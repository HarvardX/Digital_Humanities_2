horae lyricae  poems chiefly of the lyric kind in two books  i songs etc sacred to devotion  ii odes elegys etc to virtue loyalty and friendship  by i watts   si non uranie lyram coelestem cohibet nec polyhymnia humanum resugit tendere barbiton horat od   imitat  pythag aur carm london printed by s and d bridge for john lawrence at the sign of the angel in the poultrey mdccvi  preface it has been a long complaint of the virtuous and refined world that poesy whose original is divine should be enslaved to vice and profaneness that an art inspired from heaven should have so far lost the memory of its birthplace as to be engaged in the interests of hell and bring all her resistless forces of metaphor wit rhyme and number and range them under the banner of the great malicious spirit to assault the honor of god and the souls of men  the eldest song which history has brought down to our ears was a noble act of worship paid to the god of israel when his right hand became glorious in power when thy right hand o lord dashed in pieces the enemy the chariots of pharaoh and his host were cast into the red sea thou did blow with thy wind the deep covered them and they sank as lead in the mighty waters exodus    this art was maintained sacred through the following ages of the church and employed by kings and prophets by david solomon and isaiah in breathing the life of angels into the hearts of men and rearing their minds heavenward in warm and tuneful devotion  in the younger days of heathenism the muses were devoted to the same service the language in which old hesiod addresses them is this  in english pierian muses famed for heavenly lays descend and sing the god your fathers praise and the pursues the subject in ten pious lines which i could not forbear to transcribe if the aspect and sound of so much greek were not terrifying to a nice reader  but some of the later poets of the pagan world have more debased this divine gift and many of the writers of first rank in this our age of national christians have to their eternal shame surpassed the vilest of the gentiles they have exposed religion to drollery and dressed her up in the most ridiculous habit for the scorn of the ruder herd of mankind they have painted the vices like so many goddesses added the charms of wit to debauchery and heightened the temptation where nature needs the strongest restraints with sweetness of sound and delicacy of expression they have given a relish to blasphemies of the harshest kind and when they rant at their maker in sonorous numbers they fancy themselves to have acted the hero well  thus almost in vain have the throne and the pulpit cried reformation while the stage and licentious poems have waged open war with the pious design of church and state the press has spread the poison far and scattered wide the mortal infection unthinking youth have been allured to sin beyond the vicious propensities of nature plunged early into diseases and death and sunk down to damnation in multitudes how will these allies of the nether world the lewd and profane versifiers stand aghast before the great judge when the blood of many souls whom they never saw shall be laid to the charge of their writings and be dreadfully required at their hands the reverend mr collier has set this awful scene before them in just and flaming colors and if the application were not too rude and uncivil that noble stanza of my lord roscommon on psalm     might be addressed to them ye dragons whose contagious breath peoples the dark retreats of death change your dire hissings into heavenly songs and praise your maker with your forked tongues   but alas there is a deep silence among these men of all divine subjects unless in banter the wonders of creating power the mysteries of redeeming love and the mighty works of renewing grace are neglected by those whom heaven has endued with a gift proper to adorn and cultivate em an art whose sweet insinuations might have almost conveyed piety into resisting nature and melted souls of iron to the love of virtue  will the writers of this age cite the french critic on their side and say de la foy dun chretien les mysteres terribles dornemens egayez ne sont point susceptibles that the mysteries of christianity are not capable of  ornaments the davideis and the two arthurs  broke down this obstacle and experimentally futed the vain pretense  besides the christian mysteries have no need of these tinsel trappings the glories of our religion in a plain narration and a simple dress have something brighter and bolder in them something more surprising and divine than all the adventures of gods and heroes all the dazzling images of false luster that compose and garnish a heathen poem here the subjects themselves would give wonderful aids to the muse and the heavenly theme would so relieve a dull hour and a languishing genius that when the muse nods the sense would burn and sparkle upon the reader and keep him feelingly awake  with how much less toil and expense might a dryden an otway a congreve or a dennis furnish out a christian poem than a modern play there is nothing amongst all the ancient fables or later romances that have two such extremes united in them as the eternal god becoming an infant of days the possessor of the palace of heaven laid to sleep in a manger the holy jesus who knew no sin bearing the sins of men in his body on the tree agonies of sorrow loading the soul of him who was god over all blessed for ever and the sovereign of life stretching his arms on a cross bleeding and expiring the heaven and the hell in our divinity are infinitely more delightful and dreadful than the childish figments of a dog with three heads the buckets of the belides the furies with snaky hairs or all the flowery stories of elysium and if we survey the one as themes divinely true and the other as a medly of fooleries which we can never believe the advantage for touching the springs of passion will fall infinitely on the side of the christian poet our wonder and our love our pity delight and sorrow with the long train of hopes and fears must needs be under the command of an harmonious pen whose every line makes a part of the readers faith and is the very life or death of his soul  if the trifling and incredible tales that furnish out a tragedy are so armed by wit and fancy as to become sovereign of the rational powers to triumph over all the affections and manage our smiles and our tears at pleasure how wondrous a conquest might be obtained over a wild world and reduce it at least to sobriety if the same happy talent were employed in dressing the scenes of religion in their proper figures of majesty beauty and terror the affairs of this life with their reference to a life to come would shine bright in a dramatick description the anguish of inward guilt the secret stings and racks and scourges of conscience the sweet retiring hours and seraphical joys of devotion the victory of a resolved soul over a thousand temptations the inimitable love and passion of a dying god the awful glories of the last tribunal the grand decisive sentence from which there is no appeal and the consequent transports or horrors of the two eternal worlds how would such a performance call back the dying piety of the nation to life and beauty it would make religion appear like it self and confound the blasphemies of a profligate world ignorant of pious pleasures  but we have reason to fear that the tuneful men of our day have not raised their ambition to so divine a pitch i should rejoice to see more of this celestial fire kindling within them for the flashes that break out in some present and past writings betray an infernal source this the incomparable mr cowley in the latter end of his preface and the ingenious sir richard blackmore in the beginning of his have so pathetically described and lamented and i rather refer the reader to mourn with them than detain and tire him here these gentlemen in their large and labored works of poesy have given the world happy examples of what they wish and encourage in prose the one in a rich variety of thought and fancy the other in all the beauties of profuse and florid diction  if shorter sonnets were composed on sublime subjects such as the psalms of david and the holy transports interspersed in the other sacred writings or such as the moral odes of horace and the ancient lyricks i persuade my self that the christian preacher would find abundant aid from the poet in his design to diffuse virtue and allure souls to god if the heart were first inflamed from heaven and the muse were not left alone to form the devotion and pursue a cold scent but only called in as an assistant to the worship then the song would end where the inspiration ceases the whole composure would be of a piece all meridian light and meridian fervor and the same pious flame would be propagated and kept glowing in the heart of him that reads some of the shorter odes of the two poets now mentioned and a few of the reverend mr norriss essays in verse are convincing instances of the success of this proposal  it is my opinion also that the free and unconfined measures of pindar would best maintain the dignity of the theme as well as give a loose to the devout soul nor check the raptures of her faith and love though in my feeble attempts of this kind i have most unhappily fettered my thoughts in the narrow numbers of our old psalmtranslators i have contracted and crampt the sense or rendered it obscure and feeble by the too speedy and regular returns of rhyme  if my friends expect a particular account of this or any other circumstance relating to what i here publish they will be pleased to accept of this short one  the title assures them that poesy is not the business of my life and if i seized those hours of leisure wherein my soul was in a more sprightly and tuneful frame to entertain them or my self with a divine or moral song i hope i shall find an easy pardon the songs sacred to devotion were never written with a design to appear before the judges of wit but only to assist the meditations and worship of vulgar christians to whom the measures of hopkins by custom are grown familiar and natural and esteemed almost sacred by being bound up in the same volume with scripture these are but a small part of two hundred hymns of the same kind which are ready for public use if the world receive favorably what i now present the reason that sent these out first and divided them from their fellows is that in most of these there are some expressions which are not suited to the plainest capacities and differ too much from the usual methods of speech in which holy things are proposed to the general part of mankind the odes to virtue etc were formed when the frame and humor of my soul was just suited to the subject of my verse the image of my heart is painted in them and if they meet with a reader whose soul is akin to mine perhaps they may agreeably entertain him the dullness of the fancy and coarseness of expression will disappear the sameness of the humor will create a pleasure and insensibly overcome and conceal the defects of the muse the imitations of that noblest latin poet of modern ages casimire sarbiewski of poland would need no excuse did they but arise to the beauty of the original i have often taken the freedom to add ten or twenty lines or to leave out as many that i might suit my song more to my own design or because i found it impossible to present the force the fineness and the fire of his expression in our language i wish some english pen would import some of the treasures of that rich genius and bless our nation the inscriptions to particular friends are warranted and defended by the practice of the two best lyric writers horace and casimire and though the authority of the first be more venerable yet if in some instances i prefer the latter i pray the critics to forgive me and i hope my friends will excuse the freedom of the address in the poems of heroic measure i have attempted in rhyme the same variety of cadence comma and period which blank verse glories in as its peculiar elegance and ornament in the pindariques i have generally conformed my lines to the shorter size of the ancients and avoided to imitate the excessive lengths to which some modern writers have stretched their sentences and especially the concluding verse in these the ear is the truest judge nor was it made to be enslaved to any precise model of elder or later times after all i must petition my reader to lay aside the sour and sullen air of criticism and to assume the friend let him come with a design to be entertained and pleased rather than to seek his own disgust and aversion which will not be hard to find i am not so vain as to think there are no faults nor so blind as to espy none there is not one copy that entirely pleases me the best of them sinks vastly below the idea which i form of a divine or moral ode he that deals in the mysteries of heaven or of the muses should be a genius of no vulgar mould and as the name of vates belongs to both so the furniture of both is comprised in that line of horace  cui mens divinior atque os magna locuturum  but what juvenal spoke in his age abides true in ours a complete poet or a prophet is such an one  qualem nequeo monstrare and sentio tantum  perhaps neither of these characters in perfection shall ever be seen on earth till the seventh angel has sounded his awful trumpet till the victory be complete over the beast and

thy sovereign voice bids ancient night her spacious realms resign and lo ten thousand globes of light in fields of azure shine iv thy wisdom with superior sway guides this vast moving frame whilst all the ranks of being pay deep reverence to thy name v vengeance attends to obey thy frown and blessings wait thy smile a wreath of lightning arms thy crown but love adorns it still vi unnumberd wonders in thee meet and various glory shines the crossing rays too fiercely beat upon our fainting minds vii angels are lost in sweet surprise if thou unvail thy grace and humble awe runs through the skies when wrath arrays thy face viii when mercy joins with majesty to spread their beams abroad not all the fairest minds on high are shadows of a god ix thy mighty works great gabriel sings in a too feeble strain and labors upon all his strings to reach thy thoughts in vain x created powers how weak they be how short our praises fall so much akin to nothing we and thou the eternal all the transcendent glories of the deity i god is a name my soul adores the almighty three the eternal one nature and grace with all their powers confess the infinite unknown ii from thy great self thy being springs thou art thine own original made up of uncreated things and selfsufficience bears them all iii thy voice has formed the seas and spheres bid the waves roar and planets shine but nothing like thy self appears through all these spacious works of thine iv still rolling nature dies and grows from change to change the creatures run thy being no succession knows and all thy vast designs are one v a glance of thine runs through the globes rules the bright worlds and moves their frame broad sheets of light compose thy robes thy guards are formed of living flame vi thrones and dominions round thee fall and worship in submissive forms thy presence shakes this lower ball this little dwelling place of worms vii then how shall trembling mortals dare to sing thy glory or thy grace beneath thy feet we lie so far and see but shadows of thy face viii who can behold the blazing light who can approach consuming flame none but thy wisdom knows thy might none but thy word can speak thy name god appears most glorious in our salvation by christ i father how wide thy glory shines how high thy wonders rise known through the earth by thousand signs by thousand through the skies ii those mighty orbs proclaim thy power their motions speak thy skill and on the wings of every hour we read thy patience still iii part of thy name divinely stands on all thy creatures writ they show the labor of thine hands or impress of thy feet iv but when we view thy strange design to save rebellious worms where vengeance and compassion join in their divinest forms v our thoughts are lost in reverend awe we love and we adore the tallest angel never saw so much of god before vi here the whole deity is known nor dares a creature guess which of the glories brightest shone the justice or the grace vii when we transgressed the fathers laws the dying son atones oh the dear mysteries of his cross the triumph of his groans viii now the full glories of the lamb adorn the heavenly plains and the young

the lord to ages stand firm as the everlasting hills iv in vain the spanish ocean roared and rolled its billows to our shore the billows sunk beneath thy word and all the floating war they bore v come said the sons of bloody rome let us provide new arms from hell and down they dug through earths dark womb and ransacked all the burning cell vi old satan lent them fiery stores infernal coal and sulfurous flame and all that burns and all that roars outrageous fires of dreadful name vii beneath the senate and the throne engines of hellish thunder lay there the dark seeds of fire were sown to spring a bright but dismal day viii thy love beheld the black design thy love that guards thine england round strange how it quenched the fiery mine and crushed the tempest under ground the second part i assume my tongue a nobler strain sing the new wonders of the lord the foes revive their powers again again they die beneath his sword ii dark as our thoughts our minutes roll while tyranny possessed the throne and murderers of an irish soul ran threatening death through every town iii the roman priest and british prince joined their best force and blackest charms and the fierce troops of neighboring france offered the service of their arms iv it is done they cried and laughed aloud the courts of darkness rang with joy the old serpent hissed and hell grew proud while zion mourned

of might their hands had lost and men of blood forgot to fight viii brigades of angels lined the way and guarded william to his throne there ye celestial warriors stay and make his palace like your own ix thus mighty god thy praise divine from heaven and earth at once shall flow angels and men conspire and join in hallelujahs here below x all hallelujah heavenly king it is thy victorious arm we sing fly round the globe ye ecchoing joys and vaulted skies repeat the noise god incomprehensible i far in the heavens my god retires my god the point of my desires and hides his lovely face when he descends within my view he charms my reason to pursue but leaves it tired and fainting in the unequal chase ii or if i reach unusual height till near his presence brought there floods of glory check my flight cramp the bold pinions of my wit and all untune my thought plunged in a sea of light i roll where wisdom justice mercy shines infinite rays in crossing lines beat thick confusion on my sight and overwhelm my soul iii come to my aid ye fellowminds and help me reach the throne what single strength in vain designs united force has done thus worms may join and grasp the poles thus atoms fill the sea but the whole race of creaturesouls stretched to their last extent of thought plunge and are lost in thee iv great god behold my reason lies adoring yet my love would rise on pinions not her own faith shall direct her humble flight through all the trackless seas of light to thee the eternal fair the infinite unknown sickness gives a sight of heaven i often have i sat in secret sighs to feel my flesh decay then groaned aloud with frighted eyes to view this tottering clay ii but i forbid my sorrows now nor dares the flesh complain diseases bring their profit too the joy orecomes the pain iii my cheerful soul now all the day sits waiting here and sings looks through the ruins of her clay and practices her wings iv faith almost changes into sight while from afar she spies her fair inheritance in light above created skies v had but the prisonwalls been strong and firm without a flaw in darkness she had dwelt too long and less of glory saw vi but now the everlasting hills through every chink appear and something of the joy she feels while she is a prisoner here vii the shines of heaven rush sweetly in at all the gaping flaws visions of endless bliss are seen and native air she draws viii o may these walls stand tottering still the breaches never close if i must here in darkness dwell and all this glory lose ix or rather let this flesh decay the ruins wider grow till glad to see the enlarged way i stretch my pinions through the universal hallelujah or psalm     paraphrased i praise ye the lord each heavenly tongue that sits around his throne jesus the man shall lead the song the god inspire the tune ii gabriel and all the immortal quire that fill the realms above sing for the formed you of his fire and feeds you with his love iii shine to his praise ye crystal skies the floor of his abode or vail your little twinkling eyes before a brighter god iv thou rolling globe of golden light whose beams create our days join with the silver queen of night to own your borrowed rays v blush and refund the honors paid to your inferior names tell the blind world your orbs are fed by his oreflowing flames vi winds ye shall bear his name aloud through the ethereal blue for when his chariot is a cloud he makes his wheels of you vii thunder and hail and fires and storms the troops of his command appear in all your dreadful forms and speak his awful hand viii shout to the lord ye surging seas in your eternal roar let wave to wave resound his praise and shore reply to shore ix while monsters rolling on the flood in scaly silver shine speak terribly their makergod and lash the foaming brine x but gentler things shall tune his name to softer notes than these young zephyrs breathing over the stream or whispering through the trees xi wave your tall heads ye lofty pines to him that bid you grow sweet clusters bend the fruitful vines on every thankful bough xii let the shrill birds his honor raise and tune it in the sky while grovelling beasts attempt his praise with hoarser harmony xiii thus while the meaner creatures sing ye mortals take the sound echo the glories of your king through all the nations round xiv the eternal name must fly abroad from england to japan and the whole race shall bow to god that owns the name of man the love of christ on his cross and on his throne i now let my faith grow strong and rise and view my lord in all his love look back to hear his dying cries then mount and see his throne above ii see where he languishd on the cross beneath my sins he groaned and died see where he fits to plead my cause by his almighty fathers side iii if i behold his bleeding heart there love in floods of sorrow reigns he triumphs over the killing smart and buys my pleasure with his pains iv or if i climb the eternal hills where the dear conqueror sits enthroned still in his heart compassion dwells near the memorials of his wound v how shall a pardoned rebel show how much i love my dying god lord here i banish every foe i hate the sins that cost thy blood vi i hold no more commerce with hell my dearest lusts shall all depart but let thine image ever dwell stamped as a seal upon my heart death a welcome messenger i lord when we see a saint of thine lie gasping out his breath with longing eyes and looks divine smiling and pleased in death ii how we could even contend to lay our limbs upon that bed and ask thine envoy to convey our spirits in his stead iii our souls are rising on the wing to venture in his place for when grim death has lost his sting he has an angels face iv jesus then purge my crimes away it is guilt creates my fears it is guilt gives death its fierce array and all the arms it bears v oh if my threatening sins were gone and death had lost his sting i could invite the angel on and chide his lazy wing vi away these interposing days and let the lovers meet the angel has a cold embrace but kind and soft and sweet vii i would leap at once my seventy years and fly into his arms and  and all my cares  eavenly charms viii joyful i would lay this body down and leave the lifeless clay without a sigh without a groan and stretch and soar away sincere praise i almighty maker god how wondrous is thy name thy glories how diffused abroad through the creations frame ii nature in every dress her humble homage pays and takes a thousand ways to express thine undissembled praise iii in native white and red the rose and lilly stand and free from pride their beauties spread to show thy skilful hand iv the lark mounts up the sky with unambitious song and bears her makers praise on high upon her artless tongue v my soul would rise and sing to her creator too fain would my tongue adore my king and pay the worship due vi but pride that busy sin spoils all that i perform cursed pride that creeps securely in and swells a haughty worm vii thy glories i abate or praise thee with design some of thy favors i forget or would have something mine viii the very songs i frame are faithless to thy cause and steal the honors of thy name unto their own applause ix create my soul anew else all my worships vain this wretched heart will never be true until it is formed again x descend celestial fire and seize me from above melt me in flames of pure desire a sacrifice to love xi let joy and worship spend the remnant of my days and to my god my soul ascend in sweet perfumes of praise gods infinity i some seraph lend your heavenly tongue or harp of golden string that i may raise a lofty song to our eternal king ii thy names how infinite they be great everlasting one boundless thy might and majesty and unconfined thy throne iii thy glories shine of wondrous size and wondrous large thy grace immortal day breaks from thine eyes and gabriel vails his face iv thine essence is a vast abyss which angels cannot sound an ocean of infinities where all our thoughts are drowned v the mysteries of creation lie beneath enlightened minds thoughts can ascend above the sky and fly before the winds vi reason may grasp the massy hills and stretch from pole to pole but half thy name our spirit fills and overloads our soul vii in vain our haughty reason swells for nothings found in thee but boundless unconceivables and vast eternity longing for the second coming of christ i when shall thy shining face be seen when shall our eyes behold our god what lengths of distance lie between and hills of guilt a heavy load ii our months are ages of delay and slowly every minute wears fly winged time and roll away these tedious rounds of sluggish years iii ye heavenly gates loose all your chains let the eternal pillars bow dear savior cleave the starry plains and make the crystal mountains flow iv hark how thy saints unite their cries and pray and wait the general doom come thou the soul of all our joys thou the desire of nations come v put thy bright robes of triumph on and bless our eyes and bless our ears thou absent love thou dear unknown thou fairest of ten thousand fairs vi our heart strings groan with deep complaint our flesh lies panting lord for thee and every limb and every joint stretches for immortality vii our spirits shake their eager wings and burn to meet thy rolling throne we rise away from mortal things to attend thy shining chariot down viii now let our cheerful eyes survey the blazing earth and melting hills and smile to see the lightnings play and flash along before thy wheels ix o for a shout of violent joys to join the trumpets thundering sound the angel herald shakes the skies awakes the graves and tears the ground x ye slumbring saints a heavenly host stands waiting at your gaping tombs let every sacred sleeping dust leap into life for jesus comes xi jesus the god of might and love new moulds our limbs of cumbrous clay quick as seraphick flames we move active and young and fair as they xii our airy feet with unknown flight swift as the motions of desire run up the hills of heavenly light and leave the weltring world in fire the sufferings and glories of christ a song in trisyllable feet i i long for a consort of heavenly praise to jesus the god the omnipotent son my voice should awake in harmonious lays could it tell half the wonders that jesus has done ii i would sing how he left his own palace of light and robes made of glory that dressed him above yet pleased with his journey and swift was his flight for he rode on the pinions of infinite love iii far down to the place of our distant abode he came we adore him to raise us on high he came to atone the revenge of a god and he took up a life to be able to die iv all hell and its lions stood roaring around his flesh and his spirit with malice they tore while worlds of sorrow lay pressing him down as vast as the burden of sins that he bore v fast bound in the chains of imperious death the infinite captive a prisoner lay the infinite captive arose from the earth and leapt to the hills of ethereal day vi then mention no more of the wrath of a god of the lions of hell and their roarings no more we lift up our eyes to his shining abode and our loudest hosannahs his name shall adore vii we crown the triumpher with the honors he won hosannah through all the celestial groves the god and the man how he fills up his throne how he sits how he shines how he looks how he loves viii o happy ye heavens and happy ye hills where he treads with his feet and diffuseth his grace while mercy and majesty glories and smiles play gently around the sweet air of his face ix amongst a  choir of archangels and songs the mighty redeemer eternally reigns and the sound of his name from a million of tongues flies over the bright mountains and blesses the plains the day of judgment an ode attempted in english sapphick i when the fierce north wind with his airy forces rears up the baltic to a foaming fury and the red lightning with a storm of hail comes rushing amain down ii how the poor sailers stand amazed and tremble while the hoarse thunder like a bloody trumpet roars a loud onset to the gaping waters quick to devour them iii such shall the noise be and the wild disorder if things eternal may be like these earthly such the dire terror when the great archangel shakes the creation iv tears the strong pillars of the vault of heaven breaks up old marble the repose of princes see the graves open and the bones arising flames all around em v hark the shrill outcries of the guilty wretches lively bright horror and amazing anguish stare through their eyelids while the living worm lies gnawing within them vi thoughts like old vultures prey upun their heartstrings and the smart twinges when their eye beholds the lofty judge frowning and a flood of vengeance rolling before him vii hopeless immortals how they scream and shiver while devils push them to the pit wide yawning hideous and gloomy to receive them headlong down to the center viii stop here my fancy all away ye horrid doleful ideas come arise to jesus how he sits godlike and the saints around him throned and adoring ix o may i sit there when he comes triumphant dooming the nations then arise to glory while our hosannahs all along the passage shout the redeemer confession and pardon i alas my aching heart here the keen torment lies it racks my waking hours with smart and frights my slumbring eyes ii guilt will be hid no more my griefs take vent apace the crimes that blot my conscience over

with our tongues thy temple adores by repeating the praise v thy power shakes the world and makes it self known thy love like eternity has never a bound the truth of our god must stand firm as his throne when the wheels of old time shall cease to go round an essay on a few of davids psalms translated into plain verse in language more agreeable to the clearer revelations of the gospel the happy saint and cursed sinner psalm i i blessed is the man whose cautious feet shun the broad path which sinners choose who hates the house where atheists meet and dreads the words that scoffers use ii he loves to employ his morning light reading the statutes of the lord and spends the wakeful hours of night with pleasure pondring over the word iii he like a plant by gentle streams shall flourish in immortal green and heaven will shine with kindest beams on every work his hands begin iv but sinners find their counsels crossed as chaff before the tempest flies so shall their hopes be blown and lost when the last trumpet shakes the skies v in vain the rebel crowds to stand in judgment with the pious race the dreadful judge with stern command divides him to a different place vi strait is the way my saints have trod i blessed the path and drew it plain but you would choose the crooked road and it leads down to eternal pain doubts and fears suppresd psalm iii i look gracious god how numerous they whose envious power and rage conspiring my eternal death against my soul engage ii the lying tempter would persuade there is no relief in heaven and all my swelling sins appear too big to be forgiven iii but god my glory and my strength shall tread the tempter down and drown my sins beneath the blood of his dear dying son iv i cried and from his sacred hill he bowed a listening ear i called my father and my god and he dispersed my fear v he threw soft slumbers on mine eyes in sight of all my foes i woke and wondered at the grace that guarded my repose vi what though the hosts of death and hell all armed against me stood terrors no more shall shake my soul nor tremblings chill my blood vii lord i adore thy wondrous love and thy salvation sing my god has broke the serpents teeth and death has lost his sting viii salvation to the lord belongs the lord alone can save blessings attend thy people here and reach beyond the grave praise to the lord from all nations psalm c i

brought us to his sacred fold iv enter his gates with thankful songs through his wide courts your voices raise almighty god our joyful tongues shall fill thine house with sounding praise v wide as the world is thy command vast as eternity thy love firm as a rock thy truth must stand when rolling years shall cease to move brotherly love psalm cxxxiii i lo what an entertaining sight are brethren that agree brethren whose cheerful hearts unite in bands of piety ii when streams of love from christ the spring descend to every soul and sacred peace with balmy wing shades and bedews the whole iii it is like the oil on aaron shed which choice perfumes compose down softly from his reverend head it trickled to his toes iv it is pleasant as the morning dews that fall on zions hill where god his mildest

my mind vi while of his absence i complain and long and weep as lovers do there is a strange pleasure in the pain and tears have their own sweetness too vii when round his courts by day i rove or ask the watchmen of the night for some kind tidings of my love his very name creates delight viii jesus my god yet rather come mine eyes would dwell upon thy face it is best to see my lord at home and feel the presence of his grace the substance of the following copy and many of the lines as they here stand were sent me by an esteemed friend mr w nokes with a desire that i would form them into a pindarick ode but i retained his measures least i should too much alter his sense a sight of christ angels of light your god and king surround with noble songs in his exalted flesh he claims your worship while his saints on earth bless their redeemergod with humble tongues angels with lofty honors crown his head we bowing at his feet by faith may feel this distant influence and confess his love once i beheld his face when beams divine broke from his eyelids and unusual light wrapped me at once in glory and surprise my joyful heart high leaping in my breast with transport cried this is the christ of god then threw my arms around in sweet embrace and clasped and bowed adoring low till i was lost in him while he appears no other charms can hold or draw my soul ashamed of former things which no remembrance now deserve or name though with contempt best in oblivion hid but the bright shine and presence soon withdrew i sought him whom i love but found him not i felt his absence and with strongest cries proclaimed where jesus is not all is vain whether i hold him with a full delight or seek him panting with extreme desire it is he alone can please my wondering soul to hold or seek him is my only choice if he refrain on me to cast his eye down from his palace nor my longing soul with upward look can spy my dearest lord through his blue pavement i will behold him still with sweet reflection on the peaceful cross all in his blood and anguish groaning deep gasping and dying there  this sight i never can loose by it i live a quickening virtue from his death inspired is life and breath to me his flesh my food his vital blood i drink and hence my strength i live i am strong and now eternal life beats quick within my breast my vigorous mind spurns the dull earth and on her fiery wings reaches the mount of purposes divine counsels of peace betwixt the almighty three conceived at once and signed without debate in perfect union of the eternal mind with vast amaze i see the unfathomed thoughts infinite schemes and infinite designs of gods own heart in which he ever rests eternity lies open to my view here the beginning and the end of all i can discover christ the end of all and christ the great beginning he my head my god my glory and my all in all o that the day the joyful day were come when the first adam from his ancient dust crowned with new honors shall revive and see jesus his son and lord while shouting saints surround their king and gods eternal son shines in the midst but with superior beams and like himself then the mysterious word long hid behind the letter shall appear all spirit and life and in the fullest light stand forth to public view and there disclose his fathers sacred works and wondrous ways then wisdom righteousness and grace divine through all the infinite transactions past inwrought and shining shall with double blaze strike our astonished eyes and ever reign admired and glorious in triumphant light death and the tempter and the man of sin now at the bar arraigned in judgment cast shall vex the saints no more but perfect love and loudest praises perfect joy create while evercircling years maintain the blissful state

grace and takes his title love vi now let the lord for ever reign and sway us as he will sick or in health in ease or pain we are his favorites still vii no more shall peevish passion rise the tongue no more complain it is sovereign love that lends our joys and love resumes again the hazard of loving the creatures i whereere my flattering passions rove i find a lurking snare it is dangerous to let loose our love beneath the eternal fair ii souls whom the tie of friendship binds and things that share our blood seize a large portion of our minds and leave the less for god iii nature has soft but powerful bands and reason she controuls while children with their little hands hang closest to our souls iv thoughtless they act the old serpents part what tempting things they be lord how they twine about our heart and draw it off from thee v our hasty wills rush blindly on where rising passion rolls and thus we make our fetters strong to bind our slavish souls vi dear sovereign break these fetters off and set our spirits free god in himself is bliss enough for we have all in thee christs amazing love and my amazing coldness i come let me love or is my mind hardened to stone or froze to ice i see the blessed fair one bend and stoop to embrace me from the skies ii o it is a thought would melt a rock and make a heart of iron move that those sweet lips that heavenly look should seek my kisses and my love iii i was a traitor doomed to fire bound to sustain immortal pains he flew on wings of strong desire assumed my guilt and took my chains iv infinite grace almighty charms stand in amaze ye rolling skies jesus the god with naked arms hangs on a cross of love and dies v did pity ever stoop so low dressed in divinity and blood was ever rebel courted so in groans of an expiring god vi again he lives and spreads his hands hands that were nay ld to torturing smart by these dear wounds says he and stands and prays to clasp me to his heart vii sure i must love or are my ears still deaf nor feel the passion move then let me melt my heart to tears and die because i cannot love wishing him ever with me i now be that smiling moment blessed when first i saw my love jesus the fairest and the best of all the forms above a thousand graces ever rise and bloom upon his face a thousand arrows from his eyes shoot through my heart with sweet surprise and stand to guard the place ii all natures art shall never cure the heavenly pains i found and it is beyond all beauties power to make another wound earthly beauties grow and fade nature may heal the wounds she made but charms so much divine hold a long empire of the heart what heaven has joined shall never part and jesus must be mine iii in vain the envious shades of night or flatteries of the day would vail his image from my sight or tempt my soul away jesus is all my waking theme his lovely form meets every dream and knows not to depart the passion reigns through all my veins and floating round the crimson stream still finds him at my heart iv dwell there for ever dwell my love here i confine my sense nor dare my wildest wishes rove nor stir a thought from thence let me be lost in thine embrace as rivers in the sea or live eternity of days to spend them all with thee still i would lie in those dear arms dissolving still among thy charms and as the moments fly i would breathe away successive souls so billow after billow rolls to kiss the shore and dye the absence of the beloved i come lead me to some lofty shade where turtles moan their loves tall shadows were for lovers made and grief becomes the groves ii it is no mean beauty of the ground that has enslaved mine eyes i faint beneath a nobler wound nor love below the skies iii jesus the spring of all that is bright the everlasting fair heavens ornament and heavens delight is my eternal care iv but ah how far above this grove does the dear charmer dwell absence that keenest wound to love that sharpest pain i feel v pensive i climb the sacred hills and near him vent my woes yet his sweet face he still conceals yet still my passion grows vi i murmur to the hollow vale i tell the rocks my flame and bless the echo in her cell that best repeats his name vii my passion breaths perpetual sighs till pitying winds shall hear and gently bear them up the skies and gently wound his ear sick of love solom song i   i tell me thou fairest of thy kind my love my alldivine where may this fainting head reclined relieve such cares as mine ye shepherds lead me to your grove if burning noon infect the sky the sickening sheep to coverts fly the sheep not half so scorcht as i thus languishing in love ii stretched on the flowery shades along there would i tune my tender song and drop a melting tear music has wondrous charms they say music can raging heats allay and tame the wildest care begin my song the soothing strain but the dear flame is charming sweet i would not cool the passion yet nor can i bear the pain strangely i am racked in wide extremes i burn i burn i burn and yet i love the flames iii oh why should beauty heavenly bright stoop down to charm a mortals sight and torture with the sweet excess of light our hearts alas how frail their make with their own weight of joy they break oh why is love so strong and natures self so weak iv dear lord forgive my rash complaint and love me still against my froward will unvail thy beauties though i faint send the great herald from the sky and at the trumpets awful roar this feeble state of things shall fly and pain and pleasure mix no more then i shall gaze with strengthened sight on glories infinitely bright my heart shall all be love my jesus all delight sitting in an arbor i sweet muse descend and bless the shade and bless the evening grove business and noise and day are fled and every care but love ii but hence ye wanton young and fair mine is a purer flame no phillis shall infect the air with her unhallowed name iii jesus has all my powers possessed my hopes my fears my joys he the dear sovereign of my breast shall still command my voice iv some of the fairest quires above shall flock around my song with joy to hear the name they love sound from a mortal tongue v his charms shall make my numbers flow and hold the falling floods while silence sits on every bough and bends the listening woods vi i will carve our passion on the bark and every wounded tree shall drop and bear some mystic mark that jesus died for me vii the swains shall wonder when they read inscribed on all the grove that heaven it self came down and bled to win a mortals love bewailing my own inconstancy i i love the lord but ah how far my thoughts from the dear object are this wanton heart how wide it roves and fancy meets a thousand loves ii  my soul burn to see my god  tread the courts of his abode but troops of rivals throng the place and tempt me off before his face iii would i enjoy my lord alone  bid my passions all be gone all but my love and charge my will to bar the door and keep it still iv but cares or trifles make or find still new avenues to the mind till i with grief and wonder see huge crowds betwixt my lord and me v often i am told the muse will prove a friend to piety and love strait i begin some sacred song and take my savior on my tongue vi strangely i lose his lovely face to hold the empty sounds in chase at best the chymes divide my heart and the muse shares the larger part vii false confident and falser breast fickle and fond of every guest each airy image as it flies here finds admittance through my eyes viii this foolish heart can leave her god and shadows tempt her thoughts abroad how shall i fix this wandering mind or throw my fetters on the wind ix look gently down almighty grace prison me round in thine embrace pity the soul that would be thine and let thy power my love confine x say when shall that bright moment be that i shall live alone for thee my heart no foreign lords adore and the wild muse prove false no more forsaken yet hoping i happy the hours the golden days when i could call my jesus mine and sit and view his smiling face and melt in pleasures all divine ii near to my heart within my arms he lay till sin defiled my breast till broken vows and earthly charms ird and provoked my heavenly guest iii and now he is gone o mighty woe gone from my soul and hides his love curse on you sins that grieved him so ye sins that forced him to remove iv break break my heart complain my tongue hither my friends your sorrows bring angels assist my doleful song if you have ere a mourning string v but ah your joys are ever high ever his lovely face you see while my poor spirits pant and die and groan for thee my god for thee vi yet let my hope look through my tears and spy afar his rolling throne his chariot through the cleaving spheres shall bring the bright beloved down vii swift as a roe flies over the hills my soul springs out to meet him high then the dear conqueror turns his wheels and climbs the mansions of the sky viii there smiling joy for ever reigns no more the turtle leaves the dove farewell to jealousies and pains and all the ills of absent love the law and gospel i cursed be the man for ever cursed that does the smallest sin commit death and damnation for the first without relief and infinite ii thus sinai roars and round the earth thunder and fire and vengeance flings  jesus thy dear gasping breath  calvary says gentler things iii pardon and grace and boundless love streaming along a saviors blood and life and joys and crowns above dear purchased by a bleeding god iv hark how he prays the charming sound dwells on his dying lips forgive and every groan and gaping wound cries father let the rebels live v go you that rest upon the law and toil and seek salvation there look to the flames that moses saw and shrink and tremble and despair vi but i will retire beneath the cross savior at thy dear feet i lie and the keen sword that justice draws flaming and red shall pass me by the death of moses deuteronomy xxxii     0 and xxxiv     or the enjoyment of god vvorth dying for i lord it is an infinite delight to see thy lovely face to dwell whole ages in thy sight and feel thy kind embrace ii this gabriel knows and sings thy name with his immortal tongue moses the saint enjoys the same and loud repeats the song iii all the bright nation sounds thy praise from the eternal hills while the sweet odor of thy grace the heavenly region fills iv thy charming looks and shining power spread life and joy abroad o it is a heaven worth dying for to see a smiling god v show me thy face and i will away from all inferior things speak lord and here i quit my clay and stretch mine airy wings vi twas a sweet journey to the sky the wondrous prophet tried climb up the mount says god

semper amabiles nunc simul adsitis nunc vicissim et fallite taedia vitae a funeral poem on thomas gunston esquire presented to the right honorable the lady abney lady mayoress of london july   0  madam had i been a common mourner at the funeral of the dear gentleman deceased i should have labored after more of art in the following composition to supply the defect of nature and to feign a sorrow but the uncommon condescension of his friendship to me the inward esteem i pay his memory and the vast and tender sense i have of our loss make all the methods of art needless whilst natural grief supplies more than all  i had resolved indeed to lament in sighs and silence and frequently checked the forward muse when she brought me grief in numbers and urged me to a tuneful mourning but the importunity was not to be resisted long lines of sorrow flowed in upon my fancy ere i was aware whilst i took many a solitary walk in the garden adjoining to his seat at newington nor could i free my self from the melancholy ideas that crowded themselves upon me and your ladyship will find throughout the poem that the fair and unfinished building which he had just raised for himself gave almost all the turns of mourning to my thoughts for i pursue no other topics of elegy then what my passion and my senses led me to  the poem roves as my eyes and thoughts did from one part of the fabric to the other it rises from the foundation salutes the walls the doors and the windows drops a tear upon the roof and climbs the turret that dear retreat where i promised my self many sweet hours of his conversation there my song wanders amongst the delightful subjects divine and moral which used to entertain our happy leisure and thence flings her self down to the fields and the shady walks where i so often enjoyed his pleasing discourse and my sorrows diffuse themselves there without a limit i had quite forgotten what i was writing till i correct my self and rise to the turret again to lament that desolate seat and how vainly shines the golden ball that crowns it thus i have written without rule and with a negligence becoming woe unfeigned  had i designed a complete elegy on your dearest brother and intended it for public view i should have followed the usual forms of poetry spent whole pages in the character and praises of the deceased and thence took occasion to call mankind to complain aloud of the universal and unspeakable loss but i wrote merely for my self as a friend of the dead and to ease my full soul by breathing out my own complaint i knew his character and virtues so well that there was no need to mention em while i talked only with my self for the image of them was ever present with me which kept my sorrow lively and my tears flowing with my numbers  perhaps your ladyship will expect some divine thoughts and sacred meditations mingled with a subject so solemn as this is had i formed a design of offering it to your hands i had composed a more christian poem but twas grief purely natural for a death so surprising that drew all the lines of it and therefore my highest reflections are but of a moral strain such as it is your ladyship requires a copy of it but let it not touch your soul too tenderly nor renew your own mournings receive it madam as a sacrifice of love and tears offered at the tomb of a departed friend and let it abide with you as a witness of that affectionate respect and honor that i bore him all which as your ladyships most rightful due both by merit and succession is now humbly offered by  madam your ladyships most hearty and obedient servant i watts  to the dear memory of my honored friend thomas gunston esquire who died november      00 when he had just finished his seat at newington of blasted hopes and of short withering joys sing heavenly muse try thine ethereal voice in funeral numbers and a doleful song gunston the just the generous and the young gunston the friend is dead o empty name of earthly bliss it is all an airy dream all a vain thought our soaring fancies rise on treacherous wings and hopes that touch the skies drag but a longer ruin through the downward air and plunge the falling joy but deeper in despair how did our souls stand flattered and prepared to shout him welcome to the seat he reared there the dear man should see his hopes complete smiling and tasting every lawful sweet that peace and plenty brings while numerous years rolled happy circles round the joyful spheres revolving suns should still renew his strength and draw the uncommon thread to an unusual length but hasty fate thrusts her dread shears between cuts the young life off and shuts up the scene thus airy pleasure dances in our sight and spreads fair images of gay delight to allure our souls till just within our arms the vision dies and all the painted charms flee quick away from the pursuing sight till they are lost in shades and mingle with the night muse stretch thy wings and thy sad journey bend to the fair the house fabric that thy dying friend built nameless twill suggest a thousand things mournful and soft as my urania sings how did he lay the deep the foundations foundations strong marking the bounds and rear the the walls walls along solid and lasting there a numerous train of happy gunstons might in pleasure reign while nations perish and long ages run nations unborn and ages unbegun not time it self should waste the blessed estate nor the tenth race rebuild the ancient seat how fond our fancies are the founder dies childless his sisters weep and close his eyes and wait upon his hearse with neverceasing cries lofty and slow it moves unto the tomb while weighty sorrow nods on every plume a thousand groans his dear remains convey to his cold lodging in a bed of clay his countries sacred tears wellwatering all the way see the dull wheels roll on the sable load but no dear son to tread the mournful road and fondly kind drop his young sorrows there the fathers urn bedewing with a filial tear o had he left us one behind to play wanton about the painted the hall hall and say  this was my fathers with impatient joy in my fond arms i would claspt the smiling boy and called him my young friend but awful fate designed the mighty stroke as lasting as twas great and must this building then this costly frame stand here for strangers must some unknown name possess these the rooms rooms the labors of my friend why were these walls raised for this hapless end why these apartments all adorned so gay why his rich fancy lavisht thus away muse view the the paintings paintings how the hovering light plays over the colors in a wanton flight and mingled shades wrought in by soft degrees give a sweet foyl to all the charming piece but night eternal night hangs black around the dismal chambers of the hollow ground and solid shades unmingled round his bed stand hideous earthy fogs embrace his head and noysom vapors glide along his face rising perpetual muse forsake the place flee the raw damps of the unwholesome clay look to his airy spacious hall and say how has he changed it for a loathsome cave confined and crowded in a narrow grave the unhappy house looks desolate and mourns and every the doors door groans doleful as it turns the pillars languish and each lofty wall stately in grief laments the masters fall in drops of briny dew the fabric bears his faint resemblance and renews my tears solid and square it rises from below a noble air without a gaudy show reigns through the model and adorns the whole manly and plain just like the builders soul o how i love to view the stately frame that dear memorial of the bestlovd name then could i wish for some prodigious cave vast as his seat and silent as his grave where the tall shades stretch to the hideous roof forbid the day and guard the sunbeams off thither my willing feet should ye be drawn at the gray twilight and the early dawn there sweetly sad should my soft minutes roll numbering the sorrows of my drooping soul but these are airy thoughts substantial grief grows by those objects that should yield relief fond of my woes i heave my eyes around my grief from every prospect courts a wound views the green gardens views the smiling skies still my heart sinks and still my cares arise my wandering feet round the dear mansion rove and there to sooth my sorrows i indulge my love often have i laid the awful calvin by and the sweet cowley with impatient eye to see those walls pay the sad visit there and drop the tribute of an hourly tear still i behold some melancholy scene with many a pensive thought and many a sigh between two days ago we took the evening air i and my grief and my urania there say my urania how the western sun broke from black clouds and in full glory shone gilding the roof then dropped into the sea and sudden night devoured the sweet remains of day thus the dear youth just reared his shining head from obscure shades of life and sunk among  dead the rising sun adorned with all his light smiles on these walls again but endless night reigns uncontrolled where the dear gunston lies he is set for ever and must never rise then why these beams unseasonable star these lightsome smiles descending from afar to greet a mourning house in vain the day breaks through the the windows windows with a joyful ray and marks a shining path along the floors bounding the evening and the morning hours in vain it bounds em while vast emptiness and hollow silence reigns through all the place nor heeds the cheerful change of natures face yet natures wheels will on without control the sun will rise the tuneful spheres will roll and the two nightly bears walk round and watch the pole see while i speak high on her sable wheel old night comes rolling up the eastern hill troops of dark clouds prepare her way behold how their brown pinions edged with evening gold spread shaddowing over the house and glide away slowly pursuing the declining day over the broad the roof roof they fly their circuit still thus days before they did and days to come they will but the black cloud that shaddows over his eyes hangs there immovable and never flies fain would i bid the envious gloom be gone ah fruitless wish how are his curtains drawn for a long evening that despairs the dawn muse view the the turret turret just beneath the skies lonesome it stands and fixes both mine eyes as it would ask a tear o sacred seat sacred to friendship o divine retreat here did i hope my happy hours to employ and fed beforehand on the promised joy when weary of the noisy town my friend from mortal cares retiring should ascend and lead me thither we our conversation there alone would sit free and secure of all intruding feet our thoughts should stretch their longest wings and rise nor bound their soarings by the lower skies our tongues should aim at everlasting themes and speak what mortals dare of all the names of boundless joys and glories thrones and seats built high in heaven for souls wed trace the streets of golden pavement walk each happy field and climb and taste the fruits the spicy mountains yield then would we swear to keep the sacred road and walk right upwards to the blessed abode wed charge our parting spirits there to meet there hand in hand approach the almightys seat and bend our heads adoring at our makers feet thus should we mount on bold adventrous wings in high discourse and dwell on heavenly things while the pleased hours in sweet succession move and minutes measured as they are above by evercircling joys and evershining love anon our thoughts should lower their lofty flight sink by degrees and take a pleasing sight a large round prospect of the spreading plain the wealthy river and his winding train the smoaky city and the busy men how we should smile to see degenerate worms lavish their lives and fight for airy forms of painted honor dreams of empty sound till envy rise and shoot a secret wound at swelling glory strait the bubble breaks and the scenes vanish as the man awakes then the tall titles insolent and proud sink to the dust and mingle with the crowd man is a restless thing still vain and wild lives beyond sixty nor outgrows the child his hurrying lusts still break the sacred bound to seek new pleasures on forbidden ground and buy them all too dear unthinking fool for a short dying joy to sell a deathless soul it is but a grain of sweetness they can sow and reap the long sad harvest of immortal woe another tribe toil in a different strife and banish all the lawful sweets of life to sweat and dig for gold to hoard the oar hide the dear dust yet darker than before and never dare to use a grain of all the store happy the man that knows the value just of earthly things nor is enslaved to dust it is a rich gift the skies but rarely send to favorite souls then happy thou my friend for thou had learnt to manage and command the wealth that heaven bestowed with liberal hand hence this fair structure rose and hence this seat made to invite my not unwilling feet in vain twas made for we shall never meet and smile and love and bless each other here the envious tomb forbids thy face to appear detains thee gvnston from my longing eyes and all my hopes lie buried where my gvnston lies come hither all ye tenderest souls that know the heights of fondness and the depths of woe young mothers who your darling babes have found untimely murdred with a ghastly wound ye frighted nymphs who on the bridal bed claspt in your arms your lovers cold and dead come in the pomp of all your wild despair with flowing eyelids and disordered hair death in your looks come mingle grief with me and drown your little streams in my unbounded sea you sacred mourners of a nobler mould born for a friend whose dear embraces hold beyond all natures ties you that have known two happy souls made intimately one and felt a parting stroke it is you must tell the smart the twinges and the racks i feel this soul of mine that dreadsul wound has born off from its side its dearest half is torn the rest lies bleeding and but lives to mourn oh infinite distress such raging grief should command pity and despair relief passion methinks should rise from all my groans give sense to rocks and sympathy to stones ye dusky the adjacent country woods and ecchoing hills around repeat my cries with a perpetual sound be all ye flowery vales with thorns oregrown assist my sorrows and declare your own alas your lord is dead the humble plain must never receive his courteous feet again mourn ye gay smiling meadows and be seen in wintry robes instead of youthful green and bid the the brook brook that still runs warbling by move silent on and weep his useless channel dry hither methinks the lowing herds should come and moaning turtles murmur over his tomb the oak should wither and the curling the trees vine weep his young life out while his arms untwine their amorous folds and mix his bleeding soul with mine ye stately elms in your long order mourn strip off your pride to dress your masters urn here gently drop your leaves instead of tears ye elms the reverend growth of ancient years stand tall and naked to the blustering rage of the mad winds thus it becomes your age to show your sorrows often ye have seen our heads reclined upon the rising green beneath your sacred shade diffused we lay here friendship reigned with an unbounded sway hither our souls their constant offerings brought the burdens of the breast and labors of the thought our opening bosoms on the conscious ground spread all the sorrows all the joys we found and mingled every care nor was it known which of the pains or pleasures were our own then with an equal hand and honest soul we share the heap yet both possess the whole and all the passions there through both our bosoms roll by turns we comfort and by turns complain and bear and ease by turns the sympathy of pain friendship mysterious thing what magic powers support thy sway and charm these minds of ours bound to thy foot we boast our birthright still and dream of freedom when we have lost our will and changed away our souls at thy command we snatch new miseries from a foreign hand to call them ours and thoughtless of our ease plague the dear self that we were born to please thou tyranness of minds whose cruel throne heaps on poor mortals sorrows not their own as though our mother nature could no more find woes sufficient for each son she bore friendship divides the shares and lengthens out the store yet are we fond of thine imperious reign proud of the slavery wanton in our pain and chide the courteous hand when death dissolves the chain virtue forgive the thought the raving muse wild and despairing knows not what she does grows mad in grief and in her savage hours affronts the name she loves and she adores she is thy votaress too and at thy shrine o sacred friendship offered songs divine while gunston lived and both our souls were thine here to these shades at solemn hours we came to pay devotion with a mutual flame and rolled in pleasures while the evening breeze fanned the leaves gently sporting through the trees and the declining sun with sloping wheels rolled down the golden day behind the western hills mourn ye young the gardens gardens ye unfinisht gates ye green enclosures and ye growing sweets lament for ye our midnight hours have known and watched us walking by the silent moon in conference divine while heavenly fire kindling our breasts did all our thoughts inspire with joys almost immortal then our zeal blazed and burnt high to reach the ethereal hill and love refined like that above the poles threw both our arms round one another souls in rapture and embraces oh forbear forbear my song this is too much to hear too dreadful to repeat such joys as these fled from the earth for ever oh for a general grief let all things share our woes that knew our loves the neighboring the air air let it be laden with immortal sighs and tell the gales that every breath that flies over these fields should murmur and complain and kiss the fading grass and propagate the pain weep all ye buildings and ye the groves groves around for ever weep this is an endless wound vast and incurable ye buildings knew his silver tongue ye groves have heard it too at that dear sound no more shall ye rejoice and i no more must hear the charming voice woe to my drooping soul that heavenly breath that could speak life lies now congealed in death while on his folded lips all cold and pale eternal chains and heavy silence dwell yet my fond hope would hear him speak again once more at least one gentle word and then gunston aloud i call in vain i cry gunston aloud for he must never reply in vain i mourn and drop these funeral tears death and the grave have neither eyes nor ears wandering i tune my sorrows to the groves and vent my swelling griefs and tell the winds our loves while the dear youth sleeps fast and hears em not he has forgot me in the lonesome vault mindless of watts and friendship there he lies deaf and unthinking clay but whither am i led this artless grief hurries the muse on obstinate and deaf to all the nicer rules and bears her down from the tall fabric to the neighboring ground the pleasing hours and the dear moments past in these sweet fields reviving on my taste snatch me away resistless with impetuous have spread thy strong pinions once again my song and reach the the turret turret thou have left so long over the wide roof its lofty head it rears waiting for our converse but only hears the noisie tumults of the realms on high the winds salute it whistling as they fly or jarring round the windows rattling showers lash the fair sides above loud thunder roars but still the master sleeps nor hears the voice of sacred friendship nor the tempests noise an iron slumber sits on every sense in vain the heavenly thunders strice to rouse it thence one labor more my muse the golden the golden ball sphere seems to demand see through the dusky air downward it shines upon the rising moon and as she labors up to reach her noon the ball pursues her orb with streaming light and shoots a golden day on the pale queen of night but not one beam can reach the darksome grave or pierce the solid gloom that fills the cave where gunston dwells in death my waking eyes saw the last midnight reigning over the skies and old boots drove his shining carr through the midheaven behold the glittering sphere bright as a burning meteor born on high or some new comet glaing through the sky it flamed and mingled with the larger stars in vain said i the golden comet glares in vain it stands while with a dismal fall he sunk beneath the ground that raised the lofty ball now let me call the joyful day to mind twas a fair morning and the blustering wind slept in its peaceful caverns while he came gazing and pleased to see the noble frame crowned with that shining orb stand there he cries thou little emblem of the boundless skies whither my soul with fiery passion tends the emblem stands and tells surviving friends of the bright palace and the golden throne where the dear gunstons better part is gone his eager thoughts bent on their shining way let the clay drop to mingle with the clay but his great soul beyond the stars is fled then why my heart why should we mourn him dead strangely my thoughts ye let this cozening grief with a false name impose on your belief it saw the flesh sink down with closing eyes to the cold earth and cried it is gunston dies mistaken grief to call the flesh the friend the heavenly court saw the bright youth ascend flew to embrace him with immortal love and sung his welcome to the seats above the building firm and all the mansions bright the roof highvaulted with ethereal light beauty and strength on the tall bulwarks sat in heavenly diamond and for every gate on golden hinges a broad ruby turns guards off the foe and as it moves it burns millions of glories reign through every part infinite power and uncreated art stand here displayed and to the stranger show how it outshines the noblest seats below the stranger just looked down and smiled upon em too come my urania leave the doleful strain let heavenly notes resume their joys again in everlasting numbers sing and say  gunston the friend lives still and wipe our tears away an elegy on the reverend mr tho gouge to mr arthur shallett merchant worthy sir the subject of the following elegy was high in your esteem and enjoyed a large share of your affections scarce does his memory need the assistance of the muse to make it perpetual but when she can at once pay her honors to the venerable dead and by this address acknowledge the favors she has received from the living it is a double pleasure to  sir your obliged humble servant  to the memory of the reverend mr tho gouge who died january         00 i ye virgin souls whose sweet complaint could teach psalm cxxxvii euphrates not to flow could lam       sions ruin so divinely paint arrayed in beauty and in woe awake ye virgin souls to mourn and with your tuneful sorrows dress a prophets urn o could my lips or flowing eyes but imitate such charming grief i would teach the seas and teach the skies wailings and sobs and sympathies nor should the stones or rocks be deaf rocks shall have eyes and stones have ears while gouges death is mourned in melody and tears ii heaven was impatient of our crimes and sent his minister of death to scourge the bold rebellion of the times and to demand our prophets breath he came commissioned for the fates of awful mead and charming bates there he essayed the vengeance first then took a dismal aim and brought great gouge to dust iii great gouge to dust how doleful is the sound how vast the stroke is and how wide the wound yes it is a vast uncommon death yes it is a wound unmeasurably wide no vulgar mortal died when he resigned his breath the muse that mourns a nations fall should wait at govges funeral should mingle majesty and groans such as she sings to sinking thrones and in deepsounding numbers tell how sion trembled when this pillar fell sion grows weak and england poor nature her self with all her store can furnish such a pomp for death no more iv the reverend man let all things mourn sure he was some ethereal mind fated in flesh to be confined and ordered to be born his soul was of the angelick frame the same ingredients and the mould the same when the creator makes a minister of flame he was all formed of heavenly things mortals believe what my urania sings for she has seen him rise upon his flamy wings v how would he mount how would he fly up through the ocean of the sky towered the celestial coast with what amazing swiftness soar till earths dark ball was seen no more and all its mountains lost scarce could the muse pursue him with her sight but angels you can tell for often you met his wondrous flight and knew the stranger well say how he past the radiant spheres and visited your happy seats and traced the well known turnings of the golden streets and walked among the stars vi tell how he climbed the everlasting hills surveying all the realms above born on a strongwingd faith and on the fiery wheels of an immortal love twas there he took a glorious sight of the inheritance of saints in light and read their title in their saviors right how often the humble scholar came and to your songs he raised his ears to learn the unutterable name to view the eternal base that bears the new creations frame the countenance of god he saw full of mercy full of awe the glories of his power and glories of his grace there he beheld the wondrous springs of those eternal sacred things the peaceful gospel and the fiery law in that majestic face that face that all his gazing powers employ with most profound abasement and exalted joy the rolls of fate were half unsealed he stood adoring by the volumes opened to his eye and sweet intelligence he held with all his shining kindred of the sky vii ye seraphs that surround the throne tell how his name was through the palace known how warm his zeal was and how like your own speak it aloud let half the nation hear and bold blasphemers shrink and fear impudent tongues to blast a prophets name the poison sure was fetched from hell where the old blasphemers dwell to taint the purest dust and blot the whitest fame impudent tongues you should be darted through nailed to your own black mouths and lie useless and dead till slander die till slander die with you viii we saw him say the ethereal throng we saw his warm devotions rise we heard the fervor of his cries and mixed his praises with our song we knew the secret flights of his retiring hours nightly he waked his inward powers young israel rose to wrestle with his god and with unconquered force scaled the celestial towers to reach the blessing down for those that sought his blood often we beheld the thunderers hand raised high to crush the factious foe as often we saw the rolling vengeance stand doubtful to obey the dread command while his ascending prayer witheld the falling blow ix draw the past scenes of thy delight my muse and bring the wondrous man to sight place him surrounded as he stood with pious crowds while from his tongue a stream of harmony ran soft along and every ear drank in the flowing good softly it ran its silver way till warm devotion raised the current strong then fervid zeal on the sweet deluge rode life love and glory grace and joy divinely rolled promiscuous on the torrentflood and bore our raptured sense away and thoughts and souls to god o might we dwell for ever there no more return to breath this grosser air this atmosphere of sin calamity and care x but heavenly scenes soon leave the sight while we belong to clay passions of terror and delight demand alternate sway behold the man whose awful voice could well proclaim the fiery law kindle the flames that moses saw and swell the trumpets warlike noise he stands the herald of the threatening skies lo on his reverend brow the frowns divinely rise all sinais thunder on his tongue and lightning in his eyes round the high roof the curses flew distinguishing each guilty head far from the unequal war the atheist fled his kindled arrows still pursue his arrows strike the atheist through and fix him down to dread the marble heart groans with an inward wound blaspheming souls of hardened steel shriek out amazed at the new pangs they feel and dread the ecchos of the sound the lofty wretch armed and arrayed in gaudy pride sinks down his impious head plunges in dark despair and mingles with the dead xi now muse assume a softer strain now sooth the sinners raging smart borrow of govge the wondrous art to calm the surging conscience and assuage the pain he from a bleeding god derives life for the souls that guilt had slain and strait the dying rebel lives the dead arise again the opening skies almost obey his powerful song a heavenly ray awakes despair to light and sheds a cheerful day his wondrous voice rolls back the spheres recalls the scenes of ancient years to make the savior known sweetly the flying charmer roves through all his labors and his loves the anguish of his cross and triumphs of his throne xii hark he invites our feet to try the steep ascent of calvary and sets the fatal tree before our eye see here celestial sorrow reigns rude nails and ragged thorns lay by tinged with the crimson of redeeming veins in wondrous words he sung the vital flood where all our sins were drowned words fit to heal and fit to wound sharp as the spear and balmy as the blood in his discourse divine afresh the purple fountain flowed our falling tears kept sympathetick time and trickled to the ground while every accent gave a doleful sound sad as the breaking heart strings of the expiring god xiii down to the mansions of the dead with trembling joy our souls are lead the captives of his tongue there the dear prince of light reclines his head darkness and shades among with pleasing horror we survey the caverns of the tomb where the beloved redeemer lay and shed a sweet persume hark the old earthquake roars again in gouges voice and breaks the chain of heavy death and tears the tombs the rising god he comes he comes with throngs of waking saints a long triumphing train xiv see the bright squadrons of the sky downward on wings of joy and have they fly meet their returning sovereign and attend him high a shining carr the conqueror fills formed of a golden cloud slowly the pomp rolls up the azure hills old satan foams and yells aloud and gnaws the eternal brass that binds him to the wheels the opening gates of bliss receive their king the fathergod smiles on his son pays him the honors he has won the lofty thrones adore and little cherubs sing behold him on his native throne glory sits fast upon his head dresst in new light and beamy robes his hand rolls on the seasons and the shining globes and sways the living worlds and regions of the dead xv gouge was his envoy to this realm below vast was the trust and great his skill bright the credentials he could show and thousands owned the seal his hallowed lips could well impart the grace the promise and command he knew the pity of emmanuels heart and terrors of jehovahs hand how did our souls start out to hear the embassies of love he bore while every ear in rapture hung upon the charming wonders of his tongue lifes busy cares a sacred silence bound attention stood with all her powers with fixed eyes and awe profound chained to the pleasure of the sound nor knew the flying hours xvi but oh my everlasting grief heaven has recalled his envoy from our eyes hence deluges of sorrow rise nor hope the impossible relief ye remnants of the sacred tribe who feel the loss come share the smart and mix your groans with mine where is the tongue that can describe infinite things with equal art or language so divine our passions want the heavenly flame almighty love breaths faintly in our songs and awful threatenings languish on our tongues how is a great but single name amidst the crowd he stands alone stands yet but with his starry pinions on dresst for the flight and ready to be gone eternal god command his stay stretch the dear months of his delay o we could wish his age were one immortal day but when the flaming chariots come and shining guards to attend thy prophet home amidst a thousand weeping eyes send an elisha down a soul of equal size or burn the worthless globe and take us to the skies an epitaph on king william iii of glorious memory who died march  th   0  i beneath these honors of a tomb greatness in humble ruin lies how earth confines in narrow room what heroes leave below the skies ii preserve oh venerable pile inviolate thy sacred trust to thy cold arms the british isle weeping commits her richest dust iii ye gentlest ministers of fate attend the monarch as he lies and bid the softest slumbers wait with silken cords to bind his eyes iv rest his dear sword beneath his head round him his faithful arms shall stand fix his bright ensigns on his bed the guards and honors of our land v ye sister arts of paint and verse place albion fainting by his side her groans arising ore the hearse and belgia sinking when he died vi high over the grave religion set in solemn gold pronounce the ground sacred to bar unhallowed feet and plant her guardian virtues round vii fair liberty in sables dressed write his loved name upon his urn william the scourge of tyrants past and awe of princes yet unborn viii sweet peace his sacred relics keep with olives blooming round her head and stretch her wings across the deep to bless the nations with the shade ix stand on the pile immortal fame broad stars adorn thy brightest robe thy thousand voices sound his name in silver accents round the globe x flattery shall faint beneath the sound while hoary truth inspires the song envy grow pale and bite the ground and malice gnaw her forky tongue xi night and the grave remove your gloom darkness becomes the vulgar dead but glory bids the royal tomb
