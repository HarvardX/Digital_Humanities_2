mineral roofs distill and pointed crystals break the sparkling rill unpolished gems no ray on pride bestow and latent metals innocently glow approach great nature studiously behold and eye the mine without a wish for gold approach but aweful lo the egerian grott where noblypensive st john sat and thought where british sighs from dying wyndham stole and the bright flame was shot through marchmonts soul let such such only tread this sacred floor who dare to love their country and be poor hymn on solitude by the late james thomson esquire author of the seasons hail everpleasing solitude companion of the wise and good but from whose holy piercing eye the herd of fools and villains fly oh how i love with thee to walk and listen to thy whispered talk which innocence and truth imparts and melts the most obdurate hearts a thousand shapes you wear with ease and still in every shape you please now rapt in some mysterious dream a lone philosopher you seem now quick from hill to vale you fly and now you sweep the vaulted sky and nature triumphs in your eye then strait again you court the shade and pining hang the pensive head a shepherd next you haunt the plain and warble forth your oaten strain a lover now with all the grace of that sweet passion in your face then softdivided you assume the gentlelooking h  ds bloom as with her philomela she her philomela fond of thee amid the long withdrawing vale awakes the rivaled nightingale a thousand shapes you wear with ease and still in every shape you please thine is the unbounded breath of morn just as the dewbent rose is born and while meridian fervors beat thine is the woodlands dumb retreat but chief when evening scenes decay and the faint landscape swims away thine is the doubtful dear decline and that best hour of musing thine descending angels bless thy train the virtues of the sage and swain plain innocence in white arrayed and contemplation rears the head religion with her aweful brow and rapt urania waits on you oh let me pierce thy secret cell and in thy deep recesses dwell for ever with thy raptures fired for ever from the world retired nor by a mortal seen save he a lycidas or lycon be an ode on aeoluss harp aeoluss harp is a musical instrument which plays wit the wind invented by mr oswald its properties are fully described in the castle of indolence  by the same i aetherial race inhabitants of air who hymn your god amid the secret grove ye unseen beings to my harp repair and raise majestic strains or melt in love ii those tender notes how kindly they upbraid with what soft woe they thrill the lovers heart sure from the hand of some unhappy maid who died of love these sweet complainings part iii but hark that strain was of a graver tone on the deep strings his hand some hermit throws or he the sacred bard jeremiah who sat alone in the drear waste and wept his peoples woes iv such was the song which zions children sung when by euphrates stream they made their plaint and to such sadly solemn notes are strung angelic harps to sooth a dying saint v methinks i hear the full celestial choir through heavens high dome their aweful anthem raise now chanting clear and now they all conspire to swell the lofty hymn from praise to praise vi let me ye wandering spirits of the wind who as wild fancy prompts you touch the string smit with your theme be in your chorus joined for till you cease my muse forgets to sing on the report of a wooden bridge to be built at westminster by the same by rufus hall where thames polluted flows provoked the genius of the river rose and thus exclaimed  have i ye british swains have i for ages lavd your fertile plains given herds and flocks and villages increase and fed a richer than the golden fleece have i ye merchants with each swelling tide poured africs treasure in and indias pride lent you the fruit of every nations toil made every climate yours and every soil yet pilferd from the poor by gaming base yet must a wooden bridge my waves disgrace tell not to foreign streams the shameful tale and be it published in no gallic vale he said  and plunging to his crystal dome white over his head the circling waters foam the choice of hercules a poem i now had the son of jove mature attained the joyful prime when youth elate and gay steps into life and follows unrestrained where passion leads or prudence points the way in the pure mind at those ambiguous years or vice rank weed first strikes her poisonous root or happily virtues opening bud appears by just degrees fair bloom of fairest fruit for if on youths untainted thought impressed the generous purpose still shall warm the manly breast ii as on a day reflecting on his age for highest deeds now ripe alcides sought retirement nurse of contemplation sage step following step and thought succeeding thought musing with steady pace the youth pursued his walk and lost in meditation strayed far in a lonely vale with solitude conversing while intent his mind surveyed the dubious path of life before him lay here virtues rough ascent there pleasures flowery way iii much did the view divide his wavering mind now glowed his breast with generous thirst of fame now love of ease to softer thoughts inclined his yielding soul and quenched the rising flame when lo far off two female forms he spies direct to him their steps they seem to bear both large and tall exceeding human size both far exceeding human beauty fair graceful yet each with different grace they move this striking sacred awe that softer winning love iv the first in native dignity surpassed artless and unadorned she pleased the more health over her looks a genuine luster cast a vest more white than newfalln snow she wore august she trod yet modest was her air serene her eye yet darting heavenly fire still she drew near and nearer still more fair more mild appeared yet such as might inspire pleasure corrected with an aweful fear majestically sweet and amiably severe v the other dame seemed even of fairer hue but bold her mien unguarded roved her eye and her flushed cheeks confessed at nearer view the borrowed blushes of an artful dye all soft and delicate with airy swim lightly she danced along her robe betrayed through the clear texture every tender limb heightning the charms it only seemed to shade and as it flowed adown so loose and thin her stature showed more tall more snowywhite her skin vi often with a smile she viewed herself askance even on her shade a conscious look she threw then all around her cast a careless glance to mark what gazing eyes her beauty drew as they came near before that other maid approaching decent eagerly she pressed with hasty step nor of repulse afraid with freedom bland the wondering youth addressed with winning fondness on his neck she hung sweet as the honeydew flowed her enchanting tongue vii dear hercules whence this unkind delay dear youth what doubts can thus distract thy mind securely follow where i lead the way and range through wilds of pleasure unconfined with me retire from noise and pain and care embathd in bliss and rapt in endless ease rough is the road to fame through blood and war smooth is my way and all my paths are peace with me retire from toils and perils free leave honor to the wretch pleasures were made for thee viii then will i grant thee all thy souls desire all that may charm thine ear and please thy sight all

sweets around the fragrant bower cool fountain shady grove fresh flowers to strew thy couch and crown thy head joy shall attend thy steps and ease shall smooth thy bed ix these will i freely constantly supply pleasures not earned with toil nor mixed with woe far from thy rest repining want shall fly nor labor bathe in sweat thy careful brow mature the copious harvest shall be thine let the laborious hind subdue the soil leave the rash soldier spoils of war to win won by the soldier thou shall share the spoil these softer cares my blessed allies employ new pleasures to invent to wish and to enjoy x her winning voice the youth attentive caught he gazed impatient on the smiling maid still gazed and listened then her name besought my name fair youth is happiness she said well can my friends this envied truth maintain they share my bliss they best can speak my praise though slander call me sloth  detraction vain heed not what slander vain detractor says slander still prompt true merit to defame to blot the brightest worth and blast the fairest name xi by this arrived the fair majestic maid she all the while with the same modest pace composed advanced know hercules she said with manly tone thy birth of heavenly race thy tender age that loved instructions voice promised thee generous patient brave and wise when manhood should confirm thy glorious choice now expectation waits to see thee rise rise youth exalt thyself and me approve thy high descent from heaven and dare be worthy jove xii but what truth prompts my tongue shall not disguise the steep ascent must be with toil subdued watching and cares must win the lofty prize proposed by heaven true bliss and real good honor rewards the brave and bold alone she spurns the timorous indolent and base danger and toil stand stern before her throne and guard so jove commands the sacred place who seeks her must the mighty cost sustain and pay the price of fame labor and care and pain xiii would thou engage the gods peculiar care o hercules the immortal powers adore with a pure heart with sacrifice and prayer attend their altars and their aid implore or would thou gain thy countrys loud applause loved as her father as her god adored be thou the bold assertor of her cause her voice in council in the fight her sword in peace in war pursue thy countrys good for her bare thy bold breast and pour thy generous blood xiv would thou to quell the proud and lift the oppressed in arts of war and matchless strength excel first conquer thou thyself to ease to rest to each soft thought of pleasure bid farewell the night alternate due to sweet repose in watches waste in painful march the day congealed amidst the rigorous winters snows scorched by the summers thirstinflaming ray thy hardened limbs shall boast superior might vigor shall brace thine arm resistless in the fight xv hearst thou what monsters then thou must engage what dangers gentle youth she bids thee prove abrupt says sloth ill fit thy tender age tumult and wars fit age for joy and love turn gentle youth to me to love and joy to these i lead no monsters here shall stay thine easy course no cares thy peace annoy i lead to bliss a nearer smoother way short is my way fair easy smooth and plain turn gentle youth with me eternal pleasures reign xvi what pleasures vain mistaken wretch are thine virtue with scorn replied who sleepst in ease insensate whose soft limbs the toil decline that seasons bliss and makes enjoyment please draining the copious bowl ere thirst require feasting ere hunger to the feast invite whose tasteless joys anticipate desire whom luxury supplies with appetite yet nature loathes and you employ in vain variety and art to conquer her disdain xvii the sparkling nectar cooled with summer snows the dainty board with choicest viands spread to thee are tasteless all sincere repose flies from thy flowery couch and downy bed for thou art only tired with indolence nor is thy sleep with toil and labor bought the imperfect sleep that lulls thy languid sense in dull oblivious interval of thought that kindly steals the inactive hours away from the long lingering space that lengthens out the day xviii from bounteous natures unexhausted stores flows the pure fountain of sincere delights averse to her you waste the joyless hours sleep drowns thy days and riot rules thy nights immortal though thou art indignant jove hurled thee from heaven the immortals blissful place for ever banished from the realms above to dwell on earth with mans degenerate race fitter abode on earth alike disgraced rejected by the wise and by the fool embraced xix fond wretch that vainly weenest all delight to gratify the sense reserved for thee yet the most pleasing object to the sight thine own fair action never did thou see though lulled with softest sounds thou lie along soft music warbling voices melting lays never did thou hear more sweet than sweetest song charming the soul thou never did hear thy praise no  to thy revels let the fool repair to such go smooth thy speech and spread thy tempting snare xx vast happiness enjoy thy gay allies a youth of follies and old age of cares young yet enervate old yet never wise vice wastes their vigor and their mind impairs vain idle delicate in thoughtless ease reserving woes for age their prime they spend all wretched hopeless in the evil days with sorrow to the verge of life they tend grieved with the present of the past ashamed they live and are despised they die nor more are named xxi but with the gods and godlike men i dwell me his supreme delight the almighty sire regards wellpleased whatever works excel all or divine or human i inspire counsel with strength and industry with art in union meet conjoined with me reside my dictates arm instruct and mend the heart the surest policy the wisest guide with me true friendship dwells she deigns to bind those generous souls alone whom i before have joined xxii nor need my friends the various costly feast hunger to them the effects of art supplies labor prepares their weary limbs to rest sweet is their sleep light cheerful strong they rise through health through joy through pleasure and renown they tread my paths and by a soft descent at length to age all gently sinking down look back with transport on a life wellspent in which no hour flew unimprovd away in which some generous deed distinguished every day xxiii and when the destined term at length complete their ashes rest in peace eternal fame sounds wide their praise triumphant over fate in sacred song for ever lives their name this hercules is happiness obey my voice and live let thy celestial birth lift and enlarge thy thoughts behold the way that leads to fame and raises thee from earth immortal lo i guide thy steps arise pursue the glorious path and claim thy native skies xxiv her words breathe fire celestial and impart newvigour to his soul that sudden caught the generous flame with great intent his heart swells full and labors with exalted thought the mist of error from his eyes dispelled through all her fraudful arts in clearest light sloth in her native form he now beheld unveiled she stood confessed before his sight false siren  all her vaunted charms that shone so fresh erewhile and fair now withered pale and gone xxv no more the rosy bloom in sweet disguise masks her dissembled looks each borrowed grace leaves her wan cheek pale sickness clouds her eyes livid and sunk and passions dim her face as when fair iris has awhile displayed her watery arch with gaudy painture gay while yet we gaze the glorious colors fade and from our wonder gently steal away where shone the beauteous phantom erst so bright now lowers the lowhung cloud all gloomy to the sight xxvi but virtue more engaging all the while disclosed new charms more lovely more serene beaming sweet influence a milder smile softened the terrors of her lofty mien lead goddess i am thine transported cried alcides o propitious power thy way teach me possess my soul be thou my guide from thee o never never let me stray while ardent thus the youth his vows addressed with all the goddess filled already glowed his breast xxvii the heavenly maid with strength divine endud his daring soul there all her powers combined firm constancy undaunted fortitude enduring patience armed his mighty mind unmoved in toils in dangers undismayed by many a hardy deed and bold emprize from fiercest monsters through her powerful aid he freed the earth through her he gained the skies twas virtue placed him in the blessed abode

before the offended god if happily yet thou may avert his ire and stay his arm outstretchd to lance the avenging fire ii did not high god of old ordain when to thy grasp he gave the scepter of the main that empire in this favored land fixed on religions solid base should stand when from thy struggling neck he broke the inglorious galling papal yoke humbled the pride of haughty spain and freed thee by a womanheros hand he then confirmed the strong degree briton be virtuous and be free be truth be sanctity thy guide be humble fear thy god and fear thou none beside iii often has the offended power his rising anger shown led on by his avenging hand rebellion triumphs in the land twice have her barbarous sons our wartraind hosts overthrown they fell a cheap inglorious prey the ambitious victors boast was half suppressed while heavnbred fear and wild dismay unmanned the warriors heart and reigned in every breast iv her arms to foreign lands britannia bore her arms auspicious now no more with frequent conquests where the fires were crowned the sons illfated fell and bit the hostile ground the tame wartrading belgian fled while in his cause the briton bled the gaul stood wondering at his own success often did his hardiest bands their wonted fears confess struck with dismay and meditating flight while the brave foe still urged the unequal fight while william with his fathers ardour fired through all the undaunted host the generous flame inspired v but heavier far the weight of shame that sunk britannias naval fame in vain she spreads her oncevictorious sails or fear or rashness in her chiefs prevails and wildly these prevent those basely shun the fight content with humble praise the foe avoids the long impending blow improves the kind escape and triumphs in his flight vi the monstrous age which still increasing years debase which teems with unknown crimes and genders new disgrace first unrestrained by honor faith or shame confounding every sacred name the hallowed nuptial bed with lawless lust profaned derived from this polluted source the dire corruption held its course through the whole cankered race and tainted all the land vii the ripening maid is versed in every dangerous art that ill adorns the form while it corrupts the heart practiced to dress to dance to play in wanton mask to lead the way to move the pliant limbs to roll the luring eye with follys gayest partisans to vye in empty noise and vain expense to celebrate with flaunting air the midnight revels of the fair studious of every praise but virtue truth and sense viii thus lessond in intrigue her early thought improves nor meditates in vain forbidden loves soon the gay nymph in cyprus train shall rove free and at large amidst the idalian grove or happily jealous of the

sublime the proud highborn patrician whore bears unabashd her front and glories in her crime ix hither from city and from court the votaries of love resort the rich the great the gay and the severe the pensiond architect of laws the patriot loud in virtues cause proud of imputed worth the peer regardless of his faith his country or his name he pawns his honor and estate nor reckons at how dear a rate he purchases disease and servitude and shame x not from such dastard sires to every virtue lost sprung the brave youth which britain once could boast who curbed the gauls usurping sway who swept the unnumberd hosts away in agincourt and cressys glorious plain who died the seas with spanish blood their vainlyvaunted fleets subdued and spread the mighty wreck over all the vanquished main xi no

emulous offspring led the rougher paths of fame to tread the matron trained their spotless youth in honor sanctity and truth formed by the united parents care the sons though bold were wise the daughters chaste though fair xii how time allwasting even the worst impairs and each foul age to dregs still fouler runs our sires more vicious even than theirs left us still more degenerate heirs to

time well pleased to won a youth beseems ne yet his wings were fledged ne locks were gray round him in sweet accord the seasons play with fruits and blossoms meint in goodly gree and dancing hand in hand rejoice the lea sick gardens now no mortal wight can see ne mote they in my simple verse descriven be ii the tempered clime full many a tree affords those many trees blush forth with ripened fruit the blushing fruit to feast invites the birds the birds with plenteous feasts their strength recruite and warble songs more sweet than shepherds flute the gentle stream that rolled the stones

he rod wild natures changed confessed the mild puissant god vi a beauteous fay or heavndescended spright sprung from her sire withouten females aid as erst minerva did and psyche hight in that enclosure happy sojourn made no art some heeld uncomelyness betrayed but nature wrought her manycolourd stole ne tarnishd like an ethiopian maid scorched with the suns that ore her beauties roll ne faded like the dames who bleach beneath the pole vii nor shame nor pride of borrowed substance wrought her gay embroidery and ornament but she who gave the gilded insects coat spun the soft silk and spread the various teint the gilded insects colors yet were feint to those which nature for this fairy wove our grannums thus with different dies besprent adorned in naked majesty the grove charmed our great sires and warmed our frozen clime to love viii on either side and all adown her back with many a ring at equal distance placed contrary to the rest was heben black with shades of green quick changing as she passed all were on groundwork of bright gold orecast the black gave livelood to the greenish hue the green still deepd the heben ore it laced the gold that peeped atween and then withdrew gave luster to them both and charmed the wondering view ix it seemed like arras wrought with cunning skill where kindly meddle colors light and shade here flows the flood there rising wood or hill breaks off its course gay verdure dies the mead the stream depeinten by the glittrand braid among the hills now winding seems to hide now shines unlooked for through the opening glade now in full

my love thou shall be well obeyed what rich purveyance for me have thou made the prickly rose alone denied the rest in full indulgence given twere to upbraid to doubt compliance with this one request how small and yet how kind cupid is thy beheast xiv and is that kindness made an argument to raise me still to higher scenes of bliss is the acceptance of thy goodness meant merit in me for farther

vows and mild regards she back reflects on him with aching eye pursues him as he goes with aching heart marks each diminished limb till indistinct diffused and lost in air he seem xvi he went to set the watches of the east that none mote rush in with the tide of wind he went to venus to make fond request from fleshly ferm to loosen psyches mind and her eftsoons transmew she forelore pined and moved for solace to the glassy lake to view the charms that had his heart entwined she saw and blushed and smiled then inly spoke these charms i cannot choose but love for cupids sake xvii but seaborn venus gan with envy stir at brute of their great happiness and sought how she might wreak her spite then called to her her sons and opened what rankled in her thought asking whod venture ore the mounds to vaut to breed them scathe unwares to damp the joy of blissful venus or to bring to naught the liefest purpose of her darling boy or urge them both their minion psyche to destroy xviii eros

said and deffly toward the gardens flew horribly smiling at his foul emprise when nearer still and nearer as he drew unsufferable brightness wounds his eyes forth beaming from the crystal walls he tries arrear to move averted from the blaze but now no longer the pure ether buoys his grosser bodys disproportioned peaze down drops plumb from his towering path the treachor base xx so ore avernus or the lucrine lake the wistless bird pursues his purposed flight whether by vapors noyd that thenceforth break or else deserted by an air too light down tumbles the fowl headlong from his height so anteros astonished fell to ground provoked but not accoid at his strange plight he rose and wending coasts it round and round to find unguarded pass hopeless to leap the mound xxi as on the margin of a stream he stood slow rolling from that paradise within a snakes outcase untenanted he viewed seizing the spoil albeit it worthless been he darts himself into the vacant skin in borrowed gear the exulting losel glides whose faded hues with joy flush bright again triumphant ore the buoyant flood he rides and shoots the important gulf borne on the gentle tides xxii so shone the brazen gates of babylon armies in vain her muniments assail so strong no engines could them batter down so high no ladders could the ramparts scale so flanked with towers besiegers note avail so wide sufficient harvests they enclose but where might yields there stratagems prevail faithless euphrates through the city flows and through his channel pours the unexpected foes xxiii he sails along in many a wanton spire now floats at length now proudly rears his crest his sparkling eyes and scales instinct with fire with splendour as he moves the waves ore kest and the waves gleam beneath his flaming breast as through the battle set in full array when the sun walks in radiant brightness dressed his beams that on the burnished helmets play the burnished helms reflect and spread unusual day xxiv so on he fares and stately wreaths about in semblaunce like a seraph glowing bright but without terror flashed his lightning out more to be wondered at than to affright the backward stream soon led the masker right to the broad lake where hanging ore the flood narcissus like enamored with the sight of his own beauties the fond psyche stood to mitigate the pains of lonely widowhood xxv unkennd of her he raught the embroidered bank and through the tangled flourets west aside to where a rosiere by the river dank luxuriant grew in all its blowing pride not far from psyche armed with scaly hide he clamb the thorns which no impression make his glittering length with all its folds untied plays floating ore the bush then silence brake and thus the nympth astonished at his speech bespake xxvi o fairest and most excellent complete in all perfections sovereign queen of nature the whole creation bowing at thy feet submissive pays thee homage wondrous creature if aught created thou for every feature speaks thee a goddess issued from the sky oh let not me offend unbidden waiter at aweful distance gazing thus but why should gazing thus offend or how unbidden i xxvii the sun that wakes those flourets from their beds or opes these buds by his soft influence is not offended that they peep their heads and show they feel his power by their quick sense offering at his command their sweet incense thus i drawn here by thy enlivening rays call not intrusion my obedience perforce yet willing thrall am come to gaze to pay my homage meet and bask in beautys blaze xxviii amazed she stood nor could recover soon from contemplation suddenly abraid starting at speech unusual yet the tune struck sootly on her ear and concert made with her own thoughts nor with less pleasure strayed her eyes delighted over his glossy skin yet frighted at the thorn on which he played pleasure with horror mixed she hung between suspended yields recoils uncertain where to lin xxix at length she spoke reptile no charms i know such as you mention yet whatever they are and nill i lessen what the gods bestow their is the gift and be the tribute their for them these beauties i improve with care intent to them alone from eve to morn but reed me reptile whence this wonder rare that thou have speech as if to reason born and how unhurt you sport on that forbidden thorn xxx say why forbidden thorn the foe replied to every reptile every insect free has malice harsh to thee alone denied the fragrance of the rose enjoyed by me   twas love not malice formed the kind decree halfwroth she cried thine all these buskets are thine fruit and flower were cupids words to me but oh i charge thee love the rose forbear for prickles sharp do arm the dangerous rosiere xxxi prickles will pain and pain will banish

laugh she blushed and frowned at his uncivil mirth then softened to a smile as hiding half what mote offend if boldly uttered forth he seemed to assay to give his answer birth but stopped and changed his smiles to looks of ruth is this quoth he fit guerdon for thy worth does cupid thus impose upon thy youth dwells then in heaven such envy void of love and truth xxxiv is this the instance of his tenderness to envy psyche what to worms is given to cut her off from present happiness with feigned reversion of a promised heaven by threatnings false from true enjoyments driven how innocent the thorn to touch he knows where are my wounds or where the avenging levin how softly blush these colors of the rose how sweet and dived into the flower its fragrance flows xxxv disadvantageous are thy terms of trial no longer psyche then the rose forbear what is to recompense the harsh denial but dreams of wandering through the fields of air and joys i know not what i know not where as eath on

to see him safe and hear his telling ambition vain to be more fair and wise and rage at cupids misconceivd false dealing various the gusts but all one way impelling she plunged into the bosom of the tree and snatched the rose no dreaded pain or quelling off drops the snake nor farther staid to see but rushed into the flood and vanished presently xxxix full many a thorn her tender body rent full many a thorn within the wounds remain and throbbing cause continual dreriment while gory drops her dainty form distain she wishes her lost innocence again and her lost peace lost charms lost love to find but shame upbraids her with a wish so vain despair succeeded and aversion blind pain fills her tortured sense and horror clouds her mind xl her bleeding faint disordered woebegon stretched on the bank beside the fatal thorn venus who came to seek her with her son beheld she stopped and albe heavenly born ruthful of others woe began to mourn the loss of venus smiles sick nature found as frostnipt drops the bloom the birds forelorn sit hushed the faded sun spreads dimness round the clattring thunders crash and earthquakes rock the ground xli then arming with a killing frown her brow die poor unhappy  cupid suppliant broke the unfinished sentence and with dueful bow begged her to doff the keenness of her look which nature feeling to her center shook then how should psyche bear it

an epistle from a swiss officer to his friend at rome from horrid mountains ever hid in snow and barren lands and dreary plains below to you dear sir my best regards i send the weakest reasoner as the truest friend your arguments that vainly strive to please your arts your country and your palaces what signs of roman grandeur still remain  much you have said and much have said in vain fine pageants these for slaves to please the eye and put the neatest dress on misery bred up to slavery and dissembled pain unhappy man you trifle with your chain but should your friend with your desires comply and sell himself to rome and slavery he could not wear his trammels with that art or hide the noble anguish of his heart you would soon repent the livery that you gave for trust me i should make an awkward slave falsely you blame our barren rocks and plains happy in freedom and laborious swains our peasants cheerful to the field repair and can enjoy the labors of the year whilst yours beneath some tree with mournful eyes sees for his haughty lord his harvests rise then silent sighs but stops his slavish breath he silent sighs for should he speak it is death hence from our field the lazy grain we call too much for want for luxury too small whilst all campanias rich inviting soil scarce knows the plowshare or the reapers toil in arms we breed our youth to dart from far and aim aright the thunder of the war to whirl the faulchion and direct the blow to ward the stroke or bear upon the foe early in hardships through the woods they fly nor feel the piercing frost or wintry sky some prowling wolf or foamy boar to meet and stretch the panting savage at their feet inured by this they seek a nobler war and show an honest pride in every scar with joy the danger and the blood partake whilst every wound is for their countrys sake but you soft warriors forced into the field or faintly strike or impotently yield for well this universal truth you know who fights for tyrants is his countrys foe i envy not your arts the roman schools improved perhaps but to inslave your souls may you to stone or nerves or beauty give and teach the softening marble how to live may you the passions in your colors trace and work up every piece with every grace in airs and attitudes be wondrous wise and know the arts to please or to surprise in musicks softest sound consume the day sounds that would melt the warriors soul away vain efforts these an honest fame to raise your painters and your eunuchs be your praise grant us more real goods you heavenly powers virtue and arms and liberty be ours weak are your offers to the free and brave no bribe can purchase me to be a slave hear me ye rocks ye mountains and ye plains the happy bounds of our helvetian swains in thee my country will i fix my seat nor envy the poor wretch that would be great my life and arms i dedicate to thee  for know it is my interest to be free life burdensome because we know not how to use it an epistle what sir a month and not one line afford it is well  how finely some folk keep their word i own my promise  but to steal an hour midst all this hurry  it is not in my power where life each day does one fixed order keep successive journies weariness and sleep or if our scheme some interval allows some hours designed for thought and for repose soon as the scattered images begin in the mind to rally  company comes in reason adieu there is no more room to think for all the day behind is noise and drink thus life rolls on but not without regret whenever at morning in some cool retreat i walk alone  it is then in thought i view some sage of old it is then i think of you whose breast no tyrant passions ever seize no pulse that riots blood that disobeys who follow but where judgment points the way and whom too busy sense never led astray not that you joys with moderation shun you taste all pleasures but indulge in none fired by this image i resolve anew it is reason calls and peace and joys in view how blessed a change a long adieu to sense o shield me sapience virtues reign commence alas how short a reign  the walk is over the dinner waits and friends some half a score at first to virtue firm the glass i fly till some sly sot  not drink the family thus gratitude is made to plead for sin my traitorous breast a party forms within and inclination bribed we never want excuse  it is hot and walking makes one faint now sense gets strength my bright resolves decay like stars that melt at the approach of day thought dies and even at last your image fades away my head grows warm all reason i despise today be happy and tomorrow wise betrayed so often i am half persuaded now surely to fail the first step is to vow the country lately twas my wish oh there gardens diversions friends relations air for london now dear london how i burn i must be happy sure when i return whoever hopes true happiness to see hopes for what never was nor ever will be the nearest ease since we must suffer still are they who dare be patient under ill whilom a fool saw where a fiddle lay and after pouring round it strove to play above below across all ways he tries he tries in vain it is discord all and noise fretting he threw it by then thus the lout there is music in it could i fetch it out if life does not its harmony impart we want not instruments but have not art it is endless to defer our hopes of ease till crosses end and disappointments cease the sage is happy not that all goes right his cattle feel no rot his corn no blight the mind for ease is fitted to the wise not so the fools  it is here the difference lies their prospect is the same but various are their eyes the duty of employing ones self an epistle few people know it yet dear sir it is true man should have somewhat evermore to do hard labors tedious every one must own but surely better such by far than none the perfect drone the quite impertinent whose life at nothing aims but  to be spent such heaven visits for some mighty ill it is sure the hardest labor to sit still hence that unhappy tribe who naught pursue who sin for want of something else to do sir john is blessed with riches honor love and to be blessed indeed needs only move for want of this with pain he lives away a lump of hardlyanimated clay dull till his double bottle does him right he is easy just at twelve oclock at night thus for one sparkling hour alone he is blessed while spleen and headache seize on all the rest what numbers sloth with gloomy humors fills racking their brains with visionary ills hence what loud outcries and wellmeaning rage what endless quarrels at the present age how many blame how often may we hear such vice  well sure the last day must be near to avoid such wild imaginary pains the sad creation of distempered brains dispatch dear friend move labor sweat run fly do aught  but think the day of judgment nigh there are who have lost all relish for delight with them no earthly thing is ever right to expect to alter to their taste were vain for who can mend so fast as they complain whatever you do shall be a crime with such one while you have lost your tongue then talk too much thus shall you meet their waspish censure still as hedgehogs prick you go which side you will oh pity these whenever you see them swell folks call em cross  poor men they are not well how many such in indolence grown old with vigor never do any thing but scold who spirits only from illhumour get like wines that die unless upon the fret wearied of flouncing to himself alone acerbus keeps a man to fret upon the fellows nothing in the earth to do but to sit quit and be scolded to pishes and oaths whenever the masters sourd all largely on the scapegoat slave are poured this drains his rage and though to john so rough abroad you would think him complaisant enough as for myself whom poverty prevents from being angry at so great expense who should i ever be inclined to rage for want of slaves war with myself must wage must rail and hear chastising be chastisd be both the tyrant and the tyrannized i choose to labor rather than to fret what is rage in some in me goes off in sweat if times are ill and things seem never worse men manners to reclaim  i take my horse one mile reforms em or if aught remain unpurgd  it is but to ride as far again thus on myself in toils i spend my rage i pay the fine and that absolves the age sometimes still more to interrupt my ease i take my pen and write  such things as these which though all other merit be denied show my devotion still to be employed add too though writing be itself a curse yet some distempers are a curse for worse and since midst indolence spleen will prevail since who do nothing else are sure to rail man should be suffered thus to play the fool to keep from hurt as children go to school you should not rhyme in spite of nature  true yet sure it is greater trouble if you do and if it is laboring only men profess who writes the hardest writes with most success thus for myself and friends i do my part promoting doubly the painstaking art first to myself it is labor to compose to read such lines is drudgery to those on scribbling against genius an epistle no single rules more frequently enjoined than this observe the bias of your mind however just by every one confessed there is not a rule more frequently transgressed for mortals to their interest blind pursue the thing they like not that they are fit to do this verros fault by frequent praises fired he several parts had tried in each admired that verro was not every way complete twas long unknown and might have been so yet but musickmad the unhappy man pursued that only thing heaven meant he never should and thus his proper road to fame neglected he is ridiculed for that he but affected would men but act from natures secret call or only where that fails not act at all if not their skill they would show at least good sense  they would get no fame  nor would they give offense not that where some one merit is denied men must be every way unqualifyd nor hold we like that wrongconcluding wight a man cannot fish  because he could not write view all the world around each man designed and furnished for some favorite part you find that sometimes low yet this so small a gift proves nature did not turn him quite adrift the phlegmatic dull awkward thick grosswitted have all some clumsy work for which they are fitted twas never known in men a perfect void even i and t  ld might be well employed would we our poverty of parts survey and follow as our genius led the way what then obedient to that turn of mind should men jog on to one dull path confined from that small circle never dare depart to strike at large and snatch a grace from art at least with care forbidden paths pursue who quits the road should keep it still in view from genius some few escapes may be allowed but ever keep within its neighborhood but c  r faithless to his bias see with giantsin opposing heavens decree still fond where he should not he blunders on with all that haste fools make to be undone want of success his passion but augments like eunuchs rage of love from impotence amongst all the instances of genius crossed the rhyming tribe are those who err the most each piddling wretch who has but common sense or thinks he has to verse shall make pretense why not it is their diversion and twere hard if men of their estates should be debarred thus wealth with them gives every thing beside as people worth so much are qualified they have all the requisites for writing fit all but that one  some little share of wit give way ye friends nor with fond prayers proceed to stop the progress of a pen full speed it is heaven incensed by some prodigious crime thus for mens sins determines them to rhyme bad men no doubt perhaps it is vengeance due for shrines they have plundered or some wretch they slew whatever it be sure grievous is the offense and grievous is heaven knows its recompense at once in want of rhyme and want of rest plagues to themselves and to mankind a jest seduced by empty forms of false delight  such in some men their deadly lust to write even i whose genius seems as much forgot mine when i write as yours when you do not who gravely thus can others faults condemn my self allowing what i blame in them with no pretense to phoebus aid divine nor the least interest in the tuneful nine with all the guilt of impotence in view grieved for past sins but yet committing new whatever the wits may say or wise may think am fooling every way with pen and ink when all who wish me best begin to advise that being witty is not being wise that if the voice of interest might be heard for one who wears a gown  would be preferred  incorrigibly deaf i feign a yawn and mock their just conclusions ere they are drawn if to my practice they opposed my theme and pointed how i swam against the stream with all the rancour of a bard in rage i would

the field an epistle from s j esquire in the country to the right hon the lord lovelace in town written in the year      in days my lord when mother time though now grown old was in her prime when saturn first began to rule and jove was hardly come from school how happy was a country life how free from wickedness and strife then each man lived upon his farm and thought and did no mortal harm on mossy banks fair virgins slept as harmless as the flocks they kept then love was all they had to do and nymphs were chaste and swains were true but now whatever poets write it is sure the case is altered quite virtue no more in rural plains or innocence or peace remains but vice is in the cottage sound and country girls are often unsound fierce partyrage each village fires with wars of justices and squires attorneys for a barley straw whole ages hamper folks in law and every neighbors in a flame about their rates or tithes or game some quarrel for their hares and pigeons and some for difference in religions some hold their parson the best preacher the tinker some a better teacher these to the church they fight for strangers have faith in nothing but her dangers while those a more believing people can swallow all things  but a steeple but i my lord who as you know care little how these matters go and equally detest the strife and usual joys of country life have by good fortune little share of its diversions or its care for seldom i with squires unite who hunt all day and drink all night nor reckon wonderful inviting a quarter sessions or cockfighting but then no farm i occupy with sheep to rot and cows to dye nor rage i much or much despair though in my hedge i find a snare nor view i with due admiration all the high honors here in fashion the great commissions of the quorum terrors to all who come before em militia scarlet edged with gold or the white staff highsheriffs hold the representatives caressing the judges bow the bishops blessing nor can i for my soul delight in the dull feast of neighboring knight who if you send three days before in white gloves meets you at the door with superfluity of breeding first makes you sick and then with feeding or if with ceremony cloyed you would next time such plagues avoid and visit without previous notice john john a coach  i cannot think who it is my lady cries who spies your coach ere you the avenue approach lord how unlucky  washingday and all the men are in the hay entrance to gain is something hard the dogs all bark the gates are barred the yards with lines of linen crossed the halldoors locked the key is lost these difficulties all overcome we reach at length the drawing room then there is such trampling overhead madam you would swear was brought to bed miss in a hurry bursts the lock to get clean sleeves to hide her smock the servants run the pewter clatters my lady dresses calls and chatters the cookmaid raves for want of butter pigs squeak fowls scream and green geese flutter now after three hours tedious waiting on all our neighbors faults debating and having nine times viewed the garden in which there is nothing worth a farthing in comes my lady and the pudden you will excuse sir  on a sudden  then that we may have four and four the bacon fowls and collyflowr their ancient unity divide the top one graces one each side and by and by the second course comes lagging like a distancd horse a salver then to church and king the butler sweats the glasses ring the cloth removed the toasts go round bawdy and politics abound and as the knight more tipsy waxes we damn all ministers and taxes at last the ruddy sun quite sunk the coachman tolerably drunk whirling over hillocks ruts and stones enough to dislocate ones bones we home return a wondrous token of heavens kind care with limbs unbroken afflict us not ye gods though sinners with many days like this or dinners but if civilities thus teaze me nor business nor diversions please me you will ask my lord how time i spend i answer with a book or friend the circulating hours dividing twixt reading walking eating riding but books are still my highest joy these earliest please and latest cloy sometimes over distant climes i stray by guides experienced taught the way the wonders of each region view from frozen lapland to peru bound over rough seas and mountains bare yet never forsake my elbow chair sometimes some famed historians pen recals past ages back again where all i see through every page is but how men with senseless rage each other rob destroy and burn to serve a priests or statesmans turn though loaded with a different aim yet always asses much the fame sometimes i view with much delight divines their holy gamecocks fight here faith and works at variance set strive hard who shall the victory get presbytery and episcopacy there fight so long it would amaze ye here free will holds a fierce dispute with reprobation absolute there sense kicks transubstantiation and reason pecks at revelation with learned newton now i fly over all the rolling orbs on high visit new worlds and for a minute this old one scorn and all that is in it and now with laboring boil i trace nature through every winding maze the latent qualities admire of vapors water air and fire with pleasing admiration see matters surprising subtlety as how the smallest lamp displays for miles around its scattered rays or how the case still more to explain see boyles experiments a fart that weighs not half a grain the atmosphere will often perfume of a whole spacious drawing room sometimes i pass a whole long day in happy indolence away in fondly meditating over past pleasures and in hoping more or wander through the fields and woods and gardens bathed in circling floods there blooming flowers with rapture view and sparkling gems of morning dew whence in my mind ideas rise of caelias cheeks and chloes eyes it is thus my lord i free from strife spend an inglorious country life these are the joys i still pursue when absent from the town and you thus pass long summer suns away busily idle calmly gay nor great nor mean nor rich nor poor not having much or wishing more except that you when weary grown of all the follies of the town and seeing in all public places the same vain fops and painted faces would sometimes kindly condescend to visit a dull country friend here you will be ever sure to meet a hearty welcome though no treat one who has nothing else to do but to divert himself and you a house where quiet guards the door no rural wits smoke drink and roar choice books safe horses wholesome liquor clean girls backgammon and the vicar to a lady in town soon after her leaving the country by the same whilst you dear maid over thousands born to reign for the gay town exchange the rural plain the cooling breeze and evening walk forsake for stifling crowds which your own beauties make through circling joys while you incessant stray charm in the mall and sparkle at the play think if successive vanities can spare one thought to love what cruel pangs i bear left in these plains all wretched and alone to weep with fountains and with echoes groan and mourn incessantly that fatal day that all my bliss with chloe snatched away say by what arts i can relieve my pain music verse all i try but try in vain in vain the breathing flute my hand employs late the companion of my chloes voice nor handels nor corellis tuneful airs can harmonize my soul or sooth my cares those oncelovd medicines unsuccessful prove music alas is but the voice of love in vain i often harmonious lines peruse and seek for aid from popes and priors muse their treacherous numbers but assist the foe and call forth scenes of sympathising woe here heloise mourns her absent lovers charms there panting emma sighs in henrys arms their loves like mine illfated i bemoan and in their tender sorrows read my own restless sometimes as often the mournful dove forsakes her nest forsaken by her love i fly from home and seek the sacred fields where cams old urn its silver current yields where solemn towers oerlook each mossy grove as if to guard it from the assaults of love yet guard in vain for there my chloes eyes but lately made whole colleges her prize her sons though few not pallas could defend nor dullness succor to her thousands lend love like a fever with infectious rage scorched up the young and thawed the frost of age to gaze at her even dons are seen to run and leave unfinished pipes and authors  scarce begun so helen looked and moved with such a grace when the grave seniors of the trojan race were forced those fatal beauties to admire that all their youth consumed and set their town on fire at famed newmarket often i spend the day an unconcerned spectator of the play there pitiless observe the ruined heir with anger fired or melting with despair for how should i his trivial loss bemoan who feel one so much greater of my own there while the golden heaps a glorious prize wait the decision of two rival dice while long disputes twixt seven and five remain and each like parties have their friends for gain without one wish i see the guineas shine fate keep your gold i cry make chloe mine now see prepared their utmost speed to try over the smooth turf the bounding racers fly now more and more their slender limbs they strain and foaming stretch along the velvet plain ah stay swift steeds your rapid flight delay no more the jockeys smarting lash obey but rather let my hand direct the rein and guide your steps a nobler prize to gain then swift as eagles cut the yielding air bear me oh bear me to the absent fair now when the winds are hushed the air serene and cheerful sunbeams gild the beauteous scene pensive over all the neighboring fields i stray wherever or choice or chance directs the way or view the opening lawns or private woods or distant bluish hills or silver floods now harmless birds in silken nets ensnare now with swift dogs pursue the flying hare dull sports for oh my chloe is not there fatigued at length i willingly retire to a small study and a cheerful fire there over some folio pore i pore it is true but oh my thoughts are fled and fled to you i hear you see you feast upon your eyes and clasp with eager arms the lovely prize here for a while i could forget my pain whilst i by dear reflection live again but even these joys are too sublime to last and quickly fade like all the real ones past for just when now beneath some silent grove i hear you talk  and talk perhaps of love or charm with thrilling notes the listening ear sweeter than angels sing or angels hear my treacherous hand its weighty charge lets go the book falls thundering on the floor below the pleasing vision in a moments gone and i once more am wretched and alone so when glad orpheus from the infernal shade had just recalled his longlamented maid soon as her charms had reached his eager eyes lost in eternal night  again she dies to

chesterfield on his being installed knight of the garter by the same these trophies stanhope of the lovely dame once the bright object of a monarchs flame who with such just propriety can wear as thou the darling of the gay and fair see every friend to wit politeness love with one consent thy sovereigns choice approve and lived plantagenet her voice to join herself and garter both were surely thine to a lady sent with a present of shells and stones designed for a grotto by the same with gifts like these the spoils of neighboring shores the indian swain his sable love adores offerings well suited to the dusky shrine of his rude goddess but unworthy mine and yet they seem not such a worthless prize if nicely viewed by philosophic eyes and such are yours that natures works admire with warmth like that which they themselves inspire to such how fair appears each grain of sand or humblest weed as wrought by natures hand how far superior to all human power springs the green blade or buds the painted flower in all her births though of the meanest kinds a just observer entertainment finds with fond delight her low productions sees and how she gently rises by degrees a shell or stone he can with pleasure view hence trace her noblest works the heavens  and you behold how bright these gaudy trifles shine the lovely sportings of a hand divine see with what art each curious shell is made here carved in fretwork there with pearl inlaid what vivid streaks the enameled stones adorn fair as the paintings of the purple morn yet still not half their charms can reach our eyes while thus confused the sparkling chaos lies doubly they will please when in your grotto placed they plainly speak the fair disposers taste then glories yet unseen shall over them rise new order from your hand new luster from your eyes how sweet how charming will appear this grot when by your art to full perfection brought here verdant plants and blooming flowers will grow there bubbling currents through the shellwork flow here coral mixed with shells of various dies there polished stone will charm our wondering eyes delightful bower of bliss secure retreat fit for the muses and statiras seat but still how good must be that fairones mind who thus in solitude can pleasure find the muse her company goodsense her guide resistless charms her power but not her pride who thus forsakes the town the park and play in silent shades to pass her hours away who better likes to breathe fresh country air than ride imprisoned in a velvet chair and makes the warbling nightingale her choice before the thrills of farinellis voice prefers her books and conscience void of ill to consorts balls assemblies and quadrille sweet bowers more pleased than gilded chariots sees for groves the playhouse quits and beaus for trees blessed is the man whom heaven shall grant one hour with such a lovely nymph in such a lovely bower to a lady in answer to a letter wrote in a very fine hand by the same whilst wellwrote lines our wondering eyes command the beauteous work of chloes artful hand throughout the finished piece we see displayed the exactest image of the lovely maid such is her wit and such her form divine this pure as flows the style through every line that like each letter exquisitely fine see with what art the sable currents stain in wandering mazes all the milkwhite plain thus over the meadows wrapped in silver snow unfrozen brooks in dark meanders flow thus jetty curls in shining ringlets deck the ivory plain of lovely chloes neck see like some virgin whose unmeaning charms receive new luster from a lovers arms the yielding papers pure but vacant breast by her fair hand and flowing pen impressed at every touch more animated grows and with new life and new ideas glows fresh beauties from the kind defiler gains and shines each moment brighter from its stains let mighty love no longer boast his darts that strike unerring aimed at mortal hearts chloe your quill can equal wonders do wound full as sure and at a distance too armed with your feathered weapons in your hands from pole to pole you send your great commands to distant climes in vain the lover flies your pen oertakes him if he escapes your eyes so those who from the sword in battle run but perish victims to the distant gun beautys a shortlived blaze a fading flower but these are charms no ages can devour these far superior to the brightest face triumph alike over time as well as space when that fair form which thousands now adore by years decayed shall tyrannize no more these lovely lines shall future ages view and eyes unborn like ours be charmed by you how often do i admire with fond delight the curious piece and wish like you to write alas vain hope that might as well aspire to copy paulos stroke or titians fire even now your splendid lines before me lie and i in vain to imitate them try believe me fair i am practicing this art to steal your hand in hopes to steal your heart the art of dancing a poem inscribed to the rt hon the lady fanny fielding written in the year    0 by the same incessu patuit dea virg canto i in the smooth dance to move with graceful mien easy with care and sprightly though serene to mark the instructions echoing strains convey and with just steps each tuneful note obey i teach be present all ye sacred choir blow the soft flute and strike the sounding lyre when fielding bids your kind assistance bring and at her feet the lowly tribute fling oh may her eyes to her this verse is due what first themselves inspired vouchsafe to view hail loftiest art thou can all hearts ensnare and make the fairest still appear more fair beauty can little execution do unless she borrows half her arms from you few like pygmalion dote on lifeless charms or care to clasp a statue in their arms but breasts of flint must melt with fierce desire when art and motion wake the sleeping fire a venus drawn by great apelles hand may for awhile our wondering eyes command but still though formed with all the powers of art the lifeless piece can never warm the heart so fair a nymph perhaps may please the eye whilst all her beauteous limbs unactive lie but when her charms are in the dance displayed then every heart adores the lovely maid this sets her beauty in the fairest light and shows each grace in full perfection bright then as she turns around from every part like porcupines she sends a piercing dart in vain alas the fond spectator tries to shun the pleasing dangers of her eyes for parthianlike she wounds as sure behind with flowing curls and ivory neck reclined whether her steps the minuets mazes trace or the slow louvres more majestic pace whether the rigadoon employs her care or sprightly igg displays the nimble fair at every stop new beauties we explore and worship now what we admired before so when aeneas in the tyrian grove fair venus met the charming queen of love the beauteous goddess whilst unmoved she stood seemed some fair nymph the guardian of the wood but when she moved at once her heavenly mien and graceful step confessed bright beautys queen new glories over her form each moment rise and all the goddess opens to his eyes now haste my muse pursue thy destined way what dresses best become the dancer say the rules of dress forget not to impart a lesson previous to the dancing art the soldiers scarlet glowing from afar shows that his bloody occupations war whilst the lawn band beneath a double chin as plainly speaks divinity within the milkmaid safe through driving rains and snows wrapped in her cloak and propd on pattens goes whilst the soft belle immured in velvet chair needs but the silken shoe and trusts her bosom bare the woolly drab and english broadcloth warm guard well the horseman from the beating storm but load the dancer with too great a weight and call from every pore the dewy sweat rather let him his active limbs display in camblet thin or glossy paduasoy let no unwieldy pride his shoulders press but airy light and easy be his dress thin be his yielding soal and low his heel so shall he nimbly bound and safely wheel but let not precepts known my verse prolong precepts which use will better teach than song for why should i the gallant spark command with clean white gloves to fit his ready hand or in his fob enlivening spirits wear and pungent salts to raise the fainting fair or hint the sword that dangles at his side should from its silken bandage be untied why should my lays the youthful tribe advise lest snowy clouds from out their wigs arise so shall their partners mourn their laces spoiled and shining silks with greasy powder soiled nor need i sure bid prudent youths beware lest with erected tongues their buckles stare the pointed steel shall often their stocking rend and often the approaching petticoat offend and now ye youthful fair i sing to you with pleasing smiles my useful labors view for you the silkworms finewrought webs display and laboring spin their little lives away for you bright gems with radiant colors glow fair as the dies that paint the heavenly bow for you the sea resigns its pearly store and earth unlocks her mines of treasured ore in vain yet nature thus her gifts bestows unless yourselves with art those gifts dispose yet think not nymphs that in the glittering ball one form of dress prescribed can suit with all one brightest shines when wealth and art combine to make the finished piece completely fine when least adorned another steals our hearts and rich in native beauties wants no arts in some are such resistless graces found that in all dresses they are sure to wound their perfect forms all foreign aids despise and gems but borrow luster from their eyes let the fair nymph in whose plump cheeks is seen a constant blush be clad in cheerful green in such a dress the sportive seanymphs go so in their grassy bed fresh roses blow the lass whose skin is like the hazel brown with brighter yellow should overcome her own while maids grown pale with sickness or despair the sables mournful dye should choose to wear so the pale moon still shines with purest light clothed in the dusky mantle of the night but far from you be all those treacherous arts that wound with painted charms unwary hearts dancings a touchstone that true beauty tries nor suffers charms that natures hand denies though for awhile we may with wonder view the rosy blush and skin of lovely hue yet soon the dance will cause the cheeks to glow and melt the waxen lips and neck of snow so shine the fields in icy fetters bound whilst frozen gems bespangle all the ground through the clear crystal of the glittering snow with scarlet dye the blushing hawthorns glow over all the plains unnumberd glories rise and a new bright creation charms our eyes till zeyhyr breathes then all at once decay the splendid scenes their glories fade away the fields resign the beauties not their own and all their snowy charms run trickling down dare i in such momentous points advise i should condemn the hoops enormous size of ills i speak by long experience found often have i trod the immeasurable round and mourned my shins bruised black with many a wound nor should the tightend stays too straightly laced in whalebone bondage gall the slender waist nor waving lappets should the dancing fair nor ruffles edged with dangling fringes wear often will the cobweb ornaments catch hold on the approaching button rough with gold nor force nor art can then the bonds divide when once the entangled gordian knot is tied so the unhappy pair by hymens power together joined in some illfated hour the more they strive their freedom to regain the faster binds the indissoluble chain let each fair maid who fears to be disgraced ever be sure to tie her garter fast lest the loosed string amidst the public ball a wished for prize to some proud fop should fall who the rich treasure shall triumphant show and with warm blushes cause her cheeks to glow but yet as fortune by the selfsame ways she humbles many some delights to raise it happened once afair illustrious dame by such neglect acquired immortal fame and hence the radiant star and garter blue britannias nobles grace if fame says true hence still plantagenet thy beauties bloom though long since moulderd in the dusky tomb still thy lost garter is thy sovreigns care and what each royal breast is proud to wear but let me now my lovely charge remind lest they forgetful leave their fans behind lay not ye fear the pretty toy aside a toy at once displayed for use and pride a wondrous engine that by magic charms cools your own breast and every others warms what daring bard shall ever attempt to tell the powers that in this little weapon dwell what verse can ever explain its various parts its numerous uses motions charms and arts its painted folds that often extended wide the afflicted fair ones blubbered beauties hide when secret sorrows her sad bosom fill if strephon is unkind or shock is ill its sticks on which her eyes dejected pore and pointing fingers number over and over when the kind virgin burns with secret shame dies to consent yet fears to own her flame its shake triumphant its victorious clap its angry slutter and its wanton tap forbear my muse the extensive theme to sing nor trust in such a flight thy tender wing rather do you in humble lines proclaim from whence this engine took its form and name say from what cause it first derived its birth how formed in heaven how thence deduced to earth once in arcadia that famed seat of love there lived a nymph the pride of all the grove a lovely nymph adorned with every grace an easy shape and sweetly blooming face fanny the damsels name as chaste as fair each virgins envy and each swains despair to charm her ear the rival shepherds sing blow the soft flute and wake the trembling string for her they leave their wandering flocks to rove whilst fannys name resounds through every grove and spreads on every tree enclosed in knots of love as fieldings now her eyes all hearts inflame like her in beauty as alike in name twas when the summer sun now mounted high with fiercer beams had scorched the glowing sky beneath the covert of a cooling shade to shun the heat this lovely nymph was laid the sultry weather over her cheeks had spread a blush that added to their native red and her fair breasts as polished marble white were half concealed and half exposed to sight aeolus the mighty god whom winds obey observed the beauteous maid as thus she lay over all her charms he gazed with fond delight and sucked in poison at the dangerous sight he sighs he burns at last declares his pain but still he sighs and still he wooes in vain the cruel nymph regardless of his moan minds not his flame uneasy with her own but still complains that he who ruled the air would not command one zephyr to repair around her face nor gentle breeze to play through the dark glade to cool the sultry day by love incited and the hopes of joy the ingenious god contrived this pretty toy with gales incessant to relieve her flame and called it fan from lovely fannys name canto ii now see prepared to lead the sprightly dance the lovely nymphs and welldressd youths advance the spacious room receives each jovial guest and the floor shakes with pleasing weight oppressed thick ranged on every side with various dies the fair in glossy silks our sight surprise so in a garden bathed with genial showers a thousand sorts of variegated flowers jonquils carnations pinks and tulips rise and in a gay confusion charm our eyes high over their heads with numerous candles bright large sconces shed their sparkling beams of light their sparkling beams that still more brightly glow reflected back from gems and eyes below unnumberd fans to cool the crowded fair with breathing zephyrs move the circling air the sprightly fiddle and the sounding lyre each youthful breast with generous warmth inspire fraught with all joys the blissful moments fly while music melts the ear and beauty charms the eye now let the youth to whose superior place it first belongs the splendid ball to grace with humble bow and ready hand prepare forth from the crowd to lead his chosen fair the fair shall not his kind request deny but to the pleasing toil with equal ardour fly but stay rash pair not yet untaught advance first hear the muse ere you attempt to dance art citae veloque rates remoque moventur art leves currus ovid  by art directed over the foaming tide secure from rocks the painted vessels glide by art the chariot scours the dusty plain springs at the whip and  nec audit currus habenas virg hears the straitning rein to art our bodies must obedient prove if ever we hope with graceful ease to move long was the dancing art unfixd and free hence lost in error and uncertainty no precepts did in mind or rules obey but every master taught a different way hence ere each newborn dance was fully tried the lovely product even in blooming died through various hands in wild confusion tossed its steps were altered and its beauties lost till fuillet wrote the art of dancing by characters in french since translated by weaver fuillet the pride of gallia rose and did the dance in characters compose each lovely grace by certain marks he taught and every step in lasting volumes wrote hence over the world this pleasing art shall spread and every dance in every clime be read by distant masters shall each step be seen though mountains rise and oceans roar between hence with her sister arts shall dancing claim an equal right to universal fame and isaacs rigadoon shall live as long as raphaels painting or as virgils song wise nature ever with a prudent hand dispenses various gifts to every land to every nation frugally imparts a genius fit for some peculiar arts to trade the dutch incline the swiss to arms music and verse are soft italias charms britannia justly glories to have found lands unexplord and sailed the globe around but none will sure presume to rival france whether she forms or executes the dance to her exalted genius it is we owe the sprightly rigadoon and louvre slow the boree and courant unpracticed long the immortal minuet and the smooth bretagne with all those dances of illustrious fame french dances that from their native country take their name with these let every ball be first begun nor country dance intrude till these are done each cautious bard ere he attempts to sing first gently fluttering tries his tender wing and if he finds that with uncommon fire the muses all his raptured soul inspire at once to heaven he soars in lofty odes and sings alone of heroes and of gods but if he trembling fears a flight so high he then descends to softer elegy and if in elegy he cannot succeed in pastral he may tune the oaten reed so should the dancer ere he tries to move with care his strength his weight and genius prove then if he finds kind natures gifts impart endowments proper for the dancing art if in himself he feels together joined an active body and ambitious mind in nimble rigadoons he may advance or in the louvres slow majestic dance if these he fears to reach with easy pace let him the minuets circling mazes trace is this too hard this too let him forbear and to the countrydance confine his care would you in dancing every fault avoid to keep true time be your first thoughts employed all other errors they in vain shall mend who in this one important point offend for this when now united hand in hand eager to start the youthful couple stand let them awhile their nimble feet restrain and with soft taps beat time to every strain so for the race prepared two coursers stand and with impatient pawings spurn the sand in vain a master shall employ his care where nature once has fixed a clumsy air rather let such to country sports confined pursue the flying hare or timorous hind nor yet while i the rural squire despise a mien effeminate would i advise with equal scorn i would the fop deride nor let him dance  but on the womans side and you fair nymphs avoid with equal care a stupid dullness and a coquet air neither with eyes that ever love the ground asleep like spinningtops run round and round nor yet with giddy looks and wanton pride stare all around and skip from side to side true dancing like true wit is best expressed by nature only to advantage dressed it is not a nimble bound or caper high that can pretend to please a curious eye good judges no such tumblers tricks regard or think them beautiful because they are hard it is not enough that every standerby no glaring errors in your steps can spy the dance and music must so nicely meet each note should seem an echo to your feet a nameless grace must in each movement dwell which words can never express or precepts tell not to be taught but ever to be seen in flavias air and chloes easy mien it is such an air that makes her thousands fall when fielding dances at a birthnight ball smooth as camilla she skims over the plain and flies like her through crowds of heroes slain now when the minuet often repeated over like all terrestrial joys can please no more and every nymph refusing to expand her charms declines the circulating hand then let the jovial countrydance begin and the loud fiddles call each straggler in but ere they come permit me to disclose how first as legends tell this pastime rose in ancient times such times are now no more when albions crown illustrious arthur wore in some fair opening glade each summers night where the pule moon diffused her silver light on the soft carpet of a grassy field the sporting fairies their assemblies held some lightly tripping with their pigmy queen in circling ringlets marked the level green some with soft notes bade mellow pipes resound and music warble through the groves around often lonely shepherds by the forest side belated peasants often their revels spied and home returning over the nutbrown ale their guests diverted with the wondrous tale instructed hence throughout the british isle and fond to imitate the pleasing toil round where the trembling may poles fixed on high and bears its flowery honors to the sky the ruddy maids and sunburned swains resort and practice every night the lovely sport on every side aeolian artists stand whose active elbows swelling winds command the swelling winds harmonious pipes inspire and blow in every breast a generous fire thus taught at first the countrydance began and hence to cities and to courts it ran succeeding ages did in time impart various improvements to the lovely art from fields and groves to palaces removed great ones the pleasing exercise approved hence the loud fiddle and shrill trumpets sounds are made companions of the dancers bounds hence gems and silks brocades and ribbons join to make the ball with perfect luster shine so rude at first the tragic muse appeared her voice alone by rustic rabble heard where twisting trees a cooling arbor made the pleased spectators sat beneath the shade the homely stage with rushes green was strewn and in a cart the strolling actors rode till time at length improved the great design and bade the scenes with painted landskips shine then art did all the bright machines dispose and theaters of parian marble rose then mimic thunder shook the canvas sky and gods descended from their towers on high with caution now let every youth prepare to choose a partner from the mingled fair vain would he hear the instructed muses voice if she pretended to direct his choice beauty alone by fancy is expressed and charms in different forms each different breast a snowy skin this amorous youth admires whilst nutbrown cheeks anothers bosom fires small waists and slender limbs some hearts ensnare while others love the more substantial fair but let not outward charms your judgments sway your reason rather than your eyes obey and in the dance as in the marriage noose rather for merit than for beauty choose be her your choice who knows with perfect skill when she should move and when she should be still who uninstructed can perform her share and kindly half the pleasing burden bear unhappy is that hopeless wretchs fate who fettered in the matrimonial state with a poor simple unexperienced wife is forced to lead the tedious dance of life and such is his with such a partner joined a moving puppet but without a mind still must his hand be pointing out the way yet never can teach so fast as she can stray beneath her follies he must ever groan and ever blush for errors not his own but now behold united hand in hand ranged on each side the wellpaird couples stand each youthful bosom beating with delight waits the brisk signal for the pleasing fight while lovely eyes that flash unusual rays and snowy bubbies pulled above the stays quick busy hands and bridling heads declare the fond impatience of the starting fair and see the sprightly dance is now begun now here now there the giddy maze they run now with slow steps they pace the circling ring now all confused too swift for sight they spring so in a wheel with rapid fury tossed the undistinguished spokes are in the motion lost the dancer here no more requires a guide to no strict steps his nimble feet are tied the muses precepts here would useless be where all is fancied unconfined and free let him but to the musicks voice attend by this instructed he can never offend if to his share it falls the dance to lead in wellknown paths he may be sure to tread if others lead let him their motions view and in their steps the winding maze pursue in every countrydance a serious mind turned for reflection can a moral find in huntthesquirrel thus the nymph we view seeks when we fly but flies when we pursue thus in rounddances where our partners change and unconfined from fair to fair we range as soon as one from his own consort flies another seizes on the lovely prize awhile the favorite youth enjoys her charms till the next comer steals her from his arms new ones succeed the last is still her care how true an emblem of the inconstant fair where can philosophers and sages wise who read the curious volumes of the skies a model more exact than dancing name of the creations universal frame where worlds unnumberd over the aetherial way in a bright regular confusion stray now here now there they whirl along the sky now near approach and now far distant fly now meet in the same order they began and then the great celestial dance is done where can the morlist find a juster plan of the vain labors and the life of man awhile through justling crowds we toil and sweat and eagerly pursue we know not what then when our trifling shortlived race is run quite tired sit down just where we first begun though to your arms kind fates indulgent care has given a partner exquisitely fair let not her charms so much engage your heart that you neglect the skilful dancers part be not when you the tuneful notes should hear still whispering idle prattle in her ear when you should be employed be not at play nor for your joys all others steps delay but when the finished dance you once have done and with applause through every couple run there rest awhile there snatch the fleeting bliss the tender whisper and the balmy kiss each secret wish each softer hope confess and her moist palm with eager fingers press with smiles the fair shall hear your warm desires when music melts her soul and dancing sires thus mixed with love the pleasing toil pursue till the unwelcome morn appears in view then when approaching day its beams displays and the dull candles shine with fainter rays then when the sun just rises over the deep and each bright eye is almost set in sleep with ready hands obsequious youths prepare safe to her coach to lead each chosen fair and guard her from the morns inclement air let a warm hood enwrap her lovely head and over her neck a handkerchief be spread around her shoulders let this arm be cast whilst that from cold defends her slender waist with kisses warm her balmy lips shall glow unchilld by nightly damps or wintry snow while generous white wind mulld with ginger warm safely protects her inward frame from harm but ever let my lovely pupils fear to chill their mantling blood with cold small beer ah thoughtless fair the tempting draught refuse when thus forewarned by my experienced muse let the sad consequence your thoughts employ nor hazard future pains for present joy destruction lurks within the poisonous dose a fatal fever or a pimpled nose thus through each precept of the dancing art the muse has played the kind instructors part through every maze her pupils she has led and pointed out the surest paths to tread no more remains no more the goddess sings but drops her pinions and unfurls her wings on downy beds the weary dancers lie and sleeps silk cords tie down each drowsy eye delightful dreams their pleasing sports restore and even in sleep they seem to dance once more and now the work completely finished lies which the devouring teeth of time defies whilst birds in air or fish in streams we find or damsels fret with aged partners joined as long as nymphs shall with attentive ear a fiddle rather than a sermon hear so long the brighest eye shall often peruse the useful lines of my instructive muse each belle shall wear them wrote upon her fan and each bright beau shall read them  if he can the modern fine gentleman written in the year      by the same quale portentum neque militaris daunia in latis alit esculetis nec jubae tellus

unknowingly has helped to make trembling and anxious stakes his utmost groat peeps over his cards and looks as if he thought next morn disowns the losses of the night because the fool would fain be thought a bite devoted thus to politics and cards nor mirth nor wine nor women he regards so far is every virtue from his heart that not a generous vice can claim a part nay lest one human passion ever should move his soul to friendship tenderness or love to figg and broughton he commits his breast to steel it to the fashionable test thus poor in wealth he labors to no end wretched alone in crowds without a friend insensible to all that is good or kind deaf to all merit to all beauty blind for love too busy and for wit too grave a hardened sober proud luxurious knave by little actions striving to be great and proud to be and to be thought a cheat and yet in this so bad is his success that as his fame improves his rents grow less on parchment wings his acres take their flight and his unpeopled groves admit the light with his estate his interest too is done his honest borough seeks a warmer sun for him now cash and liquor flows no more his independent voters cease to roar and britain soon must want the great defense of all his honesty and eloquence but that the generous youth more anxious grown for public liberty than for his own marries some jointurd antiquated crone and

the morn again for love no time has she or inclination yet must coquet it for the sake of fashion for this she listens to each fop that is near the embroidered colonel flatters with a sneer and the cropped ensign nuzzles in her ear but with most warmth her dress and airs inspire the ambitious bosom of the landed squire who fain would quit plump dollys softer charms for withered lean right honorable arms he bows with reverence at her sacred shrine and treats her as if sprung from race divine which she returns with insolence and scorn nor deigns to smile on a plebeian born ere long by friends by cards and lovers crossed her fortune health and reputation lost her money gone yet not a tradesman paid her fame yet she still damned to be a maid her spirits sink her nerves are so unstrung she weeps if but a handsome thief is hung by mercers lacemen mantuamakers pressed but most for ready cash for play distressed where can she turn  the squire must all repair she condescends to listen to his prayer and marries him at length in mere despair but soon the endearments of a husband cloy her soul her frame incapable of joy she feels no transports in the bridal bed of which so

forced to quit the town and tubbs conveys the wretched exile down now rumbling over the stones of tyburnroad never pressed with a more grieved or guilty load she bids adieu to all the wellknown streets and envies every cinderwench she meets and now the dreaded country first appears with sighs unfeigned the dying noise she hears of distant coaches fainter by degrees then starts and trembles at the sight of trees silent and sullen like some captive queen she is drawn along unwilling to be seen until at length appears the ruined hall within the grassgreen moat and ivyd wall the doleful prison where for ever she but not alas her griefs must buried be her coach the curate and the tradesmen meet greatcoated tenants her arrival greet and boys with stubble bonfires light the street while bells her ears with tongues discordant grate types of the nuptial ties they celebrate but no rejoicings can unbend her brow nor deigns she to return one awkward bow but bounces in disdaining once to

proud one friendly visit to repay too indolent to read too criminal to pray at length half dead half mad and quite confined shunning and shunned by all of human kind even robbed of the last comfort of

esquire by the same atque ipsa utilitas justi prope matter et aequi hor thou whom nor honors wealth nor youth can spoil with the least vice of each luxuriant soil say york for sure if any you can tell what virtue is who practice it so well say where inhabits this sultana queen praised and adored by all but rarely seen by what sure marks her essence can we trace when each religion faction age and place sets up some fancied idol of its own a vain pretender to her sacred throne in man too often a welldissembled part a selfdenying pride in womans heart in synods faith and in the fields of fame valor usurps her honors and her name whoever their sense of virtue could express it is still by something they themselves possess hence youth good humor frugal craft old age warm politicians term it partyrage true churchmen zeal right orthodox and hence fools think it gravity and wits pretense to constancy alone fond lovers join it and maids unasked to chastity confine it but have we then no law besides our will no just criterion fixed to good and ill as well at noon we may obstruct our sight then doubt if such a thing exists as light for no less plain would natures law appear as the meridian sun unchanged and clear would we but search for what we were designed and for what end the almighty formed mankind a rule of life we then should plainly see for to pursue that end must virtue be then what is that not want of power or fame or worlds unnumberd to applaud his name but a desire his blessings to diffuse and fear lest millions should existence lose his goodness only could his power employ and an eternal warmth to propagate his joy hence soul and sense diffused through every place make happiness as infinite as space thousands of suns beyond each other blaze orbs roll over orbs and glow with mutual rays each is a world where formed with wondrous art unnumberd species live through every part in every tract of ocean earth and skies myriads of creatures still successive rise scarce buds a leaf or springs the vilest weed but little flocks upon its verdure feed no fruit our palate courts or flower our smell but on its fragrant bosom nations dwell all formed with proper faculties to share the daily bounties of their makers care the great creator from his heavenly throne pleased on the wideexpanded joy looks down and his eternal law is only this that all contribute to the general bliss nature so plain this primal law displays each living creature sees it and obeys each formed for all promotes through private care the public good and justly tastes its share all understand their great creators will strive to be happy and in that fulfill mankind excepted lord of all beside but only slave to folly vice and pride it is he that is deaf to this command alone deilghts in others woe and courts his own racks and destroys with torturing steel and flame for luxry brutes and man himself for fame sets superstition high on virtues throne then thinks his makers temper like his own hence are his altars stained with reeking gore as if he could atone for crimes by more hence whilst offended heaven he strives in vain to appease by fasts and voluntary pain even in repenting he provokes again how easy is our yoke how light our load did we not strive to mend the laws of god for his own sake no duty he can ask the common welfare is our only task for this sole end his precepts kind as just forbid intemprance murder theft and lust with every act injurious to our own or others good for such are crimes alone for this are peace love charity enjoined with all that can secure and bless mankind thus is the public safety virtues cause and happiness the end of all her laws for such by nature is the human frame our duty and our interest are the same but hold cries out some puritan divine whose wellstuffd cheeks with ease and plenty shine is this to fast to mortify refrain and work salvation out with fear and pain we own the rigid lessons of their schools are widely different from these easy rules virtue with them is only to abstain from all that nature asks and covet pain pleasure and vice are ever near akin and if we thirst cold water is a sin heavens path is rough and intricate they say yet all are damned that trip or miss their way god is a being cruel and severe and man a wretch by his command placed here in sunshine for awhile to take a turn only to dry and make him fit to burn mistaken men too piously severe through craft misleading or misled by fear how little they gods counsels comprehend our universal parent guardian friend who forming by degrees to bliss mankind this globe our sportive nursery assigned where for awhile his fond paternal care feasts us with every joy our state can bear each sense touch taste and smell dispense delight music our hearing beauty charms our sight trees herbs and flowers to us their spoils resign its pearl the rock presents its gold the mine beasts fowl and fish their daily tribute give of food and clothes and die that we may live seasons but change new pleasures to produce and elements contend to serve our use loves gentle shafts ambitions towering wings the pomps of senates churches courts and kings all that our reverence joy or hope create are the gay playthings of this infant state scarcely an ill to human life belongs but what our follies cause or mutual wrongs or if some stripes from providence we feel he strikes with pity and but wounds to heal kindly perhaps sometimes afflicts us here to guide her views to a sublimer sphere in more exalted joys to fix our taste and wean us from delights that cannot last our present good the easy task is made to earn superior bliss when this shall fade for soon as ever these moral pleasures cloy his hand shall lead us to sublimer joy snatch us from all our little sorrows here calm every grief and dry each childish tear waft us to regions of eternal peace where bliss and virtue grow with like increase from strength to strength our souls for ever guide through wondrous scenes of being yet untried where in each stage we shall more perfect grow and new perfections new delights bestow oh would mankind but make these truths their guide and force the helm from prejudice and pride were once these maxims fixed that gods our friend virtue our good and happiness our end how soon must reason over the world prevail and error fraud and superstition fail none would hereafter then with groundless fear describe the almighty cruel and severe predestinating some without pretense to heaven and some to hell for no offense inflicting endless pains for transient crimes and favoring sects or nations men or times to please him none would foolishly forbear or food or rest or itch in shirts of hair or deem it merit to believe or teach what reason contradicts or cannot reach none would fierce zeal for piety mistake or malice for whatever tenets sake or think salvation to one sect confined and heaven too narrow to contain mankind no more then nymphs by long neglect grown nice would in one female frailty sum up vice and censure those who nearer to the right think virtue is but to dispense delight no servile tenets would admittance find destructive of the rights of humankind of power divine hereditary right and nonresistance to a tyrants might for sure that all should thus for one be cursed is but great natures edict just reversed no moralists then righteous to excess would show fair virtue in so black a dress that they like boys who some feigned spright array first from the spectre fly themselves away no preachers in the terrible delight but choose to win by reason not affright not conjurers like in fire and brimstone dwell and draw each moving argument from hell no more our sage interpreters of laws would fatten on obscurities and flaws but rather nobly careful of their trust strive to wipe off the longcontracted dust and be like hardwicke guardians of the just no more applause would on ambition wait and laying waste the world be counted great but one goodnatured act more praises gain than armies overthrown and thousands slain no more would brutal rage disturb our peace but envy hatred war and discord cease our own and others good each hour employ and all things smile with universal joy virtue with happiness her consort joined would regulate and bless each human mind and man be what his maker first designed the female drum or the origin of cards a tale addressed to the honorable miss carpenter thou whom to counsel is to praise with candor view these friendly lays nor from the vice of gaming free believe the satire points at thee who truth and worth betimes can prize nor yet too sprightly to be wise but hear this tale of ancient time nor think it vain though told in rhyme elate with wideextended power sworn rivals from the natal hour avarice and sloth with hostile art contended long for womans heart she fond of wealth afraid of toil still shifted the capricious smile by turns to each the heart was sold now bought with ease and now with gold scarce either grasp the sovereign sway when chance reversed the prosperous day the doubtful strife was still renewed each baffled often but never subdued when avarice showed the glittering prize and hopes and fears began to rise sloth shed on every busy sense the gentle balm of indolence when sloth had screend with artful night the soft pavilion of delight stern avarice with reproachful frown would scatter thorns amongst her down thus each by turns the realm controlled which each in turn despaired to hold at length unable to contend they join to choose a common friend to close in love the long debate such love as mutual fears create a friend they chose a friend to both of avarice born and nursed by sloth an artful nymph whose reign began when wisdom ceased to dwell with man in wisdoms aweful robes arrayed she rules over politics and trade and by the name of cunning known makes wealth and fame and power her own in quest of cunning then they rove over all the windings of the grove where twining boughs their shade unite for cunning ever flies the light at length through maze perplexed with maze through tracts confused and private ways with sinking hearts and weary feet they gain their favrites dark retreat there watchful at the gate they find suspicion with her eyes behind and wild alarm awaking blows the trump that shakes the worlds repose the guests well known salute the guard the hundred gates are soon unbarrd through half the gloomy cave they press and reach the wily queens recess

more be foes this hour she cries your discord ends henceforth be sloth and avarice friends henceforth with equal pride prepare to rule at once the captive fair the attentive powers in silence heard nor uttered what they hoped or feared but search in vain the dark decree for cunning loves obscurity nor would she soon her laws explain for cunning ever joys to pain she then before their wondering eyes bid piles of painted paper rise search now these heaps she cries here find fit emblem of your power combined the heap to avarice first she gave who soon descried her darling knave and sloth ere envy long could sting with joyful eyes beheld a king these gifts said cunning bear away sure engines of despotick sway these charms dispense over all the ball secure to rule wherever they fall the love of cards let sloth infuse the love of money soon ensues the strong desire shall never decay who plays to win shall win to play the breast where love has planned his reign shall burn unquenchd with lust of gain and all the charms that wit can boast in dreams of better luck be lost thus neither innocent nor gay the useless hours shall fleet away while time oerlooks the trivial strife and scoffing shakes the sands of life till the wan maid whose early bloom the vigils of quadrille consume exhausted by the pangs of play to sloth and avarice falls a prey to mr fox written at florence in

and make a wretch thy friend if over the mountains snowy height we stray where carthage first explored the venurous way or through the tainted air of romes parched plains where want resides and

desert the wood to imitate the whale and range the flood or will the mole her native earth forsake in wanton madness to explore the lake yet man whom still ideal profit sways than those less prudent and more blind than these will quit his home and venurous brave the seas and when his rashness its desert has found the fool surviving weeps the fool that is drowned herds range the fields the feathered kind the grove choose woo caress and with promiscuous love as taste and nature prompt adhere or rove they meet with pleasure and with ease they part for beasts are only coupled by the heart the body still accompanies the mind and when this wanders that is unconfined the love that joined the sated pair once fled they change their haunts their pasture and their bed no fourleggd idiots drag with mutual pain the natural cement passed an artful chain the effect of passion ceases with the cause clogged with no afterweight of forms or laws to no dull rules of custom they submit like us they cool but when they cool they quit nor find we in the wood the sea or plain one ever elected over the rest to reign if any rule it is force that gives the law what brutes are bound in voluntary awe do they like us a pageant idol raise swollen with false pride and flattered by false praise do they their equal sometimes less revere at once detest and serve despise and fear to strength inferior do they bend the knee with ears and eyes of others hear and see or ever vest a mortal god with power to do those wrongs they afterward deplore these institutions are of man alone marriage and monarchy are both our own public oppression and domestic strife are ills which we ourselves annexed to life god never made a husband king or wife boast then oh man thy profitable gain to folly polished civilized to pain here would i launch into the various field of all the cares our prejudices yield what multiplied examples might be told of pains they give and joys that they withold when to credulity tradition preaches and ignorance practices what error teaches would any feathered maiden of the wood or scaly female of the peopled flood when lust and hunger called its force resist in abstinence or chastity persist and cry if heavens intent was understood these tastes were only given to be withstood or would they wisely both these gifts improve and eat when hungry and when amorous love yet superstition in religions name with future punishment and present shame can fright weak woman from her lovers arms who weeps with mutual pain her useless charms whilst she poor wretch consumed in secret fires with power to seize foregoes what she desires till beauty fades and inclination dies and the fair tree the fruit ungatherd dies but are these ills the ills which heaven designed are we unfortunate or are we blind if in possession of our wishes cursed bathed in untasted springs we die with thirst if we make miseries what were blessings meant and benefits convert to punishment when in the spring the wise industrious bees collect the various bloom from fragrant trees extract the liquid sweet of every flower and cull the garden to enrich their store should any pedant be of all the hive from this or that perfume the plundrers drive and say that he by inspiration knows the sacred tempting interdicting rose by heavens command though sweetest useless grows think you the fool would ever be obeyed and that the lie would grow into a trade even turks would answer no  and yet we see the vine that rose and mahomet that be to these how many proofs i yet could add that mans superior sense is being mad that none refining their true interest view but for the substance still the shade pursue that often perverse and prodigal of life our power and will at everlasting strife we waste the present for the future hour and miserlike by hoarding still are poor or foolishly regretful of the past the good which yet remains neglect to taste nor need i any foreign proof to bring myself an instance of the truths i sing whilst in a court repugnant to my taste from my loved friend these precious hours i waste why do i vainly here thy absence mourn and not anticipate thy wished return why stay my passage to those happy fields where fate in thee my every pleasure yields fortune allows the blessings i refuse and even this moment were my heart to choose for thee i should forsake this joyless crowd and not on paper think but think aloud with thy loved converse fill the shortened day and glad my soul  yet here unpleasd i stay and by mean sanguine views of interest swayed by airy hopes to real cares betrayed lament a grievance which i might redress and wish that happiness i might possess the poets prayer if ever in thy sight i found favor apollo

who hear and receive but will do nothing for thee from being caressed to be left in the lurch the tool of a party in state or in church from dull thinking blockheads as sober as turks and petulant bards who repeat their own works from all the gay things of a drawing room show the sight of a belle and the smell of a beau from busy backbiters and tatlers and carpers and scurvy acquaintance of fiddlers and sharpers from old politicians and coffeehouse lectures the dreams of a chemist and schemes of projectors from the fears of a jail and the hopes of a pension the tricks of a gamester and oaths of an ensign from shallow freethinkers in taverns disputing nor ever confuted nor ever confuting from the constant good fare of another mans board my ladys broad hints and the jests of my lord from hearing old chemists prelecting de olco and reading of dutch commentators in folio from waiting like gay whole years at white hall from the pride of gay wits and the envy of small from very fine ladies with very fine incomes which they finely lay out on fine toys and fine trincums from the pranks of ridottoes and courtmasquerades the snares of young jilts and the spite of old maids from a

country cure that living interment with a wife and no prospect of any preferment from scribbling for hire when my credit is sunk to buy a new coat and to line an old trunk from squires who divert us with jokes at their tables of hounds in their kennels and nags in their stables from the nobles and commons who bound in strict league are to subscribe for no book yet subscribe to heidegger from the cant of fanatics the jargon of schools the censures of wisemen and praises of fools from critics who never read latin or greek and pedants who boast they read both all the week from borrowing wit to

without the pain within pleasure and you were both so near allied that when i lost the one the other died pain too has lavished all her killing store nor can she add nor can i suffer more in vain i viewed you with as chaste a fire as angels mingle or as saints admire by reason prompted passion had no part a virtuous ardour that refined the heart in vain i sought a friendship free from fault where sex and beauty were alike forgot a friendship by the noblest union joined the female softness and the manly mind courage to conquer evils or endure sweetness to sooth the pain and smiles to cure scandal a busy fiend in truths disguise like fame all covered over with ears and eyes learns the fond tale and spreads it as she flies nor spreads alone but alters adds defames affects to pity though her duty blames feigns not to credit all she sees or hears but hopes the evil only in her fears pretends to weigh the fact in even scale and wish at least that justice may prevail insinuates dissembles lies betrays plays the whole hypocrite such various ways that innocence itself must suffer wrong and honor bleed the prey of slanders tongue such is my fate so grievous my distress condemned to suffer but denied redress too fond of joy too sensible of pain to part with all that is dear and not complain too delicate to injure what i love to ask the pity fame will never approve what more remains then but to drop my claim and by my conduct justify my flame burst the dear bands that to my heart strings join and sacrifice my peace to purchase thine as the fond mother who delirious eyes her dying babe will scarce believe it dies but strains it still with transport in her arms dwells on its lips and numbers over its charms pleads that it slumbers and expects in vain to see the little cherub live again so my torn heart must all the sorrows prove that torture constancy or sadden love yet fondly follow your dear image still fancy i hear you speak i see you smile dote on a phantom idolize the name and wish the shade and substance were the same alas how fruitless is the idle prayer the joys imagined real the despair like adam forced his eden to forego i lose my only

diverse high crimes and misdemeanors the court was met the prisoner brought the council with instruction fraught and evidence prepared at large on oath to vindicate the charge but first it is meet where form denies poetic helps of fancied lies gay metaphors and figures fine and similes to deck the line it is meet as we before have said to call description to our aid begin we then as first it is fitting with the three chiefs in judgment sitting above the rest and in the chair sat faction with dissembled air her tongue was skilled in specious lies and murmurs whence dissentions rise a smiling mask her features veiled her form the patriots robe concealed with studied blandishments she bowed and drew the captivated crowd the next in place and on the right sat envy hideous to the sight her snaky locks her hollow eyes and haggard form forbad disguise pale discontent and sullen hate upon her wrinkled forehead sat her left hand clenchd her cheek sustained her right with many a murder stained a dagger clutchd in act to strike with starts of rage and aim oblique last on the left was clamor seen of stature vast and horrid mien with bloated cheeks and frantic eyes she sent her yellings to the skies prepared with trumpet in her hand to blow sedition over the land with these four more of lesser fame and humbler rank attendant came hypocrisy with smiling grace and impudence with brazen face contention bold with iron lungs and slander with her hundred tongues the walls in sculptured tale were rich and statues proud in many a nich of chiefs who fought in factions cause and perished for contempt of laws the roof in varied light and shade the seat of anarchy displayed triumphant over a falling throne by emblematick figure known confusion raged and lust obscene and riot with distempered mien and outrage bold and mischief dire and devastation clad in fire prone on the ground a martial maid expiring lay and groaned for aid her shield with many a stab was pierced her laurels torn her spear reversed and near her crouchd amidst the spoils a lion painted in the toils with look composed the prisoner stood and modest pride by turns he viewed the court the council and the crowd and with submissive reverence bowed proceed we now in humbler strains and lighter rhymes with what remains the indictment grievously set forth that selim lost to truth and worth in company with one will p  t and many more not taken yet in fortyfive the royal palace did enter and to shame grown callous did then and there his faith forsake and did accept receive and take with mischievous intent and base value unknown a certain place he was a second time indicted for that by evil zeal excited with learning more than laymans share which parsons want and he might spare in letter to one gilbert west he the said selim did attest maintain support and make assertion of certain points from pauls conversion by means whereof the said apostle did many an unbeliever jostle starting unfashionable fancies and building truths on known romances a third charge run that knowing well wits only eat as pamphlets sell he the said selim notwithstanding did fall to answring shaming branding three curious letters to the whigs making no reader care three figs for any facts contained therein by which uncharitable sin an author modest and deserving was destined to contempt and starving against the king his crown and peace and all the statutes in that case the pleader rose with brief full charged and on the prisners crimes enlarged  but not to damp the muses fire with rhetrick such as courts require well try to keep the reader warm and sift the matter from the form virtue and social love he said and honor from the land were fled that patriots now like other folks were made the butt of vulgar jokes while opposition dropped her crest and courted power for wealth and rest why some folks laughed and some folks railed why some submitted some assailed angry or pleased  all solved the doubt with who were in and who were out the sons of clamor grew so sickly they looked for dissolution quickly their weekly journals finely written were sunk in privies all besh  n oldengland and the londonevening hardly a soul was found believing in and caleb once so bold and strong was stupid now and always wrong ask ye whence rose this foul disgrace why selim has received a place and thereby brought the cause to shame proving that people void of blame might serve their country and their king by making both the selfsame thing by which the credulous believed and others by strange arts deceived that ministers were sometimes right and meant not to destroy us quite that bartring thus in state affairs he next must deal in sacred wares the clergys rights divine invade and smuggle in the gospeltrade and all this zeal to reinstate exploded notions out of date sending old rakes to church in shoals like children snivling for their souls and ladies gay from smut and libels to learn beliefs and read their bibles erecting conscience for a tutor to damn the present by the future as if to evils known and real twas needful to annex ideal when all of human life we know is care and bitterness and woe with short transitions of delight to set the shattered spirits right then why such mighty pains and care to make us humbler than we are forbidding short lived mirth and laughter by fears of what may come hereafter better in ignorance to dwell none fear but who believe an hell and if there should be one no doubt men of themselves would find it out but selims crimes he said went further and barely stopped on this side murder one yet remained to close the charge to which with leave he would speak at large and first twas needful to premise that though so long for reasons wise the press inviolate had stood productive of the public good yet still too modest to abuse it railed at vice but told not whose that great improvements of late days were made to many an authors praise who not so scrupulously nice proclaimed the person with the vice or gave where vices might he wanted the name and took the rest for granted upon this plan a champion author of the letters to the whigs rose unrighteous greatness to oppose proving the man inventus non est who trades in power and still is honest and god be praised he did it roundly flogging a certain junto soundly but chief his anger was directed where people least of all suspected and selim not so strong as tall beneath his grasp appeared to fall but innocence as people say stood by and saved him in the fray by her assisted and one truth a busy prating forward youth he rallied all his strength anew and at the foe a letter threw his weakest part the weapon found and brought him senseless to the ground hence opposition fled the field and ignorance with her sevnfold shield and well they might for things weighed fully the prisoner with his whore and bully must prove for every foe too hard who never fought with such a guard but truth and innocence he said would stand him here in little stead for they had evidence on oath that would appear too hard for both of witnesses a fearful train came next the indictments to sustain detraction hatred and distrust and party of all foes the worst malice revenge and unbelief and disappointment worn with grief dishonor foul unawed by shame and every fiend that vice can name all these in ample form deposed each fact the triple charge disclosed with taunts and gibes of bitter sort and asking vengeance from the court the prisoner said in his defense that he indeed had small pretense to soften facts so deeply sworn but would for his offenses mourn yet more he hoped than bare repentance might still be urged to ward the sentence that he had held a place some years he owned with penitence and tears but took it not from motives base the indictment there mistook the case and though he had betrayed his trust in being to his country just neglecting faction and her friends he did it not for wicked ends but that complaints and feuds might cease and jarring parties mix in peace that what he wrote to gilbert west bore hard against him he confessed yet there they wronged him for the fact is he reasoned for belief not practice and people might believe he thought though practice might be deemed a fault he either dreamt it or was told religion was revered of old that it gave breeding no offense and was no foe to wit and sense but whether this was truth or whim he would not say the doubt with him and no great harm he hoped was how the enlightened world would take it now if they admitted it twas well if not he never talked of hell nor even hoped to change mens measures or frighten ladies from their pleasures one accusation he confessed had touched him more than all the rest three patriotletters high in fame by him overthrown and brought to shame and though it was a rule in vogue if one man called another rogue the party injured might reply and on his foe retort the lie yet what accrud from all his labor but foul dishonor to his neighbor and he is a most unchristian elf who others damns to save himself besides as all men knew he said these letters only railed for bread and hunger was a known excuse for prostitution and abuse a guinea properly applied had made the writer change his side he wished he had not cut and carved him and owned he should have bought not starved him the court he said knew all the rest and must proceed as they thought best only he hoped such resignation would plead some little mitigation and if his character was clear from other faults and friends were near who would when called upon attest it he did in hamblest form request it to be from punishment exempt and only suffer their contempt the prisners friends their claim preferred in turn demanding to be heard integrity and honor swore benevolence and twenty more that he was always of their party and that they knew him firm and hearty religion sober dame attended and as she could his cause befriended she said twas since she came from college she knew him introduced by knowledge the man was modest and sincere nor farther could she interfere the muses begged to interpose but envy with loud hissings rose and called them women of ill fame liars and prostitutes to shame and said to all the world twas known selim had had them every one the prisoner blushed the muses frowned when silence was proclaimed around and faction rising with the rest in form the prisoner thus addressed you selim thrice have been indicted first that by wicked pride excited and bent your country to disgrace you have received and held a place next infidelity to wound you have dared with arguments profound to drive freethinking to a stand and with religion vex the land and lastly in contempt of right with horrid and unnatral spite you have an authors same overthrown thereby to build and fence your own these crimes successive on your trial have met with proofs beyond denial to which yourself with shame conceded and but in mitigation pleaded yet that the justice of the court may suffer not in mens report judgment a moment i suspend to reason as from friend to friend and first that you of all mankind with kings and courts should stain your mind you who were oppositions lord her nerves her sinews and her sword that you at last for servile ends should wound the bowels of her friends  is aggravation of offense that leaves for mercy no pretense yet more  for you to urge your hate and back the church to aid the state for you to publish such a letter you who have known religion better for you i say to introduce the fraud again  there is no excuse and last of all to crown your shame was it for you to load with blame the writings of a patriotyouth and summon innocence and truth to prop your cause  was this for you  but justice does your crimes pursue and sentence now alone remains which thus by me the court ordains that you return from whence you came there to be stripped of all your fame by vulgar hands that once a week oldengland pinch you till you squeak that ribbald pamphlets do pursue you and lies and murmurs to undo you with every foe that worth procures and only virtues friends be yours the trophy being six cantatas to the honor of his royal highness willliam duke of cumberland expressing the just sense of a grateful nation in the several characters of the

the lovely rose the gardens queen companion of this shrub was seen the lilly fair the violet blue the eglantine beside her grew the woodbines arms did round her twine with the pale genteel jessamine with here is the tuberose mixed her sweet the flowers were gracious she discreet the envious shrub with some regret saw all her friends in wedlock met up the tall elm the woodbine swarms and twines her marriageable arms a gorgeous bower the jessmine chose the glory of some ancient house with joy she views the shortlived maid the violet drooping in the shade and sees which pleased her to the quick the lilly hug a sapless stick and must myrtilla still be seen pining in sickness evergreen shall she  with that she armed her brow which once had conquests gained but now  too old to choose too proud to sue strikes flag to her good cousin yew this yew was fair and large and good esteemed a pretty stick of wood but never in the garden placed or to be borne by nymphs of taste but in a wilderness or waste and cut and clip whatever you do this pretty stick was still but yew the poisonous drops the baleful shade struck each genteeler flower dead but myrtle being evergreen thought nature taught to wed her kin and careless of the event withdrew from her old friends and sought her yew behold the amorous shrub transplanted and her last prayer in vengeance granted the bride and bridegroom cling together enjoy the fair and scorn foul weather visits are paid around are seen the scrubbed race of evergreen the illnatured holly ragged box and yews own family in flocks but not a flower of scent or flavor would do the bride so great a favor but in contempt drew in their leaves and shrunk away as sensitives the blushing the rose queen with decent pride turned as she passed her head aside the lilly nice was like to spue to see myrtilla mrs yew the eglantine a prude by nature would never go anear the creacher and the gay woodbine gave a flaunt nor answered her but with a taunt poor myrtle strangely mortified too late resumes her proper pride which heightened now by pique and spleen paints her condition doubly mean she sourd her mind grew brokenhearted and soon this spiteful world departed and now lies decently interred near the old yew in  churchyard on a bayleaf plucked from virgils tomb near naples      by the same bold was the irreligious hand that could all reverence withstand and sacrilegiously presume to rob the poets sacred tomb of so much honorable shade as this so small a trophy made could dare to pluck from virgils brow the honors nature did bestow pascua sweetly the gentle goddess smiled and listened to her favorite child whether in shepherds cleanly weed he deftly tuned his oaten reed and taught the vocal woods around his amaryllis to resound rura or taught he in a graver strain to cloth the field with waving grain and in the marriagefolds to twine the barren elm and clustered vine to yoke the laboring ox to breed to the known goal the foaming steed and sung the manners rights degrees and labors of the frugal bees duces or whether with aeneas name he swelled the extended cheek of fame and all his godlike labors sung whence romes extended glories sprung the goddess smiled and owned she knew the original from whence he drew and grateful she spontaneous gave this living honor to his grave hail thou sweet shade whose revrencd name still foremost in the mouth of fame does preference and value give and teach this little leaf to live methinks secluded from that brow where grateful nature bad it grow this beauteous green should fade away and yield to irontoothd decay but virgils name forbids that crime and blunts the threatening scythe of time to chloe written on my birthday      by the same the minutes the hours the days and the years that fill up the current of time neither flowing with hopes neither ebbing with fears unheeded rolled on to my prime in infancy prattling in youth full of play still pleased with whatever was new i bad the old cripple fly swifter away to overtake some gay trifle in view but when chloe with sweetness and sense in her look first taught me the lesson of love then i counted each

passions rage obstructed in their course swell to new heights forbidden paths explore and drown those virtues which they fed before and sure the dreadliest foe to virtues flame our worst of evils is perverted shame beneath this load what abject numbers groan the entangled slaves to folly not their own meanly by fashionable fear oppressed we seek our virtues in each others breast blind to ourselves adopt each foreign vice anothers weakness interest or caprice each fool to low ambition poorly great that pines in splendid wretchedness of state tired in the treacherous chase would nobly yield and but for shame like sylla quit the field the demon shame paints strong the ridicule and whispers close the world will call you fool behold yon wretch by impious fashion driven believes and trembles while he scoffs at heaven by weakness strong and bold through fear alone he dreads the sneer by shallow coxcombs thrown dauntless pursues the path spinoza trod to man a coward and a brave to

virtue but his pride hence chaste lucretias innocence betrayed fell by that honor which was meant its aid thus virtue sinks beneath unnumberd woes when passions born her friends revolt her foes hence satires power it is her corrective part to calm the wild disorders of the heart she points the arduous height where glory lies and teaches mad ambition to be wise in the dark bosom wakes the fair desire draws good from ill a brighter flame from fire strips black oppression of her gay disguise and bids the hag in native horror rise strikes towering pride and lawless rapine dead and plants the wreath on virtues aweful head nor boasts the muse a vain imagined power though often she mourn those ills she cannot cure the worthy court her and the worthless fear who shun her piercing eye that eye revere her aweful voice the vain and vile obey and every foe to wisdom feel her sway smarts pedants as she smiles no more are vain desponding fops resign the clouded cane hushed at her voice pert follys self is still and dullness wonders while she drops her quill alluding to these lines of mr pope in the nice be what art so subtly true from poisonous herbs extracts a healing dew  like the armed be with art most subtly true from poisonous vice she draws a healing dew weak are the ties that civil arts can find to quell the ferment of the tainted mind cunning evades securely wrapped in wiles and force strongsinewd rends the unequal toils the stream of vice impetuous drives along too deep for policy for power too strong even fair religion native of the skies scorned by the crowd seeks refuge with the wise the crowd with laughter spurns her aweful train and mercy courts and justice frowns in vain but satires shaft can pierce the hardened breast she plays a ruling passion on the rest undaunted mounts the battery of his pride and awes the brave that earth and heaven defied when fell corruption by her vassals crowned derides fallen justice prostrate on the ground swift to redress an injured peoples groan bold satire shakes the tyrant on her throne powerful as death defies the sordid train and slaves and sycophants surround in vain but with the friends of vice the foes of satire all truth is spleen all just reproof ill nature well may they dread the muses fatal skill well may they tremble when she draws her quill her magic quill that like ithuriels spear reveals the cloven hoof or lengthened ear bids vice and folly take their natural shapes turns duchesses to strumpets beaux to apes drags the vile whisperer from his dark abode till all the demon starts up from the toad o sordid maxim formed to screen the vile that true goodnature still must wear a smile in frowns arrayed her beauties stronger rise when love of virtue wakes her scorn of vice where justice calls it is cruelty to save and it is the laws goodnature hangs the knave who combats virtues foe is virtues friend then judge of satires merit by her end to guilt alone her vengeance stands confined the object of her love is all mankind scarce more the friend of man the wise must own even allens bounteous hand than satires frown this to chastise as that to bless was given alike the faithful ministers of heaven often on unfeeling hearts the shaft is spent though strong the example weak the punishment they least are pained who merit satire most folly the laureats vice was chartres boast then where is the wrong to gibbet high the name of fools and knaves already dead to shame often satire acts the faithful surgeons part generous and kind though painful is her art with caution bold she only strikes to heal though folly raves to break the friendly steel then sure no fault impartial satire knows kind even in vengeance kind to virtues foes whose is the crime the scandal too be theirs the knave and fool are their own libellers part ii dare nobly then but conscious of your trust as ever warm and bold be ever just nor court applause in these degenerate days the villains censure is extorted praise but chief be steady in a noble end and show mankind that truth has yet a friend it is mean for empty praise of wit to write as foplings grin to show their teeth are white to brand a doubtful folly with a smile or madly blaze unknown defects is vile it is doubly vile when but to prove your art you fix an arrow in a blameless heart o lost to honors voice o doomed to shame thou fiend accursed thou murderer of fame fell ravisher from innocence to tear that name than liberty than life more dear where shall thy baseness meet its just return or what repay thy guilt but endless scorn and know immortal truth shall mock thy toil immortal truth shall bid the shaft recoil with rage retorted wing the deadly dart and empty all its poison in thy heart with caution next the dangerous power apply an eagles talon asks an eagles eye let satire then her proper object know and ere she strike be sure she strikes a foe nor fondly deem the real fool confessed because blind ridicule conceives a jest before whose altar virtue often has bled and often a destined victim shall be led lo it were to be wished that lord shaftsbury had expressed himself with greater precision on this subject however thus much may be affirmed with truth   st by the general tenor of his essays on enthusiasm and the freedom of wit and humor it appears that his principal design was to recommend the way of ridicule as he calls it for the investigation of truth and detection of falsehood not only in moral but religious subjects   dly it appears no less evident that in the course of his reasonings on this question he confounds two things which are in their nature and consequences entirely different these are ridicule and good humor the latter acknowledged by all to be the best mediator in every debate the former no less regarded by most as an embroiler and incendiary though he sets out with a formal profession of proving the efficacy of wit humor and ridicule in the investigation of truth yet by shifting and mixing his terms he generally slides insensibly into mere encomiums on goodbreeding cheerfulness urbanity and free enquiry this indeed keeps something like an argument on foot and amuses the superficial reader but to a more observant eye discovers a very contemptible defect either of sincerity or penetration  the question concerning ridicule may be thus not improperly stated whether doubtful propositions of any kind can be determined by the application of ridicule much might be said on this question but a few words will make the matter clear to an unprejudiced mind  the disapprobation or contempt which certain objects raise in the mind of man is a particular mode of passion the objects of this passion are apparent falsehood incongruity or impropriety of some particular kinds thus the object of fear is apparent danger the object of anger is apparent injury but who has ever dreamt of exalting the passions of fear and anger into a standard or test of real danger and injury the design must have been rejected as absurd because it is the work of reason only to correct and fix the passions on their proper objects the case is parallel apparent or seeming falsehoods etc are the objects of contempt but it is the work of reason only to determine whether the supposed falsehood be real or fictitious but it is said the sense of ridicule can never be mistaken  why no more can the sense of danger or the sense of injury  what do men never fear or resent without reason  yes very commonly but they as often despise and laugh without reason thus before any thing can be determined in either case reason and reason only must examine circumstances separate ideas decide upon restrain and correct the passion  hence it follows that the way of ridicule of late so much celebrated is in fact no more than a species of eloquence and that too the lowest of all others so tully justly calls it tenuissimus ingenii fructus it applies to a passion and therefore can go no farther in the investigation of truth than any of those arts which tend to raise love pity terror rage or hatred in the heart of man consequently his lordship might have transplanted the whole system of rhetoric into his new scheme with the same propriety as he has introduced the way of ridicule itself a hopeful project this for the propagation of truth  as this seems to be the real nature of ridicule it has been generally discouraged by philosophers and divines together with every other mode of eloquence when applied to controverted opinions this discouragement from what is said above appears to have been rational and just therefore the charge laid against divines with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of lord shaftsbury see a note on the pleasures of imagination book iii seems entirely groundless the distinction which the same author has attempted with respect to the influence of ridicule between speculative and moral truths seems no better founded it is certain that opinions are no less liable to ridicule than actions and it is no less certain that the way of ridicule cannot determine the propriety or impropriety of the one more than the truth or falsehood of the other because the same passion of contempt is equally engaged in both cases and therefore as above reason only can examine the circumstances of the action or opinion and thus fix the passion on its proper objects  upon the whole this new design of discovering truth by the vague and unsteady light of ridicule puts one in mind of the honest irishman who applied his candle to the sundial in order to see how the night went   shaftsbry rears her high on reasons throne and loads the slave with honors not her own bigswoln with folly as her smiles provoke profaneness spawns pert dunces nurse the joke come let us join awhile this tittering crew and own the idiot guide for once is true deride our weak forefathers musty rule who therefore smiled because they saw a fool sublimer logic now adorns our isle we therefore see a fool because we smile truth in her gloomy cave why fondly seek lo gay she sits in laughters dimpled cheek contemns each surly academic foe and courts the spruce freethinker and the beau daedalian arguments but few can trace but all can read the language of grimace hence mighty ridicules allconquring hand shall work herculean wonders through the land bound in the magic of her cobweb chain you mighty warburton shall rage in vain in the vain trackless maze of truth you scan and lend the informing clue to erring man no more shall reason boast her power divine her base eternal shook by follys mine truths sacred fort the exploded laugh shall win and coxcombs vanquish berkley by a grin but you more sage reject the inverted rule that truth is ever explored by ridicule on truth on falsehood let her colors fall she throws a dazzling glare alike on all as the gay prism but mocks the flattered eye and gives to every object every dye beware the mad adventrer bold and blind she hoists her sail and drives with every wind deaf as the storm to sinking virtues groan nor heeds a friends destruction or her own let cleareyd reason at the helm preside bear to the wind or stem the furious tide then mirth may urge when reason can explore this point the way that waft us glad to shore though distant times may rise in satires page yet chief it is here is to draw the present age with wisdoms luster follys shade contrast and judge the reigning manners by the past bid britains heroes aweful shades arise and ancient honor beam

sharpers only dared a lie or falsifyd the card or coggd the dye ere lewdness the stained garb of honor wore or chastity was carted for the whore vice fluttered in the plumes of freedom dressed or

mirth be temperate temperate in her spleen nor while she preaches modesty obscene deep let her wound not rankle to a sore nor call his lordship  her grace a  the muses charms resistless then assail

chaste dart not on folly an indignant eye who ever discharged artillery on a fly deride not vice absurd the thought and vain to bind the tiger in so weak a chain nay more when flagrant crimes your laughter move the knave exults to smile is to approve the muse labor then success shall crown when folly feels her smile and vice her frown know next what measures to each theme belong and suit your thoughts and numbers to your song on wing proportioned to your quarry rise and stoop to earth or soar among the skies thus when a modish folly you rehearse free the expression simple be the verse in artless numbers paint the ambitious peer that mounts the box and shines a charioteer in strains familiar sing the midnight toil of camps and senates disciplined by hoyle patriots and chiefs whose deep design invades and carries off the captive king of  spades let satire here in milder vigor shine and gayly graceful sport along the line bid courtly fashion quit her thin pretense and smile each affectation into sense not so when virtue by her guards betrayed spurned from her throne implores the muses aid when crimes which erst in kindred darkness lay rise frontless and insult the eye of day indignant hymen veils his hallowed fires and whiterobd chastity with tears retires when rank adultery on the genial bed hot from cocytus rears her baleful head when private faith and public trust are sold and traitors barter liberty for gold when fell corruption dark and deep like fate saps the foundation of a sinking state when giantvice and irreligion rise on mountaind falsehoods to invade the skies then warmer numbers glow through satires page and all her smiles are darkened into rage on eaglewing she gains parnassus height not lofty epic soars a nobler flight then keener indignation fires her eye then flash her lightnings and her thunders fly wide and more wide her flaming bolts are hurled till all her wrath involves the guilty world yet satire often assumes a gentler mien and beams on virtues friends a look serene she wounds reluctant pours her balm and joy glad to commend where merit strikes her eye but tread with cautious step this dangerous ground beset with faithless precipices round truth be your guide disdain ambitions call and if you fall with truth you greatly fall it is virtues native luster that must shine the poet can but set it in his line and who unmoved with laughter can behold a sordid pebble meanly graced with gold let real merit then adorn your lays for shame a tends on prostituted praise and all your wit your most distinguished art but makes us grieve you want an honest heart nor think the muse by satires law confined she yields description of the noblest kind inferior art the landscape may design and paint the purple evening in the line her daring thought essays a higher plan her hand delineates passion pictures man and great the toil the latent soul to trace to paint the heart and catch internal grace by turns bid vice or virtue strike our

canvass glow of light and shade provoke the noble strife and wake each striking feature into life part iii through ages thus has satire keenly shined the friend to truth to virtue and mankind yet the bright flame from virtue never had sprung and man was guilty ere the poet sung this muse in silence joyd each better age till glowing crimes had waked her into rage truth saw her honest spleen with
