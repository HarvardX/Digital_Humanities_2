the state of the excise after the union compared with what it is now  printed in the year mdccvi  the state of the excise after the union compared with what it is now the burden of the english taxes industriously buzzed about into the ears of the commonalty by such as upon other views were prejudiced against the present treaty of union has no doubt contributed in a great measure to work them into so general a ferment against it their weakness and incapacity to inquire into and examine these matters joined with some mean prejudices from the fear of losing the crown and the like made them a subject very easy to be wrought upon this way  that the design might have the better success all methods have been used to scrue up these burdens to extravagant heights that their appearance might be more frightful it cannot be denied that in an affair of this moment to set matters in their due light was the duty of every person that ventured to give the public his opinion but to fish for ways to magnify things seems to have had some other end than the real service of the nation  to give a fair and distinct view and to rectify mistakes as to these on liquors is the design of the following sheet for understanding of which the reader is desired to be informed of the following particulars    the english barrel of beer or ale containing    english gallons by stat   w and m cap    contains    gallons scots   every such barrel of above   shillings value pays of excise   lib    shil scots   every such barrel of   shillings value or under pays of excise    shil scots   of every    such barrels there is an allowance of   barrels or an   th part for leakage   after deduction of an   th part as the allowance for leakage the excise of   scots pint of ale above   shill value is scarce   pennies scots and a half or    pennies on the gallon   after deduction of the allowance above the excise of   scots gallon of ale at   shillings value or under is not full    pennies per gallon but for easier counting shall be supposed    pennies or   pennies per pint   the excise in scotland is   pennies on the pint without distinction   the town of edinburgh leith glasgow and some others have grants of a duty of   pennies on the pint of ale vended in their privileges   the brewer allows the retailer   pint to every gallon and   barrel to every  0 for which profits some sell at the price they lay at  0 the retailer pays  0 pennies for the ale sold ordinarily at   shil scots    ale above   pennies scots per scots pint of nea and clear value to the brewer will fall under the excise of strong ale  order to discover which value with regard to our present two penny ale the following compute will direct price of a pint of two penny ale to the brewer  0 pennies deduce on account of the barrel to the score   penny on account of the pint to the gallon   penny for the excise to the queen   pennies in edinburgh etc for the towns duty   pennies total to be deduced   penny rests the clear price of  pint of two penny ale to the brewer    penny this ale being above   shil sterling value the  gallons add to the foresaid price the excise of strong ale   penny summa is    pennies add   pennies for the barrel to the score and the pint the to gallon   pennies the brewers price from the retailer is    pennies allowing the retailer the common profit of d   pennies then ale of the goodness of the present edinburgh two penny ale might in the country be sold at    pennies in edinburgh by the foresaid calcul adding the towns duty the brewer would sell such ale without allowances at  0 pennies and with allowances computed at   pennies at    pennies thus the retailer would sell such ale at    pennies or for more easy division at    pennies  by the above calcul it appears how little ground there is for the common report spread about the country o our two penny ale being doubled in its price since supposing the excise to be exacted in its rigor it hightens the price only   pennies per pint or   at most and considering that the excise in england is managed by collection t cannot be thought the surveys will be so severe as here where the farming the excise by roup screws up its price and the taxmen for their own gain squeeze the poor people to the outmost law allows if not beyond it  this being the state of the english excise with regard to ale above   sh sterling per barrel the lesser excise supposed largely to be   pennies per pint falls next to be considered as to which that we shall be easier is obvious since the smallest ale we can brew now pays   pennies per pint and ale of   pennies true price to the brewer which falls under the lesser excise not being a full fourth part weaker then the present two penny ale will be no contemptible table drink and no small ease to the poor trades people who will then find good drink for    pennies per pint whereas now none is under two pence this appears plainer by the following calcul  the brewers clear price supposed to be   pennies add the queens excise on smallbear   pennies add for the allowance to the score and gallon   pennies the brewers price to the retailer will be    pennies and allowing the retailler   pennies per pint    pennies  from these two views of the greater and lesser excise it not only appears that the greater is no such hideous monster as is commonly believed but also that taking both jointly we should be full as easy as now especially with regard to the poorer sort of people nay further we should be much easier than we have been for several years since the revolution for from the  st of june      to the  st of may      our excise was   merks per boll and   pennies per pint in all   pennies per pint only half a penny less than the english greater excise and from  st of september      to march        pennies per pint from thence to march school   pennies and from thence to march      pennies so that for a tract of   years we were under an excise near equal to the english in quantity but vastly more burdensome as will appear by the following two considerations    that the   dear years were part of these six which considering the circumstance of the poor were hard enough under any excise but this is only a temporary consideration the next is perpetual viz that we neither had then nor have now any distinction betwixt small and strong ale the consequence of which was that the brewers finding all ale equal as to excise chose rather to brew strong ale which would yield them six pennies profit per pint than small which yielded only two pennies yet paid the same excise and accordingly the ale commonly sold then was   pence per pint or   pence and a plack which the poor people behooved either to buy or drink water whereas should the brewers brew strong ale under the english excise yet there will still be good wholesome drink for the poorer sort at an easy rate by reason of the distinction of the excise  if what is here advanced be true as there is little reason to doubt since it depends on uncontraverted matters of fact and a plain and simple calcul it may seem odd that the author of the short view of our present trade and taxes page   should suppose each boll of malt will produce   sh sterling excise and should on this build his calcul of the increase of excise in case of the union no doubt a brewer for a wager may produce near   sh excise from a boll by brewing ale at  0 pennies per pint true value but he is a mad man if he does so for ordinary since had he brewed  at   pennies the excise would only be near   sh   d sterling and since we are supposing i shall suppose and make good that a brewer may bring the excise of a boll of malt to    sh and   d scots by brewing only   gallons of very strong ale from it which at   sh   d scots per gallon makes the foresaid sum but the brewer will be regula by none of our suppositions he will brew such ale as will best bear the respective excises and at the same time please his customers  finis
