an account of the voyages undertaken by the order of his present majesty for making discoveries in the southern hemisphere and successively performed by commodore byron captain wallis captain carteret and captain cook in the dolphin the swallow and the endeavor drawn up from the journals which were kept by the several commanders and from the papers of joseph banks esquire  by john hawkesworth lld  in three volumes illustrated with cuts and a great variety of charts and maps relative to countries now first discovered or hitherto but imperfectly known  vol i  london printed for w strahan and t cadell in the strand  mdcclxxiii  to the king sir after the great improvements that have been made in navigation since the discovery of america it may well be thought strange that a very considerable part of the globe on which we live should still have remained unknown that it should still have been the subject of speculation whether a great portion of the southern hemisphere is land or water and even where land had been discovered that neither its extent nor figure should have been ascertained but the cause has probably been that sovereign princes have seldom any other motive for attempting the discovery of new countries than to conquer them that the advantages of conquering countries which must first be discovered are remote and uncertain and that ambition has always found objects nearer home  it is the distinguishing characteristic of your majesty to act from more liberal motives and having the best fleet and the bravest as well as most able navigators in europe your majesty has not with a view to the acquisition of treasure or the extent of dominion but the improvement of commerce and the increase and diffusion of knowledge undertaken what has so long been neglected and under your majestys auspices in little more than seven years discoveries have been made far greater than those of all the navigators in the world collectively from the expedition of columbus to the present time  to have been appointed to record them and permitted to inscribe the narrative to your majesty is an honor the sense of which will always be retained with the warmest gratitude by  your

after his accession to the crown formed a design of sending out vessels for making discoveries of countries hitherto unknown and in the year      the kingdom being then in a state of profound peace he proceeded to put it into execution the dolphin and the tamar were dispatched under the command of commodore byron and the best account of his majestys motives and design that can be given will be found in the following preamble to commodore byrons instructions which are dated the   th of june in that year  whereas nothing can redound more to the honor of this nation as a maritime power to the dignity of the crown of great britain and to the advancement of the trade and navigation thereof than to make discoveries of countries hitherto unknown and whereas there is reason to believe that lands and islands of great extent hitherto unvisited by any european power may be found in the atlantic ocean between the cape of good hope and the magellanic straight within the latitudes convenient for navigation and in climates adapted to the produce of commodities useful in commerce and whereas his majestys islands called pepys island and falklands islands lying within the said tract notwithstanding their having been first discovered and visited by british navigators have never yet been so sufficiently surveyed as that an accurate judgment may be formed of their coasts and product his majesty taking the premises into consideration and conceiving no conjuncture so proper for an enterprise of this nature as a time of profound peace which his kingdoms at present happily enjoy has thought fit that it should now be undertaken  the dolphin was a man of war of the sixth rate mounting twentyfour guns her complement was   0 men with three lieutenants and thirtyseven petty officers  the tamar was a sloop mounting sixteen guns her complement was ninety men with three lieutenants and two and twenty petty officers and the command of her was given to captain mouat  commodore byron returned in the month of may in the year      and in the month of august following the dolphin was again sent out under the command of captain wallis with the swallow commanded by captain carteret in prosecution of the same general design of making discoveries in the southern hemisphere the equipment of the dolphin was the same as before the swallow was a sloop mounting fourteen guns her complement was ninety men with one lieutenant and twentytwo petty officers  these vessels proceeded together till they came within sight of the south sea at the western entrance of the straight of magellan and from thence returned by different routs to england  in the latter part of the year      it was resolved by the royal society that it would be proper to send persons into some part of the south sea to observe a transit of the planet venus over the suns disk which according to astronomical calculation would happen in the year      and that the islands called marquesas de mendoza or those of rotterdam or amsterdam were the properest places then known for making such observation  in consequence of these resolutions it was recommended to his majesty in a memorial from the society dated february      that he would be pleased to order such an observation to be made upon which his majesty signified to the lords commissioners of the admiralty his pleasure that a ship should be provided to carry such observers as the society should think fit to the south seas and in the beginning of april following the society received a letter from the secretary of the admiralty informing them that a bark of three hundred and seventy tons had been taken up for that purpose this vessel was called the endeavor and the command of her given to lieutenant james cook a gentleman of undoubted abilities in astronomy and navigation who was soon after by the royal society appointed with mr charles green a gentleman who had long been assistant to dr bradley at the royal observatory at greenwich to observe the transit  while this vessel was getting ready for her expedition captain wallis returned and it having been recommended to him by lord morton when he went out to fix on a proper place for this astronomical observation he by letter dated on board the dolphin the   th of may      the day before he landed at hastings mentioned port royal harbor in an island which he had discovered then called georges island and since otaheite the royal society therefore by letter dated the beginning of june in answer to an application from the admiralty to be informed whither they would have their observers sent made choice of that place  the endeavor had been built for the coal trade and a vessel of that construction was preferred for many reasons particularly because she was what the sailors call a good sea boat was more roomy would take and lie on the ground better and might be navigated by fewer men than other vessels of the same burden  her complement of officers and men was lieutenant cook the commander with two lieutenants under him a master and boatswain with each two mates a surgeon and carpenter with each one mate a gunner a cook a clerk and steward two quarter masters an armourer a sailmaker three midshipmen fortyone able seamen twelve marines and nine servants in all eightyfour persons besides the commander she was victualled for eighteen months and took on board ten carriage and twelve swivel guns with good store of ammunition and other necessaries the endeavor also after the astronomical observation should be made was ordered to prosecute the design of making discoveries in the south seas what was effected by these vessels in their several voyages will appear in the course of this work of which it is now necessary to give some account  it is drawn up from the journals that were kept by the commanders of the several ships which were put into my hands by the lords commissioners of the admiralty for that purpose and with respect to the voyage of the endeavor from other papers equally authentic an assistance which i have acknowledged in an introduction to the account of her voyage  when i first undertook the work it was debated whether it should be written in the first or third person it was readily acknowledged on all hands that a narrative in the first person would by bringing the adventurer and the reader nearer together without the intervention of a stranger more strongly excite an interest and consequently afford more entertainment but it was objected that if it was written in the name of the several commanders i could exhibit only a naked narrative without any opinion or sentiment of my own however fair the occasion and without noting the similitude or dissimilitude between the opinions customs or manners of the people now first discovered and those of nations that have been long known or remarking on any other incident or particular that might occur in answer to this objection however it was said that as the manuscript would be submitted to the gentlemen in whose names it would be written supposing the narrative to be in the first person and nothing published without their approbation it would signify little who conceived the sentiments that should be expressed and therefore i might still be at liberty to express my own in this opinion all parties acquiesced and it was determined that the narrative should be written in the first person and that i might notwithstanding intersperse such sentiments and observations as my subject should suggest they are not indeed numerous and when they occur are always cursory and short for nothing would have been more absurd than to interrupt an interesting narrative or new descriptions by hypothesis and dissertation they will however be found most frequent in the account of the voyage of the endeavor and the principal reason is that although it stands last in the series great part of it was printed before the others were written so that several remarks which would naturally have been suggested by the incidents and descriptions that would have occurred in the preceding voyages were anticipated by similar incidents and descriptions which occurred in this  some particulars that are related in one voyage will perhaps appear to be repeated in another as they would necessarily have been if the several commanders had written the account of their voyages themselves for a digest could not have been made of the whole without invading the right of each navigator to appropriate the relation of what he had seen these repetitions however taken together will be found to fill but a few pages of the book  that no doubt might remain of the fidelity with which i have related the events recorded in my materials the manuscript account of each voyage was read to the respective commanders at the admiralty by the appointment of lord sandwich who was himself present during much the greatest part of the time the account of the voyage of the endeavor was also read to mr banks and dr solander in whose hands as well as in those of captain cook the manuscript was left for a considerable time after the reading commodore byron also captain wallis and captain carteret had the manuscripts of their respective voyages to peruse after they had been read at the admiralty in their presence and such emendations as they suggested were made in order thus to authenticate the voyage of captain cook the account of it was first written because it was expected when his journal was put into my hands that he would have sailed on the voyage he is now making in less than five months  it will probably be thought by many readers that i have related the nautical events too minutely but it must be remembered that minutely to relate these events was the great object of the work it was in particular thought necessary to insert the situation of the ship at different hours of the day with the bearings of different parts of the land while she was navigating seas and examining shores that hitherto have been altogether unknown in order to ascertain her track more minutely than could be done in any chart however large the scale and to describe with critical exactness the bays headlands and other irregularities of the coast the appearance of the country its hills valleys mountains and woods with the depth of water and every other particular that might enable future navigators easily to find and safely to visit every part of it i was not indeed myself sufficiently apprised of the minuteness that was necessary in this part of the work so that i was obliged to make many additions to it after i had prepared my manuscript it is however hoped that those who read merely for entertainment will be compensated by the description of countries which no european had before visited and manners which in many instances exhibit a new picture of human life in this part the relation of little circumstances requires no apology for it is from little circumstances that the relation of great events derives its power over the mind an account that ten thousand men perished in a battle that twice the number were swallowed up by an earthquake or that a whole nation was swept away by a pestilence is read in the naked brevity of an index without the least emotion by those who feel themselves strongly interested even for pamela the imaginary heroine of a novel that is remarkable for the enumeration of particulars in themselves so trifling that we almost wonder how they could occur to the authors mind  this work is illustrated and adorned by a great number of cuts from which every class of readers whether their object is knowledge or pleasure will find equal advantage as they consist not only of maps and charts drawn with great skill and attention but of views and figures designed and executed by the best artists in this country  the most effectual way to prevent obscurity and confusion in relating events is to range them in order of time which however cannot be done in an unbroken series when the complicated and multifarious objects of history are to be recorded but as each of the narratives in this work is a single thread the transactions of every day are set down in a regular succession and the time noted in the margin  great care has been taken to make the charts and the nautical part of the narrative coincide if there should be any difference which it is hoped will not be the case the charts are to be confided in as of unquestionable authority by the charts as well as by the narrative especially by that on which the tracks of the several vessels are marked it will be seen how far the existence or non existence of a southern continent is already ascertained and what land has in the course of these voyages been first discovered the charts also will at one view prevent any mistake which might arise from the same name having been given to different islands by the several commanders in these voyages without the trouble of comparing the latitudes and longitudes assigned them in the narrative  as it is but a very few years since the existence of a race of men above the common stature upon the coast of patagonia was the subject of eager dispute among all ranks of people in this country i have brought together the whole of the evidence on the question as i find it in a collection of voyages lately printed in france under the title of histoire des navigationes aux terres australes  it must be acknowledged that the contrariety of the reports that have been made by ocular witnesses concerning a fact easy to be determined does not deviate less from the common course of things than the gigantic stature of the people in question it appears that during an hundred years almost all navigators of whatever country agree in affirming the existence of a race of giants upon the coast of patagonia and that during another century the much greater number agree in denying the fact treating their predecessors as idle fabulists and imputing their reports either to the terror which the rude fierceness of a savage people inspired or to the natural propensity of mankind to assume importance by pretending to have seen wonderful things that men have a strange propensity to the marvelous cannot be denied nor that fear naturally magnifies its object but though it be allowed that the accounts of the patagonians have in some instances been exaggerated it is certain that all who have affirmed their stature to be gigantic were not under the influence of fear and it is very strange that nations who have an hereditary hatred to each other and an acknowledged opposition of interest should agree in asserting an evident falsehood  in the first place it is well known to have been an opinion long established both in our ancient world and in america that there was once a race of giants upon earth who distinguished themselves by violence and guilt  barbenais was told by the inhabitants of south america that a deluge having laid peru under water the indians retired to the mountains till the flood should subside and that when they came again down to the plain they found there men of an enormous stature who attacked them with great ferocity killing many and driving the rest to the caves of the rocks but that having continued in their hiding places many years they saw in the air a young man who destroyed the giants by thunderbolts and thus restored to them the possession of their country his guides also showed him many marks upon a rock which they said were impressed by the thunderbolts and many bones of an extraordinary size which they believed to be remains of the giants but they did not pretend to know when the deluge happened  the ynca garcilasso de la vega in his history of peru relates pedro de cieca chap    garcilasso hist du perou live   chap   that according to a tradition universally received a number of vessels or junks came to point saint helena with a company of giants on board of a stature so enormous that the natives of the country were not higher than their knees that their eyes were as broad as the bottom of a plate and their limbs proportionably large that some of them were naked and others slightly covered with the skins of beasts that when they came on shore they dug a pit of an astonishing depth in the rock and each of them consuming as much provisions as would be sufficient for fifty men the country was soon exhausted and they were obliged to live upon fish that they seized the women of the country to whom their brutality was fatal and afterward giving themselves up to worse vices the whole race was destroyed by fire from heaven which however left their bones unconsumed as a lasting memorial of divine vengeance bones of an amazing size are said to have been found in this country and fragments of teeth which if they were whole must have weighed half a pound  those who wish to know all the particulars of these american traditions may satisfy their curiosity by reading torquemado lib   chap    and    where they will find that these fables are very similar to those relative to the same subject in other parts of the world the bones said to have been the bones of giants which have been found in america and which were shown at mexico and other places in the year    0 are probably the bones of some animal unknown and indeed nothing less than the sight of such a race of human beings or of an entire skeleton can be admitted as a proof of their existence turner the naturalist reports that in the year    0 the thigh bone of a man was shown in london who must have been of an enormous size but this testimony is not decisive though the author adds that he had himself seen near the river plata upon the coast of brasil a race of giants who went stark naked that the hinder part of their heads was flat and not round that the women had long black hair as coarse as a horses mane that the men were excellent archers and besides their bow and arrows carried two massive balls or bullets each fastened to one end of a thong a weapon which they used with great dexterity and force either by striking with it or throwing it like a stone from a sling one of these giants he says was twelve feet high but acknowledges that he saw no other so tall  of this fact there are other ocular witnesses who perhaps may be thought more worthy of credit among the spaniards magellan loaisa sarmiento and nodal among the english cavendish hawkins and knivet among the dutch sebald de noort le maire and spilberg and among the french those who went in the expedition from marseilles and saint maloes those who bear testimony to the contrary are winter the dutch admiral hermit froger in de genness narrative and sir john narborough winter after having himself seen the inhabitants of patagonia says in direct terms that the accounts of their being giants are falsehoods invented by the spaniards and it must be confessed that the testimony of these navigators at least counterbalances the evidence on the other side especially as they were best acquainted with the straight of magellan and the neighboring country such navigators as have visited this country and are silent with respect to the stature of the inhabitants particularly sir francis drake must be considered as witnesses against the fact in question for their silence is a proof that they saw nothing extraordinary it must however be observed in the first place that the greater part of those who hold the affirmative in this question speak of people that inhabited the desert coast of patagonia to the east and west and that on the contrary those who hold the negative speak of those who inhabit the straight upon the sides of the utmost point of america to the north and south the nations of these two districts are certainly not the same and if the first have sometimes been seen in the straight it cannot be thought strange considering how short the distance is from port saint julian which appears to be their ordinary habitation magellan and his people saw them there very often and trafficked with them sometimes on board his ships and sometimes on shore nor was this all he seized two of them and kept them prisoners in his vessel one of whom was baptized some time before his death and taught several words of his language to pigafette who formed them into a little dictionary these are facts than which nothing can be more positive or less subject to illusion  i affirm says knivet that when i was at port desire i measured several dead bodies that i found buried there which were from fourteen to sixteen spans high and saw tracks in the sand which must have been left by people of nearly the same stature i have also frequently seen at brazil one of the patagonians who had been taken at port saint julian and though he was but a youth he measured no less than thirteen spans and our english prisoners at brazil have assured me that they had seen many men of the same stature upon the coasts of the straight sebald de were says that when he was in the straight he saw giants of the same bulk who tore up trees by the roots that were a span in diameter with great facility he also saw women that were gigantic and others of the common stature oliver de noort reports that he saw savages of a gigantic stature at port desire but does not call them giants that he took six of them prisoners and carried them on board his ship one of whom afterward told him that the country was inhabited by many different nations four of which were of the ordinary stature but that farther within the land in a territory called coin there was a gigantic people distinguished by the name of tiremenen who were continually making war upon the other nations spilberg relates that he saw a man of an extraordinary stature upon the coast of terra del fuego but that the sepulchers which he found had received men of the common height arisclasz who was on board la maires fleet in the character of commissary a man well worthy of credit declares that having visited the sepulchers which he discovered upon the coast of patagonia he found the bones of men who were between ten and eleven feet high which convinced him that the reports of former navigators were true and here it must be confessed that the examination was made in cold blood when it cannot be pretended that the object was magnified by fear some others particularly nodal and sir richard hawkins content themselves with saying that these savages were a head taller than the inhabitants of europe and of such a stature that the people on board their vessels called them giants such is the evidence of past times we shall now consider that of the age in which we live in   0  the captains harrington and carman who commanded two french vessels one from saint maloes and the other from marseilles saw at one time seven of these giants in possession bay at another time six and at a third time they had an interview with a company of more than four hundred men part of whom were gigantic and part of the common stature that harrington and carman reported this fact is attested by m frezier superintendant of the fortifications of bretagne a man well known and universally esteemed frezier never saw any of these savages himself but he says that being upon the coast of chili don pedro molina governor of the isle of chiloe and many other eyewitnesses told him that there was at a considerable distance within the country an indian nation called by their neighbors caucohues who sometimes came down to the spanish settlements that were more than nine feet high and were the same race with the patagonians who live on the eastern coast and have been mentioned in former relations we are told by reaveneau de lussan that the spaniards who live upon the sea coast in south america report that certain white indians inhabit part of chili with whom they are always at war that they are of an enormous bulk and stature and that whenever they take a spaniard prisoner they force up the breast bone as they would the shell of a tortoise and tear out his heart narborough on the contrary though he agrees that the indians who inhabit the mountains near the spanish settlements at chili and perpetually commit hostilities against them are tall expressly denies that their stature is gigantic he had often measured the skulls and the prints of the feet of the savages on the coasts of the straight of magellan which he says were of the common size he had also several times seen numerous companies of them even at port saint julian and these he declares not to be taller or bigger than other men narborough is certainly a credible witness and his evidence is directly to the point it is confirmed by that of lhermite who says that the people he saw upon the coast of terra del fuego though they were robust and wellproportioned were not larger than the inhabitants of europe and lastly m de gennes bears testimony that none of the people he saw at port famine were six feet high  those who diligently consider these different relations will find reason to believe that all the parties have spoken truth each of them faithfully reporting what he saw and therefore that the existence of a gigantic race in these parts is a real fact not to be questioned merely because they were not seen by every mariner that visited the country  it appears to be well established that the inhabitants of the two borders of the straight are of the common stature and that the race distinguished by the name of patagonians made their constant residence upon the desert coasts either in some miserable hovels in the depth of the woods or in some caverns of the rocks scarcely accessible to any but themselves and it appears from the account of oliver de noort that when the straight began to be frequented by european vessels they hid themselves as soon as the ships were in sight which accounts both for their not being seen and for the recent marks of inhabitants upon a coast that appeared to be desert perhaps the frequent appearance of our ships upon this coast at length determined them to quit it as a settled habitation returning only at particular seasons of the year and taking up their constant residence in the interior part of the country lord anson was of opinion that they resided statedly on the western side of the cordeliers and visited the eastern side occasionally but not often so that if they have been rarely seen by the vessels which have touched at the coast of patagonia for the last hundred years the reason probably is that being like other indian nations desirous to conceal themselves from strangers they retired to the mountains it is indeed to be regretted that no skeleton of these people has been brought into europe and it may at first seem strange that no such evidence of their uncommon stature should have been produced as it is known that several of them who had been made prisoners by the commanders of european vessels died on board soon after they came into a hot climate but the wonder will cease when it is considered that all mariners have a superstitious opinion that the compass will not traverse if there is a dead body on board the vessel upon the whole it may reasonably be presumed that the concurrent testimony of late navigators particularly commodore byron captain wallis and captain carteret gentlemen of unquestionable veracity who are still living and who not only saw and conversed with these people but measured them will put an end to all the doubts that have been hitherto entertained of their existence  having thus brought together the whole of the evidence for and against a fact which has long been the object both of popular and philosophical curiosity i shall not anticipate any opinion that the reader may form concerning future navigations in the track which has been described by any of the vessels whose voyages are here related except that although it is the opinion of commodore byron who spent seven weeks and two days in passing through the straight of magellan that it may be passed in three weeks at the proper season yet the passage cost captain wallis near four months though he performed it precisely at the time recommended by the commodore having reached the eastern entrance about the middle of december  i cannot however dismiss my readers to the following narratives without expressing the regret with which i have recorded the destruction of poor naked savages by our firearms in the course of these expeditions when they endeavored to repress the invaders of their country a regret which i am confident my readers will participate with me this however appears to be an evil which if discoveries of new countries are attempted cannot be avoided resistance will always be made and if those who resist are not overpowered the attempt must be relinquished it may perhaps be said that the expense of life upon these occasions is more than is necessary to convince the natives that further contest is hopeless and perhaps this may sometimes have been true but it must be considered that if such expeditions are undertaken the execution of them must be entrusted to persons not exempt from human frailty to men who are liable to provocation by sudden injury to unpremeditated violence by sudden danger to error by the defect of judgment or the strength of passion and always disposed to transfer laws by which they are bound themselves to others who are not subject to their obligation so that every excess thus produced is also an inevitable evil  if it should be said that supposing these mischiefs to be inevitable in attempting discoveries discoveries ought not to be attempted it must be considered that upon the only principles on which this opinion can be supported the risk of life for advantages of the same kind with those proposed in discovering new countries is in every other instance unlawful if it is not lawful to put the life of an indian in hazard by an attempt to examine the country in which he lives with a view to increase commerce or knowledge it is not lawful to risk the life of our own people in carrying on commerce with countries already known if it being said that the risk of life in our own people is voluntary and that the indian is brought into danger without his consent the consequence will still follow for it is universally agreed at least upon the principles of christianity that men have no more right over their own lives than over the lives of others and suicide being deemed the worst species of murder a man must be proportionably criminal in exposing his own life for any purpose that would not justify his exposing the life of another if the gratification of artificial wants or the inrease of knowledge are justifiable causes for the risk of life the landing by force on a newly discovered country in order to examine its produce may be justified if not every trade and profession that exposes life for advantages of the same kind is unlawful and by what trade or profession is not life exposed let us examine all the multitudes that art has employed from the refiner who sweats at the furnace to the sedentary artificer who grows pale at the loom and perhaps none can be found in which life is not in some degree sacrificed to the artificial necessities of civil society but will it therefore be said that civil society to which this sacrifice is made is for that reason a combination contrary to the great original principles of morality which are the basis of all duty will it be said that to exercise the faculties which are the distinguishing characteristics of our nature is unnatural and that being endowed with the various powers which in civil societies only can be brought into action it was incongruous to the will of our creator that any such society should be formed and that it would be pleasing to him if still continuing in a savage state these powers should lie torpid in our nature like life in an embrio during the whole of our existence this surely must appear extravagant and absurd in the highest degree especially as it must be allowed that although commerce and arts in some instances expose life in others they preserve it they supply the wants of nature without rapine and violence and by producing a common interest they prevent the inhabitants of the same country from being divided into different clans which among savages are almost perpetually committing hostilities against each other with a ferocious cruelty which is not to be found where civil government and literary knowledge have meliorated the manners of mankind upon the whole therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that the increase of knowledge and commerce are ultimately common benefits and that the loss of life which happens in the attempt is among the partial evils which terminate in general good  i have now only to request of such of my readers as may be disposed to censure me for not having attributed any of the critical escapes from danger that i have recorded to the particular interposition of providence that they would in this particular allow me the right of private judgment which i claim with the greater confidence as the very same principle which would have determined them to have done it has determined me to the contrary as i firmly believe the divine precept delivered by the author of christianity there is not a sparrow falls to the ground without my father and cannot admit the agency of chance in the government of the world i must necessarily refer every event to one cause as well the danger as the escape as well the sufferings as the enjoyments of life and for this opinion i have among other respectable authorities that of the bible shall we says job receive good from the hand of god and shall we not receive evil the supreme being is equally wise and benevolent in the dispensation of both evil and good as means of effecting ultimate purposes worthy of his ineffable perfections so that whether we consider ourselves as christians or philosophers we must acknowledge that he deserves blessing not more when he gives than when he takes away if the fall of a sparrow as well as its preservation is imputed to providence why not the fall as well as the preservation of a man and why should we attribute to providence only what appears to be good in its immediate effect when we suppose that the whole concatenation of events whether the preservation or destruction of particular parts tends ultimately to the good of the whole the same voice commissions the winds to plough up the deep which at the appointed time rebukes them saying peace be still if the adorable author and preserver of nature was such a being as baal is represented to have been by the prophet when he derided his worshippers if he was sometimes on a journey and sometimes asleep we might with propriety say that a fire happened to break out or a storm to rise but that by the interposition of providence life was preserved expressions which imply that the mischief had one origin and the remedy another but such language certainly derogates from the honor of the great universal cause who acting through all duration and subsisting in all space fills immensity with his presence and eternity with his power  it will perhaps be said that in particular instances evil necessarily results from that constitution of things which is best upon the whole and that providence occasionally interferes and supplies the defects of the constitution in these particulars but this notion will appear not to be supported by those facts which are said to be providential it will always be found that providence interposes too late and only moderates the mischief which it might have prevented but who can suppose an extraordinary interposition of providence to supply particular defects in the constitution of nature who sees those defects supplied but in part it is true that when the endeavor was upon the rock off the coast of new holland the wind ceased and that otherwise she must have been beaten to pieces but either the subsiding of the wind was a mere natural event or not if it was a natural event providence is out of the question at least we can with no more propriety say that providentially the wind ceased than that providentially the sun rose in the morning if it was not a mere natural event but produced by an extraordinary interposition correcting a defect in the constitution of nature tending to mischief it will lie upon those who maintain the position to show why an extraordinary interposition did not take place rather to prevent the ships striking than to prevent her being beaten to pieces after she had struck a very slight impulse upon the ships course would have caused her to steer clear of the rock and if all things were not equally easy to omnipotence we should say that this might have been done with less difficulty than a calm could be produced by suspending the general laws of nature which had brought on the gale  i have however paid my homage to the supreme being consonant to my own ideas of his agency and perfections and those who are of opinion that my notions are erroneous must allow that he who does what he thinks to be right and abstains from what he thinks to be wrong acquits himself equally of moral obligation whether his opinions are false or true  an explanation of the nautical terms not generally understood which occur in this work a aback the situation of the sails when their surfaces are flatted against the masts by the force of the wind the sails are said to be taken aback when they are brought into this situation either by a sudden change of the wind or by an alteration in the ships course they are laid aback to effect an immediate retreat without turning

extremely fine  while we lay here i went one day to cape forward and when i set out i intended to have gone farther but the weather became so bad with heavy rain that we were glad to stop there and make a great fire to dry our clothes which were wet through from the place where we stopped the indians had been gone so lately that the wood which lay half burnt where they had made their fire was still warm and soon after our fire was kindled we perceived that another was kindled directly opposite to it on the terra del fuego shore probably as a signal which if we had been indians we should have understood after we were dried and refreshed at our fire the rain having abated i walked cross the cape to see how the straight ran which i found to be about w n w the hills as far as i could see were of an immense height very craggy and covered with snow quite from the summit to the base i made also another excursion along the shore to the northward and found the country for many miles exceedingly pleasant the ground being in many places covered with flowers which were not inferior to those that are commonly found in our gardens either in beauty or fragrance and if it were not for the severity of the cold in winter this country might in my opinion be made by cultivation one of the finest in the world i had set up a small tent at the bottom of this bay close to a little rivulet and just at the skirts of a wood soon after the ship came to an anchor where three men were employed in washing they slept on shore but soon after sunset were awakened out of their first sleep by the roaring of some wild beasts which the darkness of the night and the solitariness of their situation in this pathless detail  at this place not far from where the ship lay there is a hill that has been cleared of wood and we supposed this to be the spot where the spaniards formerly had a settlement see some account of this settlement in the voyage of captain wallis chap iii p      one of the men as he was passing over this hill perceived that in a particular part the ground returned the sound of his foot as if it was hollow he therefore repassed it several times and finding the effect still the same he conceived a strong notion that something was buried there when he came on board he related what he had remarked to me and i went myself to the spot with a small party furnished with spades and pickaxes and saw the spot opened to a considerable depth but we found nothing nor did there appear to be any hollow or vault as was expected as we were returning through the woods we found two very large skulls which by the teeth appeared to have belonged to some beasts of prey but of what kind we could not guess  having continued here till friday the  th of january  a chart of hawkinss maidenland discovered by sr richard hawkins in      and falkland sound so called by capn john strong of the farewell from london who sailed through it in      map  chap v the course back from port famine to falklands islands with some account of the country we weighed anchor at four oclock in the morning  at one oclock the next morning we weighed but in less than half an hour  this bank which has not been mentioned by any navigator who has passed the straight is extremely dangerous especially as it lies directly in the fair way between cape virgin mary and the first narrow and just in the middle between the south and north shores it is more than two leagues long and full as broad in many places also it is very steep when we were upon it point possession bore n e distant three leagues and the entrance of the narrow s w distant two leagues i afterward saw many parts of it dry and the sea breaking very high over other parts of it where the water was shallow a ship that should ground upon this shoal in a gale of wind would probably be very soon beaten to pieces  about six oclock in the morning we anchored in fifteen fathom the shoal bearing n n w w at the distance of about half a mile at noon we weighed with a light breeze at n e and worked with the ebb tide till two but finding the water shoal we anchored again in six fathom and an half  the next morning about eight oclock we weighed eight the next morning  on the  th  on the  0th  on the   th w   s distant seventy leagues the variation was now    e we had been embayed  on monday the   th then were sixteen fathom with rocky ground in honor of the earl our people grew tired of them it was a common thing for a boat to bring off sixty or seventy fine geese without expending a single charge of powder and shot for the men knocked down as many as they pleased with stones wood however is wanting here except a little that is found adrift along the shore which i imagined came from the straight of magellan among other refreshments which are in the highest degree salutary to those who have contracted scorbutic disorders during a long voyage here are wild celery and wood sorrel in the greatest abundance nor is there any want of mussels clams cockles and limpets the seals and penguins are innumerable so that it is impossible to walk upon the beach without first driving them away and the coast abounds with sea lions many of which are of an enormous size we found this animal very formidable i was once attacked by one of them very unexpectedly and it was with the utmost difficulty that i could disengage myself from him at other times we had many battles with them and it has sometimes afforded a dozen of us an hours work to dispatch one of them i had with me a very fine mastiff dog and a bite of one of these creatures almost tore him to pieces nor were these the only dangerous animals that we found here for the master having been sent out one day to sound the coast upon the south shore reported at his return that four creatures of great fierceness resembling wolves ran up to their bellies in the water to attack the people in his boat and that as they happened to have no firearms with them they had immediately put the boat off into deep water the next morning after this happened i went upon the southern shore myself where we found one of the largest sea lions i had ever seen as the boats crew were now well armed they immediately engaged him and during the contest one of the other animals was seen running toward us he was fired at before he came up and was presently killed though i afterward wished that we had endeavored to take him alive which if we had been aware of his attack i dare say might easily have been done when any of these creatures got fight of our people though at ever so great a distance they ran directly at them and no less than five of them were killed this day they were always called wolves by the ships company but except in their size and the shape of the tail i think they bore a greater resemblance to a fox they are as big as a middlesized mastiff and their fangs are remarkably long and sharp there are great numbers of them upon this coast though it is not perhaps easy to guess how they first came hither for these islands are at least one hundred leagues distant from the main they burrow in the ground like a fox and we have frequently seen pieces of seal which they have mangled and the skins of penguins lie scattered about the mouth of their holes to get rid of these creatures our people set fire to the grass so that the country was in a blaze as far as the eye could reach for several days and we could see them running in great numbers to seek other quarters i dug holes in many places about two feet deep to examine the soil which i found first a black mould and then a light clay while we lay here we set up the armourers forge on shore and completed a great deal of iron work that was much wanted our people had every morning an excellent breakfast made of portable soup and wild celery thickened with oatmeal neither was our attention confined wholly to ourselves for the surgeon of the tamar surrounded a piece of ground near the wateringplace with a fence of turf and planted it with many esculent vegetables as a garden for the benefit of those who might hereafter come to this place of this harbor and all the neighboring islands i took possession for his majesty king george the third of great britain by the name of falklands islands and there is i think little reason to doubt that they are the same land to which cowley gave the name of pepyss island  in the printed account of cowleys voyage he says we held our course s w till we came into the latitude of fortyseven degrees where we saw land the same being an island not before known lying to the westward of us it was not inhabited and i gave it the name of pepyss island we found it a very commodious place for ships to water at and take in wood and it has a very good harbor where a thousand sail of ships may safely ride here is great plenty of fowls and we judge abundance of fish by reason of the grounds being nothing but rocks and sands  to this account there is annexed a representation of pepyss island in which names are given to several points and head lands and the harbor is called admiralty bay yet it appears that cowley had only a distant view of it for he immediately adds the wind being so extraordinary high that we could not get into it to water we stood to the southward shaping our course s s w till we came into the latitude of    and though he says that it was commodious to take in wood and it is known that there is no wood on falklands islands pepyss island and falklands islands may notwithstanding be the same for upon falklands islands there are immense quantities of flags with narrow leaves reeds and rushes which grow in clusters so as to form bushes about three feet high and then shoot about six or seven feet higher these at a distance have greatly the appearance of wood and were taken for wood by the french who landed there in the year      as appears by pernettys account of their voyage it has been suggested that the latitude of pepyss island might in the m s from which the account of cowleys voyage was printed be expressed in figures which if ill made might equally resemble fortyseven and fiftyone and therefore as there is no island in these seas in latitude fortyseven and as falklands islands lie nearly in fiftyone that fiftyone might reasonably be concluded to be the number for which the figures were intended to stand recourse therefore was had to the british musaeum and a manuscript journal of cowleys was there found in this manuscript no mention is made of an island not before known to which he gave the name of pepyss island but land is mentioned in latitude fortyseven degrees forty minutes expressed in words at length which exactly answers to the description of what is called pepyss island in the printed account and which here he says he supposed to be the islands of sebald de were this part of the manuscript is in the following words january      this month we were in the latitude of fortyseaven degrees and forty minnetts where we espied an island bearing west from us we having the wind at east north east we bore away for it it being too late for us to go on shore we lay by all night the island seemed very pleasant to the eye with many woods i may as well say the whole land was woods there being a rock lying above water to the eastward of it where an innumerable company of fowls being of the bigness of a small goose which fowls would strike at our men as they were aloft some of them we killed and eat they seemed to us very good only tasted somewhat fishly i sailed along that island to the southward and about the south west side of the island there seemed to me to be a good place for ships to ride i would have had the boat out to have gone into the harbor but the wind blew fresh and they would not agree to go with it sailing a little further keeping the lead and having six and twenty and seven and twenty fathoms water until we came to a place where we saw the weeds ride having the lead again found but seven fathoms water fearing danger went about the shipp there were then fearful to stay by the land any longer it being all rocky ground but the harbor seemed to be a good place for ships to ride there in the island seeming likewise to have water enough there seemed to me to be harbor for five hundred sail of ships the going in but narrow and the north side of the entrance shallow water that i could see but i verily believe that there is water enough for any shipp to go in on the south side for there cannot be so great a lack of water but must needs scowre a channel away at the ebb deep enough for shipping to go in i would have had them stood upon a wind all night but they told me they were not come out to go upon discovery we saw likewise another island by this that night which made me think them to be the sibble dwards  the same night we steered our course again west south west which was but our south west the compass having two and twenty degrees variation eastwardly keeping that course till we came in the latitude of three and fifty degrees  in both the printed and manuscript account this land is said to lie in latitude fortyseven to be situated to the westward of the ship when first discovered to appear woody to have an harbor where a great number of ships might ride in safety and to be frequented by innumerable birds it appears also by both accounts that the weather prevented his going on shore and that he steered from it w s w till he came into latitude fiftythree there can therefore be little doubt but that cowley gave the name of pepyss island after he came home to what he really supposed to be the island of sebald de were for which it is not difficult to assign several reasons and though the supposition of a mistake of the figures does not appear to be well grounded yet there being no land in fortyseven the evidence that what cowley saw was falklands islands is very strong the description of the country agrees in almost every particular and even the map is of the same general figure with a straight running up the middle the chart of falklands that accompanies this narrative was laid down from the journals and drawings of captain macbride who was dispatched thither after my return and circumnavigated the whole coast the two principal islands were probably called falklands islands by strong about the year      as he is known to have given the name of falklands sound to part of the straight which divides them the journal of this navigator is still unprinted in the british musaeum the first who saw these islands is supposed to be captain davies the associate of cavendish in      in      sir richard hawking saw land supposed to be the same and in honor of his mistress queen elizabeth called them hawkinss maiden land long afterward they were seen by some french ships from saint maloes and frezier probably for that reason called them the malouins a name which has been since adopted by the spaniards  having continued in the harbor which i had called port egmont till sunday the   th of january we were scarcely got out of the port before it began to blow very hard at port egmont  the next morning and therefore i tacked and stood to the northward  chap vi the passage through the straight of magellan as far as cape monday with a description of several bays and harbors formed by the coast on each side we continued to make sail for port desire till wednesday the  th of february  the next morning being on shore they were got off  on wednesday the   th the storeship being ready for sea

under way  at six oclock in the evening i made the signal and weighed we worked through the second narrow and at ten oclock passed the west end of it at eleven we anchored in seven fathom off elizabeths island and the french ship at the same time anchored in a bad situation to the southward of saint bartholomews island which convinced me that she was not acquainted with the channel  at six oclock the next morning water  here we continued till monday the   th  we steered s s w with little wind along the shore five miles  at six oclock the next morning  from cape gallant to passage point which are distant about three leagues the coast lies w by n by compass passage point is the east point of elizabeths bay and is low land with a rock lying off it between this and cape gallant there are several islands some of them are very small but the eastermost which is charless island that has been just mentioned is two leagues long the next is called monmouths island and the westermost ruperts island ruperts island lies s by e of point passage these islands make the straight narrow between point passage and ruperts island it is not more than two miles over and it is necessary to go to the northward of them all keeping the north shore on board we sailed within two cables length of it  at two oclock in the afternoon of thursday the   th  at five oclock the next morning the wind being northerly was open delighted  at five oclock in the morning of the  d we weighed more moderate  at six oclock the next morning  at six oclock on the  th i sent an officer to the westward to look

that time had one continued storm with impenetrable fogs and incessant rain  at eight oclock in the morning of the   th once more abreast of cape monday and at five  at six oclock the next morning we

and at six in the evening we anchored in the bay on the southern shore which lies about a league to the eastward of the cape and had fifteen fathom water  while we were lying here and taking in wood and water seven or eight indians in a canoe came round the western point of the bay and having landed opposite to the ship made a fire we invited them to me on board by all the signs we could devise but without success i therefore took the jolly boat and went on shore to them i introduced myself by making them presents of several trifles with which they seemed to be much gratified and we became very intimate in a few minutes after we had spent some time together i sent away my people in the boat for some bread and remained on shore with them alone when the boat returned with the bread i divided it among them and i remarked with equal pleasure and surprise that if a bit of the biscuit happened to fall not one of them offered to touch it till i gave my consent in the mean time some of my people were cutting a little grass for two or three sheep which i had still left on board and at length the indians perceiving what they were doing ran immediately and tearing up all the weeds they could get carried them to the boat  on sunday the  th the current  this day and not before the tamars boat returned from the westward she had been within two or three leagues of cape pillar and had found several very good anchoringplaces on the south more  at one oclock the next morning  at six oclock fine steady gale sprung up at s e to which i spread all the sail that it was possible for the ship to bear  it is probable that whoever shall read this account of the difficulties and dangers which attended our passage through the straight of magellan will conclude that it ought never to be attempted again but that all ships which shall hereafter sail a western course from europe into the south seas ought to go round cape horn i however who have been twice round cape horn am of a different opinion i think that at a proper season of the year not only a single vessel but a large squadron might pass the straight in less than three weeks and i think to take the proper season they should be at the eastern entrance some time in the month of december one great advantage of this passage is the facility with which fish is almost every where to be procured with wild celery scurvy grass berries and many other vegetables in great abundance for to this i impute the heathiness of my ships company not a single man being affected with the scurvy in the slightest degree nor upon the sick list for any other disorder notwithstanding the hardship and labor which they endured in the passage which cost us seven weeks and two days as we entered the straight on sunday the   th of february  chap viii the run from the western entrance of the straight of magellan to the islands of disappointment having cleared the straight we pursued our course to the westward as appears by the track in the chart till friday april the   th  we bore away for masafuero and at sunset being within about seven leagues of it we brought to and afterward kept the wind all night to which there was a fine fall of fresh water  at seven oclock in the morning of nearly the same size  this evening the surf running very high the gunner and one of the seamen who were on shore with the waterers were afraid to venture off and the boat therefore when she came on board the last time left them behind her  the next day we found a more convenient wateringplace  as soon as this was reported to me i sent another boat to inform them that as by the appearances of the weather there was reason to believe it would soon blow hard in his room and gave mr kendal one of the mates of the dolphin a commission as second lieutenant of the tamar  on the  0th  on the  0th  on the   th  on the morning of the   th  on the   d being in latitude  0    s  on the   th we saw two large birds about the ship  on the   th  on the   st  we saw no land however till one oclock in the morning of friday the  th of june  i stood for the small island which as we drew near it had a most beautiful appearance it was surrounded by a beach of the finest white sand and within it was covered with tall trees which extended their shade to a great distance and formed the most delightful groves that can be imagined without underwood we judged this island to be about five miles in circumference and from each end of it we saw a spit running out into the sea upon which the surge broke with great fury there was also a great surf all round it we soon perceived that it was inhabited for many of the natives appeared upon the beach with spears in their hands that were at least sixteen feet long kind from the power which fancy is perpetually exerting to aggravate the calamities of life and would fain have fired upon them  at six oclock in the morning of the  th gestures to prevent their landing  at half an hour after ten we bore away and made sail to the westward finding it impossible to procure at these islands any refreshment for our sick whose situation was becoming more deplorable every hour and i therefore called them the islands of disappointment  chap ix the discovery of king georges islands with a description of them and an account of several incidents that happened there at half an hour after five oclock in the afternoon of the  th we saw land again scarcely a ships length wide  about noon finding there was no anchorage here i bore away and steered along the shore to the westermost point of the island the boats immediately followed us and kept founding close to the beach but could get no ground  when we came to the westermost point of this island must have cost those who made them infinite labor  as the surf which broke very high upon the shore rendered it impossible to procure refreshments for the sick in this part of the island i hauled the wind and worked back to the inlet being determined to try once more what could be done there  i recovered that station in the afternoon and immediately sent the boats to sound the inlet again but they confirmed the account which had been made before that it afforded no anchorage for a ship while the boats were absent i observed a great number of the natives upon the point near the spot where we had left them in the morning and they seemed to be very busy in loading a great number of large canoes which lay close to the beach as i thought they might be troublesome and was unwilling that they should suffer by another unequal contest with our people  just before the evening closed in our boats landed and got a few cocoanuts which they brought off but saw none of the inhabitants in the night during which we had rain and hard squalls i stood off and on with the ships and at seven oclock in the morning brought to off the inlet  our people  close to the houses of these people we saw buildings of another kind which appeared to be buryingplaces and from which we judged that they had great veneration for their dead they were situated under lofty trees that gave a thick shade the sides and tops were of stone and in their figure they somewhat resembled the square tombs  we sent off several boatloads of cocoanuts and a great quantity of scurvy grass with which the island is covered refreshments which were of infinite service to us as by this time i believe there was not a man among us wholly untouched by the scurvy  the fresh water here is very good but it is scarce the wells which supply the natives are so small that when two or three cocoanut shells have been filled from them they are dry for a few minutes but as they presently fill again if a little pains were taken to enlarge them they would abundantly supply any ship with water  we saw no venomous creature here but the flies were an intolerable torment they covered us from head to foot and filled not only the boat but the ships we saw great numbers of parrots and parroquets and several other birds which were altogether unknown to us we saw also a beautiful kind of dove so tame that some of them frequently came close to us and even followed us into the indian huts  all this day the natives kept themselves closely concealed and did not even make a smoke upon any part of the islands as far as we could see probably fearing that a smoke might discover the place of their retreat  this part of the island lies in latitude       s longitude      0 w and after i got on board i hauled a little way farther from the shore intending to visit the other island in the morning which had been seen to the westward of that before which the ship lay and which is distant about sixtynine leagues from the islands of disappointment in the direction of w s  the next morning which they did it to them  to these two islands i gave the name of king georges islands  chap x the run from king georges islands to the islands of saypan tinian and aguigan with an account of several islands that were discovered in that track we pursued our course to the westward the same day  from the western extremity of this island we steered n    w and at noon on the   th

for the variation  after having seen the breakers soon after it was light in the morning i told my officers that i apprehended we should have frequent alarms in the night at night therefore every body was upon the watch which a very hard squall of wind with rain rendered the more necessary about nine oclock having just gone down into my cabin i heard a great noise above  nothing worthy of notice happened till monday the   th that this island was the same that in the neptune francois is called maluita  we continued our course till the   th  on tuesday the  d of july south west side of it and cheerfulness in their countenances that is very striking  i sent out the boats to sound soon after we brought to off the island and when they came back they reported that there was ground at the depth of thirty fathom within two cables length of the shore but as the bottom was coral rock and the soundings much too near the breakers for a ship to lie in safety i was obliged again to make sail without procuring any refreshments for the sick this island to which my officers gave the name of byrons island      s  in our course from this place we saw for several days abundance of fish but we could take only sharks which were become a good dish even at my own table many of the people now began to fall down with fluxes which the surgeon imputed to the excessive heat and almost perpetual

account of the transactions there on the   th spot where lord anson lay in the centurion  as soon as the ship was secured i went on shore to six upon a place where tents might be erected for the sick which were now very numerous not a single man being wholly free from the scurvy and many in the last stage of it we found several huts which had been left by the spaniards and indians the year before for this year none of them had as yet been at the place nor was it probable that they should come for some months the sun being now almost vertical and the rainy season set in after i had fixed upon a spot for the tents six or seven of us endeavored to push through the woods that we might come at the beautiful lawns and meadows of which there is so luxuriant a description in the account of lord ansons voyage and if possible kill some cattle the trees stood so thick and the place was so overgrown with underwood that we could not see three yards before us we therefore were obliged to keep continually hallooing to each other to prevent our being separately lost in this trackless wilderness as the weather was intolerably hot we had nothing on besides our shoes except our shirts and trowsers and these were in a very short time torn all to rags by the bushes and brambles at last however with incredible difficulty and labor we got through but to our great surprise and disappointment we found the country very different from the account we had read of it the lawns were entirely overgrown with a stubborn kind of reed or brush in many places higher than our heads and no where lower than our middles which continually entangled our legs and cut us like whipcord our stockings perhaps might have suffered still more  the next day our people were employed in setting up more tents getting the watercasks on shore violence and broke so high upon the reef that i was obliged to put to sea for a week for if our cable had parted in the night and the wind had been upon the shore which sometimes happens for two or three days together the ship must inevitably have been lost upon the rocks  as i was myself very ill with the scurvy i ordered a tent to be pitched for me and took up my residence on shore where we also erected the armourers forge and began to repair the ironwork of both the ships i soon found that the island produced limes four oranges cocoanuts breadfruit see a particular description of the breadfruit vol ii p  0  guavas and paupaus in great abundance but we found no watermelons scurvy grass or sorrel  notwithstanding the fatigue and distress that we had endured and the various climates we had passed through neither of the ships had yet lost a single man since their sailing from england but while we lay here two died of fevers a disease with which many were seized though we all recovered very fast from the scurvy i am indeed of opinion that this is one of the most unhealthy spots in the world at least during the season in which we were here the rains were violent and almost incessant and the heat was so great as to threaten us with suffocation the thermometer which was kept on board the ship generally stood at eightysix which is but nine degrees less than the heat of the blood at the heart and if it had been on shore it would have risen much higher i had been upon the coast of guinea in the west indies and upon the island of saint thomas which is under the line but i had never felt any such heat as i felt here besides the inconvenience which we suffered from the weather we were incessantly tormented by the flies in the day and by the musquitos in the night the island also swarms with centipieds and scorpions and a large black ant scarcely inferior to either in the malignity of its bite besides these there were venomous insects without number altogether unknown to us by which many of us suffered so severely that we were afraid to lie down in our beds nor were those on board in a much better situation than those on shore for great numbers of these creatures being carried into the ship with the wood they took possession of every birth and left the poor seamen no place of rest either below or upon the deck  as soon as we were settled in our new habitations i sent out parties to discover the haunts of the cattle some of which were found but at a great distance from the tents and the beasts were so shy that it was very difficult to get a shot at them some of the parties which when their haunts had been discovered were sent out to kill them were absent three days and nights before they could succeed and when a bullock had been dragged seven or eight miles through such woods and lawns as have just been described to the tents it was generally full of flyblows and stunk so as to be unfit for use nor was this the worst for the fatigue of the men in bringing down the carcass and the intolerable heat they suffered from the climate and the labor frequently brought on fevers which laid them up poultry however we procured upon easier terms there was great plenty of birds and they were easily killed but the flesh of the best of them was very illtasted and such was the heat of the climate that within an hour after they were killed it was as green as grass and swarmed with maggots our principal resource for fresh meat was the wild hog with which the island abounds these creatures are very fierce and some of them so large that a carcass frequently weighed two hundred pounds we killed them without much difficulty but a black belonging to the tamar contrived a method to snare them so that we took great numbers of them alive which was an unspeakable advantage for it not only ensured our eating the flesh while it was sweet but enabled us to send a good number of them on board as seastores  in the mean time we were very desirous of procuring some beef in an eatable state with less risk and labor and mr gore one of our mates at last discovered a pleasant spot upon the north west part of the island where cattle were in great plenty and whence they might be brought to the tents by sea to this place therefore i dispatched a party with a tent for their accommodation and sent the boats every day to fetch what they should kill sometimes however there broke such a sea upon the rocks that it was impossible to approach them and the tamars boat unhappily lost three of her best men by attempting it we were now upon the whole pretty well supplied with provisions especially as we baked fresh bread every day for the sick and the fatigue of our people being less there were fewer ill with the fever but several of them were so much disordered by eating of a very fine looking fish which we caught here that their recovery was for a long time doubtful the author of the account of lord ansons voyage says that the people on board the centurion thought it prudent to abstain from fish as the few which they caught at their first arrival surfeited those who eat of them but not attending sufficiently to this caution and too hastily taking the word surfeit in its literal and common acceptance we imagined that those who tasted the fish when lord anson first came hither were made sick merely by eating too much whereas if that had been the case there would have been no reason for totally abstaining afterward but only eating temperately we however bought our knowledge by experience which we might have had cheaper for though all our people who tasted this fish eat sparingly they were all soon afterward dangerously ill  besides the fruit that has been mentioned already this island produces cotton and indigo in abundance and would certainly be of great value if it was situated in the west indies the surgeon of the tamar enclosed a large spot of ground here and made a very pretty garden but we did not stay long enough to derive any advantage from it  while we ay here i sent the tamar to examine the island of saypan which is much larger than tinian rises higher and in my opinion has a much pleasanter appearance she anchored to the leeward of it at the distance of a mile from the shore and in about ten fathom water with much the same kind of ground as we had in the road of tinian her people landed upon a fine sandy beach which is six or seven miles long and walked up into the woods where they saw many trees which were very fit for topmasts they saw no fowls nor any tracks of cattle but of hogs and guanicoes there was plenty they found no fresh water near the beach but saw a large pond inland which they did not examine they saw large heaps of pearl oystershells thrown up together and other signs of people having been there not long before possibly the spaniards may go thither at some seasons of the year and carry on a pearl fishery they also saw many of those square pyramidal pillars which are to be found at tinian and which are particularly described in the account of lord ansons voyage  on monday the  0th of september  chap xiii the run from tinian to pulo timoan with some account of that island its inhabitants and productions and thence to batavia we continued our course till thursday the  0th  on the   th these birds appeared to have been blown off some island to the northward of us  the needle continued to point due north till the   d  on the   th  at seven oclock the next morning some refreshments are to be procured  the next day i landed to see what was to be got  these people are of a small stature but extremely well made and of a dark copper color we saw among them one old man who was dressed somewhat in the manner of the persians but all the rest were naked except a handkerchief which they wore as a kind of turban upon their heads and some pieces of cloth which were fastened with a silver plate or clasp round their middles we saw none of their women and probably some care was taken to keep them out of our fight the habitations are very neatly built of slit bamboo  the island is mountainous and woody but we found it pleasant when we were ashore it produces the cabbage and cocoanut tree in great plenty but the natives did not choose to let us have any of the fruit we saw also some rice grounds but what other vegetable productions nature has favored them with we had no opportunity to learn as we staid here but two nights and one day in the bay where the ship rode there is excellent fishing though the surf runs very high we hauled our seine with great success but could easily perceive that it gave umbrage to the inhabitants who consider all the fish about these islands as their own there are two fine rivers that run into this bay and the water is excellent it was indeed so much better than what we had on board that i filled as many casks with it as loaded the boat twice while we lay here some of the natives brought down an animal which had the body of a hare and the legs of a deer one of our officers bought it and we should have been glad to have kept it alive but it was impossible for us to procure for it such food as it would eat it was therefore killed and we found it very good food all the while we lay here we had the most violent thunder lightning and rain that i had ever known and finding that nothing more was to be procured we sailed again on thursday morning we had nothing but light airs calms and tornados with violent rain thunder and lightning  at seven oclock in the morning of sunday the  0th  at one oclock the next morning  at ten oclock in the morning of tuesday the   th  the next day at four in the afternoon colors  the next morning point on the sumatra shore s w to avoid a shoal  in the morning the current or tide set to the s e at the rate of three knots at five we weighed  on the   th  chap xiii transactions at batavia and departure from that place the next day which by our account was the   th  there is always lying here a dutch commodore belonging to the company who among his countrymen is a person of very great consequence this gentleman thought fit to send his boat on board of me with only the cockswain in her who was a very dirty ragged fellow as soon as he was brought to me he asked whence i came whither i was bound and many other questions which i thought equally impertinent at the same time pulling out a book and pen and ink that he might set down the answers but as i was impatient to save him this trouble he was desired immediately to walk over the ships side and put off his boat with which he was graciously pleased to comply  when we came to this place we had not one man sick in either of the ships but as i knew it to be more unhealthy than any other part of the east indies as the rainy season was at hand and arrack was to be procured in great plenty i determined to make my stay here as short as possible i went on shore to wait upon the dutch governor but was told that he was at his country house about four miles distant from the town i met however with an officer called a shebander who is a kind of master of the ceremonies and he acquainted me that if i chose to go to the governor immediately rather than wait for his coming to town he would attend me i accepted his offer and we set out together in his chariot the governor received me with great politeness and told me that i might either take a house in any part of the city that i should like or be provided with lodgings at the hotel this hotel is a licensed lodginghouse the only one in the place and kept by a frenchman an artful fellow who is put in by the governor himself it has indeed more the appearance of a palace than a house of entertainment being the most magnificent building in batavia nor would a small edifice answer the purpose for as there is a penalty of five hundred dollars upon any person in the city who shall suffer a stranger to sleep a single night at his house the strangers who make it their residence are never few all the houses indeed have a stately appearance on the outside and are elegantly fitted up within and we were told that the chinese of whom there are great numbers at this place were the architects the city is large and the streets well laid out but they have greatly the appearance of those in the cities of holland for a canal runs through most of them with a row of trees planted on each side this is convenient for the merchants who have every thing brought up to their own doors by water but it probably contributes to the unhealthiness of the place the canal indeed as the city is built in a swamp might be necessary as a drain but the trees though they have a pleasant appearance must certainly prevent the noxious vapors that are perpetually arising from being dispersed by obstructing the circulation of the air  the number of people here is incredible and they are of almost every nation in the world dutch portuguese chinese persians moors malays javanese and many others the chinese however have a large town to themselves without the walls and carry on a considerable trade for they have annually ten or twelve large junks from china and to these the opulence of the dutch at batavia is in a great measure owing the beef here is bad and the mutton scarce but the poultry and fish are excellent and in great plenty here are also the greatest variety and abundance of the finest fruit in the world but the musquitos centipieds scorpions and other noxious vermin which are innumerable prevent all enjoyment and even rest as well by night as by day the roads for many miles about the city are as good as any in england they are very broad and by the side of them runs a canal shaded by tall trees which is navigable for vessels of a very large size on the other side of the canal are gardens of a very pleasant appearance and country houses of the citizens where they spend as much of their time as possible the situation being less unwholesome than the city and there are so few of them who do not keep a carriage that it is almost a disgrace to be seen on foot  at this place i continued from the   th of november to the  0th of december when ships companies eat any thing else  chap xiv the passage from batavia to the cape of good hope and from thence to england we continued our course  i stood in for the land and when i was within about two leagues of it i saw a great smoke rising from a sandy beach i imagined the smoke to be made by the hottentots yet i was astonished at their choosing this part of the coast for their residence for it consisted of nothing but sand banks as far as we could see without the least bush or a single blade of verdure and so heavy a sea broke upon the coast that it was impossible to catch any fish  on wednesday the   th at three oclock in the afternoon island and green point  the next morning shore when i heard this melancholy account i could only regret that i had not known it before for i would then certainly have made every effort in my power to have found these unhappy wretches and taken them from a place where now in all probability they must miserably perish  the cape is certainly a most excellent place for ships to touch at it is a healthy climate a fine country and abounds with refreshments of every kind the companys garden is a delightful spot and at the end of it there is a paddock belonging to the governor in which are kept a great number of rare and curious animals and among others when i was there were three fine ostriches and four zebras of an uncommon size i gave all the people leave to go on shore by turns and they always contrived to get very drunk with cape wine before they came back many ships came in while we lay here some were dutch some french some danes but all were outward bound  having continued here three weeks and during that time refreshed our men and completed our water i took leave of the good old governor on the  th of march and on the  th  on sunday the   th at six in the morning fears  on the   th  pursuant to these orders the tamar parted company with

commission which was dated the   th of june       the ship was fitted for the sea with all possible expedition during which the articles of war and the act of parliament were read to the ships company  on the   th i received my sailing orders he said would in that case be of great service if room could be found to flow them in i therefore gave him leave to put them into my cabin the only place in the ship where they could be received as they consisted of three large boxes  on the   d  we proceeded in our voyage without any remarkable incident till sunday the seventh of september  about five oclock we ran between this end of the island and the deserters on the side next the deserters is a low flat island and near it a needle rock the side next to madeira is full of broken rocks and for that reason it is not safe to come within less than two miles of it  at six in the evening we anchored in madeira road about twothirds of a mile from the shore in    fathom with a muddy bottom about eight the swallow and prince frederick also came to an anchor and i sent an officer on shore to the governor to let him know that i would salute him if he would return an equal number of guns which he promised to do  having taken in a proper quantity of water at this place with four pipes and ten puncheons of wine some fresh beef and a large quantity of onions we weighed anchor on the   th  at six oclock in the morning of tuesday the   th  on the  0th we tried the current  in the night between the   st and   d we lost our companion the swallow  on the next day  at noon the southend of the island st iago bore s w by w distant four leagues and the northend n w distant five leagues at half an hour after three we anchored in port praya in that island in company with the swallow and prince frederick in eight fathom water upon sandy ground we had much rain and lightning in the night and early in the morning i sent to the commandingofficer at the fort  we soon learnt that this was the sickly season and that the rains were so great as to render it extremely difficult to get any thing down from the country to the ships it happened also unfortunately that the smallpox which is extremely fatal here was at this time epidemic so that i permitted no man to go ashore who had not had that distemper and i would not suffer even those that had to go into any house  we procured however a supply of water and some cattle from the shore and caught abundance of fish with the seine which was hauled twice every day we found also in the valley where we got our water a kind of large purslain growing wild in amazing quantities this was a most welcome refreshment both raw as a sallad and boiled with the broth and pease and when we left the place we carried away enough of it to serve us a week  on the   th  this day i ordered hooks and lines to be served to all the ships company that they might catch fish for themselves but at the same time i also ordered that no man should keep his fish more than four and twenty hours before it was eaten for i had observed that stale and even dried fish had made the people sickly and tainted the air in the ship  on the first of october  on the  0th our butter and cheese being all expended  on the   d we saw an incredible number of birds  on the   th i ordered the ships company to be served with brandy and reserved the wine for the sick and convalescent carried away her foretopsailyard to supply this loss we gave her our spritsailtopsailyard which we could spare and she hoisted it immediately  on the   th she again made signals

about half an hour we anchored in a bay close under the south side of the cape in ten fathom water with a gravelly bottom the swallow and storeship anchored soon after between us and the cape which then bore n by w w and a low sandy point like dungeness s by w from the cape there runs a shoal to the distance of about half a league which may be easily known by the weeds that are upon it we found it high water at half an hour after eleven and the tide rose twenty foot  the natives continued abreast of the ship all night making several great fires and frequently shouting very loud as soon as it was light to some distance they immediately complied  each of these people both men and women had a horse with a decent saddle stirrups and bridle the men had wooden spurs except one who had a large pair of such as are worn in spain brass stirrups and a spanish cimeter without a scabbard but notwithstanding these distinctions he did not appear to have any authority over the rest the women had no spurs the horses appeared to be well made and nimble and were about    hands high the people had also many dogs with them which as well as the horses appeared to be of a spanish breed  as i had two measuring rods with me puncho a square piece of cloth made of the downy hair of the guanico through which a hole being cut for the head the rest hangs round them about as low as the knee the guanico is an animal that in size make and color resembles a deer but it has a hump on its back and no horns these people wear also a kind of drawers which they pull up very tight and buskins which reach from the midleg to the instep before and behind are brought under the heel the rest of the foot is without any covering we observed that several of the men had a red circle painted round the left eye and that others were painted on their arms and on different parts of the face the eyelids of all the young women were painted black they talked much and some of them called out capitane but when they were spoken to in spanish portuguese french and dutch they made no reply of their own language we could distinguish only one word which was chevow we supposed it to be a salutation as they always pronounced it when they shook hands with us and when  while we stayed on shore we saw them eat some of their flesh meat raw particularly the paunch of an ostrich without any other preparation or cleaning than just turning it inside out and shaking it we observed among them several beads such as i gave them and two pieces of red baize which we supposed had been left there or in the neighboring country by commodore byron  after i had spent about four hours with these people i made signs to them that i was going on board and that i would take some of them with me if they were desirous to go as soon as i had made myself understood above an hundred eagerly offered to visit the ship few beads a comb and a lookingglass word from another  when the boat returned on board i sent her off again with the master to sound the shoal that runs off from the point he found it about three miles broad from north to south and that to avoid it it was necessary to keep four miles off the cape in twelve or thirteen fathom water  chap ii the passage through the straight of magellan with some further account of the patagonians and a description of the coast on each side and its inhabitants about one oclock on wednesday the   th of december  when we got about two leagues to the west of dungeness and were standing off shore we fell in with a shoal upon which we had but seven fathom water at half flood this obliged us to make short tacks and keep continually heaving the lead at half an hour after eight in the evening we anchored about three miles from the shore in  0 fathom with a muddy bottom cape virgin mary then bearing n e by e e point possession w s at the distance of about five leagues  about half an hour after we had cast anchor  as we saw great numbers of the natives on horseback abreast of the ship and as captain carteret informed me that this was the place where commodore byron had the conference with the tall men i sent the lieutenants of the swallow and the storeship to the shore but with orders not to land as the ships were at too great a distance to protect them when these gentlemen returned they told me that the boat having lain upon her oars very near the beach the natives came down in great numbers whom they knew to be the same persons they had seen the day before with many others particularly women and children that when they perceived out people had no design to land they seemed to be greatly disappointed and those who had been on board the ship waded off to the boat making signs for it to advance and pronouncing the words they had been taught englishmen come on shore very loud many times that when they found they could not get the people to land they would fain have got into the boat and that it was with great difficulty they were prevented that they presented them with some bread tobacco and a few toys pointing at the same time to some guanicoes and ostriches and making signs that they wanted them as provisions but that they could not make themselves understood that finding they could obtain no refreshment they rowed along the shore in search of fresh water but that seeing no appearance of a rivulet they returned on board  at six oclock the next morning we weighed  from this time to the   d  in the morning of the   d we made sail sometimes backing bores sometimes came down with immense quantities of weeds that we expected every moment to be adrift  the next day made with many fresh shells of muscles and limpets lying about them they saw also several wigwams or huts consisting of young trees which being sharpened at one end and thrust into the ground in a circular form the other ends were brought to meet and fastened together at the top but they saw none of the natives  from this place we saw many high mountains bearing from s to w s w several parts of the summits were covered with snow though it was the midst of summer in this part of the world they were clothed with wood about three parts of their height and above with herbage except where the snow was not yet melted this was the first place where we had seen wood in all south america  at two oclock in the morning of the   th we weighed from the north shore  about four oclock we anchored in port famine bay in    fathom and there being little wind sent all the boats and towed in the swallow and prince frederick  the next morning  on the   th we unbent all the sails  during our whole stay in this place we caught fish enough to furnish one meal a day both for the sick and the well we found also great plenty of celery and peatops which were boiled with the pease and portable soup besides these we gathered great quantities of fruit that resembled the cranberry and the leaves of a shrub somewhat like our thorn which were remarkably sour when we arrived all our people began to look pale and meagre many had the scurvy to a great degree and upon others there were manifest signs of its approach yet in a fortnight there was not a scorbutic person in either of the ships their recovery was effected by their being on shore eating plenty of vegetables being obliged to wash their apparel and keep their persons clean by daily bathing in the sea  the next day we set up the forge on shore  in the mean time a considerable quantity of wood was cut and put on board the storeship to be sent to falklands island and as i well knew there was no wood growing there i caused some thousands of young trees to be carefully taken up with their roots and a proper quantity of earth and packing them in the best manner i could i put them also on board the storeship with orders to deliver them to the commanding officer at port egmont and to sail for that place with the first fair wind putting on board two of my seamen who being in an ill state of health when they first came on board were now altogether unfit to proceed in the voyage  on wednesday the   th of january  after several attempts to sail the master returned from his expedition the master reported that he had found four places in which there was good anchorage between the place where we lay and cape froward that he had been on shore at several places where he had found plenty of wood and water close to the beach with abundance of cranberries and wild celery he reported also that he had seen a great number of current bushes full of fruit though none of it was ripe and a great variety of beautiful shrubs in full blossom bearing flowers of different colors particularly red purple yellow and white besides great plenty of the winters bark a grateful spice which is well known to the botanists of europe he shot several wild ducks geese gulls a hawk and two or three of the birds which the sailors call a racehorse  at five oclock in the morning of sunday the   th  in the morning of monday the   th the mountains for the land he is of a stupendous height cape holland bore w s w w distant two miles and cape froward e our latitude by observation was       s  the next morning we got off some water  having completed our wood and water  at six the next morning deepened to    fathom in the afternoon i sent out the master to examine the bay and a large lagoon and he reported that the lagoon was the most commodious harbor we had yet seen in the straight having five fathom at the entrance and from four to live in the middle that it was capable of receiving a great number of vessels had three large fresh water rivers and plenty of wood and celery we had here the misfortune to have a seine spoiled by being entangled with the wood that lies sunk at the mouth of these rivers but though we caught but little fish we had an incredible number of wild ducks which we found a very good succedaneum  the mountains are here very lofty and the master of the swallow climbed one of the highest hoping that from the summit he should obtain a fight of the south sea but he found his view intercepted by mountains still higher on the southern shore before he descended however he erected a pyramid within which he deposited a bottle containing a shilling and a paper on which was written the ships name and the date of the year a memorial which possibly may remain there as long as the world endures  in the morning of the   th we took two boats and examined cords bay  in this place we saw an animal that resembled an ass but it had a cloven hoof as we discovered afterward by tracking it and was as swift as a deer this was the first animal we had seen in the straight except at the entrance where we found the guanicoes that we would fain have trafficked for with the indians we shot at this creature but we could not hit it probably it is altogether unknown to the naturalists of europe  the country about this place has the most dreary and forlorn appearance that can be imagined the mountains on each side the straight are of an immense height about one fourth of the ascent is covered with trees of a considerable size in the space from thence to the middle of the mountain there is nothing but withered shrubs above these are patches of snow and fragments of broken rock and the summit is altogether rude and naked towering above the clouds in vast crags that are piled upon each other and look like the ruins of nature devoted to everlasting sterility and desolation  we went over in two boats to the royal islands and sounded but found no bottom a very rapid tide set through wherever there was an opening and they cannot be approached by shipping without the most imminent danger whoever navigates this part of the straight should keep the north shore close on board all the way and not venture more than a mile from it till the royal islands are passed the current sets easterly through the whole four and twenty hours and the indraught should by all means be avoided the latitude of cape gallant road is     0 s  we continued in this station taking in wood and water and gathering muscles and herbs distant half a mile and the white patch on charless island s e by s we had fresh gales and heavy flaws off the land and at two oclock the west point of cape gallant bore e distant three leagues and york point w n w distant five leagues at five we opened york road the point bearing n w at the distance of half a mile at this time the ship was taken aback and a strong current with a heavy squall drove us so far to leeward that it was with great difficulty we got into elizabeth bay and anchored in    fathom near a river the swallow being at anchor off the point of the bay and very near the rocks i sent all the boats with anchors and hausers to her assistance and at last she was happily warped to windward into good anchorage york point now bore w by n a shoal with weeds upon it w n w at the distance of a cables length point passage s e e distant half a mile a rock near ruperts isle s e and a rivulet on the bay n e by e distant about three cables length soon after sunset we saw a great smoke on the southern shore and another on prince ruperts island  early in the morning i sent the boats on shore for water with a keen appetite and great seeming satisfaction  when the boat returned she brought three of them on board the ship but they seemed to regard nothing with any degree of curiosity except our clothes and a lookingglass the lookingglass afforded them as much diversion as it had done the patagonians and it seemed to surprise them more when they first peeped into it they started back first looking at us and then at each other they then took another peep as it were by stealth starting back as before and then eagerly looking behind it when by degrees they became familiar with it they smiled and seeing the image smile in return they were exceedingly delighted and burst into fits of the most violent laughter they left this however and every thing else with perfect indifference the little they possessed being to all appearance equal to their desires they eat whatever was given them  when they left the ship i went on shore with them and by this time several of their wives and children were come to the wateringplace i distributed some trinkets among them with which they seemed pleased for a moment and they gave us some of their arms in return they gave us also several pieces of mundic such as is found in the tin mines of cornwall they made us understand that they found it in the mountains where there are probably mines of tin and perhaps of more valuable metal as this seems to be the most dreary and inhospitable country in the world not excepting the worst parts of sweden and norway the people seem to be the lowest and most deplorable of all human beings their perfect indifference to every thing they saw which marked the disparity between our state and their own though it may preserve them from the regret and anguish of unsatisfied desires seems notwithstanding to imply a defect in their nature for those who are satisfied with the gratifications of a brute can have little pretension to the prerogatives of men when they left us and embarked in their canoes they hoisted a seal skin for a sail and steered for the southern shore where we saw many of their hovels and we remarked that not one of them looked behind either at us or at the ship so little impression had the wonders they had seen made upon their minds and so much did they appear to be absorbed in the present without any habitual exercise of their power to reflect upon the past  in this station we continued till tuesday the  d of february on a reef of rocks the wind however suddenly shifted  in the morning stumps of trees at the bottom of the river we then went ashore where we saw many wigwams of the natives and several of their dogs who as soon as we came in sight ran away we also saw some ostriches but they were beyond the reach of our pieces we gathered muscles limpets seaeggs celery and nettles in great abundance about three miles up this river on the west side between mount misery and another mountain of a stupendous height there is a cataract which has a very striking appearance it is precipitated from an elevation of above four hundred yards half the way it rolls over a very steep declivity and the other half is a perpendicular fall the sound of this cataract is not less awful than the sight  in this place contrary winds detained us till  0 oclock in the morning of saturday the   th  here we remained till five oclock in the morning of the   th drove so close to the rock  about one oclock the boats returned having found an anchoring place in a small bay to which we gave the name of butlers bay it having been discovered by mr butler one of the mates it lies to the west of riders bay on the south shore of the straight which is here about two miles wide we ran in with the tide which set fast to the westward and anchored in    fathom water the extremes of the bay from w by n to n w are about a quarter of a mile asunder a small rivulet at the distance of somewhat less than two cables length bore s w and cape quod n at the distance of four miles at this time the swallow was at anchor in island bay on the north shore at about six miles distance  i now sent all the boats out to sound round the ship and in the neighboring bays and they returned with an account that they could find no place fit to receive the ship neither could any such place be found between cape quod and cape notch  in this place we remained till friday the  0th little of the gale but that she had been very near being lost  we continued here eight days during which time we completed our wood and water dried our sails and sent great part of the ships company on shore to wash their clothes and stretch their legs which was the more necessary as the cold snowy and tempestuous weather had confined them too much below we caught muscles and limpets and gathered celery and nettles in great abundance the muscles were the largest we had ever seen many of them being from five to six inches long we caught also great plenty of a fine firm red fish not unlike a gurnet most of which were from four to five pounds weight at the same time we made it part of the employment of every day to try the current which we found constantly setting to the eastward  the master having been sent out to look for anchoring places returned with an account that he could find no shelter except near the shore where it should not be sought but in cases of the most pressing necessity  on sunday the first of march  about three oclock in the afternoon there being little wind we anchored with the swallow under the north shore in a small bay where there is a high steep rocky mountain the top of which resembles the head of a lion for which reason we called the bay lions cove we had here  0 fathom with deep water close to the shore and at half a cables length without the ship no ground we sent the boats to the westward in search of anchoring places and at midnight they returned with an account that there was an indifferent bay at the distance of about four miles and that goodluck bay was three leagues to the westward  at half an hour after    the next day as the wind was southerly and blew fresh she was in great danger for the cove was not only small but full of rocks and open to the southeasterly winds  all the day following  i ordered these jackets to be made very large allowing one with another two yards and thirtyfour inches of the cloth to each jacket i sent also seven bales of the same cloth to the swallow which made every man on board a jacket of the same kind and i cut up three bales of finer cloth and made jackets for the officers of both ships which i had the pleasure to find were very acceptable  in this situation we were obliged to continue a week during which time i put both my own ship and the swallow upon twothirds allowance except brandy but continued the breakfast as long as greens and water were plenty  on sunday the   th about noon  at nine oclock the next morning returned with an account that they could find none at nine we had fresh gales and at midnight cape upright bore s s w w  at seven the next morning  as a great swell came on about noon we hauled over to the north shore we soon found ourselves surrounded with islands but the fog was so thick that we knew not where we were nor which way to steer among these islands the boats were sent to cast the lead but no anchorage was to be found we then conjectured that we were in the bay of islands and that we had no chance to escape shipwreck but by hauling directly out this however was no easy task for i was obliged to tack almost continually to weather some island or rock at four oclock in the afternoon it happily cleared up for a minute just to show us cape upright for which we directly steered and at half an hour after five anchored with the swallow in the bay when we dropped the anchor we were in    fathom and after we had veered away a whole cable in    with a muddy bottom in this situation a high bluff on the north shore bore n w n distant five leagues and a small island within us s by e e soon after we had anchored the swallow drove to leeward notwithstanding she had two anchors ahead but was at last brought up in  0 fathom about a cables length astern of us at four oclock in the morning i sent the boats with a considerable number of men and some hausers and anchors on board her to weigh her anchors and warp her up to windward when her best bower anchor was weighed it was found entangled with the small one i therefore found it necessary to send the stream cable on board and the ship was hung up by it to clear her anchors and warp her into a proper birth cost us the whole day and was not at last effected without the utmost difficulty and labor  on the   th we had fresh breezes  the next morning hook and line i gave them a hatchet or two with some beads  while we lay here we sent out the boats as usual in search of anchoring places and having been  0 leagues to the westward they found but two one was to the westward of cape upright in the bay of islands but was very difficult to enter and get out of the other was called dolphin bay at  0 leagues distance which was a good harbor with even ground in all parts they saw several small coves which were all dangerous as in them it would be necessary to let go the anchor within half a cables length of a lee shore and steady the ship with halsers fastened to the rocks the people belonging to one of the boats spent a night upon an island upon which while they were there six canoes landed about thirty indians the indians ran immediately to the boat and were carrying away every thing they found in her out people discovered what they were doing just time enough to prevent them as soon as they found themselves opposed they went to their canoes and armed themselves with long poles and javelins pointed with the bones of fish they did not begin an attack but stood in a threatening manner our people who were two and twenty in number acted only on the defensive and by parting with a few trifles to them they became friends and behaved peaceably the rest of the time they staid  for many days we had hail lightning rain and hard gales with a heavy sea so that we thought it impossible for the ship to hold though she had two anchors ahead and two cables an end the men however were sent frequently on shore for exercise which contributed greatly to their health and procured an almost constant supply of muscles and greens among other damages that we had sustained our fireplace was broken to pieces we therefore found it necessary to set up the forge and employ the armourers to make a new back we also made lime of burnt shells and once more put it into a useful condition  on monday the  0th  the day following  on thursday the second of april cape tamer  this day two canoes came on board with four men and three young children in each the men were somewhat more decently dressed than those that we had seen before but the children were stark naked they were somewhat fairer than the men who seemed to pay a very tender attention to them especially in lifting them in and out of the canoes to these young visitors i gave necklaces and bracelets with which they seemed mightily pleased it happened that while some of these people were on board and the rest waiting in their canoes by the ships side the boat was sent on shore for wood and water the indians who were in the canoes kept their eyes fixed upon the boat while she was manning and the moment she put off from the ship they called out with great vociferation to those that were on board who seemed to be much alarmed and hastily handing down the children leaped into their canoes without uttering a word none of us could guess at the cause of this sudden emotion but we saw the men in the canoes pull after the boat with all their might hallooing and shouting with great appearance of perturbation and distress the boat outrowed them and when she came near the shore the people on board discovered some women gathering muscles among the rocks this at once explained the mystery the poor indians were afraid that the strangers either by force or favor should violate the prerogative of a husband of which they seemed to be more jealous than the natives of some other countries who in their appearance are less savage and sordid our people to make them easy immediately lay upon their oars and suffered the canoes to pass them the indians however still continued to call out to their women till they took the alarm and ran out of sight and as soon as they got to land drew their canoes upon the beach and followed them with the utmost expedition  we continued daily to gather muscles till the  th  the weather being still tempestuous and unsettled we remained at anchor till  0 oclock in the morning of friday the  0th the other at noon  our latitude by observation was       and we computed our longitude to be    w  thus we quitted a dreary and inhospitable region where we were in almost perpetual danger of shipwreck for near four months having entered the straight on the   th of december      and quitted it on the   th of april      a region where in the midst of summer the weather was cold gloomy and tempestuous where the prospects had more the appearance of a chaos than of nature and where for the most part the valleys were without herbage and the hills without wood  chap iii a particular account of the places in which we anchored during our passage through the straight and of the shoals and rocks that lie near them having cleared the straight we steered a western course but before i continue the narrative of our voyage i shall give a more particular account of the several places where we anchored plans of which are deposited in the admiralty office for the use of future navigators with the shoals and rocks that lie near them the latitude longitude tides and variation of the compass  i cape virgin mary the bay under this cape is a good harbor when the wind is westerly there is a shoal lying off the cape but that may easily be known by the rock weed that grows upon it the cape is a steep white cliff not unlike the south foreland its latitude by observation is       s and its longitude by account       w the variation of the needle by the medium of five azimuths and one amplitude was     0 e in this place we saw no appearance either of wood or water we anchored in  0 fathom with coarse sandy ground about a mile from the shore cape virgin mary bearing n by w w distant about two miles and dungeness point s s w distant four miles we anchored here on the   th of december and sailed the next day there is good landing on a fine sandy beach all along the shore  ii possession bay in sailing into this bay it is necessary to give the point a good birth because there is a reef that runs right off it about a short mile the soundings are very irregular all over the bay but the ground is every where a fine soft mud and clay so that the cables can come to no damage the point lies in latitude       s longitude by account       w the variation is two points easterly in the bay the tide rises and falls between four and five fathom and runs at the rate of about a mile an hour in the midchannel without the bay it runs nearly three miles an hour in this place we saw no appearance either of wood or water the landing appeared to be good but we did not go on shore we anchored here on the   th of december and sailed again on the   d  iii port famine at this place the spaniards in the year      built a town which they called phillippeville and left in it a colony consisting of  00 persons when our celebrated navigator cavendish arrived here in      he found one of these unhappy wretches the only one that remained upon the beach they had all perished for want of subsistence except twentyfour twentythree of these set out for the river plata and were never afterward heard of this man whose name was hernando was brought to england by cavendish who called the place where he had taken him up port famine it is a very fine bay in which there is room and convenience for many ships to moor in great safety we moored in nine fathom having brought cape st anne n e by e and sedger river s w which perhaps is the best situation though the whole bay is good ground in this place there is very good wooding and watering we caught many fine small fish with a hook and line off the ships side and hauled the seine with great success in a fine sandy bay a little to the southward of sedger river we also shot a great number of birds of various kinds particularly geese ducks teal snipes plover and racehorses and we found wild celery in great plenty the latitude of this place is       s longitude by observation       w the variation is two points easterly we anchored here the   th of december      and sailed again the   th of january       iv cape holland bay there is no danger in sailing into this bay and there is good anchoring ground in every part of it we lay at about three cables length from the shore in  0 fathom the ground coarse sand and shells cape holland bearing w s w w distant three miles cape froward a little to the n of the e right abreast of the ship there was a very fine rivulet and close under cape holland a large river navigable for boats many miles the shore also affords fire wood in great plenty we found abundance of wild celery and cranberries muscles and limpets but caught very little fish either with hook and line or the seine we killed some geese ducks teal and racehorses but they were not plenty this bay lies in latitude       s longitude by account       w the variation is two points easterly the water rose about eight feet we found however no regular tide but for the most part a strong current setting to the eastward we anchored here on the   th of january and sailed again on the   d  v cape galllant bay in this bay which may be entered with great safety there is a fine large lagoon where a fleet of ships may moor in perfect security there is a depth of four fathom in every part of it with a soft muddy ground in the bay the best anchoring is on the east side where there is from six to ten fathom here is good watering from two rivers and plenty of wood the lagoon abounded with wild fowl and we found wild celery muscles and limpets in plenty we did not haul the seine having torn one to pieces and the other being unpacked but if we had there is reason to believe that we should have been well supplied with fish the landing is good the latitude of the bay and lagoon is     0 s longitude by account      w the variation is two points easterly i observed the water to rise and fall about nine feet but the tide was very irregular we anchored here the   d of january and sailed again the   th  vi elizabeths bay at the entrance of this bay there are two small reefs which appear above water the most dangerous lies off the east point of the bay but this may easily be avoided by keeping at the distance of about two cables length from the point there is good landing all round the bay but it is much exposed to the westerly winds the best place for anchoring is passage point at half a mile distance bearing s e and the river bearing n e by e distant three cables length in this situation a bank or shoal which may be known by the weeds bears w n w distant a cables length the ground is coarse sand with shells sufficient wood is to be procured here for the use of ships and there is good watering at a small river we found a little celery and a few cranberries but neither fish nor fowl the latitude of this place is       s the longitude by account       w the variation is two points easterly we anchored here the   th of january and sailed the  th of february  vii york road the only danger of sailing into the bay that is formed by two points in this road arises from a reef that runs off to about a cables length from the western point which once known may be easily avoided to anchor in this bay it is safest to bring york point e s e bachelors river n by w w the west point of the bay or reef n w w and st jeromes sound w n w at the distance of half a mile from the shore there is good watering about a mile up bachelors river and good wooding all round the bay where the landing also is in all parts very good we found plenty of celery cranberries muscles and limpets many wild fowl and some fish but not enough to supply the ships company with a fresh meal the latitude here is       s longitude by account       w the variation two points easterly the water rises and falls about eight feet but the tide is irregular the master who crossed the straight many times to examine the bays frequently found the current setting in three different directions we anchored here on the  th of february and sailed again the   th  viii butlers bay this is a small bay entirely surrounded by rocks so that no ship should anchor here if she can possibly avoid it we found however sufficient wood and water to keep up our stock muscles and limpets in plenty some good rockfish and a few wild fowl but celery and cranberries were very scarce this bay lies in latitude       s longitude by account      w the variation is two points easterly the water rises and falls here about four feet but the current always sets to the eastward we anchored here the   th of february and sailed the  st of march  ix lion cove this is a small bay and surrounded by rocks the water is deep but the ground is good it is not a bad place for one ship nor a good one for two here is good watering up a small creek but no wood there is good landing at the wateringplace but no where else we found no refreshment but a few muscles limpets and rockfish with a little celery the latitude is       s longitude by account       w the variation was two points easterly the water as far as we could judge by the appearance of the rocks rises and falls about five feet and the current sets at the rate of about two knots an hour we anchored here on the  d of march and sailed the next day  x goodluck bay this is a small bay and like several others in this straight entirely surrounded by rocks the ground is very coarse and the cable of our best bower anchor was so much rubbed that we were obliged to condemn it and bend a new one at this place there is a little wood and plenty of good water but the rocks render it very difficult of access no man that sees this part of the coast can expect to find any kind of refreshment upon it and indeed we caught nothing except a few rockfish with hook and line there may be circumstances in which it may be good luck to get into this bay but we thought it very good luck to get out of it it lies in latitude       s longitude by account       w the variation is two points easterly the water rises and falls between three and four feet though whenever we had an opportunity of trying the current we found it run easterly we anchored here the  d of march and sailed the   th  xi swallow harbor this harbor when once entered is very safe being sheltered from all winds but the entrance is narrow and rocky the rocks however may be easily avoided by keeping a good lookout as there are large bunches of rockweed upon them all we found here a sufficient supply of wood and water the wood however was very small as the water is constantly smooth here the landing is every where good but we found no supply of provisions except a few muscles and rockfish the mountains round it have the most horrid appearance and seem to be altogether deserted by every thing that has life the latitude is       s the longitude by account       w the variation is two points easterly and the tide rises and falls between four and five feet we anchored here the   th of march and left the place the next day  xii upright bay this bay may be safely entered as there is no obstruction but what is above water the wood here is very small but we found sufficient to keep up our stock the water is excellent and in great plenty as to provisions we got only a few wild fowl rockfishes and muscles the landing is bad the latitude of this place is      s longitude       w the variation two points easterly the water rises and falls about five feet but the tide or current is very irregular we anchored here on the   th of march and sailed again on the  0th of april  there are three very good bays a little beyond cape shutup which we called river bay lodging bay and walliss bay walliss bay is the best  about half way between elizabeths bay and york road lies muscle bay where there is very good anchorage with a westerly wind there is also a bay with good anchorage opposite to york road and another to the eastward of cape crosstide but this will hold only a single ship between cape cross and saint davids head lies saint davids sound on the south side of which we found a bank of coarse sand and shells with a depth of water from    to  0 fathom where a ship might anchor in case of necessity and the master of the swallow found a very good small bay a little to the eastward of saint davids head a little to the eastward of cape quod lies island bay where the swallow lay some time but it is by no means an eligible situation the ground of chance bay is very rocky and uneven and for that reason should be avoided  as all the violent gales by which we suffered in this navigation blew from the westward it is proper to stand about a hundred leagues or more to the westward after sailing out of the straight that the ship may not be endangered on a lee shore which at present is wholly

all our care and attention to prevent it they had vinegar and mustard without limitation wine instead of spirits sweet wort and salop portable soup was still constantly boiled in their peace and oatmeal their birth and clothes were kept perfectly clean the hammocks were constantly brought upon the deck at eight oclock in the morning and carried down at four in the afternoon some of the beds and hammocks were washed every day the water was rendered wholesome by ventilation and every part between decks frequently washed with vinegar  on sunday the   st of may  the next day  on the  d very far distant  when we were within about five miles of this island we saw another bearing n w by w about three oclock in the afternoon being very near the island that was first discovered we brought to and i sent mr faurneaux my second lieutenant my first lieutenant being very ill with the boats manned and armed to the shore as he approached it we saw two canoes put off and paddle away with great expedition toward the island that lay to leeward at seven in the evening the boats returned and brought with them several cocoa nuts and a considerable quantity of scurvy grass they brought also some fish hooks that were made of oystershells and some of the shells of which they were made they reported that they had seen none of the inhabitants but had visited three huts or rather sheds consisting only of a roof neatly thatched with cocoa nut and palm leaves supported upon posts and open all round they saw also several canoes building but found no fresh water nor any fruit but cocoa nuts they sounded but found no anchorage and it was with great difficulty that they got on shore as the surf ran very high having received this account i stood off and on all night anchor  when we came under the lee of the other island i sent lieutenant furneaux with the boats manned and armed to the shore where i saw about fifty of the natives armed with long pikes and several of them running about with firebrands in their hands i ordered mr furneaux to go to that part of the beach where we saw the people and endeavor to traffic with them for fruit and water or whatever else might be useful at the same time being particularly careful to give them no offense i ordered him also to employ the boats in sounding for anchorage about seven oclock he returned and told me that he could find no ground with the line till he came within half a cables length of the shore and that there it consisted of sharp rocks and lay very deep  as the boat approached the shore the indians thronged down toward the beach and put themselves upon their guard with their long pikes as if to dispute the landing our men then lay upon their oars and made signs of friendship showing at the same time several strings of beads  i stood off and on with the ship all night by two other canoes at the west end of the island  the inhabitants of this island were of a middle stature and dark complexion with long black hair which hung loose over their shoulders the men were well made and the women handsome their clothing was a kind of coarse cloth or matting which was fastened about their middle and seemed capable of being brought up round their shoulders  in the afternoon i sent lieutenant furneaux with the boats again on shore he had with him a mate and twenty men who were to make a rolling way for getting the casks down to the beach from the well i gave orders that he should take possession of the island in the name of king george the third and give it the name of queen charlottes island who were enfeebled by the scurvy to take a walk  in the morning board  when we sailed we left a union jack flying upon the island with the ships name the time of our being here and an account of our taking possession of this place and whitsun island in the name of his britannic majesty cut on a piece of wood and in the bark of several trees we also left some hatchets nails glass bottles beads shillings sixpences and halfpence as presents to the natives and an atonement for the disturbance we had given them queen charlottes island is about six miles long and one mile wide lies in latitude       s longitude by observation       w and we found the variation here to be      e  we made sail with a fine breeze and about one oclock saw an island w by s queen charlottes island at this time bearing e by n distant    miles at half an hour after three we were within about three quarters of a mile of the east end of the island and ran close along the shore but had no soundings the east and west ends are joined to each other by a reef of rocks over which the sea breaks into a lagoon in the middle of the island which therefore had the appearance of two islands  at one oclock on the   th one mile to one quarter of a mile broad i gave the name of gloucester island  at five oclock in the morning  at daybreak on saturday the   th  soon after daylight on the   th  at five in the evening  the next morning the men  chap v an account of the discovery of king george the thirds island or otaheite and of several incidents which happened both on board the ship and on shore at two oclock the same day we bore away hour one of them by signs while he was thus engaged  as we had no anchorage here we stood along the shore sending the boats at the same time to sound at a less distance as none of these canoes had sails they could not keep up with us and therefore soon paddled back toward the shore the country has the most delightful and romantic appearance that can be imagined toward the sea it is level and is covered with fruit trees of various kinds particularly the cocoa nut among these are the houses of the inhabitants consisting only of a roof and at a distance having greatly the appearance of a long barn the country within at about the distance of three miles rises into lofty hills that are crowned with wood and terminate in peaks from which large rivers are precipitated into the sea we saw no shoals but found the island skirted by a reef of rocks through which there are several openings into deep water about three oclock in the afternoon we brought to abreast of a large bay where there was an appearance of anchorage the boats were immediately sent to sound it and while they were thus employed i observed a great number of canoes gather round them i suspected that the indians had a design to attack them and as i was very desirous to prevent mischief i made the signal for the boats to come aboard and at the same time to intimidate the indians i fired a nine pounder over their heads as soon as the cutter began to stand toward the ship the indians in their canoes though they had been startled by the thunder of our nine pounder endeavored to cut her off the boat however sailing faster than the canoes could paddle soon got clear of those that were about her but some others that were full of men  the officers who had been sent out with the boats informed me that they had sounded close to the reef and found as great a depth of water as at the other islands however as i was now on the weather side of the island i had reason to expect anchorage in running to leeward i therefore took this course but finding breakers that ran off to a great distance from the southend of the island i hauled the wind and continued turning to windward all night in order to run down on the east side of the island  at five oclock in the morning we made sail shore  the boats continued sounding till noon when they returned with an account that the ground was very clear that it was at the depth of five fathom within a quarter of a mile of the shore but that there was a very great surf where we had seen the water the officers told me that the inhabitants swarmed upon the beach and that many of them swam off to the boat with fruit and bamboos filled with water they said that they were very importunate with them to come on shore particularly the women who came down to the beach and stripping themselves naked  in the afternoon i sent the boats again to the shore with some barecas or small casks which are filled at the head and have a handle by which they are carried to endeavor to procure some water of which we began to be in great want in the mean time many of the canoes continued about the ship but the indians had been guilty of so many thefts that i would not suffer any more of them to come on board  at five in the evening the boats returned with only two barecas of water which the natives had filled for them and as a compensation for their trouble they thought fit to detain all the rest our people who did not leave their boat tried every expedient they could think of to induce the indians to return their water vessels but without success and the indians in their turn were very pressing for our people to come on shore which they thought it prudent to decline there were many thousands of the inhabitants of both sexes and a great number of children on the beach when our boats came away  the next morning see a description of this fruit in the account of the voyage of the endeavor  plantains a fruit resembling an apple only better fowls and hogs which we purchased with beads nails knives and other articles of the like kind so that we procured pork enough to serve the ships company two days  when the boats returned they brought us only a few calibashes of water for the number of people on the beach was so great that they would not venture to land though the young women repeated the allurements which they had practiced the day before with still more wanton and if possible less equivocal gestures fruit and provisions of various kinds were brought down and ranged upon the beach of which our people were also invited to partake as an additional inducement for them to leave the boat they continued however inexorable and showing the indians the barecas on board made signs that they should bring down those which had been detained the day before to this the indians were inexorable in their turn and our people therefore weighed their grapplings and sounded all round the place to see whether the ship could come in near enough to cover the waterers in which case they might venture on shore in defiance of the whole island when they put off the women pelted them with apples and bananas shouting and showing every mark of derision and contempt that they could devise they reported that the ship might ride in four fathom water with sandy ground at two cables length from the shore and in five fathom water at three cables length the wind here blew right along the shore raising a great surf on the side of the vessel and on the beach  at daybreak masthead and immediately bore away for it  we now stood off and the boats being sent to leeward found that the reef ran down to the westward about a mile and a half and that beyond it there was a very good harbor the master after having placed a boat at the end of the reef and furnished the longboat with anchor and hausers and a guard to defend her from an attack of the indians  the place where the ship struck appeared upon farther examination to be a reef of sharp coral rock with very unequal soundings from six fathom to two and it happened unfortunately to lie between the two boats that were placed as a direction to the ship the weathermost boat having    fathom and the leewardmost nine the wind freshened almost as soon as we got off and though it soon became calm again the surf ran so high and broke with such violence upon the rock that if the ship had continued fast half an hour longer she must inevitably have been beaten to pieces upon examining her bottom we could not discover that she had received any damage except that a small piece was beaten off the bottom of the rudder she did not appear to admit any water but the trussletrees at the head of all the masts were broken short which we supposed to have happened while she was beating against the rock our boats lost their grapplings upon the reef but as we had reason to hope that the ship was sound they gave us very little concern as soon as the ship was secured i sent the master with all the boats manned and armed to sound the upper part of the bay that if he found good anchorage we might warp the ship up within the reef and anchor her in safety the weather was now very pleasant a great number of canoes were upon the reef and the shore was crowded with people  about four in the afternoon the master returned and reported that there was every where good anchorage i therefore determined to warp the ship up the bay early in no     the morning and in the mean time  at six oclock the next morning stones coming off of others  having now no reason to fear any further interruption we warped the ship up the harbor and by noon we were not more than half a mile from the upper part of the bay  soon after the master had brought me this account i sent mr furneaux again with all the boats manned and armed the marines being also put on board with orders to land opposite to our station and secure himself under cover of the boats and the ship in the clearest ground he could find about two oclock the boats landed without any opposition and mr furneaux stuck up a staff upon which he hoisted a pendant turned a turf and took possession of the island in his majestys name in honor of whom he called it king george the thirds island he then went to the river and tasted the water which he found excellent and mixing some of it with rum every man drank his majestys health while he was at the river this ceremony  at night soon after it was dark we heard the noise of many drums with conchs and other wind instruments and saw a multitude of lights all along the coast keeping close along the shore their fortune in a second attack  at two oclock in the afternoon they had left upon the beach for them  the next morning i sent the boats on shore word of all that he had said endeavored to convince him  chap vi the sick sent on shore and a regular trade established with the natives some account of their character and manners of their visits on board the ship and a variety of incidents that happened during this intercourse matters being thus happily settled they all ran away  as i foresaw that a private traffic would probably commence between such of our people as were on shore and the natives and that if it was left to their own caprice perpetual quarrels and mischief would ensue i ordered that all matters of traffic should be transacted by the gunner on behalf of both parties and i directed him to see that no injury was done to the natives either by violence or fraud and by all possible means to attach the old man to his interest this service he performed with great diligence and fidelity nor did he neglect to complain of those who transgressed my orders which was of infinite advantage to all parties for as i punished the first offenders with a necessary severity many irregularities that would otherwise have produced the most disagreeable consequences were prevented we were also indebted for many advantages to the old man whose caution kept our people perpetually upon their guard and soon brought back those who straggled from the party the natives would indeed sometimes pilfer but by the terror of a gun without using it he always found means to make them bring back what was stolen a fellow had one day the dexterity and address to cross the river unperceived  at this time the people on board were employed in caulking and painting the weatherwork overhauling the rigging stowing the hold and doing other necessary business but my disorder which was a bilious cholic increased so much that this day i was obliged to take to my bed my first lieutenant also still continued very ill and the purser was incapable of his duty the whole command devolved upon mr furneaux the second lieutenant to whom i gave general directions and recommended a particular attention to the people on shore i also ordered that fruit and fresh provisions should be served to the ships company as long as they could be procured and that the boats should never be absent from the ship after sunset  sunday the   th was marked by no incident  while the gunner was trafficking for provisions on shore we sometimes hauled the seine but we caught no fish we also frequently crawled but with no better success the disappointment however was not felt for the produce of the island enabled our people to fare sumptuously every day  all matters continued in the same situation till the  d of july when our old man being absent serve most of the messes reserving plenty for the sick and convalescent  on the  d  on sunday the  th  while our people were on shore several young women were permitted to cross the river who though they were not averse to the granting of personal favors knew the value of them too well not to stipulate for a consideration  on tuesday the  th that refreshments might there be bought at the original price  the commerce which our men had found means to establish with the women of the island rendered them much less obedient to the orders that had been given for the regulation of their conduct on shore than they were at first i found it necessary therefore to read the articles of war and i punished james proctor the corporal of marines who had not only quitted his station and insulted the officer but struck the master at arms such a blow as brought him to the ground  the next day  from this time our market was very ill supplied  on saturday the   th grace  the next morning i went on shore for the first time no     roof being open as soon as we entered the house little trouble as it would have cost me to have lifted over a child if i had been well  the next morning i sent her by the gunner  on the   th bitterly  the next morning i sent the second lieutenant but did not seem willing to part with any of the provisions which our people were most desirous to purchase  on thursday the   th the first lieutenant was not yet recovered  accordingly the next morning she came down to the beach and soon after a great number of people  in the afternoon of the next day  the next morning  on the  0th we continued to trade with good success the gauntlet thrice round the deck  on the   st upon which she burst into tears and it was not without great difficulty that she was pacified  the next morning  on the   d we had very heavy rain  the next day i sent the old man  in the morning of the   th  hours min seconds the immersion began by true time at       0 the emersion by true time was at     0 the duration of the eclipse was      0  the latitude of the point on which the observation was made was     0 s the suns declination was     0 n and the variation of the needle      e  after the observation was taken i went to the queens house and showed her the telescope which was a reflector after she had admired its structure i endeavored to make her comprehend its use and fixing it so as to command several distant objects with which she was well acquainted but which could not be distinguished with the naked eye i made her look through it as soon as the saw them she started back with astonishment and directing her eye as the glass was pointed stood some time motionless and silent she then looked through the glass again and again sought in vain with the naked eye for the objects which it discovered as they by turns vanished and reappeared her countenance and gestures expressed a mixture of wonder and delight which no language can describe  in the evening our people returned from their excursion and came down to the beach upon which i put the queen and her attendants into the boats and sent them on shore as she was going over the ships side she asked by signs whether i still persisted in my resolution of leaving the island at the time i had fixed and when i made her understand that it was impossible i should stay longer she expressed her regret by a flood of tears which for a while took away her speech as soon as her passion subsided she told me that she would come on board again the next day and thus we parted  chap vii an account of an expedition to discover the inland part of the country and our other transactions till we quitted the island to continue our voyage after the mate came on board  at four oclock in the morning of saturday the   th of june i landed with four midshipmen a sergeant and twelve marines and twentyfour seamen all armed besides four who carried hatchets and other articles of traffic and four who were loaded with ammunition and provisions the rest being left with the boat every man had his days allowance of brandy and the hatchet men two small kegs to give out when i should think proper  as soon as i got on shore i called upon our old man and took him with us we then followed the course of the river in two parties one marching on each side for the first two miles it flowed through a valley of considerable width in which were many habitations with gardens walled in and abundance of hogs poultry and fruit the soil here seemed to be a rich fat earth and was of a blackish color after this the valley became very narrow and the ground rising abruptly on one side of the river we were all obliged to march on the other where the stream was precipitated from the hills channels had been cut to lead the water into gardens and plantations of fruit trees in these gardens we found an herb which had never been brought down to the waterside and which we perceived the inhabitants eat raw calleloor though its leaf was very different the ground was fenced off so as to make a very pretty appearance the breadfruit and apple trees were planted in rows on the declivity of the hills and the cocoa nut and plantain which require more moisture on the level ground under the trees both on the sides and at the foot of the hills there was very good grass but no underwood as we advanced the windings of the stream became innumerable the hills on each side swelled into mountains and vast crags every where projected over our heads traveling now became difficult and when we had proceeded about four miles the road for the last mile having been very bad we sat down to rest ourselves and take the refreshment of our breakfast we ranged ourselves upon the ground under a large apple tree in a very pleasant spot but just as we were about to begin our repast we were suddenly alarmed by a confused sound of many voices and a great shouting and presently afterward saw a multitude of men women and children upon the hill above us our old man seeing us rise hastily and look to our arms beckoned to us to sit still and immediately went up to the people that had surprised us as soon as he joined them they were silent and soon after disappeared in a short time however they returned and brought with them a large hog ready roasted with plenty of breadfruit yams and other refreshments which they gave to the old man who distributed them among our people in return for this treat i gave them some nails buttons and other things with which they were greatly delighted after this we proceeded up the valley as far as we could searching all the runs of water and all the places where water had run for appearances of metal or ore climbing we flattered ourselves that from the top we should command the whole island what difficulties we might meet with before we got back to the ship  about  0 oclock the gunner sent off near thirty hogs enough to go with us  at break of day on monday the   th people made it fast  at noon the harbor from which we sailed bore s e e distant about twelve miles it lies in latitude     0 s longitude   0 w and i gave it the name of port royal harbor  chap viii a more particular account of the inhabitants of otaheite and of their domestic life manners and arts having lain off this if island from the   th of june to the   th of july  the inhabitants of this island are a stout wellmade active and comely people the stature of the men in general is from five feet seven to five feet ten inches though a few individuals are taller and a few shorter that of the women from five feet to five feet six the complexion of the men is tawney but those that go upon the water are much redder than those who live on shore their hair in general is black but in some it is brown in some red and in others flaxen which is remarkable because the hair of all other natives of asia africa and america is black without a single exception it is generally tied up either in one bunch in the middle of the head or in two one on each side but some wear it loose and it then curls very strongly in the children of both sexes it is generally flaxen they have no combs yet their hair is very neatly dressed and those who had combs from us made good use of them it is a universal custom to anoint the head with cocoanut oil in which a root has been scraped that smells something like roses the women are all handsome and some of them extremely beautiful chastity does not seem to be considered as a virtue among them for they not only readily and openly trafficked with our people for personal favors but were brought down by their fathers and brothers for that purpose they were however conscious of the value of beauty and the size of the nail that was demanded for the enjoyment of the lady was always in proportion to her charms the men who came down to the side of the river at the same time that they presented the girl showed a stick of the size of the nail that was to be her price and if our people agreed she was sent over to them for the men were not permitted to cross the river this commerce was carried on a considerable time before the officers discovered it for while some straggled a little way to receive the lady the others kept a lookout when i was acquainted with it i no longer wondered that the ship was in danger of being pulled to pieces for the nails and iron that held her together which i had before puzzled myself to account for in vain the whole ships company having daily as much fresh provision and fruit as they could eat both men and women are not only decently but gracefully clothed in a kind of white cloth that is made of the bark of a shrub and very much resembles coarse china paper their dress consists of two pieces of this cloth one of them a hole having been made in the middle to put the head through hangs down from the shoulders to the midleg before and behind another piece which is between four and five yards long and about one yard broad they wrap round the body in a very easy manner this cloth is not woven but is made like paper of the macerated fibers of an inner bark spread out and beaten together their ornaments are feathers flowers pieces of shells and pearls the pearls are worn chiefly by the women from whom i purchased about two dozen of a small size they were of a good color but were all spoiled by boring mr furneaux saw several in his excursion to the west but he could purchase none with any thing he had to offer i observed that it was here a universal custom both for men and women to have the hinder part of their thighs and loins marked very thick with black lines in various forms these marks were made by striking the teeth of an instrument somewhat like a comb just through the skin and rubbing into the punctures a kind of paste made of foot and oil which leaves an indelible stain the boys and girls under twelve years of age are not marked but we observed a few of the men whose legs were marked in chequers by the same method and they appeared to be persons of superior rank and authority one of the principal attendants upon the queen appeared much more disposed to imitate our manners than the rest and our people with whom he soon became a favorite distinguished him by the name of jonathan this man mr furneaux clothed completely in an english dress and it sat very easy upon him our officers were always carried on shore it being shoal water where we landed and jonathan assuming new state with his new finery made some of his people carry him on shore in the same manner he very soon attempted to use a knife and fork at his meals but at first when he had stuck a morsel upon his fork and tried to feed himself with that instrument he could not guide it but by the mere force of habit his hand came to his mouth and the victuals at the end of the fork went away to his car  their food consists of pork poultry dogs flesh and fish breadfruit bananas plantains yams apples and a four fruit which though not pleasant by itself gives an agreeable relish to roasted breadfruit with which it is frequently beaten up they have abundance of rats but as far as i could discover these make no part of their food the river affords them good mullet but they are neither large nor in plenty they find conchs muscles and other shellfish on the reef which they gather at low water and eat raw with breadfruit before they come on shore they have also very fine crayfish and they catch with lines and hooks of mother of pearl at a little distance from the shore parrotfish groopers and many other sorts of which they are so fond that we could seldom prevail upon them to sell us a few at any price they have also nets of an enormous size with very small meshes and with these they catch abundance of small fish about the size of sardines but while they were using both nets and lines with great success we could not catch a single fish with either we procured some of their hooks and lines but for want of their art we were still disappointed  the manner in which they dress their food is this they kindle a fire by rubbing the end of one piece of dry wood upon the side of another in the same manner as our carpenters whet a chissel then they dig a pit about half a foot deep and two or three yards in circumference they pave the bottom with large pebble stones which they lay down very smooth and even and then kindle a fire in it with dry wood leaves and the husks of the cocoanut when the stones are sufficiently heated they take out the embers and rake up the ashes on every side then they cover the stones with a layer of green cocoanuttree leaves and wrap up the animal that is to be dressed in the leaves of the plantain if it is a small hog they wrap it up whole if a large one they split it when it is placed in the pit they cover it with the hot embers and lay upon them breadfruit and yams which are also wrapped up in the leaves of the plantain over these they spread the remainder of the embers mixing among them some of the hot stones with more cocoanuttree leaves upon them and then close all up with earth so that the heat is kept in after a time proportioned to the size of what is dressing the oven is opened and the meat taken out which is tender full of gravy and in my opinion better in every respect than when it is dressed any other way excepting the fruit they have no sauce but salt water nor any knives but shells with which they carve very dexterously always cutting from them it is impossible to describe the astonishment they expressed when they saw the gunner who while he kept the market used to dine on shore dress his pork and poultry by boiling them in a pot having as i have before observed no vessel that would bear the fire they had no idea of hot water or its effects but from the time that the old man was in possession of an iron pot he and his friends eat boiled meat every day the iron pots which i afterward gave to the queen and several of the chiefs were also in constant use and brought as many people together as a monster or a puppetshow in a country fair they appeared to have no liquor for drinking but water and to be happily ignorant of the art of fermenting the juice of any vegetable so as to give it an intoxicating quality they have as has been already observed the sugarcane but they seemed to make no other use of it than to chew which they do not do habitually but only break a piece off when they happen to pass by a place where it is growing  of their domestic life and amusements we had not sufficient opportunity to obtain much knowledge but they appear sometimes to have wars with each other not only from their weapons but the scars with which many of them were marked and some of which appeared to be the remains of very considerable wounds made with stones bludgeons or some other obtuse weapon by these scars also they appear to be no inconsiderable proficients in surgery of which indeed we happened to have more direct evidence one of our seamen when he was on shore run a large splinter into his foot and the surgeon being on board one of his comrades endeavored to take it out with a penknife but after putting the poor fellow to a good deal of pain was obliged to give it over our good old indian who happened to be present then called over one of his countrymen that was standing on the opposite side of the river who having looked at the seamans foot went immediately down to the beach and taking up a shell broke it to a point with his teeth with this instrument in little more than a minute he laid open the place and extracted the splinter in the mean time the old man who as soon as he had called the other over went a little way into the wood returned with some gum which he applied to the wound upon a piece of the cloth that was wrapped round him and in two days time it was perfectly healed we afterward learned that this gum was produced by the apple tree and our surgeon procured some of it and used it as a vulnerary balsam with great success  the habitations of these happy people i have described already and besides these we saw several sheds enclosed within a wall on the outside of which there were several uncouth figures of men women hogs and dogs carved on posts that were driven into the ground several of the natives were from time to time seen to enter these places with a slow pace and dejected countenance from which we conjectured that they were repositories of the dead the area within the walls of these places was generally well paved with large round stones but it appeared not to be much trodden for the grass every where grew up between them i endeavored with particular attention to discover whether they had a religious worship among them but never could find the least traces of any  the boats or canoes of these people are of three different sorts some are made out of a single tree and carry from two to six men these are used chiefly for fishing and we constantly saw many of them busy upon the reef some were constructed of planks very dexterously sewed together these were of different sizes and would carry from ten to forty men two of them were generally lashed together and two masts set up between them if they were single they had an outrigger on one side and only one mast in the middle with these vessels they sail far beyond the sight of land probably to other islands and bring home plantains bananas and yams which seem also to be more plenty upon other parts of this island than that off which the ship lay a third sort seem to be intended principally for pleasure and show they are very large but have no sail and in shape resemble the gondolas of venice the middle is covered with a large awning and some of the people sit upon it some under it none of these vessels came near the ship except on the first and second day after our arrival but we saw three or four times a week a procession of eight or ten of them passing at a distance with streamers flying and a great number of small canoes attending them while many hundreds of people ran abreast of them along the shore they generally rowed to the outward point of a reef which lay about four miles to the westward of us where they stayed about an hour and then returned these processions however are never made but in fine weather and all the people on board are dressed though in the other canoes they have only a piece of cloth wrapped round their middle those who rowed and steered were dressed in white those who sat upon the awning and under it in white and red and two men who were mounted on the prow of each vessel were dressed in red only we sometimes went out to observe them in our boats and though we were never nearer than a mile we saw them with our glasses as distinctly as if we had been upon the spot  the plank of which these vessels are constructed is made by splitting a tree with the grain into as many thin pieces as they can they first fell the tree with a kind of hatchet or adze made of a tough greenish kind of stone very dexterously fitted into a handle it is then cut into such lengths as are required for the plank one end of which is heated till it begins to crack and then with wedges of hard wood they split it down some of these planks are two feet broad and from    to  0 feet long the sides are smoothed with adzes of the same materials and construction but of a smaller size six or eight men are sometimes at work upon the same plank together and as their tools presently lose their edge every man has by him a cocoa nutshell filled with water and a flat stone with which he sharpens his adze almost every minute these planks are generally brought to the thickness of about an inch and are afterward fitted to the boat with the same exactness that would be expected from an expert joiner to fasten these planks together holes are bored with a piece of bone that is fixed into a stick for that purpose a use to which our nails were afterward applied with great advantage and through these holes a kind of plaited cordage is passed so as to hold the planks strongly together the seams are caulked with dried rushes and the whole outside of the vessel is paid with a gummy juice which some of their trees produce in great plenty and which is a very good succedaneum for pitch  the wood which they use for their large canoes is that of the apple tree which grows very tall and strait several of them that we measured were near eight feet in the girth and from  0 to  0 to the branches with very little diminution in the size our carpenter said that in other respects it was not a good wood for the purpose being very light the small canoes are nothing more than the hollowed trunk of the breadfruit tree which is still more light and spongy the trunk of the breadfruit tree is six feet in girth and about  0 feet to the branches  their principal weapons are stones thrown either with the hand or sling and bludgeons for though they have bows and arrows the arrows are only fit to knock down a bird none of them being pointed but headed only with a round stone  i did not see one turtle all the while i lay off this island but upon showing some small ones which i brought from queen charlottes island to the inhabitants they made signs that they had them of a much larger size i very much regretted my having lost our hegoat which died soon after we left saint iago and that neither of our shegoats of which we had two were with kid if the hegoat had lived i would have put them all on shore at this place and i would have left a shegoat here if either of them had been with kid and i doubt not but that in a few years they would have stocked the island  the climate here appears to be very good and the island to be one of the most healthy as well as delightful spots in the world we saw no appearance of disease among the inhabitants the hills are covered with wood and the valleys with herbage and the air in general is so pure that notwithstanding the heat our flesh meat kept very well two days and our fish one we met with no frog toad scorpion centipied or serpent of any kind and the only troublesome insects that we saw were ants of which there were but few  the southeast part of the island seems to be better cultivated and inhabited than where we lay for we saw every day boats come round from thence laden with plantains and other fruit and we always found greater plenty and a lower price soon after their arrival than before  the tide rises and falls very little and being governed by the winds is very uncertain though they generally blow from the e to the s s e and for the most part a pleasant breeze  the benefit that we received while we lay off this island with respect to the health of the ships company was beyond our most sanguine expectations for we had not now an invalid on board except the two lieutenants and myself and we were recovering though still in a very feeble condition  it is certain that none of our people contracted the venereal disease here and therefore as they had free commerce with great numbers of the women there is the greatest probability that it was not then known in the country it was however found here by captain cook in the endeavor and as no european vessel is known to have visited this island before captain cooks arrival but the dolphin and the boudeuse and etoil commanded by m bougainville the reproach of having contaminated with that dreadful pest a race of happy people to whom its miseries had till then been unknown must be due either to him or to me to england or to france and i think myself happy to be able to exculpate myself and my country beyond the possibility of doubt  it is well known that the surgeon on board his majestys ships keeps a list of the persons who are sick on board specifying their diseases and the times when they came under his care and when they were discharged it happened that i was once at the paytable on board a ship when several sailors objected to the payment of the surgeon alleging that although he had discharged them from the list and reported them to be cured yet their cure was incomplete from this time it has been my constant practice when the surgeon reported a man to be cured who had been upon the sick list to call the man before me and ask him whether the report was true if he alleged that any symptoms of his complaint remained i continued him upon the list if not i required him as a confirmation of the surgeons report to sign the book which was always done in my presence a copy of the sick list on board the dolphin during this voyage signed by every man in my presence when he was discharged well in confirmation of the surgeons report written in my own hand and confirmed by my affidavit i have deposited in the admiralty by which it appears that the last man on board the ship in her voyage outward who was upon the sick list for the venereal disease except one who was sent to england in the store ship was discharged cured and signed the book on the   th of december      near six months before our arrival at otaheite which was on the   th of june      and that the first man who was upon the list for that disease in our return home was entered on the   th of february      six months after we left the island which was on the   th of july      so that the ships company was entirely free fourteen months within one day the very middle of which time we spent at otaheite and the man who was first entered as a venereal patient on our return home was known to have contracted the disease at the cape of good hope where we then lay  sir charles saunders island latitude      south longitude   0   west of london osnaburgh island latitude      south longitude     00 west  boscawens island latitude    0 south long     0

some account of several other islands that were discovered in the south seas having made sail from king george the thirds island  at daylight the next morning we saw land  on the   th the variation of the compass by azimuth by breakers  in the afternoon we saw land bearing w by n and stood for it at five oclock we saw breakers running a great way out to the southward and soon after low land to the s w and breakers all about it in every direction  we turned to windward all night and as soon as it was light crowded sail to get round these shoals at nine we got round them and named them scilly islands  we continued to steer our course westward till daybreak on the   th of august  at two oclock being about two miles distant from boscawens island we saw several of the inhabitants but keppels isle being to windward and appearing more likely to afford us anchorage we hauled up for it at six it was not more than a mile and an half distant and with our glasses  at four oclock the next morning  having received this account  in consequence of this resolution at noon i bore away and passed boscawens island without visiting it it is a high round island abounding in wood and full of people but keppels isle is by far the largest and the best of the two  boscawens island lies in latitude     0 s longitude     w and keppels isle in latitude       s longitude       w  we continued a w n w course till  0 oclock in the morning of sunday the   th map we saw a few huts  the boats rowed close along the shore and found it rocky with trees growing close down to the waterside these trees were of different sorts many of them very large but had no fruit on the leeside however there were a few cocoanuts but not a single habitation was to be seen they discovered several small rills of water which by clearing might have been made to run in a larger stream soon after they had got close to the shore several canoes came up to them each having six or eight men on board they appeared to be a robust active people and were quite naked except a kind of mat that was wrapped round their middle they were armed with large maces or clubs such as hercules is represented with two of which they sold to the master for a nail or two and some trinkets as our people had seen no animal either bird or beast except seafowl they were very desirous to learn of the natives whether they had either but could not make themselves understood it appears that during this conference a design was formed to seize our cutter for one of the indians suddenly laid hold of her painter and hauled her upon the rocks our people endeavored in vain to make them desist till they fired a musket cross the nose of the man that was most active in the mischief no hurt was done but the fire and report so affrighted them that they made off with great precipitation both our boats then put off but the water had fallen so suddenly that they found it very difficult to get back to the ship for when they came into deep water they found the points of rocks standing up and the whole reef except in one part was now dry and a great sea broke over it the indians probably perceived their distress for they turned back and followed them in their canoes all along the reef till they got to the breach  about six in the evening it being then dark the boats returned and the master told me that all within the reef was rocky but that in two or three places at about two cables length without it there was anchorage in       and    fathom upon sand and coral the breach in the reef he found to be about  0 fathom broad and here if pressed by necessity he said a ship might anchor or moor in   fathom but that it would not be safe to moor with a greater length than half a cable  when i had hoisted the boats in i ran down four miles to leeward where we lay till the morning and then finding that the current had set us out of sight of the island i made sail the officers did me the honor to call this island after my name  as the latitudes and longitudes of all these islands are accurately laid down and plans of them delivered in to the admiralty it will be easy for any ship that shall hereafter navigate these seas to find any of them either to refresh or to make farther discoveries of their produce  i thought it very remarkable that although we found no kind of metal in any of these islands yet the inhabitants of all of them the moment they got a piece of iron in their possession began to sharpen it but made no such attempt on brass or copper  we continued to steer n westerly and many birds were from time to time seen about the ship till the   th walliss islands map and was webfooted we also saw several plantain leaves and cocoanuts pass by the ship  on saturday the   th  on thursday the  d of september  at eight oclock the islands which i judged to be two of the piscadores bore from s w by w to w and to windward from n by e to n e and had the appearance of small flat keys they were distant about three leagues but many others much farther off were in sight the latitude of one of those islands is    n longitude      0 w and the other     0 n longitude        w  on the  th we saw a curlieu and a pewit  on the   th we saw two gannets the afternoon  chap xi some account of the present state of the island of tinian and our employment there with what happened in the run from thence to batavia as soon as the ship was secured i sent the boats on shore to erect tents and bring off some refreshments and about noon they returned with some cocoanuts limes and oranges  in the evening the tents being erected i sent the surgeon and all the invalids on shore with two months provisions of every kind for forty men the smiths forge and a chest of carpenters tools i then landed myself with the first lieutenant both of us being in a very sickly condition taking with us also a mate and twelve men to go up the country and hunt for cattle  when we first came to an anchor  at six in the evening  early the next morning  in this place we got beef pork poultry papaw apples breadfruit limes oranges and every refreshment that is mentioned in the account of lord ansons voyage the sick began to recover from the day they first went on shore the air however was so different here from what we found it in king georges island that flesh meat which there kept sweet two days could here be scarcely kept sweet one there had been many cocoanut trees near the landingplace but they had been all wastefully cut down for the fruit and none being grown up in their stead we were forced to go three miles into the country before a single nut could be procured the hunters also suffered incredible fatigue for they were frequently obliged to go ten or twelve miles through one continued thicket and the cattle were so wild that it was very difficult to come near them so that i was obliged to relieve one party by another and it being reported that cattle were more plenty at the north end of the island but

here a dutch commodore with sixteen sail of dutch east indiamen a french east india ship and the admiral watson captain griffin an east india packet boat for bengal we saluted the governor with thirteen guns and he returned the same number the admiral watson saluted us with eleven guns and we returned nine the french ship afterward saluted us with nine guns and we returned seven  having got off some mutton for the ships company with plenty of greens i sent the surgeon on shore to hire quarters for the sick but he could procure none for less than two shillings a day and a stipulation to pay more if any of them should take the smallpox which was then in almost every house in proportion to the malignity of the disease the first expense being great and it appearing upon enquiry that many of our people had never had the smallpox so that the increase was likely to be considerable besides the danger i requested the governors permission to erect a tent upon a spacious plain at about two miles distance from the town called green point and to send my people on shore thither during the day under the care of an officer to prevent their straggling this permission the governor immediately granted and gave orders that they should suffer no molestation  in this place therefore i ordered tents to be erected and the surgeon and his mate with proper officers to attend at the same time strictly charging that no man should be suffered to go into the town and that no liquor should be brought to the tents all the sick except two left the ship early in the morning with their provisions and firing and for those that were reduced to great weakness i ordered the surgeon to procure such extraordinary provisions as he should think proper particularly milk though it was sold at an excessive price about six in the evening they returned on board and seemed to be greatly refreshed at the same time being extremely ill myself i was obliged to be put on shore and carried about eight miles up the country where i continued all the time the ship lay here and when she was ready to sail returned on board without having received the least benefit  no time however was lost in

mdcclxviii and mdcclxix by philip carteret esquire commander of his majestys sloop the swallow  chap i the run from plymouth to madeira and from thence through the straight of magellan the longitude in this voyage is reckoned from london westward to   0 and eastward afterward soon after i returned from a voyage round the world with the honorable commodore byron which i knew by experience would be of the utmost importance if it was intended that i should make another voyage round the world but i was told that the vessel and her equipment were very fit for the service she was to perform and none of the requisites for which i applied were allowed me i was therefore confirmed in my opinion that if the dolphin was to go round the world it could never be intended that i should go farther than falklands islands where the jason a fine frigate which was like the dolphin sheathed with copper and amply equipped would supply my place i was however deficient in junk an article which is essentially necessary in every voyage and for this i applied when i got to plymouth but i was told that a quantity sufficient for both the ships had been put on board the dolphin  on friday the   d of august  while i lay at this place not being yet acquainted with my destination i represented my want of junk and the reply that had been made to my application for a supply by the commissioner at plymouth in a letter to captain wallis who sent me five hundred weight this quantity however was so inadequate to my wants that i was soon afterward reduced to the disagreeable necessity of cutting off some of my cables to save my rigging  on the  th very early in the morning get a skinful of liquor  we sailed again on the   th  i was now convinced that i had been sent upon a service to which my vessel and her equipment were by no means equal  we proceeded on our voyage without any remarkable event till we anchored off cape virgin mary where we saw the patagonians of which i have given some account in a letter to dr matty which was published in the sixtieth volume of the transactions of the royal society and which it is not necessary here to repeat as it is in general the same as those which have been given by commodore byron and captain wallis  when we entered the straight i was ordered to keep ahead of the dolphin and the storeship to pilot them through the shoals but my ship worked so ill that we could but very seldom make her tack without the help of a boat to tow her round however with much labor and at no inconsiderable risk we anchored in port famine on friday the   th of december  after many difficulties and dangers  we continued therefore for some time to navigate the straight together and as i had passed it before i was ordered to keep ahead and lead the way with liberty to anchor and weigh when i thought proper but perceiving that the bad sailing of the swallow would so much retard the dolphin as probably to make her lose the season for getting into high southern latitudes and defeat the intention of the voyage i proposed to captain wallis that he should lay the swallow up in some cove or bay and that i should attend and assist him with her boats till the straight should be passed which would probably be in much less time than if he continued to be retarded by my ship and i urged as an additional advantage that he might complete not only his stock of provisions and stores but his company out of her and then send her back to england with such of his crew as sickness had rendered unfit for the voyage proposing also that in my way home i would examine the eastern cost of patagonia or attempt such other discoveries as he should think proper if this was not approved and my knowledge of the south seas was thought necessary to the success of the voyage i offered to go with him on board the dolphin and give up the swallow to be commanded by his first lieutenant whose duty i would perform during the rest of the voyage or to make the voyage myself with only the dolphin if he would take the swallow back to europe but captain wallis was still of opinion that the voyage should be prosecuted by the two ships jointly pursuant to the orders that had been given  the swallow was now become so foul that with all the sails she could set she could not make so much way as the dolphin april when the western entrance of the straight was open  at noon to our unspeakable comfort  the little bay where we were now at anchor lies about three leagues e by s from cape pillar it is the first place which has any appearance of a bay within that cape and bears s by e about four leagues from the island which sir john narborough called westminster hall from its resemblance to that building in a distant view the western point of this bay makes a very remarkable appearance being a perpendicular plane like the wall of a house there are three islands about two cables length within its entrance and within those islands a very good harbor with anchorage in between twentyfive and thirty fathom with a bottom of soft mud we anchored without the islands the passage on each side of them being not more than onefourth of a cables length wide our little bay is about two cables length broad the points bearing east and west of each other in the inner part there is from sixteen to eighteen fathom but where we lay it is deeper we had one anchor in seventeen fathom and the other in fortyfive with great overfalls between them and rocks in several places here we rode out a very hard gale and the ground being extremely uneven we expected our cables to be cut in two every minute yet when we weighed to our great surprise they did not appear to have been rubbed in any part though we found it very difficult to heave them clear of the rocks the land round this bay and harbor is all high and as the current sets continually into it i doubt not but it has another communication with the sea to the south of cape deseada the master said he went up it four miles in a boat and could not then be above four miles from the western ocean yet i still saw a wide entrance to the s w the landing is every where good there is plenty of wood and water and muscles and wild geese in abundance  from the north shore of the western end of the straight of magellan which lies in about latitude    s to latitude    the land which is the western coast of patagonia runs nearly north and south and consists wholly of broken islands among which are those that sharp has laid down by the name of the duke of yorks islands he has indeed placed them at a considerable distance from the coast but if there had been many islands in that situation it is impossible but that the dolphin the tamar or the swallow must have seen them as we ran near their supposed meridian and so did the dolphin and the tamar the last voyage till we came into this latitude we had tolerable weather and little or no current in any direction but when we came to the northward of    we found a current setting strongly to the north so that probably we then opened the great bay which is said to be ninety leagues deep we found here a vast swell from the n w and the winds generally blew from the same quarter yet we were set every day twelve or fifteen miles to the northward of our account  on wednesday the   th the sea run more regularly from the s w and the wind soon after coming from s s w to s s e we had by noon got a pretty good offing  chap ii the passage from cape pillar at the western entrance of the straight of magellan to masafuero with some account of that island i took my departure from cape pillar  in the middle of the night of the   th violent  from the time of our clearing the straight and during our passage along this coast we saw a great number of sea birds particularly albatrosses gannets sheerwaters and a thick lumpish bird about as big as a large pigeon which the sailors call a cape of good hope hen they are of a dark brown or blackish color and are therefore sometimes called the black gull we saw also a great many pintado birds of nearly the same size which are prettily spotted with black and white and constantly on the wing though they frequently appear as if they were walking upon the water like the peterels to which sailors have given the name of mother careys chickens and we saw also many of these  in the evening of monday the   th it died away and we had a dead calm for six hours as well as on several other occasions  notwithstanding this wind was fair we durst not venture to put the ship before it for if in wearing any of these enormous seas had broken on her side it would inevitably have carried away all before it after some time however it became more moderate and we then got up our yards and made sail steering n by w and now the men having been up all night and being wet to the skin i ordered every one of them a dram  by the next morning the  d of may  on the  d  on the  th west which at once threw all our sails aback  the gale continued in this direction till eight in the morning of the  th many times to let fly our topsail sheets  during all this time i hoisted no colors having none but english on board which at this time i did not think it proper to show  as i was disappointed of wood and water at this place and of the refreshments of which after the dangers and fatigue of our voyage through the straight and our passage from it to get some water  the next morning as soon as it was light  we continued here till the   th at daybreak and then  at daybreak  at four oclock in the morning the island bore west of us rate board for they were frequently stopped by high steep bluff points  on the   th i sent the cutter for a load of water evening  the wind blew very hard the next morning out the weather became more moderate a view of the n w side of masafuera view masafuera bearing nw distant about    leagues view was for a while obliterated by the joy of our escape from those that were past  from the   th when we were first driven from our anchoring ground to this time we suffered an uninterrupted series of danger fatigue and misfortunes the ship worked and sailed very ill the weather was dark and tempestuous with thunder lightning and rain and the boats which i was obliged to keep always employed even when we were under sail to procure us water were in continual danger of being lost as well by the hard gales which constantly blew as by the sudden gusts which frequently rushed upon us with a violence that is scarcely to be conceived this distress was the more severe as it was unexpected for i had experienced very different weather in these parts about two years before with commodore byron it has generally been thought that upon this coast the winds are constantly from the s to the s w though frazier mentions his having had strong gales and high seas from the n n w and n w quarter which was unhappily my case  having once more got my people and boats safe on board i made sail from this turbulent climate and thought myself fortunate not to have left any thing behind me except the wood which our people had cut for firing  the island of masafuero lies in latitude       s longitude  0    w of london its situation is west of juan fernandes both being nearly in the same latitude and by the globe it is distant about thirtyone leagues it is very high and mountainous and at a distance appears like one hill or rock it is of a triangular form and about seven or eight leagues in circumference the south part which we saw when we first made the island at the distance of three and twenty leagues is much the highest on the north end there are several spots of clear ground which perhaps might admit of cultivation  the author of the account of lord ansons voyage mentions only one part of this island as affording anchorage which is on the north side and in deep water but we saw no part where there was not anchorage on the west side in particular there is anchorage at about a mile from the shore in twenty fathom and at about two miles and a half in forty and fortyfive fathom with a fine black sand at the bottom this author also says that there is a reef of rocks running off the eastern point of the island about two miles in length which may be seen by the seas breaking over them but in this he is mistaken there is no reef of rocks or shoal running off the eastern point but there is a reef of rocks and sand running off the western side near the south end of it he is also mistaken as to the distance of this island from juan fernandes and its direction for he says the distance is twentytwo leagues and the direction w by s but we found the distance nearly onethird more and the direction is due west for as i have before observed the latitude of both islands is nearly the same the goats that he mentions we found upon it in the same abundance and equally easy to be caught  on the south west point of the island there is a remarkable rock with a hole in it which is a good mark to come to an anchor on the western side where there is the best bank of any about the place about a mile and a half to the northward of this hole there is a low point of land and from this point runs the reef that has been just mentioned in the direction of w by s to the distance of about three quarters of a mile where the sea continually breaks upon it to anchor run in till the hole in the rock is shut in about a cables length upon this low point of land then bearing s by e e and anchor in twenty and twentytwo fathom fine black sand and shells there is anchorage also at several places on the other sides of the island particularly off the north point in fourteen and fifteen fathom with fine sand  there is plenty of wood and water all round the island but they are not to be procured without much difficulty a great quantity of stones and large fragments of the rock have fallen from the high land all round the island and upon these there breaks such a surf that a boat cannot safely come within a cables length of the shore there is therefore no landing here but by swimming from the boat and then mooring her without the rocks nor is there any method of getting off the wood and water but by hauling them to the boat with ropes there are however many places where it would be very easy to make a commodious landing by building a wharf which it would be worth while even for a single ship to do if she was to continue any time at the island  this part of masafuero is a very good place for refreshment especially in the summer season the goats have been mentioned already and there is all round the island such plenty of fish that a boat may with three hooks and lines catch as much as will serve an hundred people among others we caught excellent coal fish cavallies cod hallibut and crayfish we took a kingfisher that weighed eightyseven pounds and was five feet and an half long and the sharks were so ravenous that when we were sounding one of them swallowed the lead by which we hauled him above water but as he then disgorged it we lost him the seals were so numerous that i verily think if many thousands of them were killed in a night they would not be missed in the morning we were obliged to kill great numbers of them as when we walked the shore they were continually running against us making at the same time a most horrible noise these animals yield excellent train oil and their hearts and plucks are very good eating being in taste something like those of a hog and their skins are covered with the finest fur i ever saw of the kind there are many birds here and among others some very large hawks of the pintado birds our people as i have before observed caught no less than seven hundred in one night we had not much opportunity to examine the place for vegetable productions but we saw several leaves of the mountain cabbage which is a proof that the tree grows here  chap iii the passage from masafuero to queen charlottes isiands several mistakes corrected concerning daviss land and an account of some small islands supposed to be the same that were seen by quiros when we took our departure from masafuero we had a great sea from the n w with a swell of long billows from the southward and the wind which was from the s w to the w n w obliged me to stand to the northward in hope of getting the south east tradewind for the ship was so dull a sailer that there was no making her go without a strong wind in her favor having thus run farther to the northward than at first i intended and finding myself not far from the parallel of latitude which has been assigned to two islands called saint ambrose and saint felix or saint paul i thought i should perform an acceptable service by examining if they were fit for shipping to refresh at especially as the spaniards having fortified juan fernandes they might be found convenient for great britain if she should hereafter be engaged in a spanish war these islands are laid down in greens charts which were published in the year      from latitude     0 to    s and from   to   w of masafuero i therefore hauled up with a design to keep in that latitude but soon afterward consulting robertsons elements of navigation i found the island of saint ambrose there laid down in latitude     0 s and     0 longitude west of london and supposing that islands of so small an extent might be laid down with more exactness in this work than in the chart i bore away more northward for that latitude the event however proved that i should not have trusted him so far i missed the islands and as i saw great numbers of birds and fish which are certain indications of land not far off there is the greatest reason to conclude that i went to the northward of them i am sorry to say that upon a farther examination of robertsons tables of latitudes and longitudes i found them erroneous in many particulars this censure however if i had not thought it necessary to prevent future mischief should have been suppressed  upon examining the account that is given by wafer who was surgeon on board captain daviss ship i think it is probable that these two islands are the land that davis fell in with in his way to the southward from the gallapago islands and that the land laid down in all the sea charts under the name of daviss land has no existence notwithstanding what is said in the account of roggeweins voyage which was made in      of land that they called eastern island which some have imagined to be a confirmation of daviss discovery and the same land to which his name has been given  it is manifest from wafers narrative that little credit is due to the account kept on board daviss ship except with respect to the latitude for he acknowledges that they had like to have perished by their making an allowance for the variation of the needle westward instead of eastward he tells us also that they steered s by e e from the gallapagos till they made land in latitude     0 s but it is evident that such a course would carry them not to the westward but to the eastward of the gallapagos and set them at about the distance of two hundred leagues from capiapo and not five hundred leagues as he has alleged for the variation here is not more than half a point to the eastward now and it must have been still less then it having been increasing to the eastward on all this coast the course that davis steered therefore if the distance between the islands of st ambrose and st felix and the gallapagos as laid down in all our sea charts is right must have brought him within sight of st ambrose and st felix when he had run the distance he mentions the truth is that if there had been any such place as daviss land in the situation which has been allotted to it in our sea charts i must have sailed over it or at least have seen it as will appear in the course of this narrative  i kept between the latitude     0 and     0 in search of the islands i intended to examine till i got five degrees to the westward of our departure and then seeing no land and the birds having left us i hauled more to the southward and got into latitude     0 s where i continued till we got between seventeen and eighteen degrees to the westward of our departure in this parallel we had light airs and soul winds with a strong northerly current which made me conjecture that we were near this daviss land for which we looked out with great diligence but a fair wind springing up again we steered west by south which gradually brought us into the latitude of    s so that it is evident i must have sailed over this land or at least have seen it if there had been any such place i afterward kept in the latitude of    for forty degrees to the westward of my departure or according to my account     degrees west of london this being the highest south latitude the winds and weather would permit me to keep so that i must have gone to the southward of the situation assigned to the supposed continent called daviss land in all our charts  we continued our search till wednesday the   th of june  it was now the depth of winter in these parts and we had hard gales and high seas that frequently brought us under our courses and low sails the winds were also variable and though we were near the tropic the weather was dark hazey and cold with frequent thunder and lightning sleet and rain the sun was above the horizon about ten hours in the four and twenty but we frequently passed many days together without seeing him and the weather was so thick that when he was below the horizon the darkness was dreadful the gloominess of the weather was indeed not only a disagreeable but a most dangerous circumstance as we were often long without being able to make an observation and were notwithstanding obliged to carry all the sail we could spread day and night our ship being so bad a sailer and our voyage so long to prevent our perishing by hunger which with all its concomitant horrors would otherwise be inevitable  a chart and views of pitcairns island latitude   0  s long     0 w map bearing n w distance    leagues view

july  while we were in the neighborhood of this island the weather was extremely tempestuous with long rolling billows from the southward larger and higher than any i had seen before the winds were variable but blew chiefly from the s s w w and w n w we had very seldom a gale to the eastward so that we were prevented from keeping in a high south latitude and were continually driving to the northward  on the  th and turbulent seas  on saturday the   th there is another island of this name among those that were discovered by captain wallis   on the   th with great fury we found no anchorage  from this time to the   th longitude     0 w of our departure the variation was here   e  on the   d  when i got into latitude    s and not before that  from the latitude    s longitude        w we had a strong gale from the s e which made a great sea after us and from that time i did not observe the long billows from the southward till we got into latitude  0    s longitude      0 e and then it returned from the s w and s s w and we found a current setting to the southward although a current in the contrary direction had attended us almost all the way from the straight of magellan i conjectured therefore that here the passage opened between new zealand and new holland the variation here was       e on the  th  about this time we found our stock of loglines nearly expended though we had already converted all our fishing lines to the same use i was some time in great perplexity how to supply this defect but upon a very diligent enquiry found that we had by chance a few fathom of thick untarred rope this which in our situation was an inestimable treasure i ordered to be untwisted but as the yarns were found to be too thick for our purpose it became necessary to pick them into oakham and when this was done the most difficult part of the work remained for this oakham could not be spun into yarn till by combing it was brought into hemp its original state this was not seamens work and if it had we should have been at a loss how to perform it for want of combs one difficulty therefore rose upon another and it was necessary to make combs before we could try our skill in making hemp upon this trying occasion we were again sensible of the danger to which we were exposed by the want of a forge necessity however the fruitful mother of invention suggested an expedient the armourer was set to work to file nails down to a smooth point with which we produced a tolerable succedaneum for a comb and one of the quartermasters was found sufficiently skilled in the use of this instrument to render the oakham so smooth and even that we contrived to spin it into yarn as fine as our coarse implements would admit and thus we made tolerable loglines although we found it much more difficult than to make cordage of our old cables after they had been converted into junk which was an expedient that we had been obliged to practice long before we had also long before used all our sewing sail twine and if knowing that the quantity with which i had been supplied was altogether inadequate to the wants of such a voyage i had not taken the whole quantity that had been put on board to repair the seine into my own custody this deficiency might have been fatal to us all  chap iv an account of the discovery of queen charlottes islands with a description of them and their inhabitants and of what happened at egmont island the scurvy still continued to make great progress among us and those hands that were not rendered useless by disease were worn down by excessive labor our vessel which at best was a dull sailer had been long in so bad a condition that she would not work and on the  0th queen charlottes islands map map wateringplace and speak to them  having considered this account and finding that a swell which came round the eastern part of the bay would render watering troublesome and inconvenient exclusive of the danger that might be apprehended from the natives if they should attack us from ambushes in the wood i determined to try whether a better situation could not be found  the next morning therefore as soon as it was light or upon shore  soon after i had dispatched the cutter on this expedition i sent the longboat with ten men on board well armed to the shore who before eight oclock brought off a tun of water about nine i sent her off again but soon after seeing some of the natives advancing along the shore toward the place where the men landed i made the signal for them to return not knowing to what number they would be exposed and having no boat to send off with assistance if they should be attacked  our men had not long returned on board when we saw three of the natives sit down under the trees abreast of the ship as they continued there gazing at us till the afternoon as soon as the cutter came in sight not caring that both the boats should be absent at the same time i sent my lieutenant in the longboat with a few beads ribbons and trinkets to endeavor to establish some kind of intercourse with them and by their means with the rest of the inhabitants these men however before the boat could reach the shore quitted their station and proceeded along the beach as the trees would soon prevent their being seen by our people who were making toward the land we kept our eyes fixed upon them from the ship and very soon perceived that they were met by three others after some conversation hospitality  such was the story of the master who  as the expedition to find a better place for the ship had issued thus unhappily i determined to try what could be done where we lay the next day therefore was in tolerable health  the next morning fired several vollies of small arms into that part of the wood from which the arrows came  hitherto though i had been long ill of an inflammatory and bilious disorder i had been able to keep the deck but this evening the symptoms became so much more threatening that i could keep up no longer and i was for some time afterward confined to my bed the master was dying of the wounds he received in his quarrel with the indians the lieutenant also was very ill the gunner and

after crossing the first entrance like all the rest of the people whom we had seen upon this island quite naked his canoe was very small  we found this place to be the western extremity of the island on the north side and that it lay in exactly the same latitude as the eastern extremity on the same side the distance between them is about fifty miles due east and west and a strong current sets westward along the shore  i was still confined to my bed and it was with infinite regret that i gave up the hopes of obtaining refreshments at this place especially as our people told me they saw hogs and poultry in great plenty as we sailed along the shore with cocoanut trees plantains bananas and a variety of other vegetable productions which would soon have restored to us the health and vigor we had lost by the fatigue and hardships of a long voyage but no friendly intercourse with the natives could now be expected and i was not in a situation to obtain what i wanted by force i was myself dangerously ill great part of my crew as i have already observed was disabled and the rest dispirited by disappointment and vexation and if the men had been all in health and spirits i had not officers to lead them on or direct them in any enterprise nor even to superintend the duties that were to be performed on board the ship these disadvantages which prevented my obtaining refreshments at this island prevented me also from examining the rest that were near it our little strength was every minute becoming less i was not in a condition to pursue the voyage to the southward and was in danger of losing the monsoon so that no time was now to be lost i therefore gave orders to steer northward nova britannia i shall however give the best account i can of the appearance and situation of the islands that i left behind me  i gave the general name of queen charlottes islands to the whole cluster as well to those that i did not see distinctly as to those that i did and i gave several of them particular names as i approached them  to the southermost of the two which when we first discovered land were right ahead i gave the name of lord how is island island edgcombs island has a fine pleasant appearanceand lies in latitude     0 s longitude        e the latitude of ourrys island is     0 s longitude        e the other islands of which there were several i did not particularly name  the inhabitants of egmont island whose persons have been described already are extremely nimble vigorous and active and seem to be almost as well qualified to live in the water as upon the land for they were in and out of their canoes almost every minute the canoes that came out against us from the west end of the island were all like that which our people brought on board and might probably upon occasion carry about a dozen men though three or four manage them with amazing dexterity we saw however others of a large size upon the beach with awnings or shades over them  we got two of their bows and a bundle of their arrows from the canoe that was taken with the wounded man and with these weapons they do execution at an incredible distance one of them went through the boats washboard and dangerously wounded a midshipman in the thigh their arrows were pointed with flint and we saw among them no appearance of any metal the country in general is woody and mountainous with many valleys intermixed several small rivers flow from the interior part of the country into the sea and there are many harbors upon the coast the variation here was about       e  chap v departure from egmont

of carterets island  rom the time of our leaving egmont island we had observed a current setting strongly to the southward and in the neighborhood of these islands we found its force greatly increased this determined me when i sailed from gowers island to steer n w fearing we might otherwise fall in with the main land too far to the southward for if we had got into any gulf or deep bay our crew was so sickly and our ship so bad that it would have been impossible for us to have got out again  about eight oclock in the morning of the   d  in the night of monday the   th  one of these islands is of considerable extent  we went to the northward of these islands and steered w by s with a strong south westerly current at eleven oclock at night we fell in with another island of a considerable extent flat green and of a pleasant appearance we saw none of its inhabitants but it appeared by the many fires which we saw in the night to be well peopled it lies in latitude    0 s and bears west fifteen leagues from the northermost of the nine islands and we called it sir charles hardys island  at daybreak the next morning  about ten oclock in the morning of the   th current set us into a deep bay or gulf  on the   th  we anchored here only to wait till the boats could find a fit place for our purpose and several very good harbors being discovered not far distant we now endeavored to weigh anchor but with the united strength of our whole company were not able this was an alarming proof of our debility and with heavy hearts we had recourse to an additional purchase with this assistance and our utmost efforts we got the anchor just clear of the bottom but the ship casting in shore it almost immediately hooked again in foul ground our task was now to begin again and though all the island of

that were able to move applied their utmost force  from this place we sailed to a little cove about three or four miles distant to which we gave the name of english cove here we anchored and immediately began to get wood and water which we found in great plenty besides ballast i also sent the boat out every day to different places with the seine but though there was plenty of fish we were able to catch very little a misfortune which was probably owing in part to the clearness of the water in part to the rockiness of the beach and perhaps in some degree also to our want of skill we plied this labor day and night notwithstanding the want of success and at the same time had recourse to the hook and line but to our great mortification not a single fish would take the bait we saw a few turtle but they were so shy that we could not catch one of them here therefore we were condemned to the curse of tantalus perpetually in the sight of what our appetites most importunately craved and perpetually disappointed in our attempts to reach it we got however from the rocks at low water a few rock oysters and cockles of a very large size and from the shore some cocoanuts and the upper part of the tree that bears them which is called the cabbage this cabbage is a white crisp juicy substance which eaten raw tastes somewhat like a chestnut but when boiled is superior to the best parsnip we cut it small into the broth that we made of our portable soup which was afterward thickened with oatmeal and made a most comfortable mess for each of these cabbages however we were forced to cut down a tree and it was with great regret that we destroyed in the parent stock so much fruit which perhaps is the most powerful antiscorbutic in the world but necessity has no law this supply of fresh vegetables and especially the milk or rather the water of the nut recovered our sick very fast they also received great benefit and pleasure from the fruit of a tall tree that resembles a plum and particularly that which in the west indies is called the jamaica plum our men gave it the same name it has a pleasant tartish taste but is a little woody probably only for want of culture these plums were not plenty so that having the two qualities of a dainty scarcity and excellence it is no wonder that they were held in the highest estimation  the shore about this place is rocky and the country high and mountainous but covered with trees of various kinds some of which are of an enormous growth and probably would be useful for many purposes among others we found the nutmeg tree in great plenty and i gathered a few of the nuts but they were not ripe they did not indeed appear to be the best sort but perhaps that is owing partly to their growing wild and partly to their being too much in the shade of taller trees the cocoanut tree is in great perfection but does not abound here are i believe all the different kinds of palm with the beetlenut tree various species of the aloe canes bamboos and rattans with many trees shrubs and plants altogether unknown to me but no esculent vegetable of any kind the woods abound with pigeons doves rooks parrots and a large bird with black plumage that makes a noise somewhat like the barking of a dog with many others which i can neither name nor describe our people saw no quadruped but two of a small size that they took for dogs the carpenter and another man got a transient glimpse of them in the woods as they were cutting spars for the ships use and said that they were very wild and ran away the moment they saw them with great swiftness we saw centipieds scorpions and a few serpents of different kinds but no inhabitants we fell in however with several deserted habitations and by the shells that were scattered about them and seemed not long to have been taken out of the water and some sticks half burnt the remains of a fire there is reason to conclude that the people had but just left the place when we arrived if we may judge of the people by that which had been their dwelling they must stand low even in the scale of savage life for it was the most miserable hovel we had ever seen  while we lay here having cleared and lightened the ship we heeled her so as to come at her leak which the carpenter stopped as well as he could we found the sheathing greatly decayed and the bottom much eaten by the worms but we paid it as far as we could get at it with a mixture of hot pitch and tar boiled together the carpenter also cut down many spars for studdingsail booms having but few left of those which he had brought from england  english cove lies n e n three or four miles from walliss island there is a small shoal on the starboard hand going in which will be easily seen by the seas breaking upon it the water ebbs and flows once in four and twenty hours the flood came in about nine or ten oclock and it was high water between three and four in the afternoon after which it ebbed all night and was low water about six in the morning the water rises and falls between eight or nine feet sometimes more sometimes less but i doubt whether this fluctuation is not rather the effect of the sea and land breeze than of a regular tide we anchored here with our best bower in twentyseven fathom water with a bottom of sand and mud we veered into the cove a cable and a half from the anchor moored head and stern with the stream anchor and steadied with hawsers on each bow the ship then lay in ten fathom at the distance of a cables length from the shore at the bottom of the cove walliss point bearing s w s distant

of considerable extent and soon afterward we saw another to the north east of it but this appeared to be little more than a large rock above water as i had here strong currents and for several days

consisting of many islands lying to the southward of the large one which we had first discovered as the nights were now moonlight we kept on till eleven oclock and the lieutenant who was then officer of the watch finding that the course we were steering would carry us among them and not being willing to awaken me till it was my turn to watch hauled off s by e and s s e i came upon deck about midnight toward the ship one of them with seven men on board our rhetoric was to no effect  these indians were the same kind of people that we had seen before on the coast of new ireland and at egmont

sometimes touched at their islands for refreshment i gave one of them three pieces of an old iron hoop each about four inches long which threw him into an ecstasy little short of distraction i could not but sympathize in his joy nor observe without great pleasure the changes of countenance and extravagance of gesture by which it was expressed all these people indeed appeared to be more fond of iron than any we had seen before and i am sure that for iron tools we might have purchased every thing upon the islands which we could have brought away they are of the indian copper color the first

continued to have a current to the northward till monday the  th of october  on monday the   th i called saint andrews islands  chap viii some account of the coast of mindanao and the islands near it in which several mistakes of dampier are corrected on the   th we discovered land again i determined to try what could be procured in a bay which dampier has described as lying on the south east part of the island bay which we supposed had been dispatched from the town  as i was now farther convinced that it was necessary to dispose of our little force to the greatest advantage we began the next day by getting the guns up from the hold before after the dutch fashion after this interchange of cravats to a part of the beach which was clear of wood  the next morning therefore  i shall now give a more particular account of our navigating the sea that washes the coasts of this island the rather as dampiers description is in several particulars erroneous  having seen the north east part of the island on the twentysixth of october without certainly knowing whether it was mindanao or saint johns we got nearer to it the next day and made what we knew to be saint augustina the south eastermost part of the island which rises in little hummocks that run down to a low point at the waters edge it bears n  0 e at the distance of two and twenty leagues from a little island which is distinguished from the other islands that lie off the southermost point of mindanao by a hill or hummock and which for that reason i called hummock island all this land is very high one ridge of mountains rising behind another so that at a great distance it appears not like one island but several after our first discovery of the island we kept turning along the east side from the northward to cape saint augustina nearly s by w w and n by e e for about twenty leagues the wind was to the southward along the shore and as we approached the land we stood in for an opening which had the appearance of a good bay where we intended to anchor but we found that it was too deep for our purpose and that some shoals rendered the entrance of it dangerous to this bay which lies about eight or ten leagues n by e from cape saint augustina the south east extremity of the island i gave the name of disappointment bay when we were in the offing standing in for this bay we observed a large hummock which had the appearance of an island but which i believe to be a peninsula joined by a low isthmus to the main this hummock formed the northermost part of the entrance and another high bluff point opposite to it formed the southermost part between these two points are the shoals that have been mentioned and several small islands only one of which can be seen till they are approached very near on this part of the coast we saw no signs of inhabitants the land is of a stupendous height with mountains piled upon mountains till the summits are hidden in the clouds in the offing therefore it is almost impossible to estimate its distance for what appear then to be small hillocks just emerging from the water in comparison of the mountains that are seen over them swell into high hills as they are approached and the distance is found to be thrice as much as it was imagined perhaps this will account for the land here being so ill laid down and in situations so very different as it appears to be in all our english charts we found here a strong current setting to the southward along the shore as the land trended the high land that is to the north of saint augustina becomes gradually lower toward the cape a low flat point in which it terminates and off which at a very little distance lie two large rocks its latitude is      n and the longitude by account      0 e  from this cape the land trends away w and w by s for six or seven leagues and then turns up to the n w making a very deep bay the bottom of which as we crossed it from saint augustina to the high land on the other side which is not less than twelve leagues we could not see the coast on the farther side of it coming up from the bottom trend first to the s and s s w and then to the s w by w toward the south extremity of the island  off this southern extremity which dampier calls the south east by mistake the south east being saint augustina at the distance of five six and seven leagues lie ten or twelve islands though dampier says there are only two and that together they are about five leagues round the islands that i saw could not be contained in a circuit of less than fifteen leagues and from the number of boats that i saw among them i imagine they are well inhabited the largest of these lies to the s w of the others and makes in a remarkable peak so that it is first seen in coming in with the land and is indeed visible at a very great distance its latitude i make      n and its longitude by account        e this island which i called hummock island  i passed between these islands and the main and found the passage good the current setting to the westward dampier has placed his bay and savannah four leagues n w from the eastermost island and there i sought it as indeed i did on all the s e part of the island till we came to the little creek which ran up to the town  all the southern part of mindanao is extremely pleasant with many spots where the woods had been cleared for plantations and fine lawns of a beautiful verdure this part also is well inhabited as well as the neighboring islands of the town i can give no account as the weather was so thick that i could not see it neither could i sufficiently distinguish the land to set off the points at which i was not a little mortified  when i came to open the land to the westward of the southermost point i found it trend from that point w n w and n w by w forming first a point at the distance of about seven or eight leagues and then a very deep bay running so far in to the n and n e that i could not see the bottom of it the westermost point of this bay is low but the land soon rises again and runs along to the n w by w which seems to be the direction of this coast from the southermost point of the island toward the city of mindanao  to the westward of this deep bay the land is all flat and in comparison of the other parts of the island but thinly wooded over this flat appears a peak of stupendous height which rises into the clouds like a tower between the entrance of this bay and the south point of the island there is another very high hill the top of which has the funnel shape of a volcano but i did not perceive that it emitted either fire or smoke it is possible that this deep bay is that which dampier mentions and that it is misplaced by an error of the press for if instead of saying it bore n w four leagues from the eastermost of the islands he had said it bore n w fourteen leagues from the westermost of the islands it would correspond well with his description the bearings being the same and the land on the east side of it high and low on the west he is also nearly right in the latitude of his islands which he makes    0 n for probably some parts of the southermost of them may lie in that latitude but as i did not go to the southward of them this is only conjecture  between hummock island which is the largest and westermost of them and the islands to the eastward of it which are all flat and even is a passage running north and south which appears to be clear the north eastermost of these islands is small low and flat with a white sandy beach all round it and a great many trees in the middle east or north east of this island there are shoals and breakers and i saw no other appearance of danger in these parts neither did i see any of the islands which are mentioned by dampier and laid down in all the charts near mindanao in the offing perhaps they are at a more remote distance than is commonly supposed for without great attention navigators will be much deceived in this particular by the height of the land as i have observed already as i coasted this island i found the current set very strong to the southward along the shore till i came to the south end of it where i found it run n w and n w by w which is nearly as the land trends we had the winds commonly from s w to n w with light airs frequent rain and unsettled weather  we now bid farewell to mindanao greatly disappointed in our hope of obtaining refreshments which at first the inhabitants so readily promised to furnish we suspected that there were dutchmen or at least dutch partisans in the town and that having discovered us to be english they had dispatched an armed party to prevent our having any intercourse with the natives who arrived about two hours after our friendly conference and were the people that defied us from the shore  chap ix the passage from mindanao to the island of celebes with a particular account of the straight of macassar in which many errors are corrected after

islands have certainly no existence as i turned through this part of the passage from side to side and sailed over the very spot where they are supposed to lie in the same chart seven small islands are also laid down within half a degree to the northward of the line and exactly in the middle of the narrowest part of this passage but neither have these islands any existence except upon paper though i believe there may be some small islands close to the main land of borneo we thought we had seen two which we took to be those that are laid down in the charts off porto tubo but of this i am not certain the southermost and narrowest part of this passage is about eighteen or twenty leagues broad with high lands on each side we continued laboring in it till the   th daily increased the weather was still unsettled despondency was reflected from one countenance to another especially among those who were not able to come upon the deck in this deplorable situation we continued till the  0th  on saturday the   th spera mondes and had the mortification to find that the westerly monsoon was now set in  the next day our latitude  between the three brothers and the main of celebes there is another island much larger than either of them called the island of tonikiky but none of them are inhabited though there are a few huts belonging to fishermen upon them all the passage between the shoal and this island is clear and good with from ten to thirteen fathom and a sandy bottom but the soundings are to be kept on the side of the island in twelve fathom and never under ten it is however very difficult and dangerous for ships to fall in with the land this way without a pilot on board for there are many shoals and rocks under water i ran in by a chart in the english east india pilot which upon the whole i found a good one though the names of the islands points and bays differ very much from those by which they are now known when we got near to the celebes shore we had land and sea breezes which obliged us to edge along the coast though our strength was so much reduced that it was with the utmost difficulty we could work the stream anchor  in the evening of tuesday the   th  i have been the more particular in my description of as much as i saw of this straight because all the charts both english and french that i consulted are extremely deficient and erroneous  chap x transactions off macassar and the passage thence to bonthain the same night that we came to an anchor  the next morning came by his express order to fetch it and disease  we passed all the remainder of this day and all the night in a state of anxiety not unmixed with indignation that greatly aggravated our distress and very early the next morning mounted eight carriageguns  very soon after we had got under sail a handsome vessel with a band of music and several gentlemen on board made up to us and told us that they were sent by the governor but could not come aboard if we did not drop our anchor again our anchor therefore was immediately dropped and the gentlemen came on board they proved to be mr blydenburg the fiscal mr voll the shebander an officer called the license master or master of the port and mr douglas the writer who has been mentioned already they expressed some surprise at my having got under sail and asked me what i intended to have done i told them that i intended neither more nor less than to fulfill the declarations i had made the day before that justified by the common rights of mankind which were superior to every other law i would rather than have put again to sea where our destruction either by shipwreck sickness or famine was inevitable have come up to their walls and either have compelled them to furnish the necessaries we wanted or have run the ship on shore since it was better to perish at once in a just contest than to suffer the lingering misery of anticipating the perdition that we could not avoid from this place before the return of the season nothing better then bad salt meat  the next morning the shebander was sent to acquaint me a draught of bonthain bay situated about  0 leagues to the s e of macassar in the island of celebes lat      so map also that he had considerable property in england and said the shebander he has also money in my hands with which i will purchase such things as you want from macassar and see that they are sent after you having specified what these articles were to be and agreed with him for the quantity and the price we parted  the next day in the afternoon i received a letter  soon after the ensign m le cerf the secretary of the council and a pilot came on board to attend us to bonthain le cerf was to command the soldiers who were on board the guardboats and the secretary as we afterward discovered was to be a check upon the resident whose name was swellingrabel this gentlemans father died second governor at the cape of good hope where he married an english lady of the name of fothergill mr swellingrabel the resident here married the daughter of cornelius sinkclaar who had been governor of macassar and died about two years ago in england having come hither to see some of his mothers relations  chap xi transactions at bonthain while the vessel was waiting for a wind to carry her to batavia with some account of the place the town of macassar and the adjacent country the next morning at daybreak we sailed  i immediately waited upon the resident mr swellingrabel who spoke english but very imperfectly and having settled with him all matters relating to money and provisions a house was allotted me near the seaside and close to a little pallisadoed fort of eight guns the only one in this place which i converted into an hospital under the direction of the surgeon to this place i immediately sent all the people who were thought incapable of recovering on board and reserved the rest as a security against accidents as soon as our people were on shore a guard of thirtysix private men two sergeants and two corporals all under the command of ensign le cerf was set over them and none of them were suffered to go more than thirty yards from the hospital nor were any of the country people allowed to come near enough to sell them any thing so that our men got nothing of them but through the hands of the dutch soldiers who abused their power very shamefully when they saw any of the country people carrying what they thought our invalids would purchase they first took it away and then asked the price what was demanded signified little the soldier gave what he thought proper which was seldom one fourth of the value and if the countryman ventured to express any discontent he gave him immediately an earnest of perfect satisfaction by flourishing his broadsword over his head this was always sufficient to silence complaint and send the sufferer quietly away after which the soldier sold what he had thus acquired for profit of sometimes more than a thousand per cent this behavior was so cruel to the natives and so injurious to us that i ventured to complain of it to the resident and the other two gentlemen le cerf and the secretary the resident with becoming spirit reprimanded the soldiers but it produced so little effect that i could not help entertaining suspicions that le cerf connived at these practices and shared the advantages which they produced i suspected him also of selling arrack to my people of which i complained but without redress and i know that his slaves were employed to buy things at the market which his wife afterward sold to us for more than twice as much as they cost the soldiers were indeed guilty of many other irregularities it was the duty of one of them by rotation to procure the days provision for the whole guard a service which he constantly performed by going into the country with his musket and a bag nor was the honest providetor always content with what the bag would contain for one of them without any ceremony drove down a young buffalo that belonged to some of the country people and his comrades not having wood at hand to dress it when it was killed supplied themselves by pulling down some of the pallisadoes of the fort when this was reported to me i thought it so extraordinary that i went on shore to see the breach and found the poor black people repairing it  on the   th  on the   th a fleet of more than an hundred sail of the small country vessels  no event worthy of notice happened till the   th of january  on friday the   th of february le cerf any body stirring in the ship  the letter acquainted me that a design had been formed by the dutch in conjunction with the king of bony to cut us off that the dutch however were not to appear in it that the business was to be done by a son of the king of bony who was besides a gratuity from the dutch to receive the plunder of the vessel for his reward and who with eight hundred men was then at bonthain for that purpose that the motive was jealousy of our forming a connection with the buggueses and other people of the country who were at enmity with the dutch and their allies and driving them out of the island or at least a suspicion that if we got back to england some project of that kind might be founded upon the intelligence we should give no english man of war as i have already observed having ever been known to have visited the island before  this letter was a new subject of surprise and speculation  the resident mr swellingrabel was at this time absent twenty miles up the country upon the companys business but had told me that he should certainly return on the  st of april a day which i now expected with great impatience especially as an old drunken sergeant was the most respectable person at the fort him that we should at all events  on the   th in the morning the resident sent me word  the season now approached in which navigation to the westward would be again practicable which gave us all great pleasure especially as putrid diseases had begun to make their appearance among us and a putrid fever had carried off one of our people  on the  th of may able  at daybreak on sunday the   d of may  bonthain is a large bay where ships may lie in perfect security during both the monsoons the soundings are good and regular and the bottom soft mud nor is there any danger coming in but a ledge of rocks which are above water and are a good mark for anchoring the highest land in sight here is called bonthain hill and when a ship is in the offing at the distance of two or three miles from the land she should bring this hill north or n w and then run in with it and anchor we lay right under it at the distance of about a mile from the shore in this bay there are several small towns that which is called bonthain lies in the north east part of the bay and here is the small pallisadoed fort that has been mentioned already on which there are mounted eight guns that carry a ball of about eight pounds weight it is just sufficient to keep the country people in subjection and is intended for no other purpose it lies on the south side of a small river and there is water for a ship to come close to it the dutch resident has the command of the place and of bullocomba another town which lies about twenty miles farther to the eastward where there is such another fort and a few soldiers who at the proper season are employed in gathering the rice which the people pay as a tax to the dutch  wood and water are to be procured here in great plenty we cut our wood near the river under bonthain hill our water was procured partly from that river and partly from another when from the other our boat went above the fort with the casks that were to be filled where there is a good rolling way but as the river is small and has a bar the boat after it is loaded can come out only at high water there are several other small rivers in the bay from which water may be got upon occasion  we procured plenty of fresh provisions all the while we lay here at a reasonable rate the beef is excellent but it would be difficult to procure enough of it for a squadron rice may be had in any quantity so may fowls and fruit there are also abundance of wild hogs in the woods which may be purchased at a low price as the natives being mahometans never eat them fish may be caught with the seine and the natives at times supplied us with turtle for this like pork is a dainty which they never touch  celebes is the key of the molucca or spice islands which whoever is in possession of it must necessarily command most of the ships that are bound to them or to banda touch here and always go between this island and that of solayer the bullocks here are the breed that have the bunch on the back besides which the island produces horses buffaloes goats sheep and deer the arrack and sugar that are consumed here are brought from batavia  the latitude of bonthain hill is    0 s longitude by account        e the variation of the compass while we were here was      w the tides are very irregular commonly it is but once high water and once low water in four and twenty hours and there is seldom six feet difference between them  chap xii passage from bonthain bay in the island of celebes to batavia transactions there and the voyage round the cape of good hope to england when we left bonthain bay we kept along the shore damage  in the afternoon of the   th its longitude west of tonikaky      in the afternoon of the   th  in the evening of sunday the   th  on thursday the  d of june in the afternoon of the next day  we found here eleven large dutch ships besides several that were less one spanish ship a portuguese snow and several chinese junks  in the afternoon i waited upon the governor and acquainted him with the condition of the ship desiring liberty to repair her defects to which he replied that i must petition the council  on the  th therefore hoped they would allow me the use of such wharfs and storehouses as should be necessary governor of that place might be punished hope and not written in the style of request which had been invariably adopted by all merchants upon the like occason i replied that no offense was intended on my part and that i had used the first words which occurred to me as proper to express my meaning thus we parted and i heard nothing more of them till the afternoon of the  th when the shebander his authority for the requisition he had made  after this i waited in a fruitless expectation till the   th and urged in more pressing terms  on the   th the shebander came again to me  after this i was supplied for my money with every thing i could desire from the companys stores without any further difficulty  a pilot was ordered to attend me and on the   d  under the hands of these people the ship continued till tuesday the   th of august if her bottom was opened it might be found still worse than it was thought bawse or master carpenter would not consent except i would certify under my hand that what should be done to the ship was not according to his judgment but my own which he said was necessary for his justification if after such repairs only as i thought fit to direct had been made the ship should come short of her port as i thought this a reasonable proposition i readily complied but as i was now become answerable for the fate of the ship i had her carefully examined by my own carpenter and his mate myself and officers always attending the but ends of the planks that joined to the stern were so open that a mans hand might be thrust in between seven chainplates were broken and decayed the iron work in general was in a very bad state several of the knees were loose and some of them were broken  while i remained here two ships belonging to our india company put into this port and we found among other private ships from india one called the dudly from bengal which had proved so leaky that it was impossible to carry her back application had been made to the governor and council for leave to careen her which had been granted but as the wharfs had been kept in continual use she had been put off above four months the captain not without reason was apprehensive that he might be kept here till the worms had eaten through the bottom of his vessel and knowing that i had received particular civilities from admiral houting applied to me to intercede for him which i was very happy to do with such success that a wharf was immediately allotted her m houting is an old man and an admiral in the service of the states with the rank of commander in chief of their marine and the ships belonging to the company in india he received his first maritime knowledge on board an english man of war speaks english and french extremely well and does honor to the service both by his abilities and politeness he was so obliging as to give me a general invitation to his table in consequence of which i was often with him and it is with pleasure that i take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgment of the favors i received from him and hearing this testimony to his public and private merit he was indeed the only officer belonging to the company from whom i received any civility or with whom i had the least communication for i found them in general a reserved and supercilious set of people the governor although the servant of a republic takes upon himself more state in some particulars than any sovereign prince in europe whenever he goes abroad he is attended by a party of horse guards and two black men go before his coach in the manner of running footmen each having a large cane in his hand with which they not only clear the way but severely chastise all who do not pay the homage that is expected from people of all ranks as well those belonging to the country as strangers almost every body in this place keeps a carriage which is drawn by two horses and driven by a man upon a box like our chariots but is open in front whoever in such a carriage meets the governor either in the town or upon the road is expected not only to draw it on one side but to get out of it and make a most respectful obeisance while his excellencys coach goes by nor must any carriage that follows him drive past on any account but keep behind him however pressing be the necessity for haste a very mortifying homage of the same kind is also exacted by the members of the council called edele heeren for whoever meets them is obliged to stop his coach and though not to get out to stand up in it and make his reverence these edele heeren are preceded by one black man with a stick nor must any person presume to pass their carriage any more than that of the governor these ceremonies are generally complied with by the captains of indiamen and other trading ships but having the honor to bear his majestys commission i did not think myself at liberty to pay to a dutch governor any homage which is not paid to my own sovereign it is however constantly required of the kings officers and two or three days after i came hither the landlord of the hotel where i lodged told me he had been ordered by the shebander to let me know that my carriage as well as others must stop if i should meet the governor or any of the council but i desired him to acquaint the shebander that i could not consent to perform any such ceremony and upon his intimating somewhat about the black men with sticks i told him that if any insult should be offered me i knew how to defend myself and would take care to be upon my guard at the same time pointing to my pistols which then happened to lie upon the table upon this he went away and about three hours afterward he returned and told me he had orders from the governor to acquaint me that i might do as i pleased the hotel at which i resided is licensed by the governor and council and all strangers are obliged to take up their abode there except officers in his majestys service who are allowed private lodgings which however i did not choose  at this place i continued between three and four months and during all that time i had the honor to see the governor but twice the first time was at my arrival when i waited upon him at one of his houses a little way in the country the next was in town as he was walking before his house there when i addressed him upon a particular occasion soon after the news of the prince of oranges marriage arrived here he gave a public entertainment to which i had the honor of being invited but having heard that commodore tinker upon a like occasion finding that he was to be placed below the gentlemen of the dutch council had abruptly left the room and was followed by all the captains of his squadron and being willing to avoid the disagreeable dilemma of either sitting below the council or following the commodores example i applied to the governor to know the station that would be allotted me before i accepted his invitation and finding that i could not be permitted to take place of the council i declined it on both these occasions i spoke to his excellency by an english merchant who acted as an interpreter the first time he had not the civility to offer me the least refreshment nor did he the last time so much as ask me to go into the house  the defects of the ship were at length repaired much to my satisfaction and i thought she might then safely proceed to europe though the dutch carpenters were of a different opinion the proper season for sailing was not yet arrived and my worthy friend admiral houting represented that if i went to sea before the proper time i should meet with such weather off the cape of good hope as would make me repent it but being very ill myself and the people being sickly i thought it better to run the risk of a few hard gales off the cape than remain longer in this unhealthy place especially as the west monsoon was setting in during which the mortality here is yet greater than at other times  on wednesday the   th of september returning  on the  0th and the casks filled without putting them on shore  having in a few days completed our wood and water we weighed and stood out of the straight of sunda with a fine fresh gale at south east which did not leave us till the island of java was seven hundred leagues behind us  on monday the   d of november  table bay is a good harbor in summer but not in winter so that the dutch will not permit any of their vessels to lie here longer than the   th of may which answers to our november after that time all ships go to false bay which is well sheltered from the north west winds which blow here with great violence  at this place we breathed a pure air had wholesome food and went freely about the country which is extremely pleasant so that i began to think myself already in europe we found the inhabitants open hospitable and polite there being scarcely a gentleman in the place either in a public or private station from whom i did not receive some civility and i should very ill deserve the favors they bestowed if i did not particularly mention the first and second governor and the fiscal  the recovery of my people made it necessary to continue here till the  th of january       on the  0th and saw plenty of turtle  on friday the   th companion hope yet i was not perfectly satisfied for we lost an officer and some men in an engagement with the indians  after he was gone and we had made sail i went upon the deck where my lieutenant asked me if my visitor had entertained me with an account of his voyage this led me to tell him the general purport of our conversation thought an artful attempt to draw me into a breach of my obligation to secrecy  on the
