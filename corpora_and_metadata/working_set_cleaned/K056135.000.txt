of the torments of hell the foundation and pillars thereof discovered searched shaken and removed with many infallible proofs that there is not to be a punishment after this life for any to endure that shall never end to the glory of god and comfort of those in fear of the torments of hell and for the furtherance of a holy life  the second edition  is not the arrow beyond thee   samuel  0   if ye will enquire enquire ye return come isa        if thou have any thing to say answer me if not hold thy peace and i shall teach thee wisdom job        london printed and sold by w boreham at the angel in paternoster row    0   of christs descending into hell some of the learned say christ descended into hell and for proof allege psalm    0 acts     dr willet says that those words of christ  descended into hell is not found in the most ancient creeds dr william whitaker says i could produce fifty of the most ancient creeds that have not these words  he descended into hell in his answer to campion page     mr william perkins on the creed says it seems likely that these words  he descended into hell were not placed in the creed at first and that it crept in by negligence for above threescore creeds of the most ancient councils and fathers want this clause  he descended into hell among the rest not found in the nicene creed nor found in the romish church nor used in the church of the east  also some of the learned say christ descended not into hell yet it is an article of their faith but if you say he did not descend into hell they will say you deny the faith and are a heretic and a blasphemer and you may be glad if ye can escape so themselves interpret hell otherwise than for a place of torments never to end mr bucer says christ descending into hell is to be understood of his burial mr calvin says hell is the sorrow of mind christ was in before his death why have thou forsaken me is gods hiding his face when he was upon the cross says dr whitaker against campion page     for upon the cross he said it is finished john   0 therefore his suffering was at an end some of the papists confess christ suffered not after his death luke        vrsinus catechis page   0 mr perkins says hell is the inward sufferings of christ on the cross bernard makes the grief of christs soul his hell  doctor ames in his marrow of divinity page    says that of the place of hell and manner of torture there the scripture has not pronounced any thing distinctly if so then the word of god says not any thing at all of them for that which the scripture speaks it speaks distinctly else it could not have been read distinctly neh    that which is spoken expressly is spoken distinctly the spirit speaks expressly   timothy    the word of the lord came expressly ezekiel    that which is not spoken distinctly cannot be understood as appears   cor     to     dr fulk says plainly that neither in the hebrew greek nor latin there is no word proper for hell as we take hell for the place of punishment of the ungodly fulks defense translation page          is not this a full testimony against their opinion of the torments of hell for if it be not to be read in the word of god what have we to do with it we are not to believe any thing in religion unless it be written how read thou says christ revealed things belong to us deuteronomy      as it is written i believed   cor     they confess it is not written then sure i am it is not to be by any affirmed nor believed meddle not with things not revealed they are but groundless conceits fables and traditions of men  that the word hell is not in the hebrew and greek bible for the word in the hebrew for which the english word hell is put is sheol the proper signification of sheol is the grave as all that be learned in the hebrew do know sheol has its signification of shaal to crave or require therefore it is one of the four that is never satisfied prove  0   we learn the propriety of the hebrew word from the learned rabbis says dr fulk def trans bib p  0 the hebrew doctors and jewish rabbis are for signification of words faithful interpreters they say sheol is the grave rabbi levi according to the opinion of the learned expounds sheol to be the lowest region of the world opposite to heaven if i descend into sheol thou art present so rabbi abraham on jonah   and david chimchi and r solomon read psalm        let the wicked be turned into sheol that is deaths estate or deadly bed jonah calls the belly of the whale sheol jon     rabbi solomon jarchi on genesis      says that the true and proper interpretation of sheol is keber which is the grave the hoar head is said to go down sheol genesis      in numb    it is said they their substance and cattle went alive to shelach that is the pit or grave our bones are scattered at the very brink or mouth of sheol psalm      jacob said i will go down to my son joseph to sheol genesis      the protestant writers say sheol properly signifies the grave dr fulks answer to the preface remist p    so also in his defense p    mr beza says that sheol properly signifies nothing but the grave or pit fulk says the best of the hebrews that either interpreted scripture or made dictionaries jews or christians say sheol properly signifies the grave page    and that deliverance from the lowest hell is deliverance from the greatest danger of death so fulk answ remist page         and so the late annotation of the bible interprets it and augustine on psalm      for lowest hell read lowest grave and so dr willet synop p  0    the chaldee paraphrast retains the word sheol and translates it the house of the grave page      they interpret sheol keburata the grave job         be in the keburata the house of the grave p      rabbi abraham reristsol joins sheol and keber together both signifying the grave and so does dr fulk in his defense page    and so mr cartwright on acts     mr gradock says hell is not mentioned in the old testament but as it is taken for the grave in his good news page     sheol enforces not any place of punishment because it signified not any place of punishment so says dr willet synops page  0   also he says the word sheol cannot be translated but for the grave there are four words in the psalms expressing the same thing in effect that sheol does yet none of them applicable to signify any place of torment the first is shacath fovea the pit psalm     the second is bhor the lake the third is cheber the grave both these words used for the same thing psalm     the word is sheol v    the other word used as expressing the former and all these three do contain a description of death and the grave the fourth is tehemoth abyssus terrae thou will take me from the depth of the earth psalm    0 in all which there is no mention of a place of torment willet synop p  0 0  the greek translates sheol into haiden or haides of adam because adam tasted death and went to the grave genesis     the gates of sheol is death sheol and haides are said to have gates isa    0 psalm     mat      the septuagint express a place generally to receive the dead the word used in the greek instead of the hebrew word sheol signifies a dark place such as the grave or pit in which the dead are laid dr fulk says some take the greek word for hell but it signifies the grave hell it cannot signify in their speech that believe no hell the greeks say plainly that their souls shall vanish like light smoke or light air fulk def p    also he says if the greek and latin interpreters had before us translated amiss which gave occasion to diverse errors must we knowing the true signification of the word follow them  the word hell is not in the greek the greek word for which they put the english word hell is gehenna ge in greek is the earth or ground and henna is borrowed from the hebrew from the valley of hinnom dr lightfoot in his epistle of his harmony says it is well known the judgment of gehinna is taken from the valley of gehinna tophet or gehinnom are names of the places of idolatry there was the idol moloch  of hellfire matthew     and the everlasting fire and unquenchable fire matthew        fear him that has power to cast into hell luke     the damnation of hell matt      matthew     the fire of gehinna and the everlasting fire etc how the jews understood them it is evidently to be seen in their writings that they understood them of the fire of the valley of hinnom so says dr lightfoot to the reader in his harmony because of the law thou art delivered from the judgment of gehenna and baaltur genesis     the protestant writers confess that matt     matt        luke     is to be understood of the fire of the valley of the son of hinnom which is tophet so mr cartwright dr fulk mr trap and the late annotations of the bible and others in danger of hellfire etc read in danger to burn in the valley of hinnom or tophet the damnation of hell of hell gehinnah they interpret these places of the valley of hinnom or tophet which place was near to jerusalem where they offered their children to moloch josh    king josiah defiled tophet the valley of the son of hinnom that no man might make his son or daughter to pass through the fire to moloch   kings    0 josiah commanded all the carrion of the city of jerusalem to be carried to that valley and burnt there that the carrion might not annoy the city thither said david chimchy was carried all the filth and unburied carcasses to be burned the synedrian of the jews for some offenses sentenced the bodies of the offenders to lie unburied in that valley to burn with the carrion cast there which among the jews was counted a great disgrace and for offenses most criminal they burned alive in that valley they set the malefactor in a dunghill up to the knees and put a towel about his neck and one pulled it one way and another another way till strangling him forced him to open his mouth then they poured scalding lead into his mouth which went down into his body and so burnt his bowels talmud in sanhedr per   mr cartwright says the jews sent thither their guilty to be burned in that valley and those they buried there they dealt with as guilty   chr      it is confessed by all that christ speaks and alludeth to the jewish practice in their judicature therefore the places abovesaid concern them secondly the speech of christ was to the jews by birth and education they wrote the new testament and though it be penned in greek it speaks the phrase of the jewish nation the apostle speaking to the jews used the word gehenna jam    christ and his disciples used known terms that they might the better be understood thirdly because the jews had not power to send them to the hell they speak of  thly because the last of the three sins is said to be judged to the fire of gehenna which if it were to be understood as some would have it it will follow that some sins deserve not hell and shall not be punished there which is contrary to themselves who teach the least sin deserves hell  thly matt     showing the ignorance and severity of the jews and pharisees that anger without a cause and racha a word of disgrace which signifies an empty fellow or wicked wretch as great faults as to say fool if not greater yet punished less rash anger in danger of the judgment racha in danger of the council if say fool in danger of hellfire to burn in the valley of the son of hinnom  of the word everlasting first the fire of the valley of tophet is so called in that it did burn night and day and went not out  secondly the word  ever and  everlasting the greeks understand it for an age ever and everlasting are of a like signification and is used for a limited time a time during life he shall serve his master for ever ex     luke      that is until his own or masters death longer he could not serve him the everlasting priesthood  exodus  0   was but until christ came then it was to cease as appears heb          it is said they shall inherit the land for ever isa      that ever was but a little while as appears isa       thirdly in that fire is durable and goes not out until the combustible matter is consumed may be called everlasting and unquenchable for the fire that destroyed the cities of sodom and gomorrha is called eternal fire and  a word of a large signification in that it consumed those cities for where no wood is the fire goes out proverbs       fourthly if fire were everlasting it will not follow that which is cast into it is everlasting the wicked are compared to chaff and stubble fire is not long consuming them burn the chaff isa     if any say chaff will be ever burning and never consumed we know the contrary  fifthly consider that the scriptures sometimes use words that exceed their signification and are not strictly to be understood according to their letter and signification of those words as john      the things that jesus did if they should be written i suppose the world it self would not contain the things that should be written a large expression what will not the whole world contain a record of the actions of one man the meaning is they would be too great so sin and the strength of the ethiopian army are said to be infinite job     neh    that is very great for the world and all in it is finite isa  0   these considerations show how such words are to be understood and it may satisfy us herein  is it not a very strange thing that themselves should confess that the english word hell is in the hebrew sheol and in the greek haides and gehennah and that they are to be understood as aforesaid that they should for the said words translate it in english hell and then expound hell for a terrible and dreadful place of torment never to end o horrible abuse and blasphemy against god and his word and even all men are deluded and deceived thereby verily verily they deserve the name they give to others of denying the word of god  the story of dives luke    0 is not any proof of any torments in hell because it is a parable not a history of a parable we are not to ground a doctrine the story of dives is no more a proof of a punishment after this life than judge    is a proof that trees did walk and speak though it is said the trees went forth and said etc the story of dives is not to be understood according to the letter for these reasons it says there was a rich man in hell yet all confess the body is in the grave    how could dives see so far as abrahams bosom is from hell mr leigh says the great chaos between abraham and dives signify an infinite distance which overthrows their seeing and speaking to each other   it says he saw abraham yet they say hell is a place of utter darkness how can any thing be seen in a place of utter darkness   by what means can dives know abraham from another seeing as all confess his body is in the grave until the resurrection  fifthly how could dives speak to abraham his body being in the grave can any speak without the organs of the body  sixthly how shall dives hear abraham at so great a gulf and distance as heaven is from hell  seventhly how comes dives to have such charity in hell to his five brethren seeing he had none to them when on earth  eighthly dives would have abraham to send to them which cannot be because abraham knows us not isa       ninthly how shall abraham send seeing he has no communion with us nor passage to us  tenthly to what purpose will it be to send if they will not hear moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded if one rise from the dead ver    it is therefore a parable and the scope of it is as dr fulk says that those that will not hear moses and the prophets are not to expect to be called neither by vision nor apparition ver    0 this parable is not done but represented says mr cartwright on luke    0 the story of dives in hell is one of their main pillars of hell torments and by that which is said it is shaken and removed  of tophet isa  0   this place is no proof of hell torments themselves being judges they say hell is deep under ground and tophet is a place above ground as has been showed behold the days come says the lord that this place shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter for in this place will i cause to fall by the sword before their enemies by the hand of those that seek their lives and their carcases will i give for meat for the fowls of heaven and they shall bury in tophet till there be no place to bury in jer    to    jer     they confess tophet is the valley of the son of hinnom tophet hebrew toph tympanum that is to say gehinnom greek gehinna signifies a tabret or drumhead or any thing that makes a noise ver    tophet is ordained of old hebrew yesterday prepared fitted for the king and those with him whom the lord will there slay for their sins by their enemies it is deep and large fit for great armies to meet and fight in fire and much wood to consume the carcases slain there the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone does kindle it not a stream of fire and brimstone but like it the destruction being from god was great and terrible or fire and brimstone shall be sent from heaven to destroy them there as ezekiel        dan   0 genesis      tophet is another of their chief proofs of the torments of hell and with that which is said it is shaken and removed  of isa      they shall go forth and look upon the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh  this place is not to be understood of any punishment after this life because it says their carcases shall lie to be seen and others shall look upon them in hell they will confess the carcases of the wicked are not now nor hereafter shall be for a carcass is without life therefore not capable of suffering if they say at the end of the world soul and body shall be united to suffer how is it then a carcass after the end of the world how shall they be an abhorring to all flesh for then there will be no flesh to go forth to look upon them the late annotation of the bible on isa      say the carcases are the forces of gog and magog which shall be slain near jerusalem ezekiel     to  0 and      contains is apparent for after the slaughter is made of them they shall lie a long time unburied and seven months shall the children of israel be a burying them that they may cleanse the land ezekiel        also the judgment inflicted upon them show it to be in this life as pestilence overflowing rain great hailstones fire and brimstone ezekiel      and the end why god punished them show it to be in this life which was that god might be magnified and sanctified in the eyes of many nations after the end of the world he cannot be sanctified in the eyes of any much less many nations the worm has reference to those that are bred and fed upon dead bodies as acts      especially such as lie long upon the ground until they rot and become as dung and carrion john      jer       0 the fire to the burning those bodies not fit to be stirred and removed but to be consumed by fire in the place where they lay isa    ezekiel     that lie rotting upon the face of the earth until they crawl all over with worms and maggots the sight of such is a loathsome spectacle therefore it is said they shall be abhorring to all flesh the greek renders it a sight or spectacle it has relation to tophet abovesaid and the hebrew doctors say the same on this place they shall go forth out of jerusalem into the valley of hinnom and there they shall see the carcases of those that rebelled against me so dr kimchi and abiezr in loc  the worm that shall not die and the fire that shall not be quenched is in this life and not as they say in hell mark       rev    0   ezekiel   etc ezekiel      concerning the destruction of gog and magog as has been showed  concerning luke    they shall not come out thence till they have paid the utmost farthing  this place mr leigh does allege to prove hell torments and the papists allege it to prove their purgatory and to as much purpose for ver      is christs counsel to avoid differences and to compose them that fall out between man and man in this life to prevent suits in law and imprisonment so the text shows and chrysostom expounds it so the word in the greek is an adversary of the law pro    luke      mention is made of the magistrate and jailer which are terms and offices properly fitting the business of this life a like place is matt      to understand luke   of their hell does imply free will and falling from grace and that suffering in hell is a satisfaction and payment of the debt they will confess in hell there is no jaildelivery nor any redemption therefore it suits not to their purpose it is conceived that hell is deep within the earth reason concludes it must needs be dark the grave is called the land of darkness job  0     the cruelty of the enemy is called thick darkness joel    to    the greek poets say it is dark they compare the darkness thereof to a certain territory that lies between baiae and cumae where the cimeria inhhabit so environed with hills that the sun never came to it whereupon the proverb comes darker than the darkness of cimeria but the chief cause is because they are in darkness without the light of the word for darkness is in this life we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness job      where no light is there is utter darkness when the eye is evil the whole body is full of darkness matt     the dark places of the earth full of cruelty psalm    0 ignorant men are in the dark and full of works of darkness romans      that would have others tormented with cruel tortures and death because not of their opinion in religion all unconverted men are in darkness they are of the night   cor     genesis   christ is the light and saints are the children of the light what communion has light with darkness   cor     darkness covered the earth till christ the light came to give light to them that sat in darkness isa      luke     who has delivered us from the power of darkness col     who has called us out of darkness into his mavelous light   pet    the people that sat in a darkness saw a great light and to them that sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up matt     ye were sometimes darkness but now ye are light in the lord ephesians    the chains of darkness are not material chains but so called because they are fast in darkness and cannot get out the law works wrath when that comes into a dark and ignorant soul it causes weeping and gnashing of teeth luke      being sad and comfortless  of burning the tares matt    0 is at the end of the world ver    the tares are the wicked the harvest is the world by which it appears the wicked with the earth shall be consumed by fire  0     pet    is any so weak as to imagine that earth will ever burn and never be consumed i have seen some burnt to ashes in an hour in a coal fire they say our fire is but painted fire to that in hell if so then it will of necessity follow that so much as that fire is hotter than our fire so much sooner shall the body be burnt and consumed in that more fierce and terrible fire  the wrath to come   thessalonians   0 and     the late annotations of the bible say they were to fill up a full measure of their own and fathers sins because god intended to sweep them away by the hand of the romans to cut them off by a temporal death which was the wrath to come to fill up their sins for the wrath is not shall come upon them to the uttermost   thessalonians     we are by nature the children of wraih that is liable to wrath inward and outwatd thy wrath lies har on me ps     the wrath of god is the hiding of hi face isa     outward wrath is temporal destruction he cast upon them the fierceness of his wrath ps      destroyed them deuteronomy   0 lev  0  jos   0 and    0 numb    0 ezekiel      chr    0 psalm  0   of the word cursed it is to be barren so the earth and fig tree

judgment eternal damnation is eternal judgment a judgment is a sentence the sentence is to a second death called eternal because it is not to be reversed  the word reprobate is in the greek of no judgment a reprobate mind is a mind void of judgment see romans       timothy    tit     see the notes in the margin  of the word fire fire is put for fiery trials   pet     inward troubles fire in my bones lam     and    the tongue is a fire   samuel    and    his word is a fire jer      gods spirit fire mat     baptized with fire   cor  0  god is a consuming fire heb    last  bellarmin and bullinger and others say the fire of hell is material fire kindled with wood and allege for it isa  0   isa      the fire of hell is true and substantial fire kept under the earth to punish withal says tertullian  the fire of hell cannot be corporal fire for these reasons our fire is corporal they say our fire is but painted fire a shadow to that therefore it is not corporal fire    corporal elementary fire is light and enlightneth the place where it is in hell they say is utter darkness if so the fire of hell is not corporal fire    corporal fire consumes speedily all combustible matter cast into it they say the fire of hell ever burns and never consumes that cast into it therefore it is not corporal fire    they say the fire of hell is invisible then it is not corporal for that which is corporal may be seen    corporal fire may be quenched the fire of hell they say is unquenchable therefore it is not corporal    corporal fire goes out without wood theirs not therefore not corporal    they say the fire of hell is eternal if so it is not corporal corporal fire is seen things seen are not eternal    they say the absence of god is the greatest torment in hell corporal fire is a greater torment to the body than the absence of god  lastly corporal fire cannot work upon a spirit the devils are spirits therefore cannot be tormented with corporal fire says willet synop page  0   to say god is able to make corporal work upon a spirit and able to make to live without food or refreshment to eternity and to make fire burn without wood is no proof that he will do so and is as silly a kind of reasoning as to say god is able to do all things with god all things are possible therefore he will do all things men should not build their vain conceits upon gods power without his word    others say the fire of hell is not corporal but spiritual fire but that it cannot be neither for there is no spiritual fire if it ceases to be natural fire it cease to be true fire it cannot be spiritual because they say it is natural it cannot be natural because they say it is spiritual it cannot be neither of them because they say it is partly corporal and partly spiritual the one to burn the body the other to burn the soul hell flames are material yet not all material says willet synop page  0 0 if so there are two fires in hell bernard says fire shall burn thy flesh and a worm thy spirit conscience accusing isidore says their minds burn with sorrow and their bodies with the flame    others say hellfire is neither material nor spiritual nor mixed but metaphorical figurative so austin and some of the modern preachers say calvin thinks that there is no true fire in hell for says he the wood and worm is to be taken metaphorically but says another that the fire is so to be taken i utterly deny  ten opinions of the learned of the places of hell   mr edw leith hugo and others say hell is a bottomless pit but there is no place without a bottom which is the earth    it is generally agreed that hell is in the lower parts of the earth but where these lower parts should be mr perkins on the creed says no man is able to define the lower parts of the earth is great abasement says dr fulk on phil    the lowest degree of christs humiliation ephesians   0 one part of the earth is not put in opposition to another part thereof but to heaven psalm  0    david says thou had fashioned me in the lowest parts of the earth psalm       was david born in hell    bishop bilson mr wheatly and others say hell is below but how many miles it is to hell they do not say nor cannot tell    bellarmin lyria and others say hell is in the earth near the center hereof if so ye may know how far it is to hell the earth being round the circumference thereof being twenty one thousand and six hundred miles the whole consisting of   0 degrees at  0 miles a degree the diametet of the terrestrial globe is six thousand seven hundred and eighty two miles and one eleventh so there to the center or middle point is three thousand three hundred and ninety miles and half at length deep into the earth to hell but in the day of judgment when the earth shall be consumed with fire as   pet    where shall hell be then it cannot be in the center of the earth when there is no earth    mr leigh and others say hell is a lake the lake is a sea as appears luke     where the swine were choked luke     whose common death is not half a mile men seek hell in the bottom of the sea because they know not where to find it hell cannot be the lake because hell was cast into the lake rev  0      others say hell is in the air the devil is the prince that rules in the air ephesians    the air then is the devils hell says willet synops page  0   if so then all we that are alive are in hell we do find it not a place of so great torment for almost all men like it well for there they desire to dwell    others say hell is above near the third heavens within the view of the glorious saints and allege for it isa      rev    0 if so it is very far to hell astronomers say that there are three heavens above the firmament where the fixed stars are is a hundred and sixteen millions of miles above the earth which is so high that if a stone or weight should fall from thence and continue falling an hundred and fifty miles an hour it would be eightyeight years two weeks four days five hours and twenty minutes a falling down to the earth    some say the absence of gods face is hell but that is not called hell but wrath isa     this was cains punishment from thy face shall i be hid my punishment is greater than i can bear genesis       the hiding of gods face causes sadness and the breaking of the bones of comfort psalm     behold his eyelids try the children of men psalm     if shut they are troubled if open they are comforted    some say hell is in this life and is a guilty accusing conscience dr willet says a guilty troubled conscience is a hell and prison of the soul what may rather be called hell than anguish of soul the judges tribunal is in the soul god sits there as judge the conscience is the accuser fear is the tormentor guilt in the soul wounds the spirit a wounded spirit who can bear prove      they the spirits in prison   pet     this is the wrath of god that abides upon him that believes not in the son john     heaven is gods face and presence and our greatest joy in this life exodus        and so will be the next psalm     thou will fill me with the joy of thy face in thy presence is fullness of joy acts     pleasures or pleasantness that is pleasant joys at thy right hand in the full enjoyment of thee are sweet delights eternal  some say hell is a local place augustine says it is not a place doctor willet says the place of hell makes not the torments it is a question says he whether the place make hell or the absence of the presence of god synops page  0     0 another says it is in the other side of the blue cloud that appears to us in the air others say where the place of hell is they cannot tell whether it be in the earth or in the water or in the air it is not revealed says greenwood they that have taken pains to find it out are as far from it as ever some of the ministers of france affirm that father cotton the jesuit did enquire of the devil for a plain place of scripture to prove purgatory so they are at as great loss to prove hell by a plain place of scripture truly translated their hell of torments never to end also the learned agree not upon which scripture to ground their hell torments upon for that place one of them allege to prove it another of themselves deny it that it is so to be understood mr ainsw on psalm  0   says that place through custom is taken for the place of the damned but is not so to be understood the word being sheol marolat on apoc page     says the fire of gehenna is the place of the damned others of them deny it m leigh says dives proves it dr fulk and others deny it  see ye not the great doubting and uncertainty they are at among themselves they grope in the dark without light job     by their reeling staggering and stumbling that they are so drunk they can find no ground to stand upon they understand not whereof they affirm yet each of them hugs his own apprehension it is very strange that in a thing so signal of which they say they see it in the word of god that they can no way agree concerning it o ye learned in the seven liberal sciences tell us how to reconcile these things in point of truth or tell us in as much as ye speak contraries as yea and nay which of you we are to believe have we not all cause to say herein where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world has not god made foolish the wisdom of this world   cor   0 he frustrateth the tokens of liars and makes diviners mad and turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolishness isaiah       mr edward leigh esquire and master of magdalenhall in oxford presents his reasons to prove hell torments or punishment after this life for some to endure never to end let them be considered prove      mr leigh says the conscience of man has a fear of some punishment after this life proves it  answ if they have that does not prove it because the conscience of men are as they are instructed according to the proverb such docter such scholar hence it is that the conscience of a papist tells him it is not lawful to eat flesh in lent not of a friday and whosoever kills you will think he does god good service joh     that is his conscience the consciences of some men are almost if not altogether for some evil therefore that proves it not  mr leigh the heathen held there was a hell a being and place for wicked men after this life  answ why did ye not say and prove that they hold that they shall be in torment never to an end  the heathens do not believe that there is to be such a punishment after this life for they deny the resurrection of the body therefore they burn the body and save the ashes in an urn for a memorial they believe as pythagoras the philosopher taught that the soui goes from one body into another man or beast that some of the philosohers grew so tender that they would not kill any beast nor fowl for they said it may be it is my brother or my sister these heathen greek poets were long before the coming of christ in their treble division of the world they fain three gods jupiter the god of heaven neptune the god of the sea and pluto the god of the earth in which they say he keeps his court and palace no word of torment that would make it a poor court and palace so homer and noninus greek poets homer wrote of the destruction of troy which was near a thousand years before the birth of christ homer is one of the most ancient records extant it seems in his time there was no mention of a hell of torments never to end the said poets call pluto summanus as being chief of the maunes or spirits below to pacify these ill spirits a feast was kept in febuary with wax candles burning to pluto called candlemasday so mr jes in his almanac the cretians are always liers titus     the greatst liars in the world that will fancy fain and say any thing is it a thing possible that wax candles above the earth should give light thousand of miles into the earth to pacify those ill spirits there it seems they are not in any great torment if a little light will pacify them the poets say hell is twice as deep as heaven is high the astronomers say jupiter the second planet is    millions of miles above the earth if hell be twice as deep it is a hundred and fifty four millions of miles to hell which is fabulous so there cerberus three heads and charus boat to row men to pluto so the fancy of purgatory did spring first from the heathen poets long before the coming of christ as appears by plato and virgil who have described at large the whole commonwealth and all the orders and degrees of purgatory these with their elysian fields and many other of their barbarisms by long use became venerable  your opinion is fitter for heathens than for christians if the heathens do hold as you do are we to believe in religion as the heathen i pass not what they nor any else say unless they can read it me in the word of god we cry to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them isa   0 mr leigh says clear reason proves it god is just many abominable sinners enjoy more prosperity in this life than those that live far more innocently must be punished hereafter according to the multitude and hainousness of their sins psalm       answ i see you are more bold to affirm than able to prove does reason deny the punishment to be just except it never end the scriptures you allege say they have an end and you say they shall never have an end that is your clear reason to say some are worse than others therefore they are to suffer a punishment never to end so you exclude mary magdalen and the poor prodigal but it is but your bare affirmation without proof your reason is that god should show mercy to little sinners but none to the great sinners they must not be saved but this your clear reason is clear against the will and wisdom of god who is pleased to save of the worst of sinners as appears st luke       timothy     asts     if some enjoy more prosperity than others must they therefore suffer a punishment never to end outward prosperity is a great blessing and you make it a great curse if that you say were true there is no cause in the day of prosperity to rejoice eccl     nor to say o lord i beseech thee send me now prosperity psalm       in saying greater sinners you judge according to outward appearances both for sin and punishment and may be mistaken in both what they are in the inner man for sin and punishment you know not the heart of unbelief and rebellion of spirit in others nor how god punishes them in their spirits sin is punished in this life  mr leigh says it is just they should suffer for ever who if they had lived would have sinned for ever cast them out of my sight jer     answ if it be just we should suffer for ever it is just our surety should suffer for ever  do you consider that the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him that has subjected the same in hope romans   0  cast them out of my sight is no proof that they shall suffer for ever but rather that they shall be utterly destroyed for if they have any being wherever they be they cannot be out of sight of god  your justice is not gods his is a death yours is not a death but another thing  mr leigh says gods intentions from everlasting was to glorify his justice as well as his mercy romans       fitted to destruction  answ know you any of the intentions of god that is not revealed in his word deuteronomy      or does the word say that god not glorify his justice unless he inflict so great a punishment without end you give neither scripture nor reason to prove that you say is just the justice of god was revealed and made known in causing the earth to swallow up corah and his company they were vessels of wrath prepared fitted to destruction your opinion denies the word of god that says they are fitted to destruction you say they are never to be destroyed die nor end mr leigh says the covenant under which ungenerate men stand and by which they are bound over to this wrath is everlasting  answ there is but two covenants gal     the old and new heb     and      the old is no more everlasting than the priesthood of it the breach of the covenant of works is death therefore not eternal life in misery mr leigh says in that torment they curse and accuse one another  answ when you write again i pray tell us how you know that in hell they do so for the word of god says not so nor have you been there to hear it nor they that told you so to affirm things in religion not revealed in the world of god is to presume above that which is written and contrary to   cor    rom     socrates an heathen was more wise and modest in not affirming things he knew not being asked what was done in hell said he never went thither nor communed with any that came from thence yet you and others affirm with great boldness and confidence things you know not some say in hell the eye is afflicted with darkness whereas darkness is no affliction to the eye also they say their ears are afflicted with horrible and hideous outcries their noses with poisons and stinking smells of what i pray their tongues with gaully bitterness the whole body with intolerable fire the damned shall prize a drop of water worth ten thousand worlds cursing shall be their tunes blasphemies their ditties lamentation their songs and screeking their strains they shall lie screeking and screaming continually ye see how men set their brains to work to invent lies for all they say is without warrant from the word of god one says their torments in hell is so great that they cannot forbear roaring and you say they curse and accuse one another so that one of their vain imaginations contradict another and all of them the word of god they will not deny that those in hell are in the greatest trouble and they in less trouble cannot speak i am so troubled i cannot speak ps     therefore they cannot curse and accuse one another as you affirm  mr leigh says divines unanimously concur etc  ans if they do it is not binding to us for we are satisfied they are not infallible there must be errors   cor     they have the greatest share the priests popish and mohammedan priests baals priests and all other sorts of priests concur common consent sooner believed than naked truth it is high time to cease from men for wherein is he to be accounted of isa     truth and not number of men is to be followed every one must give an account of himself to god romans         luther said he esteemed not the worth of a rush a thousand agustines and cyprians against himself all churches err parnormitan said more credit is to be given to one speaking truth than to all men in all ages speaking the contrary  they are like to concur and agree if they take the counsel they give as not to question principles it seems we must take all upon trust and hearsay without trial they all say it therefore it is true but the bereans wold and did search the scriptures to see if things were so as the apostles preached see   john     let it be certainly made to appear that god has said in any thing contrary to any thing that i have said i desire with all my heart to submit to it without that i cannot yield the sovereignty of my judgment and conscience to the concurring consent of blind guides ignorant and erroneous men though in sheeps clothing and covered all over with the title of godly learned and holy saints or presbyters or ministers of christ the papists call their church holy church and their priest holy priest and their order holy order and all holy if you will believe them  some say the jews report that in tophet the valley of the son of hinnon there was a great ditch which could never be filled which they called the mouth of hell and that the chaldeans when they slew the israelites threw them in there if this report be true which has been brought to prove hell then it will follow that the mouth of hell is near jerusalem and that god does give to the wicked power to cast his people into hell  how much weight there is in your reasons to prove a punishment after this life never to end let who will judge i for my part profess i do not see how they serve to your purpose your nakedness appears and that your opinion has neither scripture nor reason to support it and therefore it must needs fall   timothy    you have done all you can and can come to no surer bottom to rest upon than supposals and imaginations wresting scriptures and consent of others your glory is that all are of your mind though without good ground or reason as is showed also in that you allege reasons to prove hell torments it gives me occasion to believe in your own judgment the scriptures you allege to prove it prove it not for if you believe the scriptures prove it to what purpose serve your reasons or do you think that those that doubt of the sufficiency of our proof of it by scripture will be satisfied with your reasons as a full proof of it if there be any such they may be to them of some use  the learned contradict themselves mr bolton says thou must live in endless woe in brimsbone and fire which thou might so often and easily escape which overthrows the doctrine of election also they say the sense of loss in hell is greater than the sense of pain so they make the sensible want of the presence of god the greatest torment in hell and that is in this life i am cast out of thy sight psalm     it follows by their doctrine that the greatest torment of hell is in this life  mr leigh says in his body of divinity the sense of gods wrath rage of conscience guilt fear despair the soul cannot melt with greater torment if so then this is not a worse torment in hell than is in this life  water is so scarce in hell that greenhood says the damned prize a drop of water above ten thousand worlds and yet they affirm those in hell shall continually weep etc therefore their own sayings agree not  the first author of the opinion of the torments of hell never to end was marcion the heretic that held that christ was not a man but in semblance and that there was two beginnings two gods one good one bad that there was torments for some in hell was first invented by him he determined the reward of the creature either in torment or refreshment to be laid up for them in hell he was the first author thereof by tertulians confession as says dr fulk in his defense page       see and behold the original of your opinion of the torments of hell an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil luke      the seven pillars of hell shaken and removed the greek fathers were the first pillars of hell torments this came to pass by reason of the ignorance of the fathers in the hebrew tongue their not understanding the word sheol deceived them so says dr fulk in his defense page     the second pillar of hell torments were the writers of the hebrew and greek copies of the bible their defect has put us to a great loss the original copy the apostles wrote is not only unknown to us but to the learned we do not hear of any alive in england that can produce the new testament the apostle wrote it is not enough that they say that we have books in hebrew and greek unless we could certainly know that these copies as they call them agree word for word with those that were wrote by the prophets and apostles many boast of gods preserving the hebrew and greek bible amidst so many enemies as god has been pleased to deliver up christ and his people so also the scriptures into the hands of sinners to be used at their pleasure it is wonderful to consider what adding and altering the scriptues have been subject unto one pope publishes what he pleases for scriptures as pope urban v and within two years after pope clement that succeeded him calls them in and burns them and puts out what he pleases and calls it the holy scriptures if ye will believe the testimony of the learned and godly protestant writers who have not been esteemed blasphemers nor heretics as dr fulk m beza m william perkins dr amiss and others dr fulk says that some greek copies are altered it is not unlikely in his answer to the remist to the reader page    and which is more he says corruption has happened to all copies this day extant in his answer to preface page          whole verses omitted in some copies as   job    is not in some copies nor in the syriack which is ancient as apostles read not this verse at all but is extant in others and that there is at least sixteen various greek copies of the new testament jus divinum page    dr lightfoot says mr beza was a man that always questioned the text to see so many differing copies would put any one to a stand which to believe mr perkin says it must not seem strange that words in the margin have crept into the text dr amiss says helps governments in the first of the corinthians     are not in the original he supposes it to be done by the prelates in favor of their government the preachers who call themselves divines have assumed and challenged divine authority to frame all copies and translations and to expound all txts according to their own minds to maintain their own doctrine and practices to uphold their power and standing hence it is that each differing partys translation agree not that party that would have the magistrate punish idolatry etc have made a text for it job      to be punished by the judges but these words are not in the hebrew but are an addition of their own as appears by the bible printed in london by the assigns of john bill in the year    0 and the geneva bible differs from this and from the translation printed by the stationers london the english transltion has variety of differences not without evident contradiion among diverse places that might be instanced see verse     of the seventh of daniel in the geneva traslation verse   is i beheld till the thrones were set up and in the kings translation printed by the company of stationers london the same verse is i behold till the thrones were cast down and verse    it is but saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and in the geneva translation the same verse is and they shall take the kingdom of the saints both cannot be true which of these is an englishman to believe some say luther added the word only to the text being asked why he did it said he did it to make the apostle say more plainly faith only justifies dr fulks defense english translation page  0 says we follow in our translation as near as we can the holy scripture in such sense if any thing be doubtful as the proper circumstance of the place will lead us unto that we may attain to the meaning of the holy ghost so then it seems if the translator do think the holy ghost means this or that he may translate it so is not this a large liberty the jews take on such liberty  the ministers of lincoln diocese in the abridgment of their grievances delivered to king james page        say that the english translation of the bible is a translation that takes away from the text and adds to the text and that sometimes to the changing and obscuring of the holy ghost and mr broughton the great linguist in his advertisement of corruption tells the bishops that the public translation of the scriptures in the english is such as that it perverts the text of the old testament in eight hundred forty and eight places and that it causes millions to reject the old testament and dr featly dr of divinity in his dipper dipped page   says no translation is simply authentical or the undoubted word of god in the undoubted word of god there can be no error but in the translation there are and may be errors the bible translated therefore is not the undoubted word of god but so far only as it agrees with the original the writings of the prophets and apostles and in as much as our english translation as he says is not the undoubted word of god what is that preaching worth that is proved by it the false glosses and interpretations which are put upon the scriptures by men learned in the languages who have made inconsiderate and bold assertions without proof in not keeping the true and proper signification of the words thereof has caused many errors and great trouble and confusion they put the word lucifer for the day star isa      they have forsaken the fountain and dug to themselves cisterns as jer   and we see the people are willing to give up themselves to a ministry of fables   kings      pet     that makes the scriptures say and unsay which being interpreted is to make them say just nothing the force of education and the custom the countrymen live in is such as ordinarily ingageth them to a prejudice and evil opinion against all principles contrary thereunto though of divine inspiration hence the papists turks and several sorts of protestants cry down and censure each others judgment and opinion as abominable error heresy and blasphemy  the third pillar that upholds hells torments are fond expositors that interpret sheol for hell torments so dr fulk calls them in his defense page  0 i would know why interpreters understand and translate a hell of torments from the hebrew and greek as is not in them as themselves confess as has been showed they will take sheol figuratively and say by tophet hell is figured which is a fancy a fable and delusion that is strong in many that expound scripture without sense or reason it is as improper to interpret sheol for a place of torment as to interpret the word house to signify a horse the scripture is not of private interpretation a sense arising out of the brain of an interpreter is a private interpretation and as the scriptures are not of man but of the holy spirit so the interpretation of them is not to be of man but of the holy spirit oracles signify the answer of god romans    see job    and how read thou luke  0   to interpret words figuratively that are to be understood literally and words literally that are to be understood figuratively is licencious and destructive to the faith of the gospel we are not to interpret any place figuratively unless that figurative sense be expressed in a plainer place of scripture if a man will have an erroneous persuasion whatsoever the scripture says to the contrary he will have it to be a figurative sense they will be left in the clouds of their own persuasion so instead of proving their hell of torments never to end by the scriptures ruffinus and others say they that will not believe it shall seal it which is no proof but a mere shift as very a lie as nurses use to still children by telling them of a great bulbegger and that a man will come down the chimney and carry him away but not any but children and fools will be scared with such bulbeggers  the fourth pillar that upholds their hell torment is the consent of their preachers their learned and godly men agree herein but their weak and various and uncertain grounds declare that they have not studied the point but when teachers and hearers are ignorant any thing will serve and pass for truth the simple believe every word all sorts of priests agree and abuse the people the mohammedan priests blow a powder into their eyes that comes to see mahomet hang that makes them quite blind that for ever after they are led and the priests say that the glory of the sight of mahomet is so great that it takes away their sight for ever after and about easter time for ten days there is great joy about a great fire for their priest mahomet and those that cast themselves into the fire and are burnt to death are counted martyrs and once a year the tomb of mahomet is carried a broad upon a cart and his priests say that those that put themselves under the wheel of that cart and are crushed to death they say to dye martyrs and some are so simple to do so that so they may dye martyrs so the antichristianpriests and all sorts of priests have greatly deluded and deceived the people blowing something into their ears that for ever after they are not able to here and receive the truth but as m beza did detest the papists limbus and purgatory so do i their dreams of hell it being a device of man without scripture with all their uncertain brain sick fancies for the imaginations of men have no end  the  th pillar of hell is their wresting the scripture to uphold their hell of torments this cozeneth and deceives many under color of divine authority when it is but humane though they are not pleased publicly to say so because it streams not to their purpose the scriptures they allege to prove is about considered if any say i wrest scripture i appeal to the learned in the languages for to them concerns the decision of the signification of words who as i have showed testify with me  the sixth pillar of hell is their arguments and reasons they bring to prove hell torments which have been considered  the seventh pillar of hell is a strong persuasion that is in men that the believing hell torments is a great means to leave sin and to live a holy life and the not believing hell torments is a means to commit all sin with greediness and to live as they list for they say men live as though there were no hell  carnal hearts of men taken offense of every thing except the law of works doing to be saved the doctrine of election gods free grace and salvation only and alone by christ without works romans    is changed to be one of the greatest doctrines of liberty to sin that ever was and is by the ignorant made a stumbling block and rock of offense and a cause of carelessness in many ludovick said if i be saved i be saved if i be damned i be damned the papists say if good works save us not to what purpose shall we do them then we may live as we list if we be appointed to life we shall be saved though we sin never so much if we sin we have an advocate   john    not any thing can separate us from the love of god romans   if we be not appointed to life we cannot be saved though we should do never so much good yea see how this truth is turned to wantonness the apostles exhort not to turn this grace of god into wantonness romans      the corrupt heart of man is ready to do it there are many things in pauls epistle which the ignorant unlearned that know not god in christ wrest to their own destruction will any therefore say that the doctrine of election and salvation by christ alone is not a doctrine fit to be taught not come abroad if so the scriptutes must not come abroad  moreover the doctrine of the protestant ministers is charged not only to be a doctrine of liberty to sin but a blasphemous doctrine to teach that the fall and sin of man was decreed they say is to make god the author of evil the protestant writers say that the sin of man was determined of god dr willet synop page   0 he also says the protestants hold that the fall of adam was both foreseen of god and decreed to be not permitted only they allege genesis       sam     acts   and acts       should ungodly lusts judge    for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him that had subjected the same in hope rom   0 dr william whitaker against campion the jesuit says now answer me campion do you think that which any one does how wicked soever is done whether god will or no if you hold that any thing is done against gods will what providence or omnipotency do you leave him for he that permits that to be done which he would by no means have to be done it is certain that he is not endued with so great power as that he can forbid that which he would not have done wherefore you must needs confess that all things that are done are done by the will of god and page     all confess god could have hindered sin to be if he had so pleased but he would not hinder it therefore it was his will it should be the will of god and not sin is the cause of gods decree and the being of all things the will and pleasure of god is the womb from whence springs every work of the creature romans     god must first will his creature to stand or fall before he can do either acts      phil     prove     the evil actions of men are not only foreseen of god but decreed says mr par in hie grounds of divinity we are not saved from sin except we have committed sin therefore salvation from sin is not without committing sin says fulk page     god willed and decreed his glory and mans happiness therefore he willed and decreed the means to it the end and moving cause of his willing sin to be is for his glory which cause it was necessary for sin to be if sin had not been how should the goodness of god in giving man eternal life in glory appeared his love in sending christ to die if there had not been sin there had been no need of christs coming nor of his death and righteousness most of the great works of god in this world and that to come have dependence or reference to sin how should we have lived by faith exercised the fruits of the spirit or have any happiness or glory in the world to come if it had not been for christ and christ had not been if there had been no sin he that wills the end wills those things that are necessarily referred to that end taking away sin was decreed before the world therefore the being of sin was decreed christs death was determined before the world for the end of christ was to restore adams fall if adam had not fallen there had been no need of a christ to restore him the saints were chosen to life before the world choice has reference to the fall therefore the fall of adam was decreed if the will of man had been the first and chief cause of the being of sin then the will of man should be the cause of gods will and so men should be the original cause of the salvation of himself and so much the cause of it that without his will it could not have been and so the determination of god what to do shall not be from himself but from the will of man which is contrary to ephesians     if men should will sin before god willed it then shall the will of god depend and wait upon the will of man as if god should say if man will sin then i will his salvation and if god should first will to send christ to save man and leave it to mans will and power whether he shall fall or no then it was possible for man to stand and so to frustrate the decree of god for if man had not sinned gods decree of sending christ had been void and of none effect mr perkins says god decree the fall of adam if the fall was decreed if man had power to stand then he had power to frustrate gods decree which no wise man will affirm and then that saying that adam had power to keep the law is without truth if he had consider ezekiel       je       god wills all things well he sins not nor can sin because he is under no law god commands men to keep the law that no man can do he commands men to think no vain thoughts and not to sin we cannot but think some vain thoughts and in many things we sin all christ says no man can come to me except the father draw him john       if they be drawn they come draw us and we will run after thee cant    if i put sufficient strength to move the earth motion must needs follow when men sin they are beguiled enticed deceived drawn away they like men have transgressed hos     we are to distinguish between that which follows a doctrine in its own nature and that which follows by accident or rather that a corrupt heart draws from it and is not from the nature and working of the doctrine it self it is strange to consider men are to set upon the popish principle to be saved for their works that they count all profaneness that crosses their way some have burned the bible and doctor crisps book of salvation by christ alone mr archers late of allhallowes london his treatise of comfort to beleivers against their sins and sorrow was burnt by the hangman the same spirit is alive to burn this also i expect no better from such as are not taught of god they condemn those things they know not and think they do god service when they persecute the truth and professors of it  take for instance that the fear of the torments of hell is no such preserver against sin is evident for those that sin with the greatest greediness the greatest sinners they do believe there are hell torments for though they be never so wicked they hope it does not belong to them or they hope to repent and lead new lives before they die though they sin for the present they hope to make god amends for all as an arminian being drunk says that he was now in the state of damnation but he said he would be in the state of grace to morrow so he comforted himself the lives of many heathens that have denied the resurrection of the body and therefore did not hold a hell of torment after have been better than many that seek to escape hell and get heaven by their works    if fear of hell were a preserver against sin then those that are delivered from the fear of hell that believe they shall be saved they should sin more than others but we find the contrary that none more free from sin than these    experience teaches that the fear of hell though at first it startleth and frighteth men yet that is soon over and is no preserver against sin i knew one set before him the torments of hell to keep him from sin and finding that would not do he added vows and curses to keep him from sin i knew another wished the devil to take him soul and body if he did not do the thing he spoke of and i knew he did it not another wished he might sink into hell presently if he did the thing he spoke of yet did do it before he went from the place the reason is because the lusts of men are stronger than the fear of hell resolutions and curses  because men are given up to their own hearts lusts it may be that they may find that liberty to sin is the greatest misery and bondage in the world it has all misery in it whether they sin with more or less fear and could enjoy all the pleasures of sin for a season they will find they have made a bad bargain of it what fruit had ye of those things whereof ye are now ashamed romans     if i sin thou markest me job  0   be sure your sin will find you out numbers      in keeping thy commands there is great reward psalm      in breaking them a great punishment loss of inward peace and comfort a guilty accusing conscience disgrace affliction losses crosses and death the bloody and deceitful man shall not live out half his days psalm      i will curse your blessings mal    see deuteronomy     men sin because they are led captive by the devil at his will   timothy    and     also men sin because they are under the law so long as a man is under the law sin will have dominion over a man romans     sin shall not have dominion over them that are under grace    men sin because they have not received power from on high against sin until they receive that power they cannot but sin thou have led captivity captive and given gifts for men psalm      until christ by his spirit set the soul at liberty it is in bondage and enthralled to base lusts but if the son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed john     but not till then see eccles     the punishment of the magistrates keeps men from abusing others more than fear of hell men would be exceeding dissolute if under no discipline of superiors    men go to sin for comfort sweetness and satisfaction but when satisfied they go not to sin to act for life is no love to god nor selfdenial nor any spiritualness nor will it do them good it is not accepted of god nor will it continue such so restrained ofttimes do exceed all other in sin the spiritual soul that lives in the enjoyments of the love of god needs no such weights to procure its motion he acts from a new life and principle to the glory of god and good of others and in this work and labor of love is more sweetness than is in all the pleasures of sin which are but for a season  it is great ignorance for any to think that it is in the power of any man to sin as much as he will if this be proved all objections are answered and this the scripture proves that without the will of god men cannot do any thing not so much as go to a city unless god will jam       god works governs and disposes all things after the counsel of his own will ephesians       job he   act      romans     who has resisted his will gods will is done luke     hebr    ephesians    acts    0 the measure of mens sins are

works and sins surely the wrath of man shall praise thee and the remainder of wrath shall thou restrain ps    0  setting aside the opinions and conjectures of mens devised fables i am fully satisfied with the testimony of the word of god besides their own testimony which is sufficient against themselves with which i see through the thick darkness of the inventions and traditions of men  several considerations that there is not to be a punishment after this life that shall never end   we do not find the place of hell mentioned in any of the six days work of god if it be a place it is a created place and so a part of the creation of god the whale is mentioned in scripture if there be a place of hell it is a greater thing and in that it is not found in the creation of god it is a ground to judge that it is of the creation of man a vain imagination of man for their reasons prove it not nor do they agree amongst themselves of the proof of it neither where it is nor what it is    solomon was wiser than all men   king     yet he spoke not any thing of the torments of hell nor of any punishment never to end he spoke from the cedar to the hysop he spoke also of beasts and fouls of creeping things and of fishes v    if he had known of any hell and torments there he would have spoken of that also    the jews unto whom were committed the oracles of god romans    to give unto us they have delivered no such thing to us nor do they believe any such thing for the hebrew doctors understand the seventh day of seven thousand years which is in the world to come he blessed because in the seven thousand years all souls shall be bound up in the bundle of life in the world to come aisnworth on genesis   a day with the lord is as a thousand years   pet    the jews say as the world was made in six days so it should continue six thousand years and no more and that the seventh day in the seven thousand years in the world to come in which all souls shall be blessed also they say a good man and a bad man died afterward one in a vision saw the good man walking in gardens among pleasant fountains of water but the bad man near a river and his tongue reaching after water but could not reach it talm jerus in chag fol    col   in that these things are received among them for truth though they be but jewish fables yet by them we see evidently that they do not believe the opinion of a torment after this life never to end the jews and hebrew doctors were great searchers of every tittle of scriptures and if it had been there to be seen they or their prophets should have seen it    the saints recorded in scripture did not believe that there was to be a punishment for any to endure never to end this appears because when they made a confession of sin and the punishment due to them for the same they do not confess to have deserved any such punishment they confess to us belongs confusion of face dan      its the lords mercy we are not consumed lam     thou have delivered me from death psalm        chronicles    0  nor do we find that they did ever give thanks for any such deliverance if they had known of any such deliverance it could not but appear the greatest deliverance any could enjoy and that it did require the greatest acknowledgment and thankfulness nor does it appear that ever they did pray for or express any desire of any such deliverance in that they express neither it is a ground to judge that they knew of no such punishment and if there had been any such deliverance they should have known it i should not have been hid from them they admired the deliverance of saving their lives from death as the greatest deliverance ezekiel       the kindness of the lord not to die   samuel  0    do you believe that if moses and paul had believed that there was so great and exceeding torment without end that in the least they would have wished or desired to be raced out of the book of life exodus      and to be separated from christ romans    to endure the said torment without end i do not believe that they were willing so to suffer    christ when on earth spoke of the destruction of jerusalem which was to come and wept because they were to suffer that luke        he would much more have spoken of a punishment never to end and wept for them that should suffer that if there had been any punishment for any to endure    because when god does warn any from sin from the consideration of punishment there is no mention of any punishments but of those in this life see   cor  0  to    they shall die of grievous deaths jer     chro    0   cor     death threatened ezekiel       and     to    titus   0   confounded that serve graven images psalm    a punishment in this life jerem     death for idolatry jer     the punishment of idolatry set for an example   pet    be instructed lest my soul depart from thee and i make thee desolate because of thy sin mich     see jer     abomination that makes desolate dan   0 he turned the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example   pet      he that threatened death would have threatened a punishment never to end if there had been such a punishment to be inflicted upon any    because gods punishment of sin is not of so large an extent as his mercy for his punishing of sin is but to the third and fourth generation deuteronomy    thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth unto the skies psalm  0   by truth in this place understand the punishing of sin because the word mercy is put in opposition which lies in forgiving sin the heavens are far above the skies astronomers say the clouds and skies are not above fifty miles above the earth but the heavens are above a hundred and sixteen millions of miles above the skies but the mercyseat above exodus      his nam is his glory his glory above the heavens psalm    why is it said he punishes the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation and not to  tenth and twentieth generation but to declare  is satisfied therewith and requires not a further punishment god does punish sin in the sinner and upon his children to the third and fourth generation but because there is not to be a punishment after this life never to end   because death and the fear of it is called the terror of god genesis     the king of terrors job       therefore death is the greatest punishment and more terrible but if there were to be a punishment never to end nor death but that were the king of terrors for is not terrible at all in comparison of that   because sin is punished in this life to the full if you will believe god he says according to their works and doings i punished them ezekiel      hos     and      jer  0   and      jer      job  0   every transgression received a just recompense of reward heb    would ye have it to be punished to the full in this life and after in the world to come with a punishment never to end that sin is punished in this life see isa     to    deuteronomy  0     mich   0 hag    lamen    i will punish the world for their iniquity they shall fall by the sword isa        to    outward calamity and death the punishment of sin lam       pet     recompence their sin to the full jer      for the violence of the sin of man when all flesh had corrupted his way god says i will destroy them with the earth a flood of water to destroy all flesh genesis         to punish sin twice is as disagreeable to justice as to receive the payment of one debt twice   0 because there is not a worse thing then the dregs of gods fury anger and wrath and these are poured out in this life god does not only begin to punish sin in this life but also finish it in this life for it is said he poured out all his fierce anger he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation psalm      death so it was poured out esa     ezekiel      accomplished my fury ezekiel    it consumed them ezekiel      for yet a very little while and mine indignation and anger shall cease in their destruction jer  0   wrath past job      taken away all psalm     he has poured out all his anger lam   0   zeph    the punishment of their iniquity is accomplished lam     ezekiel     and    and      the dregs of the cup of my fury accomplished ezekiel        therefore there is no continuance of it after this life for when achan was dead it is said the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger jos     but if that they say were true his death was but the beginning of the lords fierce anger  many infallible proofs that there is not to be a punishment after this life never to end proof i because the scriptures hold forth no such thing as has been showed we ought not to presume above that which is written revealed things belong to us deuteronomy       pooof ii their opinion of a punishment never to end is contrary to the word of god in that it does maintain that the wicked shall have eternal life if man was to live for ever why was the flaming sword set to keep the way of the tree of life genesis     left he put forth his hand and take of the tree of life and live for ever no eternal life came by the first adam eternal life came by jesus christ who is the tree of life eternal life promised and given by jesus christ eternal life by jesus christ romans     and he that eats of this bread shall live for ever john     because i live ye shall live also john     god sent his son that we might live through him   john    only believers have eternal life he that believes on the son has eternal iife he that

life then they cannot live for ever god said genesis     if thou eatest thou shall surely die but the serpent said genesis    ye shall not die so the serpent which is the devil has taught men to say as the serpent said now they have eaten they shall not die but shall live for ever and never die which is to say god is the liar and that which the devil said is truth the word says him will god destroy matthew        cor     and     they shall be destroyed   pet     swift destruction their end is destruction phil     their opinion says they shall never be destroyed die nor end which is no destruction the word says the last enemy is death   cor      their opinions says that is not the last there is an after that is much worse never to end it says gods anger is for ever he will never turn from it contrary to jer     psalm    and     and      mr bolton says they shall suffer so long as god is god if so then they have eternal life though in misery whereas the scripture does not declare eternal life to be for all men john       promised us eternal life   john       i give unto them eternal life to as many as thou have given him john      in hope of eternal life john     as many as were ordained to eternal life believed act      they that have done good unto the resurrection of life john     if it be granted that the wicked have not eternal life as has been proved it will follow that they cannot suffer for ever so long as god is god and therefore all their building of a punishment never to end fails grant the first and the later must needs follow  if adam had not sinned he should have died this is proved first because adam in his creation had a natural body   cor      that which is natural is not eternal v    he was of the earth earthly      therefore mortal and corruptible       secondly man in his first being was corporal and visible to be seen things seen are not eternal mr bolton says if adam had stood he could not have conveyed to us a body immortal or not dying in his treatise of heaven page     basil says if god had given adam an immutable and unchangeable nature he had created a god and not a man augustine in his book of confessions says because the lord created a man of nothing therefore he left in man a possibility to return into nothing if he obeyed not the will of his maker  thirdly man in innocence needed food etc that which depends upon mutable and earthly things is earthly and mutable we see it in all other creatures that live upon perishing things at last perish and herein man by the first adam has no preeminence above a beast heaven and earth were created therefore had a beginning and although they have a much longer life than man are to have an end heaven and earth shall be dissolved   pet      if adam had not died romans     he should have continued in this world he should not have gone to the world to come therefore by his fall he lost no happiness nor eternal life in that world for he could not by that fall lose more than he had and was to have death is according to nature but to attain immortality is above nature adam being earth and from the earth his enjoyment life and loss and punishment must of necessity be earthly how comes he then by his fall to be capable of a punishment never to end unless by his fall he could purchase eternal life which none will affirm eternal life cannot be by the first man much less by sin  i deny not but the wages of sin is death romans     there is difference to be put between a natural death and a judicial death the first is from nature the second is from sin if the common death that all die heb     were the punishment of sin as most men think then christ by freeing his from the punishment of sin by bearing death for them of necessity he must free them from dying a natural death but christ freeth not his from a natural death yet freeth them from the punishment of sin therefore to die the common death is no part of the punishment of sin for where sin is satisfied or pardoned or forgiven the punishment is not inflicted if it be how is it forgiven even men when they pardon inflict not the punishment all confess some mens sins are pardoned how then comes it to pass that they die for sin whose sin is pardoned he that keeps my saying shall not see death john      is not to be referred to a natural death but to perish a judicial death john     the scripture declares that there shall be a resurrection of the dead the just and unjust acts      the unjust would enter into life but shall not john   0 unto whom i swore in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest psalm      heb    and your selves thrust out luke      when they rise to judgment at the last day they shall be consumed with the earth by fire that is their end so that not to enter to be thrust out the second death and to perish is one thing if they live for ever and have eternal life how do they perish and how is the end of those things death romans     if there be no end to be carnally minded is death romans    how is this true if they live orever and not die  sin being a transgression of the law is a legal sin and so i to have a legal punishment for some sins is death romans     inflicted by god as genesis     0 and by man a legal death is not from nature but from sin and is a second death if a man for murder be put to death in dying he dies the first and second death for in dying he dies a natural death and a judicial death this later is a second death in that it is no from nature but from sin  men put the stress of the punishment of sin upon the second death but what that second death is they cannot agree among themselves the ministers in their late annotations on the bible on revel  0  on such the second death has no power interpret it not to be destroyed by antichrist nor by the turk v   so then according to their intepretation it is not a punishment never to end mr perkins says the second death is a total separation from god if so it is not a punishment without end and in that god is every where psalm       if they be any where how are they absent from god  if the second death be a death it is not a life of misery never to end that is not a death unless eternal life be a death they confess eternal life in misery is worse than death if so then it is not a death but another thing  the first death is the destruction of the body a separation of soul and body the second death must be like it the second death is an image of the first else how is it a death and a second death the second adam being man was an image of the first the scriptures says the second death is like the first luke    the second is like to it matthew      therefore as the first death so the second is a separation of soul and body else how is it a death or a second death  reuben by going into his fathers bed deserved a judicial legal death but did not die for it genesis      and        chronicles    let reuben live and not die deuteronomy     a judicial or second death the jews onkelos read deuteronomy     let reuben live and not die the second death and jonathan on isa     i will deliver their carcasses to the second death verse    the lord will slay them with the second death by which it appears the jews count the second death is to be slain and if so it is not a life of misery never to end as some say the book of the revelation speaks of the second death dr featly and dr lightfoot and others say that book treats of the church and things done in this world and if so then the second death is a punishment of this life they also interpret heaven in that book to be the church and the late annotations on the bible and mr brightman and others on apoc  0 0 say that the devil in that place is the great turk  it is their opinion that say the wages of sin is not death they say it is a life of misery never to end which is worse and more than death therefore their opinion is contrary to the word that says it is death filled with all unrighteousness haters of god despiteful proud inventers of evil things they that commit such things are worthy of death romans       these are great sinners yet the word says not that they are worthy of more then death and therefore why should any say they are worth of more then death and if the end of these things are death romans     therefore there is not any thing to come after death   kings    the soul that sins shall die ezekiel        that is all that sin does bring forth god in giving his law did express the punishment of the breach of it saying in the day that thou eatest of that tree thou shall surely die genesis     dying thou shall do that is naturally and judiciously not touch it left ye die genesis    to bear iniquity is to dye for it levit     numb      that one man die for the people john      the body is dead because of sin romans   0 he that is dead is freed from sin romans    neither sin nor punishment has any thing to do with a dead man this iniquity shall not be purged from ye till ye die then it is purged from them if this iniquity be purged from you till ye die we learn that death acquitteth talm jerus sanched fol    col    after man had sinned god expounded the punishment of the breach of his law genesis     to v  0 it is evident that the punishment of the old serpent the devil and of the woman and of the man for their sin are only punishments of this life there is not the least word of any punishment after this life much less of a punishment never to end so that by that which is said we may judge of that mr bolton and others say of being everlastingly in a redhot scorching fire deprived of all possibility of dying or of being ever consumed in torment eternally they say the fire of hell burns far hotter than ten thousand rivers of brimstone how know they it seeing they never felt it nor they that told you so three drops of brimstone will make one so full of torment that one cannot forbear roaring out for pain yet it must be born so long as god is god o eternity eternity eternity if so they shall have eternal life which is contrary to the scripture as has been showed and is therefore to be rejected also they say that the soul of the wicked goes immediately at death to hell to the devil contrary to eccles     and     genesis    heb     ezekiel          zach     if the devils are in hell in torment as they commonly and vainly imagine hell is in the wicked the devils evil spirits are there and rule there in the children of disobedience ephesians      pet    matthew     jud    matthew      0    adam in innocence being a natural man he had the law of nature written in his heart the breach of that natural law caused a temporal curse and punishment and not any eternal they that think eternal life is to be had for our works our well doing are prone to think eternal life may be lost for our not well doing but the way of the gospel places not eternal life and eternal death in misery upon our doing romans       also the scripture speaks not of an eternal death and therefore there is no such thing  proof iii their opinion of a punishment after this life never to end makes not sin but christ to be the cause of their so suffering this is evident because if christ had not come there had been no resurrection and if no resurrection there could be no suffering of any torment after this life for if no resurrection they should have perished in the grave their had been their end if christ be not risen they which are fallen asleep are perished   cor        that the resurrection came by jesus christ is also evident for christ says i am the resurrection john      by man that is christ came the resurrection ver    therefore it is called the resurrection of jesus christ   pet     his resurrection romans    philippians       pet     christ is called the first fruits because he first rose from the dead after him others if christ had not risen no man should ever have risen from the dead therefore it is said they came out of his graves after their resurrection mat     and in that christ is the resurrection and the cause of it in that it came by him sure none will deny that if there had been no resurrection from the dead there could be no suffering after death so long as god is god therefore it follows if any man shall so suffer christ is the cause of it for without him they could not have lived for ever and therefore not suffer for ever and is it not very hard and unreasonable and contrary to the word to charge christ to be the cause of their so suffering seeing christ came in love to the world john      to save not to destroy luke     and   0 not to make any miserable he came to save sinners   timothy     luke     he rose again for our satisfaction therefore if none can so suffer unless christ be the cause of it there is no such punishment for any to endure never to end  proof iv the scriptures declare what christ came to do namely to deliver us from the hand of our enemies luke     to taste death for every man heb    see luke     the last enemy is death he abolished death   timothy   0 he has promised deliverance from death and grave i will redeem thee from death hosea      that keeps my sayings shall not see death john       o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory   cor      i will ransom thee from the power of the grave he says not from the torments of hell nor from the punishment never to end o death i will be thy plagues o grave i will be thy destruction hos     so that if there be a punishment after death and grave there is no mention of christs delivering us from that and in that the scripture sith he is able to save from death heb    is as much as to say salvation from death is sufficient and that there is no farther thing to be delivered from than death and grave if there were deliverance from them had not been satisfactory because not sufficient for if there is to be a punishment after death who shall deliver us from that christ delivers from death and grave no further deliverance from any thing is mentioned therefore he has not delivered his from more and therefore there is no further thing to be delivered from so that ye may see that their opinion makes void christs suffering and the saints comfort for if a punishment for ever be due to man for sin christ must for ever suffer that torment to free us from it or we must suffer it the protestant writers confess that the way and means that christ freeth us from the punishment of sin is by his suffering that punishment we were to suffer to this the scriptures agree gal     isa        so that if christ our surety has not suffered the said torments for ever then has not christ suffered enough namely that which we were to suffer and so not delivered us from the said punishment that jesus christ has not so suffered is evident and confessed by the protestant writers some of the protestants say the repobates in hell suffer the want of the vision or sight of god for ever fina rejection   they shall be perplexed with the horror of a guilty conscience   deprived of the gifts of the holy spirit   instead of virtues they are defiled with wickedness indignation desperation christ suffered none of these says willets synopsis page  0 0 far it be from us so to conceive page  0   also they say in hell is inward and outward darkness   a lake of fire and brimstone   fire unquenchable   worm and prick of conscience   malediction   desperation second death christ suffered none of these therefore christ suffered not the torments of hell to be ever in thee in that place they will not say christ is now in if christ had suffered the pains of the damned yet unless he suffer them without end christ suffered not the punishment of the damned in hell which they say we were to suffer also they say they suffer not those torments without sin and desperation will any say christ so suffered also they say in hell they shall see the story of their sins before their eyes the wrath of god lying upon them for their sins cruel indignation horrible outcries blasphemies fretting for horrible torments endless pains without all hope or comfort who dare say christ suffered any of these some that are for the torments of hell confess that it stands not with the dignity and worthiness of christs person nor with the holiness of his nature nor the dignity of his office to suffer in that local place eternally final rejection with desperation with the worm of conscience agrees not to the holiness of his person final rejection christ suffered not nor eternal flames nor the second death for christ to suffer these were to destroy the work of our redemption christ could not be subject to destruction willet synops page  00  christ suffered none of these punishments therefore he suffered not the torments of hell christ was heard in that he feared christ did not fear the torments of hell therefore he did not partake with us nor deliver us from them christ not deliver us from any thing which he suffered not eternal fire in hell he suffered not nor are the pains of this life the pains of hell therefore if there be any such hell or punishment christ suffered it not and therefore we must suffer it see ye not whither this their doctrine tends to overthrow the sufficiency of christs suffering and our comfort in leaving us to suffer the said torments ourselves christ leaving his suffering an example if we suffer with him etc romans     must we suffer the torments of hell i believe christ has born the whole punishment of sin in it i am satisfied and desire no more but how christ suffered the torments of hell i nor themselves see not they say christ being god made an infinite satisfaction paying at once upon the cross that which we should have been ever a paying i grant christ is god but the godhead did not nor could not suffer if the godhead of christ was to make satisfaction to god is to say god satisfies god and if christ as god was to make satisfaction to what purpose was christ to be made man and die if ye say christ was to make satisfaction in both his godhead and manhood does the godhead need the help of the manhood to make satisfaction it is not proper to say god was to be satisfied for god was never unsatisfied god is perfect infinite happy unchangeable how is he so if he were ever unsatisfied to say god is or ever was unsatisfied is in effect to deny the being of god to say he is not happy for satisfaction and content belong to happiness where there is no satisfaction there is no content because no perfection god is one to us there is but one god god was in christ reconciling the world to himself   cor     that is father word and spirit god is one not one divine nature in christ satisfying and another in the father satisfied but the father in the son god in christ the essence of god is one and the same reconciling the world to himself god was never unreconciled to the world it is only man that is at enmity and unreconciled therefore it is said he reconciled them to him the change is in the creature not in god mal    if the manhood of christ was to make satisfaction to god how can man that is finite satifie that which is infinite unless you will affirm the godhead of christ did suffer there was not any thing to suffer but the manhood of christ can the suffering of man satisfy god man is finite so is all he does sin is a transgression of the law sin is a disorder of the creatures first and chief being which stands in righteousness and is an eclipse of the glory of man sin is a defect and discovery of the weakness and mutability of the reasonable creature sin cannot impeach god if thou sinnest what do thou against him or if thy righteousness be multiplied what do thou unto him if thou be righteous what give thou unto him or what receives he at thy hand thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thy righteousness profit the son of man job       god has all satisfaction in and from himself not from any thing without or besides himself god gave not a law to himself to satisfy but to man the law belongs only to the humane nature therefore christ was a man he took on him the form of a servant and became obedient to death the death of the cross phil     a body heb  0 0 obedience belongs to the humane will the man christ made a curse for us he was bruised for our iniquities and with his stripes we are healed isa     0 it was blood that washed away our sins rev    therefore it is said by the obedience of one man we are made righteous romans   0 the word says not by the obedience of god nor of god man god is satisfied but by the obedience of one man we are made righteous the man christ jesus   timothy    the worthiness of christs person did not abolish the equity of the law of god and exempt him from suffering that he ought to suffer luke      some say the suffering of christ was infinite but the word says not so the punishment of sin is death he tasted death he died for us it is no infinite thing to die they reply the sin of man is infinite because against an infinite god to say sin is infinite in a strict sense is to attribute too much to sin and too little to god to give that to sin which is proper to god to equal sin with god is in effect to deny the being of god because there can be but one infinite also to say sin is infinite is to make all sin alike equal for there is no degrees in that which is infinite sin not being infinite needs not an infinite satisfaction they say infinite majesty offended infinite punishment opposed but it is but their say so because it is without and besides the word of god the punishment of sin is not to be taken from the infiniteness of god but from the penalty expressed in his law for the breach of it which is death genesis     proof v the word says gods fury is like fire in the fire of his jealousy he shall make a speedy riddance of all them in the day of the lords wrath ezekiel     but to continue in torment for ever is no speedy riddance therefore there is no such punishment to be the pouring out of the fiery anger of the lord is a day zeph       romans     ezekiel      and      james     isa       the day of the lord is at hand deuteronomy        job  0   a punishment never to end no ways agrees to a day therefore there is no such punishment to be  proof vi the opinion of the torments of hell never to end has and does daily cause much sin for  first it causes fear fear has punishment   john    he that fears is not perfect in love   john     a servile and a slavish fear is sin    it causes many evil and hard thoughts of god    fear troubles the hearts of many of the lords people and makes them sad with their lies this god complains of ezekiel      their lies cause them to err after which their fathers walked amos    christ says let not your hearts be troubled john     the fear of hell does greatly trouble the hearts of many it is gods will to comfort the sad to release those that are bound isa        and  0   a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures in silver prove         fear distracts and greatly discourageth the soul hinders faith that which freeth the soul from fear fits the soul to serve god without fear in holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives luke        fear unfits and disableth the soul to every good work to god or man fear unfits for any outward occasion fear is a weight that depresses the soul and makes it weak it straitneth the heart but hope comfort and enlarges it  the opinion of hell torments provokes the soul to envy and unbelief and hinders subjection to god if the soul apprehends it self liable to so great and everlasting punishment it cannot submit to god nor be quiet this caused francis spira to wish he were above god the light of this truth causes the soul less to sin and less to be troubled to have less hard thoughts of god and less to fret against the lord    their opinion causes an exceeding and unreasonable trouble of mind and melancholy such trouble is sin john     a merry heart does good prove      the knowledge of the truth herein eases the fearful mind and causes as it were a heaven upon earth    their opinion has caused many to murder themselves in taking away their own lives by poison stabbing drowning hanging strangling and shooting themselves casting themselves out of windows and from high places to break their necks and by other deaths that they might not live to increase their sin and increase their torments in hell    their opinion provokes to the greatest sins as despair also to the wickedness that the world lies in namely working for life to do duties to escape hell and get heaven which is to tread under foot the blood of christ as an unholy thing heb  0   in seeking to be justified by the law of works and not alone by the perfect righteousness of jesus christ rev    jer     heb  0 0     0 freedom from fear causes love love causes service the love of christ constrains it tends to the comfort of many that through weakness of faith give way to satans temptations to fear the torments of hell causes a feeble mind comfort the feeble mind   these     its a comfort to many whose children and friends die and leave no testimony of their conversion the fear that they are to suffer so great and endless torment has greatly sadded and troubled the heart of many a parent and friend  proof vii the reason that god gives that he will not contend for ever nor be always wroth for the spirit would fail before me and the souls i have made isa      man is not able to dwell with everlasting burning isa      to be in so great a torment as they speak of without end ease and refreshment the spirit must needs fail a small thing will make the spirit fail if so then the reason is the same against the being of a punishment never to end  proof viii it is not agreeable to the god of nature to go contrary to the law of nature that he has written in mankind there is planted in man an universal love to man especially to their offspring be they obedient or disobedient what bowels of love is there in parents to their offspring when in misery and to others in misery and want sure no man does desire any man nor creature to endure the torment they speak of one year much less their own offspring how then may i or can i think so of god to be less pitiful less merciful then cruel man  jer  0   and hos    to his offspring we are all his offspring acts      sure god exceeds man in goodness if ye which are evil know how to give good things to your children how much more shall your heavenly father give good things to them that ask him matthew     0   thou lord art good and do good psalm       matthew     though they were evil and did evil god did good and gave rain acts      they say the fire dan     is nothing to hell and that the greatest torment man can devise is scarce a shadow to that in hell by which they declare god to be more cruel than man  proof ix if man had deserved so great punishment why may not god show that mercy as not to inflict it as well as to let his sun to shine and his rain to fall on them that no way deserve it seeing he could if he so pleased hinder it we do see men show more kindness to a rebellious and disobedient child then he deserves may not god do the same so much as god is greater than man so much greater is his mercy love and goodness than that in man yea than that that is or ever was in all men all that came from him and all is but the least drop to that great sea and ocean of mercy and love that is in him how little a portion is heard of him job      all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing vanity isaiah  0          o how great is he that hangs the earth upon nothing job     he can and will do for the worst creature far above that which it is able to ask or think  proof x because gods general goodness in the creation of the world is to all his creatures and also in his ordinary dispensation is toward and for the whole universe of mankind he has provided room enough for all men and creatures and all good things for all the profit of the earth is for all eccles    god has commanded us to do good to all he that has two coats is to impart to him that has none and he that has meat must do so likewise luke     all which does hold forth gods good will and care to mankind he that would not have them suffer the torment of misery and want that takes care to prevent that little and short misery will not impose a far greater never to end  proof xi their opinion lesseneth the goodness of god and limiteth to a few whereas the scripture declares it to be to all romans   the creature it self shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of god romans     the whole creation and every creature is angels and men jews and gentiles verse  0 mark      in bondage to corruption subject to vanity idolatry and delusion of the devil that know not nor partake of the glorious liberty of the sons of god shall be delivered from this bondage into the said liberty for god was in christ reconciling the world to himself   cor     this is spoken to persuade them to be reconciled to god verse  0 which shows it to concern mankind the protestants in poland understand by every creature angels and men they say there willcome a time when the angels and wickedest men shall be freed origin one of the fathers held that at last all should be saved men and devils the generality of the fathers held that all souls shall be purged by fire of the last judgment and so pass to salvation moulin page     see romans          all flesh shall see the salvation of god romans     see   timothy      isaiah      the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it isa  0  the times of the restitution of all things god has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since the world began acts     they shall in time be delivered from their bondage for which deliverance they groan are not all angels and men obedient or disobedient the creation of god if so the worst shall partake of the liberty of the sons of god as the whole creation came from god or rather is in god for in him we live it shall be taken up into the same glory a good the larger it is the better if it be good to show mercy to some is it not more good to have mercy on all romans     plato could say god being a supreme good there was no envy in him to any of his creatures but rather a desire that all might be made like him this is so great and glorious a discovery of god and that all men are in god for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are all his offspring acts      i have wondered how the heathen poets came to know this truth sure god did manifest it to them if all men are in god all men are in christ for christ says i and my father are one john  0 0 also if all men are in god for in him we live and move etc if so then all men are in christ for god was in christ reconciling the world to himself   cor    all confess that all that are in christ shall be saved as in adam all die so in christ shall all be made alive   cor      i see god is good and does good and that it is suitable to the being of god to do good to all and that no such torment of such continuance any way agrees to the mind and will of god  romans   puts the second adam in opposition to the first in saving to his sinning if all nations be blessed as genesis      every particular is comprehended in the general word all it is a great lessening of the greatness and glory of the fullness and riches of gods grace to say that god has made this world for all who are many and the best world to come but for a very few shall the fruit of christ the son of righteousness be more narrow and confined than the sun in the firmament whose excellency is that its bright rays and beams are dispersed into every corner of the universe  proof xii it does no way agree to the spirit of a saint we may know the mind of a saint we have the mind of christ   cor     he that is turned to the lord is one spirit   cor     god is in them of a truth   cor    christ in us col     stephen when stoned cried lord lay not this sin to their charge acts     saints they are ever merciful psalm      the desire of the righteous is only good prove      such torment of such continuance in the last agree not to the gracious mind and merciful heart of a saint he desires not any man nor creature to be in such torment an hour therefore it does no way agree to the mind of god we find the more the lord manifests himself in any the more their minds and spirit are humbed the more living and merciful they are even to their enemies and can do them good for evil  proof xiii such torments do not in the least agree to the mind and will of christ christ is full of love and mercy to the worst men it was truly said of christ he was a friend to publicans and sinners he the best friend to them that ever was when they crucified him he said father forgive them luke      when the disciples would have had fire to come down from heaven to consume christs enemies he rebuked them luke     he that will by no means suffer his enemies to suffer a short death by fire will not inflict upon them a more terrible fire never to end ye may know the mind of god by the mind of christ for christ is god alike equal acts    heb    and as one i and my father are one john  0 0  proof xiv such punishments agree not to the fruits of the holy and blessed god the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace goodness etc gal       the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness ephesians    the words of the lord are pure words psalm     the words of the pure are pleasant words prove      good words comfortable words the holy spirit is called a comforter not a tormenter the pure spirit of love sends forth only love and sweetness  proof xv no such torment no way agrees to the nature of god god is love   john     it is his nature there is no anger nor fury in love fury is not in me isa     god wills us to love enemies that abuse wrong and hate us god will do so much more love his enemies luke     if god should only love them that love him do not the publicans the same mat     all that is in god is god as infinite god is love love is infinite without bounds and limits though we in our shallowness and narrowness have often set bounds and limits to infiniteness there was never any beginning in god therefore no beginning of his love the infinite blessed god is one and ever the same i am the lord i change not mich    this love delights in mercy and love and not in punishing of sin that is his strange act isa      christ died to answer the law we broke  christ did not purchase the love of god he loved us before the world began and ever will john     god was never without his love nor is ever out of that love christ says thou have loved them as thou have loved me john      at what shall god be angry or unsatisfied for god was never angry with christ nor his people nor at the being of sin nor at christ taking our sins upon him for he laid them on him the iniquity of us all isa      proof xvi it is not suitable to the mercifulness of a father to his child of a creator to his creature the work of his hands to impose so great a punishment without end upon any of them that were worse then to forsake the works of his hands and is contrary to psalm      your heavenly father is merciful luke     rich in mercy ephesians    the lord is gracious of great mrcy the lord is good to all and his tender mercies over all his works all thy works shall praise thee and thy saints shall bless thee psalm       0 he is good to all he despises not any job     no respecter of persons acts  0    proof xvii sin cannot overcome his love where sin has abounded grace abounds muth more romans   0 this declares the mercy of god to be greater then sin if so the grace of god is to all to the worst for sin aburds in them most and where sin abounds grace abous much more if so then all their sins shall be forgiven and if any were so to suffer how has grace abounded to them much more where sin has abounded answer this if ye can with the lord there is mercy psalm   0  the lord is good to all therefore to the worst of men his tender mercy are over all his works therefore to the worst of men also for they are the work of his hands job      isa     therefore there is no punishment for any to endure never to end he that bids us not to be overcome with evil but to overcome evil with good he will not be overcome with evil but will overcome all evil with his infinite goodness that which is finite cannot possibly overcome that which is infinite  proof xviii god he is just therefore he will not do any thing but that which is just and right the greatest punishment of the breach of his law is death he will not inflict another much less a worser punishment then he has expressed in his law justice is in number weight and measure god requires things equal ye may see the mind of god in his command in forbidding any thing to be done but that which is equal and suitable to the fact as eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot stripe for stripe exodus          how much she has glorified her self and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her rev     what measure you mete to others shall be measured to you again murder an horrible and grievous sin yet it is punished with an equal punishment in this life life for life he that sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed genesis    life for life is equal but to lose life for life and also to suffer so great torment never to end is not equal  proof xix it is no profit nor pleasure to god for any to suffer such endless torment he has no pleasure in the death of any ezekiel        much less can it be any pleasure to him for any so to suffer he desires mercy and not sacrifice mich    if so he desires not any should be so sacrificed in a torment never to end god abhors cruelty anos       and casting off pity  proof xx it is not for the glory of god to impose such a punishment upon any glory lies not in imposing great and terrible punishments that belongs to cruelty is abhored by the light of nature glory lies in great mercy and forgivenes exodus      the greater mercy and forgiveness the greater is the grace and the more is it to the glory of god love covers all sins prove  0   he that covers transgression seeks love pro     if man his glory is to pass over transgression prove      it is for the glory of god to do so much more god made all things and does all things for his glory he seeks his glory in his exceeding greatness and riches of his grace ephesians    it is more for his glory to save all then to save a few the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life romans     sin could not hinder manasses mary magdalen persecutors and wicked prodigals to find mercy i cannot admit to think any thing that is cruel to be in god in love whose goodness is unsearchable past finding out far above all we can ask or think there is such a confused noise among men of the grace and love of god so many several voices that we are in confusion and know not what to make of it look above and hearken to the sweet voice above in the region of love what is the voice in heaven they agree in one there is no voice comes from heaven but love peace and good will to man let men say what they will i rest satisfied in the voice above that is only a voice of love and good will its enough to satisfy any in this doubt and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising god and saying glory be to the highest on earth peace and good will to men luke       not only to some men but to all people v  0 this is glad tidings indeed good news from heaven the best news that ever was that god has good will to men there is no ill will all is good will to men this causes peace and praise glory be to the highest for his sweet peace and good will to men to all people  conclusion in reading the scriptures we are not to understand any text in such sense as is not plain in scriptures or contrary to scriptures or contrary to the law of nature or against the general goodness of god to mankind or to lessen the goodness of god or contrary to the gracious spirit and mercifulness of a saint or contrary to the mind of christ which he declared when on earth or contrary to the fruits of the blessed spirit the nature of the love goodness and mercy of god or that shall tend to contradict or lessen the glory of god or lessen the greatness and riches of his grace for it is not to be imagined that god who is only wise should do and teach contrary things  sure i am from hence arise no inconveniency to the gospel nor is it any dishonor to god nor any grief nor hinders faith and love in any good man nor any discouragement to any in serving of god that there is not to be a punishment for any to endure that shall never end there is not any thing more plain than that which has been said to him that will agree to truth some will not agree to any thing though never so plain and certain if contrary to the tradition of their fathers this their way is their folly and their posterity approve their sayings psalm      who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed isa      some believed the things that were spoken and some believed not acts      they make a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reproves in the gate and turn away the just for a thing of naught isa      o god the lord the strength of my salvation thou have covered my head in the day of battle psalm   0    so be it
