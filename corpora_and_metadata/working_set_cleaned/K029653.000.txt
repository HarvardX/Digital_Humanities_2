the actor a poetical epistle  the actor a poetical epistle to bonnell thornton esquire  quocunque animum auditoris agunto hor london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall mdcclx  the actor acting dear bonnell it is perfection draws from no observance of mechanic laws no settled maxims of a favorite stage no rules delivered down from age to age let players nicely mark them as they will can ever entail hereditary skill if amongst the humble hearers of the pit at some loved play the old man chance to sit am i pleased more because twas acted so by booth and cibber thirty years ago the mind recalls an object held more dear and hates the copy that it comes so near why loved we wilkss air booths nervous tone in them twas natural twas all their own a garricks genius must our wonder raise but gives his mimic no reflected praise thrice happy genius whose unrivaled name shall live for ever in the voice of fame it is thine to lead with more than magic skill the train of captive passions at thy will to bid the bursting tear spontaneous flow in the sweet sense of sympathetic woe through every vein i feel a chilness creep when horrors such as thine have murdered sleep and at the old mans look and frantic stare it is lear alarms me for i see him there nor yet confined to tragic walks alone the comic muse too claims thee for her own with each delightful requisite to please taste spirit judgment elegance and ease familiar nature forms thy only rule from rangers rake to druggers vacant fool with powers so pliant and so various blessed that what we see the last we like the best not idly pleased at judgments dear expense but burst ourageous with the laugh of sense perfections top with weary toil and pain it is genius only that can hope to gain the playrs profession though i hate the phrase it is so mechanic in these modern days lies not in trick or attitude or start natures true knowledge is his only art the strongfelt passion bolts into the face the mind untouched what is it but grimace to this one standard make your just appeal here lies the golden secret learn to feel or fool or monarch happy or distressed no actor pleases that is not possessed once on the stage in romes declining days when christians were the subject of their plays ere persecution dropped her iron rod and mortals waged an impious war with god an actor flourished of no vulgar fame natures disciple and genest his name a noble object for his skill he chose a martyr dying midst insulting foes resigned with patience to religions laws yet braving monarchs in his saviors cause filled with the idea of the sacred part he felt a zeal beyond the reach of art while look and voice and gesture all expressed a kindred ardour in the players breast till as the flame through all his bosom ran he lost the actor and commenced the man professed the faith his pagan gods denied and what he acted then he after died the players province they but vainly try who want these powers deportment voice and eye the critic sight it is only grace can please no figure charms us if it has not ease there are who think the stature all in all nor like the hero if he is not tall the feeling sense all other wants supplies i rate no actors merit from his size superior hight requires superior grace and what is a giant with a vacant face theatric monarchs in their tragic gait affect to mark the solemn pace of state one foot put forward in position strong the other like its vassal dragged along so grave each motion so exact and slow like wooden monarchs at a puppetshow the mien delights us that has native grace but affectation ill supplies its place unskilful actors like your mimic apes will writhe their bodies in a thousand shapes however foreign from the poets art no tragic hero but admires a start what though unfeeling of the nervous line who but allows his attitude is fine while a whole minute equipoizd he stands till praise dismiss him with her echoing hands resolved though nature hate the tedious pause by perseverance to extort applause when romeo sorrowing at his juliets doom with eager madness bursts the canvass tomb the sudden whirl stretched leg and lifted staff which please the vulgar make the critic laugh to point the passions force and mark it well the proper action natures self will tell no pleasing powers distortions ever express and nicer judgment always loathes excess in sock or buskin who oerleaps the bounds disgusts our reason and the taste confounds of all the evils which the stage molest i hate your fool who overacts his jest who murders what the poet finely writ and like a bungler haggles all his wit with shrug and grin and gesture out of place and writes a foolish comment with his face old johnson once though cibbers perter vein but meanly groupes him with a numerous train with steady face and sober humrous mien filled the strong outlines of the comic scene what was writ down with decent utterance spoke betrayed no symptom of the conscious joke the very man in look in voice in air and though upon the stage he seemed no playr the word and action should conjointly suit but acting words is labor too minute grimace will ever lead the judgment wrong while sober humor marks the impression strong her proper traits the fixed attention hit and bring me closer to the poets wit with her delighted over each scene i go wellpleased and not ashamed of being so it is not enough the voice be sound and clear it is modulation that must charm the ear when desperate heroines grieve with tedious moan and whine their sorrows in a seesaw tone the same soft sounds of unimpassioned woes can only make the yawning hearers doze the voice all modes of passion can express that marks the proper word with proper stress but none emphatic can that actor call who lays an equal emphasis on all some over the tongue the labored measures roll slow and delibrate as the parting toll point every stop mark every pause so strong their words like stageprocessions stalk along all affectation but creates disgust and even in speaking we may seem too just nor proper thornton can those sounds appear which bring not numbers to thy nicer ear for them in vain the pleasing measure flows whose recitation runs it all to prose repeating what the poet sets not down the verb disjointing from its friendly noun while pause and break and repetition join to make a discord in each tuneful line some placid natures fill the allotted scene with lifeless drone insipid and serene while others thunder every couplet over and almost crack your ears with rant and roar in so much noise but little sense is found as empty barrels make the greatest sound more nature often and finer strokes are shown in the low whisper than tempestuous tone and hamlets hollow voice and fixed amaze more powerful terror to the mind conveys than he who swoln with big impetuous rage bullies the bulky phantom off the stage the modes of grief are not included all in the white handkerchief and mournful drawl a single look more marks the internal woe than all the windings of the lengthened oh up to the face the quick sensation flies and darts its meaning from the speaking eyes love transport madness anger scorn despair and all the passions all the soul is there in vain ophelia gives her flowrets round and with her straws fantastic strews the ground in vain now sings now heaves the desperate sigh if phrenzy sit not in the troubled eye in cibbers look commanding sorrows speak and call the tear fast trickling down my cheek he who in earnest studies over his part will find true nature cling about his heart all from their eyes impulsive thought reveal and none can want expression who can feel there is a fault which stirs the critics rage a want of due attention on the stage there have been actors and admired ones too whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue in their own speech who whine or roar away yet unconcerned at what the rest may say whose eyes and thoughts on different objects roam until the prompters voice recall them home divest yourself of hearers if you can and strive to speak and be the very man why should the wellbred actor wish to know who sits above tonight or who below so mid the harmonious tones of grief or rage italian squallers often disgrace the stage when with a simpring leer and bow profound the squeaking cyrus greets the boxes round or proud mandane of imperial race familiar drops a curtsie to her grace to suit the dress demands the actors art yet there are those who overdress the part to some prescriptive right gives settled things black wigs to murdrers feathered hats to kings but michel cassio might be drunk enough though all his features were not grimd with snuff why should pol peachum shine in satin clothes why every devil dance in scarlet hose but in stagecustoms what offends me most is the slipdoor and slowlyrising ghost tell me nor count the question too severe why need the dismal powdered forms appear when chilling horrors shake the affrighted king and guilt torments him with her scorpion sting when keenest feelings at his bosom pull and fancy tells him that the seat is full why need the ghost usurp the monarchs place to frighten children with his mealy face the king alone should form the phantom there and talk and tremble at the vacant chair if belvidera her loved loss deplore why for twin specter bursts the yawning floor when with disordered starts and horrid cries she paints the murdered forms before her eyes and still pursues them with a frantic stare it is pregnant madness brings the visions there more instant horror would enforce the scene if all her shuddrings were at shapes unseen poet and actor thus with blended skill mould all our passions to their instant will it is thus when feeling garrick treads the stage the speaking comment of his shakespeares page often as i drink the words with greedy ears i shake with horror or dissolve with tears o never may folly seize the throne of taste nor dullness lay the realms of genius waste no bouncing crackers ape the thundrers fire no tumbler float upon the bending wire more natural uses to the stage belong than tumblers monsters pantomime or song for other purpose was that spot designed to purge the passions and reform the mind to give to nature all the force of art and while it charms the ear to mend the heart thornton to thee i dare with truth commend the decent stage as virtues natural friend though often debased with scenes profane and loose no reason weighs against it is proper use though the lewd priest his sacred function shame religions perfect law is still the same shall they who trace the passions from their rise show scorn her features her own image vice who teach the mind it is proper force to scan and hold the faithful mirror up to man shall their profession ever provoke disdain who stand the foremost in the moral train who lend reflection all the grace of art and strike the precept home upon the heart yet hapless artist though thy skill can raise the bursting peal of universal praise though at thy beck applause delighted stands and lifts briareus like her hundred hands know fame awards thee but a partial breath not all thy talents brave the stroke of death poets to ages yet unborn appeal and latest times the eternal nature feel though blended here the praise of bard and playr while more than half becomes the actors share relentless death untwists the mingled fame and sinks the player in the poets name the pliant muscles of the various face the mein that gave each sentence strength and grace the tuneful voice the eye that spoke the mind are gone nor leave a single trace behind finis
