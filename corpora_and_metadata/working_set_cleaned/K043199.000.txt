knave or not a comedy in five acts  as performed at the theater royal drury lane  by thomas holcroft  second edition  london printed for g g and j robinson paternoster row  mdccxcviii  advertisement the unrelenting opposition which the productions of the author of the present comedy have experienced for several years is well known to those who pay attention to our public amusements it is not for him to pronounce how far this opposition has been merited by inability since the appearance of the road to ruin his comedy of the deserted daughter only has escaped and that as he imagines because it was not known on the night of its first performance by whom it was written loves frailties the man of ten thousand and knave or not have sustained increasing marks of hostility so that the efforts made to afford rational amusement to the public emolument to the author and improvement to morals have been rendered feeble and almost ineffectual in the last instance one mistake appears to have pervaded the majority of the spectators it was imagined that the author himself was as unqualified a libeller of mankind as monrose in which character the writers individual sentiments were supposed to have been incorporated those who have read his other works surely cannot attribute to him any such indiscriminate misanthropy the accusation that has most generally been made against him is that he thinks men capable of gradations of virtue which others affirm they can never attain persons who have made the human mind their study have discovered that guilty men exert the whole force of their faculties to justify their own course of action to themselves to this principle the writer was strictly attentive in pourtraying the character of monrose his design was to draw a man of genius misled by his passions reasoning on his actions systematizing them condemning them in principle but justifying them in practice and heating his imagination by contemplating the crimes of others that he might still maintain that respect for himself of which the strongest minds even in the last stages of vice are so tenacious how far that spirit of faction commotion and anarchy of which the author has long been and is still so vehemently accused is to be traced in the present comedy may now be seen sincerely desirous of giving no offense the passages which were most disapproved or to speak more accurately reprobated on the first night have since been omitted in representation but they are printed between inverted commas that the cool judgment may decide whether the author could have been so insane as actually to intend to inflame the spectators and increase a spirit of enmity between men of different sentiments whom could he reconcile he would account it the most beneficial and heart consoling action of his life the seventh scene in the fourth act is likewise omitted in the performance because instead of giving pleasure it appeared tedious it is inserted here rather to preserve a necessary connection between the scenes than to appeal from the judgment and the feelings of a whole audience  before the comedy appeared all parties were anxious that no sentence or word should be spoken which could be liable to misrepresentation some few passages therefore are committed to the press which never were spoken on the stage particularly the concluding part of the last speech in the second act where monrose enquires into his qualifications for being a lord a few years ago this would have been commonplace satire and it is a subject of no little regret that at present local and temporary applications are so liable to be made where none are intended  truth requires it should be mentioned that in the original sketch of this comedy some hints were taken from il raggiratore la serva amorosa and il padre di famiglia by goldoni but of these though he has not lately examined them the author is persuaded so few traces remain that they are scarcely discoverable they are mentioned because he considers the least concealment of such a kind as derogatory to that veracity which it is the peculiar duty of moral writers to inculcate  february        prologue among the various ways by wit devised to paint our faults and follies undisguisd through every age is found of most avail the well drawn character and well told tale hence has the stage become the last resort of injured innocence her proper court the guilty wretch whom power and gold can screen struck to the soul will sicken at the scene vice that with front erect and brazen eye in broad day pomp will pass unblushing by should he be seen but sitting at a play how will his secret sins that conscious eye betray pert folly too caprice in every freak displays her feathered head and painted cheek while louder far than wisdom in the street she cries  lo here am i come worship at my feet the thoughtless crowd thus summoned to adore her hear stare obey and prostrate fall before her yet let her be in

yards of my white satin train and presumptuously begs for the rest of the season that i would try to amuse you with nature and reason this prayer i protested i never could grant i had ranted and raved

kind   aur this impartiality is to your honor   ol our parents and seniors are in possession of their property and the law tells them they have a right to dispose of that as they please but the hearts and affections of the young are not in their keeping   aur nay nay but every days experience proves the contrary   ol can the cold and palsied hand of age tie the delicate knot of love   aur no but

visitors which cannot be got rid of therefore what do you think of matrimony   aur that it is the paradise of pleasure for a few months and the cave of despair for the remainder of life   ol it is the cradle of love   aur say the tomb and love being dead jealousy anger ambition and avarice all have full play   ol what if love were vigorous enough to repel these ravagers   aur he then falls a victim to the petty warfare of caprice dullness and the desire of novelty   ol what if beauty and wit be his guards   aur alackaday they are guards that always desert their post and when on it are so
