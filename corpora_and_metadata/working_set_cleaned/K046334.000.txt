the times a poem  by   london printed for the author and sold by j coote in paternoster row j almon in piccadilly w flexney near graysinn gate holborn c henderson at the royal exchange j gardener in parliamentstreet westminster and c moran under the great piazza covent garden mdcclxiv  the times the time has been a boyish blushing time when modesty was scarcely held a crime when the most wicked had some touch of grace and trembled to meet virtue face to face when those who in the cause of sin grown gray had served her without grudging day by day were yet so weak an awkward shame to feel and strove that glorious service to conceal we better bred and than our sires more wise such paultry narrowness of soul despise to virtue every mean pretense disclaim lay bare our crimes and glory in our shame time was ever temperance had fled the realm ere luxury sat guttling at the helm from meal to meal without one moments space reserved for business or allowed for grace ere vanity had so far conquered sense to make us all wild rivals in expense to make one fool strive to outvye another and every coxcomb dress against his brother ere banished industry had left our shores and labor was by pride kicked out of doors ere idleness prevailed sole queen in courts or only yielded to a rage for sports ere each weak mind was with externals caught and dissipation held the place of thought ere gambling lords in vice so far were gone to cog the die and bid the sun look on ere a great nation not less just than free was made a beggar by economy ere rugged honesty was out of vogue ere fashion stamped her sanction on the rogue time was that men had conscience that they made scruples to owe what never could be paid was one then found however high his name so far above his fellows damned to shame who dared abuse and falsify his trust who being great yet dared to be unjust shunned like a plague or but at distance viewed he walked the crowded streets in solitude nor could his rank and station in the land bribe one mean knave to take him by the hand such rigid maxims o might such revive to keep expiring honesty alive made rogues all other hopes of fame denied not just through principle be just through pride our times more polished wear a different face debts are an honor payment a disgrace men of weak minds highplacd on follys list may gravely tell us trade cannot subsist nor all those thousands who are in trade employed if faith twixt man and man is once destroyed why  be it so  we in that point accord but what is trade and tradesmen to a lord faber from day to day from year to year has had the cries of tradesmen in his ear of tradesmen by his villainy betrayed and vainly seeking justice bankrupts made what is it to faber lordly as before he sits at ease and lives to ruin more fixed at his door as motionless as stone begging but only begging for their own unheard they stand or only heard by those those slaves in livery who mock their woes what is it to faber he continues great lives on in grandeur and runs out in state the helpless widow wrung with deep despair in bitterness of soul pours forth her prayer hugging her starving babes with streaming eyes and calls down vengeance vengeance from the skies what is it to faber he stands safe and clear heaven can commence no legal action here and on his breast a mighty plate he wears a plate more firm than triple brass which bears the name of privilege against vulgar awe he feels no conscience and he fears no law nor think acquainted with small knaves alone who have not shame outlived and grace outgrown the great world hidden from thy reptile view that on such men to whom contempt is due contempt shall fall and their vile authors name recorded stand through all the land of shame no  to his porch like persians to the sun behold contending crowds of courtiers run see to his aid what noble troops advance all sworn to keep his crimes in countenance nor wonder at it  they partake the charge as small their conscience and their debts as large proppd by such clients and without control from all that is honest in the human soul in grandeur mean with insolence unjust whilst none but knaves can praise and fools will trust caressed and courted faber seems to stand a mighty pillar in a guilty land and a sad truth to which succeeding times will scarce give credit when it is told in rimes did not strict honor with a jealous eye watch round the throne did not true piety who linked with honor for the noblest ends ranks none but honest men amongst her friends forbid us to be crushed with such a weight he might in time be minister of state but why enlarge i on such petty crimes they might have shocked the faith of former times but now are held as nothing  we begin where our sires ended and improve in sin rack our invention and leave nothing new in vice and folly for our sons to do nor deem this censure hard there is not a place most consecrate to purposes of grace which vice has not polluted none so high but with bold pinion she has dared to fly and build there for her pleasure none so low but she has crept into it made it know and feel her power in courts in camps she reigns over sober citizens and simple swains even in our temples she has fixed her throne and bove gods holy altars placed her own more to increase the horror of our state to make her empire lasting as it is great to make us in fullgrown perfection feel curses which neither art nor time can heal all shame discarded all remains of pride meanness sits crowned and triumphs by her side meanness who gleans out of the human mind those few good seeds which vice had left behind those seeds which might in time to virtue tend and leaves the soul without a power to mend meanness at sight of whom with brave disdain the breast of manhood swells but swells in vain before whom honor makes a forced retreat and freedom is compelled to quit her seat meanness which like that mark by bloody cain borne in his forehead for a brother slain god in his great and allsubduing rage ordains the standing mark of this vile age the venal hero trucks his fame for gold the patriots virtue for a place is sold the statesman bargains for his countrys shame and for preserment priests their god disclaim worn out with lust her day of letchry over the mother trains the daughter which she bore in her own paths the father aids the plan and when the innocent is ripe for man sells her to some old letcher for a wife and makes her an adulteress for life or in the papers bids his name appear and advertises for a l  husband and wife whom avarice must applaud agree to save the charge of pimp and bawd those parts they play themselves a frugal pair and share the infamy the gain to share wellpleased to find when they the profits tell that they have played the whore and rogue so well nor are these things which might imply a spark of shame still left transacted in the dark no  to the public they are open laid and carried on like any other trade scorning to mince damnation and too proud to work the works of darkness in a cloud in fullest vigor vice maintains her sway free are her marts and open at noonday meanness now wed to impudence no more in darkness skulks and trembles as of yore when the light breaks upon her coward eye boldly she stalks on earth and to the sky lists her proud head nor fears least time abate and turn her husbands love to cankered hate since fate to make them more sincerely one has crowned their loves with mountague their son a son so like his dam so like his sire with all the mothers craft the fathers fire an image so express in every part so like in all bad qualities of heart that had they fifty children he alone would stand as heir apparent to the throne with our own island vices not content we rob our neighbors on the continent dance europe round and visit every court to ape their follies and their crimes import to different lands for different sins we roam and richly freighted bring our cargoe home nobly industrious to make vice appear in her sull state and perfect only here to holland where politeness ever reigns where primitive sincerity remains and makes a stand where freedom in her course has left her name though she has lost her force in that as other lands where simple trade was never in the garb of fraud arrayed where avarice never dared to show his head where like a smiling cherub mercy led by reason blesses the sweetblooded race and cruelty could never find a place to holland for that charity we roam which happily begins and ends at home france in return for peace and power restored for all those countries which the heros sword unprofitably purchased idly thrown into her lap and made once more her own france has afforded large and rich supplies of vanities fulltrimmd of polished lies of soothing flatteries which through the ears steal to and melt the heart of slavish fears which break the spirit and of abject fraud  for which alas we need not send abroad spain gives us pride  which spain to all the earth may largely give nor fear herself a dearth  gives us that jealousy which born of fear and mean distrust grows not by nature here  gives us that superstition which pretends by the worst means to serve the best of ends  that cruelty which stranger to the brave dwells only with the coward and the slave that cruelty which led her christian bands with more than savage rage over savage lands bade her without remorse whole countries thin and hold of naught but mercy as a sin italia nurse of every softer art who feigning to refine unmans the heart who lays the realms of sense and virtue waste who marrs whilst she pretends to mend our taste italia to complete and crown our shame sends us a fiend and legion is his name the farce of greatness without being great pride without power titles without estate souls without vigor bodies without force hate without cause revenge without remorse dark mean revenge murder without defense jealousy without love sound without sense mirth without humor without wit grimace faith without reason gospel without grace zeal without knowledge without nature art men without manhood women without heart halfmen who dry and pithless are debarred from mans best joys  no sooner made than marred  halfmen whom many a rich and noble dame to serve her lust and yet secure her fame keeps on high diet as we capons feed to glut our appetites at last decreed women who dance in postures so obscene they might awaken shame in aretine who when retired from the days piercing light they celebrate the mysteries of night might make the muses in a corner placed to view their monstrous lusts deem sappho chaste these and a thousand follies rank as these a thousand faults ten thousand fools who please our palled and sickly taste ten thousand knaves who serve our foes as spies and us as slaves who by degrees and unperceived prepare our necks for chains which they already wear madly we entertain at the expense of fame of virtue taste and commonsense nor stop we here  the soft luxurious east where man his soul degraded from the beast in nothing different but in shape we view they walk on four legs and he walks on two attracts our eye and flowing from that source sins of the blackest character sins worse than all her plagues which truly to unfold would make the best blood in my veins run cold and strike all manhood dead which but to name would call up in my cheeks the marks of shame sins if such sins can be which shut out grace which for the guilty leave no hope no place even in gods mercy sins against natures plan possess the land at large and man for man burns in those fires which hell alone could raise to make him more than damned which in the days of punishment when guilt becomes her prey with all her tortures she can scarce repay be grace shut out be mercy deaf let god with tenfold terrors arm that dreadful nod which speaks them lost and sentenced to despair distending wide her jaws let hell prepare for those who thus offend amongst mankind a fire more fierce and tortures more refined on earth which groans beneath their monstrous weight on earth alas they meet a diffrent fate and whilst the laws false grace false mercy shown are taught to wear a softness not their own men whom the beasts would spurn should they appear amongst the honest herd find refuge here no longer by vain fear or shame controlled from long too long security grown bold mocking rebuke they brave it in our streets and lumley even at noon his mistress meets so public in their crimes so daring grown they almost take a pride to have them known and each unnatral villain scarce endures to make a secret of his vile amors go where we will at every time and place sdom confronts and stares us in the face they ply in public at our very doors and take the bread from much more honest whores thse who are mean high paramours secure and the rich gailty screen the guilty poor the sin too proud to feel from reason awe and those who practice it too great for law woman the pride and happiness of man without whose soft endearments natures plan had been a blank and life not worth a thought woman by all the loves and graces taught with softest arts and sure though hidden skill to humanize and mould us to her will woman with more than common grace formed here with the persuasive language of a tear to melt the rugged temper of our isle or win us to her purpose with a smile woman by fate the quickest spur decreed the fairest best reward of every deed which bears the stamp of honor at whose name our ancient heroes caught a quicker flame and dared beyond belief whilst over the plain spurning the carcases of princes slain confusion proudly strode whilst horror blew the fatal trump and death stalked full in view woman is out of date a thing thrown by as having lost its use no more the eye with female beauty caught in wild amaze gazes entranced and could for ever gaze no more the heart that seat where love resides each breath drawn quick and short in fuller tides life posting through the veins each pulse on fire and the whole body tingling with desire pants for those charms which virtue might engage to break his vow and thaw the frost of age bidding each trembling nerve each muscle strain and giving pleasure which is almost pain women are kept for nothing but the breed for pleasure we must have a ganymede a fine fresh hylas a delicious boy to serve our purposes of beastly joy fairest of nymphs where every nymph is fair whom nature formed with more than common care with more than common care whom art improved and both declared most worthy to be loved  neglected wanders whilst a crowd pursue and consecrate the steps  she hapless maid born in a wretched hour wastes lifes gay prime in vain like some fair flower sweet in its scent and lively in its hue which withers on the stalk from whence it grew and dies uncroppd whilst he admired carest beloved and every where a welcome guest with brutes of rank and fortune plays the whore for their unnatral lust a common sewr dine with apicius  at his sumptuous board find all the world of dainties can afford  and yet so much distempered spirits pall the sickly appetite amidst them all apicius finds no joy but whilst he carves for every guest the landlord sits and starves the forest haunch fine fat in flavor high kept to a moment smokes before his eye but smokes in vain his heedless eye runs over and loathes what he had deified before the turtle of a great and glorious size worth its own weight in gold a mighty prize for which a man of taste all risques would run itself a feast and every dish in one the turtle in luxurious pomp comes in kept killed cut up prepared and dressed by quin in vain it comes in vain lies full in view as quin has dressed it he may eat it too apicius cannot  when the glass goes round quickcircling and the roofs with mirth resound sober he sits and silent  all alone though in a crowd and to himself scarce known on grief he feeds nor friends can cure nor wine suspend his cares and make him cease to pine why mourns apicius thus why runs his eye heedless over delicates which from the sky might call down jove where now his generous wish that to invent a new and better dish the world might burn and all mankind expire so he might roast a phoenix at the fire why swims that eye in tears which through a race of sixty years never showed one sign of grace why feels that heart which never felt before why does that pampered glutton eat no more who only lived to eat his stomach palled and drowned in floods of sorrow has fate called his father from the grave to second life has clodius on his hands returned his wife or has the law by strictest justice taught compelled him to restore the dower she brought has some bold creditor against his will brought in and forced him to discharge a bill where eating had no share has some vain wench run out his wealth and forced him to retrench has any rival glutton got the start and beat him in his own luxurious art bought cates for which apicius could not pay or dressed old dainties in a newer way has his cook worthy to be slain with rods spoiled a dish fit to entertain the gods or has some varlet crossed by cruel fate thrown down the price of empires in a plate none none of these  his servants all are tried so sure they walk on ice and never slide his cook an acquisition made in france might put a cloe out of countenance nor though old holles still maintains his stand has he one rival glutton in the land women are all the objects of his hate his debts are all unpaid and yet his state in full security and triumph held unless for once a knave should be expelled his wife is still a whore and in his power the woman gone he still retains the dower sound in the grave thanks to his filial care which mixed the draught and kindly sent him there his father sleeps and till the last trump shake the corners of the earth shall not awake whence flows this sorrow then behind his chair did thou not see decked with a solitaire which on his bare breast glittering played and graced with nicest ornaments a stripling placed a smooth smug stripling in lifes fairest prime did thou not mind too how from time to time the monstrous letcher tempted to despise all other dainties thither turned his eyes how he seemed inly to reproach us all who strove his fixed attention to recall and how he wished even at the time of grace like janus to have had a double face his cause of grief behold in that fair boy apicius dotes and corydon is coy vain and unthinking stripling when the glass meets thy too curious eye and as you pass flattering presents in smiles thy image there why do thou bless the gods who made thee fair blame their large bounties and with reason blame curse curse thy beauty for it leads to shame when thy hot lord to work thee to his end bids showers of gold into thy breast descend suspect his gifts nor the vile giver trust they are baits for virtue and smell strong of lust on those gay gaudy trappings which adorn the temple of thy body look with scorn view them with horror they pollution mean and deepest ruin thou have often seen from amongst the herd the fairest and the best carefully singled out and richly dressed with grandeur mocked for sacrifice decreed only in greater pomp at last to bleed be warned in time the threatned danger shun to stay a moment is to be undone what though temptation proof thy virtue shine nor bribes can move nor arts can undermine all other methods failing one resource is still behind and thou must yield to force paint to thyself the horrors of a rape most strongly paint and while thou can escape mind not his promises  they are made in sport  made to be broke  was he not bred at court trust not his honor he is a man of birth attend not to his oaths  they are made on earth not registred in heaven  he mocks at grace and in his creed god never found a place  look not for conscience  for he knows her not so long a stranger she is quite forgot  nor think thyself in law secure and firm  thy master is a lord and thou a worm a poor mean reptile never meant to think who being well supplied with meat and drink and suffered just to crawl from place to place must serve his lusts and think he does thee grace fly then whilst yet it is in thy power to fly but whither can thou go on whom rely for wished protection virtues sure to meet an armed host of foes in every street what boots it of apicius fearful grown headlong to fly into the arms of stone or why take refuge in the house of prayer if sure to meet with an apicius there trust not old age which will thy faith betray saint socrates is still a goat though gray trust not green youth florio will scarce go down and at eighteen has surfeited the town trust not to rakes  alas it is all pretense  they take up raking only as a fence against common fame  place h  in thy view he keeps one whore as barrowby kept two trust not to marriage  t  took a wife who chaste as dian might have passed her life had she not far more prudent in her aim to propagate the honors of his name and save expiring titles taken care without his knowledge to provide an heir trust not to marriage in mankind unread s  s a married man and s  new wed would thou be safe society forswear fly to the desert and seek shelter there herd with the brutes  they follow natures plan  there is not one brute so dangerous as man in africs wilds  amongst them that refuge find which lust denies thee here among mankind renounce thy name thy nature and no more pique thy vain pride on manhood on all four walk as you see those honest creatures do and quite forget that once you walked on two but if the thoughts of solitude alarm and social life has one remaining charm if still thou art to jeopardy decreed amongst the monsters of augustas breed lay by thy sex thy safety to procure put off the man from men to live secure go forth a woman to the public view and with their garb assume their manners too had the lightfooted greek of chirons school been wise enough to keep this single rule the maudlin hero like a puling boy robbed of his plaything on the plains of troy had never blubbered at patroclus tomb and placed his minion in his mistress room be not in this than catamites more nice do that for virtue which they do for vice thus shall thou pass untainted lifes gay bloom thus stand uncourted in the drawing room at midnight thus untempted walk the sttreet and run no danger but of being beat where is the mother whose officious zeal discreetly judging what her daughters feel by what she felt herself in days of yore against that letcher man makes fast the door who not permits even for the sake of prayer a priest uncastrated to enter there nor could her wishes and her care prevail would suffer in the house a fly that is male let her discharge her cares throw wide her doors her daughters cannot if they would be whores nor can a man be found as times now go who thinks it worth his while to make them so though they more fresh more lively than the morn and brighter than the noonday sun adorn the works of nature though the mothers grace revives improved in every daughters face undisciplined in dull discretions rules untaught and undebauchd by boarding schools free and unguarded let them range the town go sorth at random and run pleasure down start where she will discard all taint of fear nor think of danger when no dangers near watch not their steps  they are safe without thy care unless like jennets they conceive by air and every one of them may die a nun unless they breed like carrion in the sun men dead to pleasure as they are dead to grace against the law of nature set their face the grand primoeval law and seem combined to stop the propagation of mankind vile pathicks read the marriage act with pride and fancy that the law is on their side broke down and strength a stranger to his bed old l  though yet alive is dead t  lives no more or lives not to our isle no longer blessed with a cz  s smile t  is at p  disgraced and m  grown gray perforce grows chaste nor to the credit of our modest race rises one  to supply their place a maidenhead which twenty years ago in mid december the rank fly would blow though closely kept now when the dogstars heat enflames the marrow in the very street may lie untouched left for the worms by those who daintily pass by and hold their nose poor plain concupiscence is in disgrace and simple letchry dares not show her face least she be sent to bridewell bankrupts made to save their fortunes bawds leave off that trade which first had left off them to wellclose square fine fresh young strumpets for dodd preaches there throng for subsistence pimps no longer thrive and pensions only keep l  alive where is the mother who thinks all her pain and all her jeopardy of travail gain when a man child is born thinks every prayer paid to the sull and answered in an heir shortsighted woman little does she know what streams of sorrow from that source may flow little suspect whilst she surveys her boy her young narcissus with an eye of joy too full for continence that fate could give her darling as a curse that she may live ere sixteen winters their short course have run in agonies of soul to curse that son pray then for daughters ye wise mothers pray they shall reward your love nor make ye gray before your time with sorrow they shall give ages of peace and comfort whilst ye live make life most truly worth your care and save in spite of death your memries from the grave that sense with more than manly vigor fraught that fortitude of soul that stretch of thought that genius great beyond the narrow bound of earths low walk that judgment perfect found when wanted most that purity of taste which critics mention by the name of chaste adorned with elegance that easy flow of ready wit which never made a foe that face that form that dignity that ease those powers of pleasing with that will to please by which lepel when in her youthful days even from the currish pope extorted praise we see transmitted in her daughter shine and view a new lepel in caroline is a son born into this world of woe in neverceasing streams let sorrow flow be from that hour the house with sables hung let lamentations dwell upon thy tongue even from the moment that he first began to wail and whine let him not see a man lock lock him up far from the public eye give him no opportunity to buy or to be bought b  though rich was sold and gave his body up to shame for gold let it be bruited all about the town that he is coarse indelicate and brown an antidote to lust his face deep scared with the small pox his body maimed and marred eat up with the kings evil and his blood tainted throughout a thick and putrid flood where dwells corruption making him all over from head to foot a rank and running sore should thou report him as by nature made he is undone and by thy praise betrayed give him out fair letchers in number more more brutal and more fierce than thronged the door of lor in sodom shall to thine repair and force a passage though a god is there let him not have one servant that is male where lords are baffled servants often prevail some vices they propose to all agree h  was guilty but was m  free give him no tutor  throw him to a punk rather than trust his morals to a monk  monks we all know  we who have lived at home from fair report and travelers who roam more feelingly  nor trust him to the gown it is often a covering in this vile town for base designs ourselves have lived to see more than one parson in the pillory should he have brothers image to thy view a scene which though not public made is true let not one brother be to the other known nor let his father sit with him alone be all his servants female young and fair and if the pride of nature spur thy heir to deeds of venery if hot and wild he chance to get some score of maids with child chide but forgive him whoredom is a crime which more at this than any other time calls for indulgence and amongst such a race to have a bastard is some sign of grace born in such times should i sit tamely down suppress my rage and saunter through the town as one who knew not or who shared these crimes should i at lesser evils point my rimes and let this giant sin in the full eye of observation pass unwounded by though our meek wives passive obedience taught patiently bear those wrongs for which they ought with the brave spirit of their dams possessed to plant a dagger in each husbands breast to cut off male increase from this fair isle and turn our thames into another nile though on his sunday the smug pulpiteer loud against all other crimes is silent here and thinks himself absolved in the pretense of decency which meant for the defense of real virtue and to raise her price becomes an agent for the cause of vice though the law sleeps and through the care they take to drug her well may never more awake born in such times nor with that patience cursed which saints may boast of i must speak or burst but if too eager in my bold cariere happily i wound the nice and chaster ear if all unguarded all too rude i speak and call up blushes in the maidens cheek forgive ye fair  my real motives view and to forgiveness add your praises too for you i write  nor wish a better plan  the cause of woman is most worthy man  for you i still will write nor hold my hand whilst there is one slave of sodom in the land let them fly far and skulk from place to place not daring to meet manhood face to face their steps i will track nor yield them one retreat where they may hide their heads or rest their feet till god in wrath shall let his vengeance fall and make a great example of them all bidding in one grand pile this town expire her towers in dust her thames a lake of fire or they most
