its last paper and named those who had most helped him to keep up the spirit of so long and approved a performance he gave chief honour to one who had on his page as in his heart no name but friend this was the gentleman of whose assistance i formerly boasted in the preface and concluding leaf of my tatlers i am indeed much more proud of his longcontinued friendship than i should be of the fame of being thought the author of any writings which he himself is capable of producing i remember when i finished the tender husband i told him there was nothing i so ardently wished as that we might some time or other publish a work written by us both which should bear the name of the monument in memory of our friendship why he refers to such a wish his next words show the seven volumes of the spectator then complete were to his mind the monument and of the friendship it commemorates he wrote i heartily wish what i have done here were as honorary to that sacred name as learning wit and humanity render those pieces which i have taught the reader how to distinguish for his so wrote steele and the spectator will bear witness how religiously his friendship was returned in number     when paraphrasing davids hymn on gratitude the rising soul of addison surveyed the mercies of his god was it not steele whom he felt near to him at the mercyseat as he wrote thy bounteous hand with worldly bliss has made my cup run oer and in a kind and faithful friend has doubled all my store the spectator steeleandaddisons spectator is a monument befitting the most memorable friendship in our history steele was its projector founder editor and he was writer of that part of it which took the widest grasp upon the hearts of men his sympathies were with all england defoe and he with eyes upon the future were the truest leaders of their time it was the firm hand of his friend steele that helped addison up to the place in literature which became him it was steele who caused the nice critical taste which addison might have spent only in accordance with the fleeting fashions of his time to be inspired with all addisons religious earnestness and to be enlivened with the free play of that sportive humour delicately whimsical and gaily wise which made his conversation the delight of the few men with whom he sat at ease it was steele who drew his friend towards the days to come and made his gifts the wealth of a whole people steele said in one of the later numbers of his spectator no     to which he prefixed a motto that assigned to himself only the part of whetstone to the wit of others i claim to myself the merit of having extorted excellent productions from a person of the greatest abilities who would not have let them appear by any other means there were those who argued that he was too careless of his own fame in unselfish labour for the exaltation of his friend and no doubt his rare generosity of temper has been often misinterpreted but for that addison is not answerable and why should steele have defined his own merits he knew his countrymen and was in too genuine accord with the spirit of a time then distant but now come to doubt that when he was dead his whole lifes work would speak truth for him to posterity  the friendship of which this work is the monument remained unbroken from boyhood until death addison and steele were schoolboys together at the charterhouse addison was a deans son and a private boarder steele fatherless and a boy on the foundation they were of like age the register of steeles baptism corroborated by the entry made on his admission to the charterhouse which also implies that he was baptized on the day of his birth is march         old style new style      addison was born on mayday      thus there was a difference of only seven weeks  steeles father according to the register also named richard was an attorney in dublin steele seems to draw from experience — although he is not writing as of himself or bound to any truth of personal detail — when in no     of the tatler he speaks of his father as having died when he was not quite five years of age and of his mother as a very beautiful woman of a noble spirit the first duke of ormond is referred to by steele in his dedication to the lying lover as the patron of his infancy and it was by this nobleman that a place was found for him when in his thirteenth year among the foundation boys at the charterhouse where he first met with joseph addison addison who was at school at lichfield in        went to the charterhouse in      and left in      when he was entered of queens college oxford steele went to oxford two years later matriculating at christ church march         0 the year in which addison was elected a demy of magdalene a letter of introduction from steele dated april        refers to the administration of the will of my uncle gascoigne to whose bounty i owe a liberal education this only representative of the family ties into which steele was born an uncle whose surname is not that of steeles mother before marriage appears therefore to have died just before or at the time when the spectator undertook to publish a sheetful of thoughts every morning and — addison here speaking for him — looked forward to leaving his country when he was summoned out of it with the secret satisfaction of thinking that he had not lived in vain to steeles warm heart addisons friendship stood for all home blessings he had missed the sisters playful grace the brothers love the mothers sympathy and simple faith in god the fathers guidance where were these for steele if not in his friend addison  addisons father was a dean his mother was the sister of a bishop and his ambition as a schoolboy or his fathers ambition for him was only that he should be one day a prosperous and pious dignitary of the church but there was in him as in steele the genius which shaped their lives to its own uses and made them both what they are to us now joseph addison was born into a home which the steadfast labour of his father lancelot had made prosperous and happy lancelot addison had earned success his father josephs grandfather had been also a clergyman but he was one of those westmoreland clergy of whose simplicity and poverty many a joke has been made lancelot got his education as a poor child in the appleby grammar school but he made his own way when at college was too avowed a royalist to satisfy the commonwealth and got for his zeal at the restoration small reward in a chaplaincy to the garrison at dunkirk this was changed for the worse to a position of the same sort at tangier where he remained eight years he lost that office by misadventure and would have been left destitute if mr joseph williamson had not given him a living of £  0 ayear at milston in wiltshire upon this lancelot addison married jane gulstone who was the daughter of a doctor of divinity and whose brother became bishop of bristol in the little wiltshire parsonage joseph addison and his younger brothers and sisters were born the essayist was named joseph after his fathers patron afterwards sir joseph williamson a friend high in office while the children grew the father worked he showed his ability and loyalty in books on west barbary and mahomet and the state of the jews and he became one of the kings chaplains in ordinary at a time when his patron joseph williamson was secretary of state joseph addison was then but three years old soon afterwards the busy father became archdeacon of salisbury and he was made dean of lichfield in      when his boy joseph had reached the age of    when archdeacon of salisbury the rev lancelot addison sent joseph to school at salisbury and when his father became dean of lichfield joseph was sent to school at lichfield as before said in the years        and then he was sent as a private pupil to the charterhouse the friendship he there formed with steele was ratified by the approval of the dean the desolate boy with the warm heart bright intellect and noble aspirations was carried home by his friend at holiday times into the lichfield deanery where steele wrote afterwards to congreve in a dedication of the drummer were things of this nature to be exposed to public view i could show under the deans own hand in the warmest terms his blessing on the friendship between his son and me nor had he a child who did not prefer me in the first place of kindness and esteem as their father loved me like one of them addison had two brothers of whom one traded and became governor of fort george in india and the other became like himself a fellow of magdalene college oxford of his three sisters two died young the other married twice her first husband being a french refugee minister who became a prebendary of westminster of this sister of addisons swift said she was a sort of wit very like him i was not fond of her   in the latter years of the seventeenth century when steele and addison were students at oxford most english writers were submissive to the new strength of the critical genius of france but the english nation had then newly accomplished the great revolution that secured its liberties was thinking for itself and calling forth the energies of writers who spoke for the people and looked to the people for approval and support a new period was then opening of popular influence on english literature they were the young days of the influence now full grown then slowly getting strength and winning the best minds away from an imported latin style adapted to the taste of patrons who sought credit for nice critical discrimination in    0 addison had been three years steele one year at oxford boileau was then living fiftyfour years old and western europe was submissive to his sway as the great monarch of literary criticism boileau was still living when steele published his tatler and died in the year of the establishment of the spectator boileau a truehearted man of genius and sense advanced his countrymen from the nice weighing of words by the précieuses and the grammarians and by the french academy child of the intercourse between those ladies and gentlemen he brought ridicule on the inane politeness of a style then in its decrepitude and bade the writers of his time find models in the latin writers who like virgil and horace had brought natural thought and speech to their perfection in the preceding labour for the rectifying of the language preference had been given to french words of latin origin french being one of those languages in which latin is the chief constituent this was but a fair following of the desire to make it run pure from its source  if the english critics who in charles the seconds time submitted to french law had seen its spirit instead of paying blind obedience to the letter they also would have looked back to the chief source of their language finding this to be not latin but saxon they would have sought to give it strength and harmony by doing then what in the course of nature we have learnt again to do now that the patronage of literature has gone from the cultivated noble who appreciates in much accordance with the fashion of his time and passed into the holding of the english people addison and steele lived in the transition time between these periods they were born into one of them and — steele immediately addison through steeles influence upon him — they were trusty guides into the other thus the spectator is not merely the best example of their skill it represents also perhaps best represents a wholesome revolution in our literature the essential character of english literature was no more changed than characters of englishmen were altered by the declaration of right which prince william of orange had accepted with the english crown when addison had lately left and steele was leaving charterhouse for oxford yet change there was and steele saw to the heart of it even in his college days  oxford in times not long past had inclined to faith in divine right of kings addisons father a church dignitary who had been a royalist during the civil war laid stress upon obedience to authority in church and state when modern literature was discussed or studied at oxford there would be the strongest disposition to maintain the commonly accepted authority of french critics who were really men of great ability correcting bad taste in their predecessors and conciliating scholars by their own devout acceptance of the purest latin authors as the types of a good style or proper method in the treatment of a subject young addison found nothing new to him in the temper of his university and was influenced as in his youth every one must and should be by the prevalent tone of opinion in cultivated men but he had and felt that he had wit and genius of his own his sensitive mind was simply and thoroughly religious generous in its instincts and strengthened in its nobler part by close communion with the mind of his friend steele  may we not think of the two friends together in a college chamber addison of slender frame with features wanting neither in dignity nor in refinement steele of robust make with the radiant short face of the spectator by right of which he claimed for that worthy his admission to the ugly club addison reads dryden in praise of whom he wrote his earliest known verse or reads endeavours of his own which his friend steele warmly applauds they dream together of the future addison sage but speculative and steele practical if rash each is disposed to find god in the ways of life and both avoid that outward show of irreligion which after the recent civil wars remains yet common in the country as reaction from an ostentatious piety which laid on burdens of restraint a natural reaction which had been intensified by the base influence of a profligate king addison bred among the preachers has a little of the preachers abstract tone when talk between the friends draws them at times into direct expression of the sacred sense of life which made them one  apart also from the mere accidents of his childhood a speculative turn in addison is naturally stronger than in steele he relishes analysis of thought steele came as a boy from the rough world of shame and sorrow his great kindly heart is most open to the realities of life the state and prospects of his country direct personal sympathies actual wrongs actual remedies addison is sensitive and has among strangers the reserve of speech and aspect which will pass often for coldness and pride but is indeed the shape taken by modesty in thoughtful men whose instinct it is to speculate and analyze and who become selfconscious not through conceit but because they cannot help turning their speculations also on themselves steele wholly comes out of himself as his heart hastens to meet his friend he lives in his surroundings and in friendly intercourse fixes his whole thought on the worth of his companion never abating a jot of his ideal of a true and perfect life or ceasing to uphold the good because he cannot live to the full height of his own argument he is too frank to conceal the least or greatest of his own shortcomings delight and strength of a friendship like that between steele and addison are to be found as many find them in the charm and use of a compact where characters differ so much that one lays open as it were a fresh world to the other and each draws from the other aid of forces which the friendship makes his own but the deep foundations of this friendship were laid in the religious earnestness that was alike in both and in religious earnestness are laid also the foundations of this book its monument  both addison and steele wrote verse at college from each of them we have a poem written at nearly the same age addisons in april      steeles early in      addison drew from literature a metrical account of the greatest english poets steele drew from life the grief of england at the death of williams queen which happened on the   th of december       addison writing in that year and at the age of about    for a college friend a short account of all the musepossest that down from chaucers days to drydens times have spent their noble rage in british rhymes was so far under the influence of french critical authority as accepted by most cultivators of polite literature at oxford and wherever authority was much respected that from an account of the greatest english poets he omitted shakespeare of chaucer he then knew no better than to say what might have been said in france that  age has rusted what the poet writ worn out his language and obscured his wit in vain he jests in his unpolishd strain and tries to make his readers laugh in vain old spenser next warmd with poetic rage in ancient tales amused a barbrous age but now the mystic tale that pleased of yore can charm an understanding age no more it cost addison some trouble to break loose from the critical cobweb of an age of periwigs and patches that accounted itself understanding and the grand epoch of our elizabethan literature barbarous rymer one of his critics had said that in the neighing of an horse or in the growling of a mastiff there is a meaning there is as lively expression and may i say more humanity than many times in the tragical flights of shakespeare addison with a genius of his own helped to free movement by the sympathies of steele did break through the cobwebs of the critics but he carried off a little of their web upon his wings we see it when in the spectator he meets the prejudices of an understanding age and partly satisfies his own by finding reason for his admiration of chevy chase and the babes in the wood in their great similarity to works of virgil we see it also in some of the criticisms which accompany his admirable working out of the resolve to justify his true natural admiration of the poetry of milton by showing that paradise lost was planned after the manner of the ancients and supreme even in its obedience to the laws of aristotle in his spectator papers on imagination he but half escapes from the conventions of his time which detested the wildness of a mountain pass thought salisbury plain one of the finest prospects in england planned parks with circles and straight lines of trees despised our old cathedrals for their gothic art and saw perfection in the roman architecture and the round dome of st pauls yet in these and all such papers of his we find that addison had broken through the weaker prejudices of the day opposing them with sound natural thought of his own among cultivated readers lesser moulders of opinion there can be no doubt that his genius was only the more serviceable in amendment of the tastes of his own time for friendly understanding and a partial sharing of ideas for which it gave itself no little credit  it is noticeable however that in his account of the greatest english poets young addison gave a fifth part of the piece to expression of the admiration he felt even then for milton that his appreciation became critical and although limited based on a sense of poetry which brought him near to milton addison proved in the spectator by his eighteen saturday papers upon paradise lost but it was from the religious side that he first entered into the perception of its grandeur his sympathy with its high purpose caused him to praise in the same pages that commended paradise lost to his countrymen another epic blackmores creation a dull metrical treatise against atheism as a work which deserved to be looked upon as one of the most useful and noble productions of our english verse the reader he added of a piece which shared certainly with salisbury plain the charms of flatness and extent of space the reader cannot but be pleased to find the depths of philosophy enlivened with all the charms of poetry and to see so great a strength of reason amidst so beautiful a redundancy of the imagination the same strong sympathy with blackmores purpose in it blinded dr johnson also to the failure of this poem which is blackmores best from its religious side then it may be that addison when a student at oxford first took his impressions of the poetry of milton at oxford he accepted the opinion of france on miltons art but honestly declared in spite of that unchecked enthusiasm whateer his pen describes i more than see whilst every verse arrayed in majesty bold and sublime my whole attention draws and seems above the critics nicer laws this chief place among english poets addison assigned to milton with his mind fresh from the influences of a father who had openly contemned the commonwealth and by whom he had been trained so to regard miltons service of it that of this he wrote oh had the poet neer profaned his pen to varnish oer the guilt of faithless men his other works might have deserved applause but now the language cant support the cause while the clean current tho serene and bright betrays a bottom odious to the sight if we turn now to the verse written by steele in his young oxford days and within twelve months of the date of addisons lines upon english poets we have what steele called the procession it is the procession of those who followed to the grave the good queen mary dead of smallpox at the age of    steele shared his friend addisons delight in milton and had not indeed got beyond the sixth number of the tatler before he compared the natural beauty and innocence of miltons adam and eve with drydens treatment of their love but the one man for whom steele felt most enthusiasm was not to be sought through books he was a living moulder of the future of the nation eagerly intent upon king william the hero of the revolution that secured our liberties the young patriot found in him also the hero of his verse keen sense of the realities about him into which steele had been born spoke through the very first lines of this poem the days of man are doomd to pain and strife quiet and ease are foreign to our life no satisfaction is below sincere pleasure itself has something thats severe britain had rejoiced in the high fortune of king william and now a mourning world attended his wife to the tomb the poor were her first and deepest mourners poor from many causes and then steele pictured with warm sympathy form after form of human suffering among those mourning poor were mothers who in the despair of want would have stabbed infants sobbing for their food but in the thought they stoppd their locks they tore threw down the steel and cruelly forbore the innocents their parents love forgive smile at their fate nor know they are to live to the mysteries of such distress the dead queen penetrated by her cunning to be good after the poor marched the house of commons in the funeral procession steele gave only two lines to it with dread concern the awful senate came their grief as all their passions is the same the next assembly dissipates our fears the stately mourning throng of british peers a factious intemperance then characterized debates of the commons while the house of lords stood in the front of the revolution and secured the permanency of its best issues steele describes as they pass ormond somers villars who leads the horse of the dead queen that heaves into big sighs when he would neigh — the verse has in it crudity as well as warmth of youth — and then follow the funeral chariot the jewelled mourners and the ladies of the court their clouded beauties speak mans gaudy strife the glittering miseries of human life i yet see steele adds this queen passing to her coronation in the place whither she now is carried to her grave on the way through acclamations of her people to receive her crown she unconcerned and careless all the while rewards their loud applauses with a smile with easy majesty and humble state smiles at the trifle power and knows its date but now what hands commit the beauteous good and just the dearer part of william to the dust in her his vital heat his glory lies in her the monarch lived in her he dies  no form of state makes the great man forego the task due to her love and to his woe since his kind frame cant the large suffering bear in pity to his people hes not here for to the mighty loss we now receive the next affliction were to see him grieve if we look from these serious strains of their youth to the literary expression of the gayer side of character in the two friends we find addison sheltering his taste for playful writing behind a roman wall of hexameter for among his latin poems in the oxford musæ anglicanæ are eighty or ninety lines of resonant latin verse upon machinæ gesticulantes anglice a puppetshow steele taking life as he found it and expressing mirth in his own way of conversation wrote an english comedy and took the word of a college friend that it was valueless there were two paths in life then open to an english writer one was the smooth and level way of patronage the other a rough uphill track for men who struggled in the service of the people the way of patronage was honourable the age had been made so very discerning by the romans and the french that a true understanding of the beauties of literature was confined to the select few who had been taught what to admire fine writing was beyond the rude appreciation of the multitude had therefore the reading public been much larger than it was men of fastidious taste who paid as much deference to polite opinion as addison did in his youth could have expected only audience fit but few and would have been without encouragement to the pursuit of letters unless patronage rewarded merit the other way had charms only for the stouthearted pioneer who foresaw where the road was to be made that now is the great highway of our literature addison went out into the world by the way of his time steele by the way of ours  addison after the campaign of      offered to the king the homage of a paper of verses on the capture of namur and presented them through sir john somers then lord keeper of the great seal to lord somers he sent with them a flattering dedicatory address somers who was esteemed a man of taste was not unwilling to receive the present of a muse unknown he asked addison to call upon him and became his patron charles montagu afterwards earl of halifax critic and wit himself shone also among the statesmen who were known patrons of letters also to him who was a prince of patrons fed with soft dedication all day long addison introduced himself to him in      as it was part of his public fame to be a latin scholar addison also a skilful latinist addressed in latin a paper of verses on the peace of ryswick with somers and montagu for patrons the young man of genius who wished to thrive might fairly commit himself to the service of the church for which he had been bred by his father but addisons tact and refinement promised to be serviceable to the state and so it was that as steele tells us montagu made addison a layman his arguments were founded upon the general pravity and corruption of men of business who wanted liberal education and i remember as if i had read the letter yesterday that my lord ended with a compliment that however he might be represented as no friend to the church he never would do it any other injury than keeping mr addison out of it to the good offices of montagu and somers addison was indebted therefore in      for a travelling allowance of £ 00 a year the grant was for his support while qualifying himself on the continent by study of modern languages and otherwise for diplomatic service it dropped at the kings death in the spring of   0  and addison was cast upon his own resources but he throve and lived to become an undersecretary of state in days that made prior an ambassador and rewarded with official incomes congreve rowe hughes philips stepney and others throughout his honourable career prudence dictated to addison more or less of dependence on the friendship of the strong an honest friend of the popular cause he was more ready to sell than give his pen to it although the utmost reward would at no time have tempted him to throw his conscience into the bargain the good word of halifax obtained him from godolphin in   0  the government order for a poem on the battle of blenheim with immediate earnest of payment for it in the office of a commissioner of appeal in the excise worth £ 00 a year for this substantial reason addison wrote the campaign and upon its success he obtained the further reward of an irish undersecretaryship  the campaign is not a great poem reams of campaigns would not have made addisons name what it now is a household word among his countrymen the remarks on several parts of italy c in which addison followed up the success of his campaign with notes of foreign travel represent him visiting italy as virgils italy the land of the great writers in latin and finding scenery or customs of the people eloquent of them at every turn he crammed his pages with quotation from virgil and horace ovid and tibullus propertius lucan juvenal and martial lucretius statius claudian silius italicus ausonius seneca phædrus and gave even to his understanding age an overdose of its own physic for all ills of literature he could not see a pyramid of jugglers standing on each others shoulders without observing how it explained a passage in claudian which shows that the venetians were not the inventors of this trick but addisons short original accounts of cities and states that he saw are pleasant as well as sensible and here and there as in the space he gives to a report of st anthonys sermon to the fishes or his short account of a visit to the opera at venice there are indications of the humour that was veiled not crushed under a sense of classical propriety in his account of the political state of naples and in other passages there is mild suggestion also of the love of liberty a part of the fine nature of addison which had been slightly warmed by contact with the generous enthusiasm of steele in his poetical letter to halifax written during his travels addison gave the sum of his prose volume when he told how he felt himself  on classic ground for here the muse so oft her harp hath strung that not a mountain rears its head unsung renownd in verse each shady thicket grows and evry stream in heavnly numbers flows but he was writing to a statesman of the revolution who was his political patron just then out of office and propriety suggested such personal compliment as calling the boyne a tiber and halifax an improvement upon virgil while his heart was in the closing emphasis also proper to the occasion which dwelt on the liberty that gives their smile to the barren rocks and bleak mountains of britannias isle while for italy rich in the unexhausted stores of nature proud oppression in her valleys reigns and tyranny usurps her happy plains addisons were formal raptures and he knew them to be so when he wrote i bridle in my struggling muse with pain that longs to launch into a bolder strain richard steele was not content with learning to be bold eager at that turning point of her national life to serve england with strength of arm at least if not with the good brains which he was neither encouraged nor disposed to value highly steeles patriotism impelled him to make his start in the world not by the way of patronage but by enlisting himself as a private in the coldstream guards by so doing he knew that he offended a relation and lost a bequest as he said of himself afterwards when he mounted a warhorse with a great sword in his hand and planted himself behind king william iii against louis xiv he lost the succession to a very good estate in the county of wexford in ireland from the same humour which he has preserved ever since of preferring the state of his mind to that of his fortune steele entered the duke of ormonds regiment and had reasons for enlistment james butler the first duke whom his father served had sent him to the charterhouse that first duke had been chancellor of the university at oxford and when he died on the   st of july      nine months before steele entered to christchurch his grandson another james butler succeeded to the dukedom this second duke of ormond was also placed by the university of oxford in his grandfathers office of chancellor he went with king william to holland in      shared the defeat of william in the battle of steinkirk in august      and was taken prisoner in july      when king william was defeated at landen these defeats encouraged the friends of the stuarts and in      bristol exeter and boston adhered to king james troops were raised in the north of england to assist his cause in      there was the conspiracy of sir george barclay to seize william on the   th of february captain charnock one of the conspirators had been a fellow of magdalene on the   rd of february the plot was laid before parliament there was high excitement throughout the country loyal associations were formed the chancellor of the university of oxford was a fellowsoldier of the kings and desired to draw strength to his regiment from the enthusiasm of the time steeles heart was with the cause of the revolution and he owed also to the ormonds a kind of family allegiance what was more natural than that he should be among those young oxford men who were tempted to enlist in the chancellors own regiment for the defence of liberty lord cutts the colonel of the regiment made steele his secretary and got him an ensigns commission it was then that he wrote his first book the christian hero of which the modest account given by steele himself long afterwards when put on his defence by the injurious violence of faction is as follows he first became an author when an ensign of the guards a way of life exposed to much irregularity and being thoroughly convinced of many things of which he often repented and which he more often repeated he writ for his own private use a little book called the christian hero with a design principally to fix upon his own mind a strong impression of virtue and religion in opposition to a stronger propensity towards unwarrantable pleasures this secret admiration was too weak he therefore printed the book with his name in hopes that a standing testimony against himself and the eyes of the world that is to say of his acquaintance upon him in a new light would make him ashamed of understanding and seeming to feel what was virtuous and living so contrary a life among his brother soldiers and fresh from the oxford worship of old classical models the religious feeling that accompanies all true refinement and that was indeed part of the english nature in him as in addison prompted steele to write this book in which he opposed to the fashionable classicism of his day a sound reflection that the heroism of cato or brutus had far less in it of true strength and far less adaptation to the needs of life than the unfashionable christian heroism set forth by the sermon on the mount  according to the second title of this book it is an argument proving that no principles but those of religion are sufficient to make a great man it is addressed to lord cutts in a dedication dated from the toweryard march      0  and is in four chapters of which the first treats of the heroism of the ancient world the second connects man with his creator by the bible story and the life and death of christ the third defines the christian as set forth by the character and teaching of st paul applying the definition practically to the daily life of steeles own time in the last chapter he descends from the consideration of those bright incentives to a higher life and treats of the ordinary passions and interests of men the common springs of action of which he says the chief are fame and conscience which he declares to be best used and improved when joined with religion and here all culminates in a final strain of patriotism closing with the character of king william that of a glorious captain and what he much more values than the most splendid titles that of a sincere and honest man this was the character of william which when in days of meaner public strife steele quoted it years afterwards in the spectator he broke off painfully and abruptly with a  fuit ilium et ingens gloria steeles christian hero obtained many readers its fifth edition was appended to the first collection of the tatler into volumes at the time of the establishment of the spectator the old bent of the english mind was strong in steele and he gave unostentatiously a lively wit to the true service of religion without having spoken or written to the last day of his life a word of mere religious cant one officer thrust a duel on him for his zeal in seeking to make peace between him and another comrade steele as an officer then or soon afterwards made a captain of fusiliers could not refuse to fight but stood on the defensive yet in parrying a thrust his sword pierced his antagonist and the danger in which he lay quickened that abiding detestation of the practice of duelling which caused steele to attack it in his plays in his tatler in his spectator with persistent energy  of the christian hero his companions felt and he himself saw that the book was too didactic it was indeed plain truth out of steeles heart but an air of superiority freely allowed only to the professional man teaching rules of his own art belongs to a too didactic manner nothing was more repugnant to steeles nature than the sense of this he had defined the christian as one who is always a benefactor with the mien of a receiver and that was his own character which was to a fault more ready to give than to receive more prompt to ascribe honour to others than to claim it for himself to right himself steele wrote a lighthearted comedy the funeral or grief à la mode but at the core even of that lay the great earnestness of his censure against the mockery and mummery of grief that should be sacred and he blended with this in the character of lawyer puzzle a protest against mockery of truth and justice by the intricacies of the law the liveliness of this comedy made steele popular with the wits and the inevitable touches of the authors patriotism brought on him also the notice of the whigs party men might perhaps already feel something of the unbending independence that was in steele himself as in this play he made old lord brumpton teach it to his son but be them honest firm impartial let neither love nor hate nor faction move thee distinguish words from things and men from crimes king william perhaps had he lived could fairly have recognized in steele the social form of that sound mind which in defoe was solitary in a later day it was to steele a proud recollection that his name to be provided for was in the last tablebook ever worn by the glorious and immortal william iii  the funeral first acted with great success in   0  was followed in the next year by the tender husband to which addison contributed some touches for which addison wrote a prologue and which steele dedicated to addison who would be surprised he said in the midst of a daily and familiar conversation with an address which bears so distant an air as a public dedication addison and his friend were then thirtyone years old close friends when boys they are close friends now in the prime of manhood it was after they had blended wits over the writing of this comedy that steele expressed his wish for a work written by both which should serve as the monument to their most happy friendship when addison and steele were amused together with the writing of this comedy addison having lost his immediate prospect of political employment and his salary too by king williams death in the preceding year had come home from his travels on his way home he had received in september at the hague news of his fathers death he wrote from the hague to mr wyche at my first arrival i received the news of my fathers death and ever since have been engaged in so much noise and company that it was impossible for me to think of rhyming in it as his fathers eldest son he had on his return to england family affairs to arrange and probably some money to receive though attached to a party that lost power at the accession of queen anne and waiting for new employment addison — who had declined the duke of somersets overcondescending offer of a hundred a year and all expenses as travelling tutor to his son the marquis of hertford — was able while lodging poorly in the haymarket to associate in london with the men by whose friendship he hoped to rise and was with steele admitted into the select society of wits and men of fashion who affected wit and took wits for their comrades in the kitcat club when in   0  marlboroughs victory at blenheim revived the whig influence the suggestion of halifax to lord treasurer godolphin caused addison to be applied to for his poem of the campaign it was after the appearance of this poem that steeles play was printed with the dedication to his friend in which he said i look upon my intimacy with you as one of the most valuable enjoyments of my life at the same time i make the town no ill compliment for their kind acceptance of this comedy in acknowledging that it has so far raised my opinion of it as to make me think it no improper memorial of an inviolable friendship i should not offer it to you as such had i not been very careful to avoid everything that might look illnatured immoral or prejudicial to what the better part of mankind hold sacred and honourable this was the common ground between the friends colliers short view of the profaneness and immorality of the english stage had been published in      it attacked a real evil if not always in the right way and congreves reply to it had been a failure steeles comedies with all their gaiety and humour were wholly free from the garnish of oaths and unwholesome expletives which his contemporaries seemed to think essential to stage emphasis each comedy of his was based on seriousness as all sound english wit has been since there have been writers in england the gay manner did not conceal all the earnest thoughts that might jar with the humour of the town and thus steele was able to claim by right of his third play the honour of being the only english dramatist who had had a piece damned for its piety  this was the lying lover produced in   0  an adaptation from corneille in which we must allow that steeles earnestness in upholding truth and right did cause him to spoil the comedy the play was afterwards readapted by foote as the liar and in its last form with another change or two has been revived at times with great success it is worth while to note how steele dealt with the story of this piece its original is a play by alarcon which corneille at first supposed to have been a play by lope de vega alarcon or to give him his full style don juan ruiz de alarcon y mendoza was a mexicanborn spaniard of a noble family which had distinguished itself in mexico from the time of the conquest and took its name of alarcon from a village in new castile the poet was a humpbacked dwarf a thorough but rather haughty spanish gentleman poet and wit who wrote in an unusually pure spanish style a man of the world too who came to spain in or about the year      and held the very wellpaid office of reporter to the royal council of the indies when alarcon in      was chosen by the court to write a festival drama and at the same time publishing the second part of his dramatic works vehemently reclaimed plays for which under disguised names some of his contemporaries had taken credit to themselves there was an angry combination against him in which lope de vega gongora and quevedo were found taking part all that alarcon wrote was thoroughly his own but editors of the   th century boldly passed over his claims to honour and distributed his best works among plays of other famous writers chiefly those of rojas and lope de vega this was what deceived corneille and caused him to believe and say that alarcons la verdad sospechosa on which in      he founded his menteur was a work of lope de vegas afterwards corneille learnt how there had been in this matter lying among editors he gave to alarcon the honour due and thenceforth it is chiefly by this play that alarcon has been remembered out of spain in spain when in      don juan hartzenbusch edited alarcons comedies for the biblioteca de autores españoles he had to remark on the unjust neglect of that good author in spain also where the poets and men of letters had long wished in vain for a complete edition of his works lope de vega it may be added was really the author of a sequel to la verdad sospechosa which corneille adapted also as a sequel to his menteur but it was even poorer than such sequels usually are  the lying lover in alarcons play is a don garcia fresh from his studies in salamanca and steeles latine first appears there as a tristan the gracioso of old spanish comedy the two ladies are a jacinta and lucrecia alarcon has in his light and graceful play no less than three heavy fathers of a spanish type one of whom the father of lucrecia brings about don garcias punishment by threatening to kill him if he will not marry his daughter and so the liar is punished for his romancing by a marriage with the girl he does not care for and not marrying the girl he loves  corneille was merciful and in the fifth act bred in his menteur a new fancy for lucrece so that the marriage at cross purposes was rather agreeable to him  steele in adapting the menteur as his lying lover altered the close in sharp accordance with that just regard to a reforming age which caused him adapting a line in his procession then unprinted to write in his prologue to it pleasure must still have something thats severe having translated corneilles translations of garcia and tristan dorante and cliton into young bookwit and latine he transformed the servant into a college friend mumming as servant because since a prating servant is necessary in intrigues the two had cast lots who should be the others footman for the present expedition then he adapted the french couplets into pleasant prose comedy giving with a light touch the romancing of feats of war and of an entertainment on the river but at last he turned desperately serious and sent his young bookwit to newgate on a charge of killing the gentleman — here called lovemore — who was at last to win the hand of the lady whom the liar loved in his last act opening in newgate steele started with blank verse and although lovemore of course was not dead and young bookwit got at last more than a shadow of a promise the other lady in reward for his repentance the changes in construction of the play took it beyond the bounds of comedy and were in fact excellent morality but not good art and this is what steele means when he says that he had his play damned for its piety  with that strong regard for the drama which cannot well be wanting to the man who has an artists vivid sense of life steele never withdrew his good will from the players never neglected to praise a good play and i may add took every fair occasion of suggesting to the town the subtlety of shakespeares genius but he now ceased to write comedies until towards the close of his life he produced with a remarkable success his other play the conscious lovers and of that by the way fielding made his parson adams say that cato and the conscious lovers were the only plays he ever heard of fit for a christian to read and i must own in the latter there are some things almost solemn enough for a sermon  perhaps it was about this time that addison wrote his comedy of the drummer which had been long in his possession when steele who had become a partner in the management of drury lane theatre drew it from obscurity suggested a few changes in it and produced it — not openly as addisons — upon the stage the published edition of it was recommended also by a preface from steele in which he says that he liked this authors play the better for the want of those studied similies and repartees which we who have writ before him have thrown into our plays to indulge and gain upon a false taste that has prevailed for many years in the british theatre i believe the author would have condescended to fall into this way a little more than he has had he before the writing of it been often present at theatrical representations i was confirmed in my thoughts of the play by the opinion of better judges to whom it was communicated who observed that the scenes were drawn after molières manner and that an easy and natural vein of humour ran through the whole i do not question but the reader will discover this and see many beauties that escaped the audience the touches being too delicate for every taste in a popular assembly my brothersharers in the drury lane patent were of opinion at the first reading of it that it was like a picture in which the strokes were not strong enough to appear at a distance as it is not in the common way of writing the approbation was at first doubtful but has risen every time it has been acted and has given an opportunity in several of its parts for as just and good actions as ever i saw on the stage addisons comedy was not produced till      the year after his unsuccessful attempt to revive the spectator which produced what is called the eighth volume of that work the play not known to be his was so ill spoken of that he kept the authorship a secret to the last and tickell omitted it from the collection of his patrons works but steele knew what was due to his friend and in      manfully republished the piece as addisons with a dedication to congreve and censure of tickell for suppressing it if it be true that the drummer made no figure on the stage though excellently acted when i observe this said steele i say a much harder thing of this than of the comedy addisons drummer is a gentleman who to forward his suit to a soldiers widow masquerades as the drumbeating ghost of her husband in her country house and terrifies a selfconfident freethinking town exquisite another suitor who believes himself brought face to face with the spirit world in which he professes that he cant believe for my part child i have made myself easy in those points the character of a freethinking exquisite is drawn from life without exaggeration but with more than a touch of the bitter contempt addison felt for the atheistic coxcomb with whom he was too ready to confound the sincere questioner of orthodox opinion the only passages of his in the spectator that border on intolerance are those in which he deals with the freethinker but it should not be forgotten that the commonest type of freethinker in queen annes time was not a thoughtful man who battled openly with doubt and made an independent search for truth but an idler who repudiated thought and formed his character upon tradition of the court of charles the second and throughout the spectator we may find a christian undertone in addisons intolerance of infidelity which is entirely wanting when the moralist is eustace budgell two or three persons in the comedy of the drummer give opportunity for good characterpainting in the actor and on a healthy stage before an audience able to discriminate light touches of humour and to enjoy unstrained although wellmarked expression of varieties of character the drummer would not fail to be a welcome entertainment  but our sketch now stands at the year   0  when steele had ceased for a time to write comedies addisons campaign had brought him fame and perhaps helped him to pay as he now did his college debts with interest his remarks on italy now published were as tickell says at first but indifferently relished by the bulk of readers and his drummer probably was written and locked in his desk there were now such days of intercourse as steele looked back to when with undying friendship he wrote in the preface to that edition of the drummer produced by him after addisons death he was above all men in that talent we call humour and enjoyed it in such perfection that i have often reflected after a night spent with him apart from all the world that i had had the pleasure of conversing with an intimate acquaintance of terence and catullus who had all their wit and nature heightened with humour more exquisite and delightful than any other man ever possessed and again in the same preface steele dwelt upon that smiling mirth that delicate satire and genteel raillery which appeared in mr addison when he was free from that remarkable bashfulness which is a cloak that hides and muffles merit and his abilities were covered only by modesty which doubles the beauties which are seen and gives credit and esteem to all that are concealed addison had the selfconsciousness of a sensitive and speculative mind this with a shy manner among those with whom he was not intimate passed for cold selfassertion the little senate of his intimate friends was drawn to him by its knowledge of the real warmth of his nature and his friendships like his religion influenced his judgment his geniality that wore a philosophic cloak before the world caused him to abandon himself in the spectator even more unreservedly than steele would have done to iterated efforts for the help of a friend like ambrose philips whose poems to eminent babies little subject little wit gave rise to the name of nambypamby addisons quietness with strangers was against a rapid widening of his circle of familiar friends and must have made the greathearted friendship of steele as much to him as his could be to steele in very truth it doubled all his store steeles heart was open to enjoyment of all kindly intercourse with men in after years as expression of thought in the literature of nations gained freedom and sincerity two types of literature were formed from the types of mind which addison and steele may be said to have in some measure represented each sought advance towards a better light one part by dwelling on the individual duties and responsibilities of man and his relation to the infinite the other by especial study of mans social ties and liberties and his relation to the commonwealth of which he is a member goethe for instance inclined to one study schiller to the other and every free mind will incline probably to one or other of these centres of opinion addison was a cold politician because he was most himself when analyzing principles of thought and humours passions duties of the individual steele on the contrary braved ruin for his convictions as a politician because his social nature turned his earnestness into concern for the wellbeing of his country and he lived in times when it was not yet certain that the newlysecured liberties were also finally secured the party was strong that desired to reestablish ancient tyrannies and the queen herself was hardly on the side of freedom  in   0  the date of the union between england and scotland whig influence had been strengthened by the elections of the preceding year and addison was early in   0  made undersecretary of state to sir charles hedges a tory who was superseded before the end of the year by marlboroughs soninlaw the earl of sunderland a whig under whom addison of course remained in office and who was thenceforth his active patron in the same year the opera of rosamond was produced with addisons libretto it was but the third or indeed the second year of operas in england for we can hardly reckon as forming a year of opera the italian intermezzi and interludes of singing and dancing performed under claytons direction at york buildings in   0  in   0  claytons arsinoe adapted and translated from the italian was produced at drury lane buononcinis camilla was given at the house in the haymarket and sung in two languages the heroines part being in english and the heros in italian thomas clayton a secondrate musician but a man with literary tastes who had been introducer of the opera to london argued that the words of an opera should be not only english but the best of english and that english music ought to illustrate good homegrown literature addison and steele agreed heartily in this addison was persuaded to write words for an opera by clayton — his rosamond — and steele was persuaded afterwards to speculate in some sort of partnership with claytons efforts to set english poetry to music in the entertainments at york buildings though his friend hughes warned him candidly that clayton was not much of a musician rosamond was a failure of claytons and not a success of addisons there is poor jesting got by the poet from a comic sir trusty who keeps rosamonds bower and has a scolding wife but there is a happy compliment to marlborough in giving to king henry a vision at woodstock of the glory to come for england and in a scenic realization of it by the rising of blenheim palace the nations gift to marlborough upon the scene of the fair rosamond story indeed there can be no doubt that it was for the sake of the scene at woodstock and the opportunity thus to be made that rosamond was chosen for the subject of the opera addison made queen eleanor give rosamond a narcotic instead of a poison and thus he achieved the desired happy ending to an opera   believe your rosamond alive king o happy day o pleasing view my queen forgives — queen — my lord is true king no more ill change queen no more ill grieve both but ever thus united live   that is to say for three days the extent of the life of the opera but the literary undersecretary had saved his political dignity with the stage tribute to marlborough which backed the closet praise in the campaign  in may   0  steele received the office of gazetteer until then worth £ 0 but presently endowed by harley with a salary of £ 00 a year at about the same time he was made one of the gentlemen ushers to queen annes husband prince george of denmark in the same year steele married of his most private life before this date little is known he had been married to a lady from barbadoes who died in a few months from days referred to in the christian hero he derived a daughter of whom he took fatherly care in   0  steele aged about    married miss or as ladies come of age were then called mrs mary scurlock aged    it was a marriage of affection on both sides steele had from his first wife an estate in barbadoes which produced after payment of the interest on its encumbrances £  0 a year his appointment as gazetteer less the £   tax on it was worth £    a year and his appointment on the prince consorts household another hundred thus the income upon which steele married was rather more than a thousand a year and miss scurlocks mother had an estate of about £  0 a year mary scurlock had been a friend of steeles first wife for before marriage she recalls steele to her mothers mind by saying it is the survivor of the person to whose funeral i went in my illness let us make our regards to each other steele wrote just before marriage mutual and unchangeable that whilst the world around us is enchanted with the false satisfactions of vagrant desires our persons may be shrines to each other and sacred to conjugal faith unreserved confidence and heavenly society there remains also a prayer written by steele before first taking the sacrament with his wife after marriage there are also letters and little notes written by steele to his wife treasured by her love and printed by a remorseless antiquary blind to the sentence in one of the first of them i beg of you to shew my letters to no one living but let us be contented with one anothers thoughts upon our words and actions without the intervention of other people who cannot judge of so delicate a circumstance as the commerce between man and wife but they are printed for the frivolous to laugh at and the wise to honour they show that even in his most thoughtless or most anxious moments the social wit the busy patriot remembered his dear prue and was her lover to the end soon after marriage steele took his wife to a boardingschool in the suburbs where they saw a young lady for whom steele showed an affection that caused mrs steele to ask whether she was not his daughter he said that she was then said mrs steele i beg she may be mine too thenceforth she lived in their home as miss ousley and was treated as a daughter by steeles wife surely this was a woman who deserved the love that never swerved from her true husband and true friend he playfully called addison her rival in the spectator there is a paper of steeles no     representing some of his own loveletters as telling what a man said and should be able to say of his wife after forty years of marriage seven years after marriage he signs himself yours more than you can imagine or i express he dedicates to her a volume of the ladys library and writes of her ministrations to him if there are such beings as guardian angels thus are they employed i will no more believe one of them more good in its inclinations than i can conceive it more charming in its form than my wife in the year before her death he was signing his letters with god bless you and dear prue eternally yours that steele made it a duty of his literary life to contend against the frivolous and vicious ridicule of the ties of marriage common in his day and to maintain their sacred honour and their happiness readers of the spectator cannot fail to find  steele on his marriage in   0  took a house in bury street st jamess and in the following year went to a house at hampton which he called in jest the hovel addison had lent him a thousand pounds for costs of furnishing and other immediate needs this was repaid within a year and when at the same time his wifes mother was proposing a settlement of her money beneficial to himself steele replied that he was far from desiring if he should survive his wife to turn the current of the estate out of the channel it would have been in had i never come into the family liberal always of his own to others he was sometimes without a guinea and perplexed by debt but he defrauded no man when he followed his prue to the grave he was in no mans debt though he left all his countrymen his debtors and he left more than their mothers fortune to his two surviving children one died of consumption a year afterwards the other married one of the welsh judges afterwards lord trevor  the friendship — equal friendship — between steele and addison was as unbroken as the love between steele and his wife petty tales may have been invented or misread in days of malicious personality steele braved the worst of party spite and little enough even slander found to throw against him nobody in their lifetime doubted the equal strength and sincerity of the relationship between the two friends steele was no follower of addisons throughout life he went his own way leading rather than following first as a playwright first in conception and execution of the scheme of the tatler spectator and guardian following his own sense of duty against addisons sense of expediency in passing from the guardian to the englishman and so to energetic movement upon perilous paths as a political writer whose whole heart was with what he took to be the peoples cause  when swift had been writing to addison that he thought steele the vilest of mankind in writing of this to swift steele complained that the examiner — in which swift had a busy hand — said addison had bridled him in point of politics adding this was ill hinted both in relation to him and me i know no party but the truth of the question is what i will support as well as i can when any man i honour is attacked john forster whose keen insight into the essentials of literature led him to write an essay upon each of the two great founders of the latest period of english literature defoe and steele has pointed out in his masterly essay upon steele that swift denies having spoken of steele as bridled by his friend and does so in a way that frankly admits steeles right to be jealous of the imputation mr forster justly adds that throughout swifts intimate speech to stella whether his humours be sarcastic or polite the friendship of steele and addison is for ever suggesting some annoyance to himself some mortification some regret but never once the doubt that it was not intimate and sincere or that into it entered anything inconsistent with a perfect equality six months after addisons death steele wrote in no    of the theatre and i am again quoting facts cited by john forster that there never was a more strict friendship than between himself and addison nor had they ever any difference but what proceeded from their different way of pursuing the same thing the one waited and stemmed the torrent while the other too often plunged into it but though they thus had lived for some years past shunning each other they still preserved the most passionate concern for their mutual welfare and when they met they were as unreserved as boys and talked of the greatest affairs upon which they saw where they differed without pressing what they knew impossible to convert each other as to the substance or worth of what thus divided them steele only adds the significant expression of his hope that if his family is the worse his country may be the better for the mortification he has undergone  such then was the friendship of which the spectator is the abiding monument the spectator was a modified continuation of the tatler and the tatler was suggested by a portion of defoes review the spectator belongs to the first days of a period when the people at large extended their reading power into departments of knowledge formerly unsought by them and their favour was found generally to be more desirable than that of the most princely patron this period should date from the day in   0  when the key turned upon defoe in newgate the year of the production of steeles tender husband and the time when addison was in holland on the way home from his continental travels defoe was then fortytwo years old addison and steele being about eleven years younger  in the following year   0  the year of blenheim — defoe issued on the   th of february no   of a weekly review of the affairs of france purgd from the errors and partiality of newswriters and pettystatesmen of all sides and in the introductory sketch of its plan said after our serious matters are over we shall at the end of every paper present you with a little diversion as anything occurs to make the world merry and whether friend or foe one party or another if anything happens so scandalous as to require an open reproof the world may meet with it there here is the first little diversion the germ of tatlers and spectators which in after years amused and edified the town mercure scandale  or  advice from the scandalous club translated out of french  this society is a corporation long since established in paris and we cannot compleat our advices from france without entertaining the world with everything we meet with from that country  and tho corresponding with the queens enemies is prohibited yet since the matter will be so honest as only to tell the world of what everybody will own to be scandalous we reckon we shall be welcome  this corporation has been set up some months and opend their first sessions about last bartholomew fair but having not yet obtaind a patent they have never till now made their resolves publick  the business of this society is to censure the actions of men not of parties and in particular those actions which are made publick so by their authors as to be in their own nature an appeal to the general approbation  they do not design to expose persons but things and of them none but such as more than ordinarily deserve it they who would not be censurd by this assembly are desired to act with caution enough not to fall under their hands for they resolve to treat vice and villanous actions with the utmost severity  the first considerable matter that came before this society was about bartholomew fair but the debates being long they were at last adjourned to the next fair when we suppose it will be decided so being not willing to trouble the world with anything twice over we refer that to next august  on the  0th of september last there was a long hearing before the club of a fellow that said he had killd the duke of bavaria now as david punishd the man that said he had killd king saul whether it was so or no twas thought this fellow ought to be delivered up to justice tho the duke of bavaria was alive  upon the whole twas voted a scandalous thing that news writers shoud kill kings and princes and bring them to life again at pleasure and to make an example of this fellow he was dismissd upon condition he should go to the queensbench once a day and bear fuller his brother of the faculty company two hours for fourteen days together which cruel punishment was executed with the utmost severity  the club has had a great deal of trouble about the newswriters who have been continually brought before them for their ridiculous stories and imposing upon mankind and tho the proceedings have been pretty tedious we must give you the trouble of a few of them in our next the addition to the heading translated out of french appears only in no   and the first title mercure scandale adopted from a french book published about      having been much criticized for its grammar and on other grounds was dropped in no    thenceforth defoes pleasant comment upon passing follies appeared under the single head of advice from the scandalous club still the verbal critics exercised their wits upon the title we have been so often on the defence of our title says defoe in no    that the world begins to think our society wants employment  if scandalous must signify nothing but personal scandal respecting the subject of which it is predicated we desire those gentlemen to answer for us how postman or postboy can signify a newspaper the post man or post boy being in all my reading properly and strictly applicable not to the paper but to the person bringing or carrying the news mercury also is if i understand it by a transmutation of meaning from a god turned into a book — from hence our club thinks they have not fair play in being denyd the privilege of making an allegory as well as other people in no    defoe made in one change more a whimsical half concession of a syllable by putting a sign of contraction in its place and thenceforth calling this part of his review advice from the scandal club nothing can be more evident than the family likeness between this forefather of the tatler and spectator and its more familiar descendants there is a trick of voice common to all and some papers of defoes might have been written for the spectator take the little allegory for instance in no    which tells of a desponding young lady brought before the society as found by rosamonds pond in the park in a strange condition taken by the mob for a lunatic and whose clothes were all out of fashion but whose face when it was seen astonished the whole society by its extraordinary sweetness and majesty she told how she had been brought to despair and her name proved to be — modesty in letters questions and comments also which might be taken from defoes monthly supplementary journal to the advice from the scandal club we catch a likeness to the spirit of the tatler and spectator now and then exact some censured defoe for not confining himself to the weightier part of his purpose in establishing the review he replied in the introduction to his first monthly supplement that many men care but for a little reading at a time and said thus we wheedle them in if it may be allowd that expression to the knowledge of the world who rather than take more pains would be content with their ignorance and search into nothing singleminded quickwitted and prompt to act on the first suggestion of a higher point of usefulness to which he might attain steele saw the mind of the people ready for a new sort of relation to its writers and he followed the lead of defoe but though he turned from the more frivolous temper of the enfeebled playhouse audience to commune in free air with the country at large he took fresh care for the restraint of his deep earnestness within the bounds of a cheerful unpretending influence drop by drop it should fall and its strength lie in its persistence he would bring what wit he had out of the playhouse and speak his mind like defoe to the people themselves every postday but he would affect no pedantry of moralizing he would appeal to no passions he would profess himself only a tatler might he not use he thought modestly distrustful of the charm of his own mind some of the news obtained by virtue of the office of gazetteer that harley had given him to bring weight and acceptance to writing of his which he valued only for the use to which it could be put for as he himself truly says in the tatler wit if a man had it unless it be directed to some useful end is but a wanton frivolous quality all that one should value himself upon in this kind is that he had some honourable intention in it swift not then a deserter to the tories was a friend of steeles who when the first tatler appeared had been amusing the town at the expense of john partridge astrologer and almanacmaker with predictions for the year   0  professing to be written by isaac bickerstaff esq the first prediction was of the death of partridge on the   th of march next about eleven at night of a raging fever swift answered himself and also published in due time the accomplishment of the first of mr bickerstaffs predictions being an account of the death of mr partridge the almanackmaker upon the   th instant other wits kept up the joke and in his next years almanac that for   0  partridge advertised that whereas it has been industriously given out by isaac bickerstaff esq and others to prevent the sale of this years almanack that john partridge is dead this may inform all his loving countrymen that he is still living in health and they are knaves that reported it otherwise steele gave additional lightness to the touch of his tatler which first appeared on the   th of april   0  by writing in the name of isaac bickerstaff and carrying on the jest that was to his serious mind a blow dealt against prevailing superstition referring in his first tatler to this advertisement of partridges he said of it i have in another place and in a paper by itself sufficiently convinced this man that he is dead and if he has any shame i do not doubt but that by this time he owns it to all his acquaintance for though the legs and arms and whole body of that man may still appear and perform their animal functions yet since as i have elsewhere observed his art is gone the man is gone to steele indeed the truth was absolute that a man is but what he can do  in this spirit then steele began the tatler simply considering that his paper was to be published for the use of the good people of england and professing at the outset that he was an author writing for the public who expected from the public payment for his work and that he preferred this course to gambling for the patronage of men in office having pleasantly shown the sordid spirit that underlies the mountebanks sublime professions of disinterestedness we have a contempt he says for such paltry barterers and have therefore all along informed the public that we intend to give them our advices for our own sakes and are labouring to make our lucubrations come to some price in money for our more convenient support in the service of the public it is certain that many other schemes have been proposed to me as a friend offered to show me in a treatise he had writ which he called the whole art of life or the introduction to great men illustrated in a pack of cards but being a novice at all manner of play i declined the offer addison took these cards and played an honest game with them successfully when at the end of   0  the earl of sunderland marlboroughs soninlaw lost his secretaryship addison lost his place as undersecretary but he did not object to go to ireland as chief secretary to lord wharton the new lordlieutenant an active party man a leader on the turf with reputation for indulgence after business hours according to the fashion of the court of charles ii  lord wharton took to ireland clayton to write him musical entertainments and a train of parasites of quality he was a great boroughmonger and is said at one critical time to have returned thirty members he had no difficulty therefore in finding addison a seat and made him in that year   0  mp for malmesbury addison only once attempted to speak in the house of commons and then embarrassed by encouraging applause that welcomed him he stammered and sat down but when having laid his political cards down for a time and at ease in his own home pen in hand he brought his sound mind and quick humour to the aid of his friend steele he came with him into direct relation with the english people addison never gave posterity a chance of knowing what was in him till following steeles lead he wrote those papers in tatler spectator and guardian wherein alone his genius abides with us and will abide with english readers to the end the tatler the spectator and the guardian were all of them steeles begun and ended by him at his sole discretion in these three journals steele was answerable for   0 papers addison for     swift wrote two papers and sent about a dozen fragments congreve wrote one article in the tatler pope wrote thrice for the spectator and eight times for the guardian addison who was in ireland when the tatler first appeared only guessed the authorship by an expression in an early number and it was not until eighty numbers had been issued and the character of the new paper was formed and established that addison on his return to london joined the friend who with his usual complete absence of the vanity of selfassertion finally ascribed to the ally he dearly loved the honours of success  it was the kind of success steele had desired — a widelydiffused influence for good the tatlers were penny papers published three times a week and issued also for another halfpenny with a blank halfsheet for transmission by post when any written scraps of the days gossip that friend might send to friend could be included it was through these and the daily spectators which succeeded them that the people of england really learnt to read the few leaves of sound reason and fancy were but a light tax on uncultivated powers of attention exquisite grace and true kindliness here associated with familiar ways and common incidents of everyday life gave many an honest man fresh sense of the best happiness that lies in common duties honestly performed and a fresh energy free as christianity itself from malice — for so both steele and addison meant that it should be — in opposing themselves to the frivolities and small frauds on the conscience by which manliness is undermined  a pamphlet by john gay — the present state of wit in a letter to a friend in the country — was dated may        about two months after the spectator had replaced the tatler and thus gay represents the best talk of the town about these papers before i proceed further in the account of our weekly papers it will be necessary to inform you that at the beginning of the winter to the infinite surprise of all the town mr steele flung up his tatler and instead of isaac bickerstaff esquire subscribed himself richard steele to the last of those papers after a handsome compliment to the town for their kind acceptance of his endeavours to divert them  the chief reason he thought fit to give for his leaving off writing was that having been so long looked on in all public places and companies as the author of those papers he found that his most intimate friends and acquaintance were in pain to speak or act before him  the town was very far from being satisfied with this reason and most people judged the true cause to be either  • that he was quite spent and wanted matter to continue his undertaking any longer or  • that he laid it down as a sort of submission to and composition with the government for some past offences or lastly  • that he had a mind to vary his shape and appear again in some new light however that were his disappearance seemed to be bewailed as some general calamity every one wanted so agreeable an amusement and the coffeehouses began to be sensible that the esquires lucubrations alone had brought them more customers than all their other newspapers put together  it must indeed be confessed that never man threw up his pen under stronger temptations to have employed it longer his reputation was at a greater height than i believe ever any living authors was before him it is reasonable to suppose that his gains were proportionably considerable every one read him with pleasure and goodwill and the tories in respect to his other good qualities had almost forgiven his unaccountable imprudence in declaring against them  lastly it was highly improbable that if he threw off a character the ideas of which were so strongly impressed in every ones mind however finely he might write in any new form that he should meet with the same reception  to give you my own thoughts of this gentlemans writings i shall in the first place observe that there is a noble difference between him and all the rest of our gallant and polite authors the latter have endeavoured to please the age by falling in with them and encouraging them in their fashionable vices and false notions of things it would have been a jest some time since for a man to have asserted that anything witty could be said in praise of a married state or that devotion and virtue were any way necessary to the character of a fine gentleman bickerstaff ventured to tell the town that they were a parcel of fops fools and coquettes but in such a manner as even pleased them and made them more than half inclined to believe that he spoke truth  instead of complying with the false sentiments or vicious tastes of the age — either in morality criticism or good breeding — he has boldly assured them that they were altogether in the wrong and commanded them with an authority which perfectly well became him to surrender themselves to his arguments for virtue and good sense  it is incredible to conceive the effect his writings have had on the town how many thousand follies they have either quite banished or given a very great check to how much countenance they have added to virtue and religion how many people they have rendered happy by shewing them it was their own fault if they were not so and lastly how entirely they have convinced our young fops and young fellows of the value and advantages of learning  he has indeed rescued it out of the hands of pedants and fools and discovered the true method of making it amiable and lovely to all mankind in the dress he gives it it is a most welcome guest at teatables and assemblies and is relished and caressed by the merchants on the change accordingly there is not a lady at court nor a banker in lombard street who is not verily persuaded that captain steele is the greatest scholar and best casuist of any man in england  lastly his writings have set all our wits and men of letters on a new way of thinking of which they had little or no notion before and although we cannot say that any of them have come up to the beauties of the original i think we may venture to affirm that every one of them writes and thinks much more justly than they did some time since  the vast variety of subjects which mr steele has treated of in so different manners and yet all so perfectly well made the world believe that it was impossible they should all come from the same hand this set every one upon guessing who was the esquires friend and most people at first fancied it must be doctor swift but it is now no longer a secret that his only great and constant assistant was mr addison  this is that excellent friend to whom mr steele owes so much and who refuses to have his name set before those pieces which the greatest pens in england would be proud to own indeed they could hardly add to this gentlemans reputation whose works in latin and english poetry long since convinced the world that he was the greatest master in europe in those two languages  i am assured from good hands that all the visions and other tracts of that way of writing with a very great number of the most exquisite pieces of wit and raillery through the lucubrations are entirely of this gentlemans composing which may in some measure account for that different genius which appears in the winter papers from those of the summer at which time as the examiner often hinted this friend of mr steele was in ireland  mr steele confesses in his last volume of the tatlers that he is obliged to dr swift for his town shower and the description of the morn with some other hints received from him in private conversation  i have also heard that several of those letters which came as from unknown hands were written by mr henley which is an answer to your query who those friends are whom mr steele speaks of in his last tatler  but to proceed with my account of our other papers the expiration of bickerstaffs lucubrations was attended with much the same consequences as the death of meliboeuss ox in virgil as the latter engendered swarms of bees the former immediately produced whole swarms of little satirical scribblers  one of these authors called himself the growler and assured us that to make amends for mr steeles silence he was resolved to growl at us weekly as long as we should think fit to give him any encouragement another gentleman with more modesty called his paper the whisperer and a third to please the ladies christened his the tell tale  at the sametime came out several tatlers each of which with equal truth and wit assured us that he was the genuine isaac bickerstaff  it may be observed that when the esquire laid down his pen though he could not but foresee that several scribblers would soon snatch it up which he might one would think easily have prevented he scorned to take any further care about it but left the field fairly open to any worthy successor immediately some of our wits were for forming themselves into a club headed by one mr harrison and trying how they could shoot in this bow of ulysses but soon found that this sort of writing requires so fine and particular a manner of thinking with so exact a knowledge of the world as must make them utterly despair of success  they seemed indeed at first to think that what was only the garnish of the former tatlers was that which recommended them and not those substantial entertainments which they everywhere abound in according they were continually talking of their maid night cap spectacles and charles lillie however there were now and then some faint endeavours at humour and sparks of wit which the town for want of better entertainment was content to hunt after through a heap of impertinences but even those are at present become wholly invisible and quite swallowed up in the blaze of the spectator  you may remember i told you before that one cause assigned for the laying down the tatler was want of matter and indeed this was the prevailing opinion in town when we were surprised all at once by a paper called the spectator which was promised to be continued every day and was written in so excellent a style with so nice a judgment and such a noble profusion of wit and humour that it was not difficult to determine it could come from no other hands but those which had penned the lucubrations  this immediately alarmed these gentlemen who as it is said mr steele phrases it had the censorship in commission they found the new spectator came on like a torrent and swept away all before him they despaired ever to equal him in wit humour or learning which had been their true and certain way of opposing him and therefore rather chose to fall on the author and to call out for help to all good christians by assuring them again and again that they were the first original true and undisputed isaac bickerstaff  meanwhile the spectator whom we regard as our shelter from that flood of false wit and impertinence which was breaking in upon us is in every ones hands and a constant for our morning conversation at teatables and coffeehouses we had at first indeed no manner of notion how a diurnal paper could be continued in the spirit and style of our present spectators but to our no small surprise we find them still rising upon us and can only wonder from whence so prodigious a run of wit and learning can proceed since some of our best judges seem to think that they have hitherto in general outshone even the esquires first tatlers  most people fancy from their frequency that they must be composed by a society i withal assign the first places to mr steele and his friend so far john gay whose discussion of the tatlers and spectators appeared when only fiftyfive numbers of the spectator had been published  there was high strife of faction and there was real peril to the country by a possible turn of affairs after queen annes death that another stuart restoration in the name of divine right of kings would leave rights of the people to be reconquered in civil war the chiefs of either party were appealing to the people and engaging all the wit they could secure to fight on their side in the war of pamphlets steeles heart was in the momentous issue both he and addison had it in mind while they were blending their calm playfulness with all the clamour of the press the spirit in which these friends worked young pope must have felt for after addison had helped him in his first approach to fame by giving honour in the spectator to his essay on criticism and when he was thankful for that service he contributed to the spectator his messiah such offering clearly showed how pope interpreted the labour of the essayists  in the fens of lincolnshire the antiquary maurice johnson collected his neighbours of spalding taking care it is said not to alarm the country gentlemen by any premature mention of antiquities he endeavoured at first to allure them into the more flowery paths of literature in   0  a few of them were brought together every postday at the coffeehouse in the abbey yard and after one of the party had read aloud the last published number of the tatler they proceeded to talk over the subject among themselves even in distant perthshire the gentlemen met after church on sunday to discuss the news of the week the spectators were read as regularly as the journal so the political draught of bitterness came sweetened with the wisdom of goodhumour the goodhumour of the essayists touched with a light and kindly hand every form of affectation and placed everyday life in the light in which it would be seen by a natural and honest man a sense of the essentials of life was assumed everywhere for the reader who was asked only to smile charitably at its vanities steele looked through all shams to the natural heart of the englishman appealed to that and found it easily enough even under the disguise of the young gentleman cited in the   th tatler so ambitious to be thought worse than he is that in his degree of understanding he sets up for a freethinker and talks atheistically in coffeehouses all day though every morning and evening it can be proved upon him he regularly at home says his prayers but as public events led nearer to the prospect of a jacobite triumph that would have again brought englishmen against each other sword to sword there was no voice of warning more fearless than richard steeles he changed the spectator for the guardian that was to be in its plan more free to guard the peoples rights and standing forward more distinctly as a politician he became member for stockbridge in place of the guardian which he had dropped when he felt the plan of that journal unequal to the right and full expression of his mind steele took for a periodical the name of englishman and under that name fought with then unexampled abstinence from personality against the principles upheld by swift in his examiner then when the peace of utrecht alarmed english patriots steele in a bold pamphlet on the crisis expressed his dread of arbitrary power and a jacobite succession with a boldness that cost him his seat in parliament as he had before sacrificed to plain speaking his place of gazetteer  of the later history of steele and addison a few words will suffice this is not an account of their lives but an endeavour to show why englishmen must always have a living interest in the spectator their joint production steeles spectator ended with the seventh volume the members of the club were all disposed of and the journal formally wound up but by the suggestion of a future ceremony of opening the spectators mouth a way was made for addison whenever he pleased to connect with the famous series an attempt of his own for its revival a year and a half later addison made this attempt producing his new journal with the old name and as far as his contributions went not less than the old wit and earnestness three times a week instead of daily but he kept it alive only until the completion of one volume addison had not steeles popular tact as an editor he preached and he suffered drier men to preach while in his jest he now and then wrote what he seems to have been unwilling to acknowledge his eighth volume contains excellent matter but the subjects are not always well chosen or varied judiciously and one understands why the spectator took a firmer hold upon society when the two friends in the full strength of their life aged about forty worked together and embraced between them a wide range of human thought and feeling it should be remembered also that queen anne died while addisons eighth volume was appearing and the change in the whig position brought him other occupation of his time  in april      in the interval between the completion of the true spectator and the appearance of the supplementary volume addisons tragedy of cato planned at college begun during his foreign travels retouched in england and at last completed was produced at drury lane addison had not considered it a stage play but when it was urged that the time was proper for animating the public with the sentiments of cato he assented to its production apart from its real merit the play had the advantage of being applauded by the whigs who saw in it a whig political ideal and by the tories who desired to show that they were as warm friends of liberty as any whig could be  upon the death of queen anne addison acted for a short time as secretary to the regency and when george i appointed addisons patron the earl of sunderland to the lordlieutenancy of ireland sunderland took addison with him as chief secretary sunderland resigned in ten months and thus addisons secretaryship came to an end in august      addison was also employed to meet the rebellion of      by writing the freeholder he wrote under this title fiftyfive papers which were published twice a week between december      and june      and he was rewarded with the

addison settled upon the countess £ 000 in lieu of an estate which she gave up for his sake henceforth he lived chiefly at holland house in april      lord sunderland became secretary of state and still mindful of marlboroughs illustrious supporter he made addison his colleague eleven months later ill health obliged addison to resign the seals and his death followed june         at the age of

he was also first in the commission of the peace for middlesex and was made one of the deputy lieutenants of the county at the request of the managers steeles name was included in the new patent required at drury lane by the royal company of comedians upon the accession of a new sovereign steele also was returned as mp for boroughbridge in yorkshire was writer of the address to the king

few weeks after the death of his wife in december      sunderland at a time when he had addison for colleague brought in a bill for preventing any future creations of peers except when an existing peerage should become extinct steele who looked upon this as an infringement alike of the privileges of the crown and of the rights of the subject opposed the bill in parliament and started in march      a paper called the plebeian in which he argued against a measure tending he said to the formation of an oligarchy addison replied in the old whig and this which occurred within a year of the close of addisons life was the main subject of political difference between them the bill strongly opposed was dropped for that session and reintroduced after addisons death in the december following to be thrown out by the house of commons  steeles argument against the government brought on him the hostility of the duke of newcastle then lord chamberlain and it was partly to defend himself and his brother patentees against hostile action threatened by the duke that steele in january    0 started his paper called the theatre but he was dispossessed of his government of the theatre to which a salary of £ 00 ayear had been attached and suffered by the persecution of the court until walpoles return to power steele was then restored to his office and in the following year      produced his most successful comedy the conscious lovers after this time his health declined his spirits were depressed he left london for bath his only surviving son eugene born while the spectator was being

health and fortune when in      he had an attack of palsy which was the prelude to his death he died sept        at carmarthen where he had been boarding with a mercer who was his agent and receiver of rents there is a pleasant record that he retained his cheerful sweetness of temper to the last and would often be carried out of a summers evening where the country lads and lasses were assembled at their rural sports — and with his pencil gave an order on his agent the mercer for a new gown to the best dancer two editions of the spectator the tenth and eleventh were published by tonson in the year of steeles death these and the next edition dated      were without the translations of the mottos which appear however in the edition of      notes were first added by dr percy the editor of the reliques of ancient poetry and dr calder dr john calder a native of aberdeen bred to the dissenting ministry was for some time keeper of dr williamss library in redcross street he was a candidate for the office given to dr abraham rees of editor and general superintendent of the new issue of chamberss cyclopædia undertaken by the booksellers in      and he supplied to it some new articles the duke of northumberland warmly patronized dr calder and made him his companion in london and at alnwick castle as private literary secretary dr thomas percy who had constituted himself cousin and retainer to the percy of northumberland obtained his bishopric of dromore in      in the following year lost his only son and suffered from that failure in eyesight which resulted in a total blindness  having become intimately acquainted with dr calder when at northumberland house and alnwick percy intrusted to him the notes he had collected for illustrating the tatler spectator and guardian these were afterwards used with additions by dr calder in the various editions of those works especially in the sixvolume edition of the tatler published by john nichols in      where percys notes have a p attached to them and dr calders are signed annotator the tatler was annotated fully and the annotated tatler has supplied some pieces of information given in the present edition of the spectator percy actually edited two volumes for r tonson in      but the work was stopped by the death of the bookseller and the other six were added to them in      they were slightly annotated both as regards the number and the value of the notes but percy and calder lived when spectator traditions were yet fresh and oral information was accessible as to points of personal allusion or as to the authorship of a few papers or letters which but for them might have remained anonymous their notes are those of which the substance has run through all subsequent editions little if anything was added to them by bisset or chalmers the energies of those editors having been chiefly directed to the preserving or multiplying of corruptions of the text percy when telling tonson that he had completed two volumes of the spectator said that he had corrected innumerable corruptions which had then crept in and could have come only by misprint since that time not only have misprints been preserved and multiplied but punctuation has been deliberately modernized to the destruction of the freshness of the original style and editors of another understanding age have also taken upon themselves by many a little touch to correct addisons style or grammar  this volume reprints for the first time in the present century the text of the spectator as its authors left it a good recent edition contains in the first    papers which are a fair sample of the whole    petty variations from the proper text at that rate in the whole work more than  000 apart from the recasting of the punctuation which is counted as a defect only in two instances where it has changed the sense chalmerss text of      was hardly better and about twothirds of the whole number of corruptions had already appeared in bissets edition of

us that many to whom his person is well known speak of him very currently by mr whatdyecall him bisset before chalmers rounded the sentence into very correctly by the appellation of mr whatdyecall him but it seems to have been chalmers who first undertook to correct in the next paper addisons grammar by turning have laughed to have seen into have laughed to see and transformed a treaty with london and wise — a firm now of historical repute — for the supply of flowers to the opera into a treaty between london and wise which most people would take to be a very different matter if the present edition has its own share of misprints and oversights at least it inherits none and it contains no wilful alteration of the text  the papers as they first appeared in the daily issue of a penny and after the stamp was imposed twopenny folio halfsheet have been closely compared with the first issue in guinea octavos for which they were revised and with the last edition that appeared before the death of steele  the original text is here given precisely as it was left after revision by its authors and there is shown at the same time the amount and character of the revision  • sentences added in the reprint are printed in brown without any appended note  • sentences omitted or words altered are shown by printing the revised version in brown and giving the text as it stood in the original daily issue as a footnote  thus the reader has here both the original texts of the spectator the essays as revised by their authors for permanent use form the main text of the present volume but if the words or passages in brackets be omitted the words or passages in corresponding footnotes — where there are such footnotes — being substituted for them the text becomes throughout that of the spectator as it first came out in daily numbers  • as the few differences between good spelling in queen annes time and good spelling now are never of a kind to obscure the sense of a word or lessen the enjoyment of the reader it has been thought better to make the reproduction perfect and thus show not only what steele and addison wrote but how they spelt  • while restoring to their style the proper harmony of their own methods of punctuating  • and their way of sometimes getting emphasis by turning to account the use of capitals which in their hands was not wholly conventional  • the original folio numbers have been followed also in the use of italics  • and other little details of the disposition of the type for example in the reproduction of those rows of single inverted commas which distinguish what a correspondent called the parts laced down the side with little cs this last detail of formatting has not been reproduced in this file html ed  • the translation of the mottos and latin quotations which steele and addison deliberately abstained from giving and which as they were since added impede and sometimes confound and contradict the text are here placed in a body at the end for those who want them again and again the essayists indulge in banter on the mystery of the latin and greek mottos and what confusion must enter into the mind of the unwary reader who finds popes homer quoted at the head of a spectator long before addisons word of applause to the young poets essay on criticism  • the mottos then are placed in an appendix  • there is a short appendix also of advertisements taken from the original number of the spectator and a few others where they seem to illustrate some point in the text will be found among the notes in the large number of notes here added to a revision of those bequeathed to us by percy and calder the object has been to give information which may contribute to some nearer acquaintance with the writers of the book and enjoyment of allusions to past manners and events  • finally from the general index to the spectators c published as a separate volume in    0 there has been taken what was serviceable and additions have been made to it with a desire to secure for this edition of the spectator the advantages of being handy for reference as well as true to the real text h m      footnote     sentences omitted or words altered

part of an impartial spectator if i dedicated the following papers to one who is not of the most consummate and most acknowledged merit  none but a person of a finished character can be the proper patron of a work which endeavours to cultivate and polish human life by promoting virtue and knowledge and by recommending whatsoever may be either useful or ornamental to society  i know that the homage i now pay you is offering a kind of violence to one who is as solicitous to shun applause as he is assiduous to deserve it but my lord this is perhaps the only particular in which your prudence will be always disappointed  while justice candour equanimity a zeal for the good of your country and the most persuasive eloquence in bringing over others to it are valuable distinctions you are not to expect that the publick will so far comply with your inclinations as to forbear celebrating such extraordinary qualities it is in vain that you have endeavoured to conceal your share of merit in the many national services which you have effected do what you will the present age will be talking of your virtues tho posterity alone will do them justice  other men pass through oppositions and contending interests in the ways of ambition but your great abilities have been invited to power and importuned to accept of advancement nor is it strange that this should happen to your lordship who could bring into the service of your sovereign the arts and policies of ancient greece and rome as well as the most exact knowledge of our own constitution in particular and of the interests of europe in general to which i must also add a certain dignity in yourself that to say the least of it has been always equal to those great honours which have been conferred upon you  it is very well known how much the church owed to you in the most dangerous day it ever saw that of the arraignment of its prelates and how far the civil power in the late and present reign has been indebted to your counsels and wisdom  but to enumerate the great advantages which the publick has received from your administration would be a more proper work for an history than an address of this nature  your lordship appears as great in your private life as in the most important offices which you have born i would therefore rather chuse to speak of the pleasure you afford all who are admitted into your conversation of your elegant taste in all the polite parts of learning of your great humanity and complacency of manners and of the surprising influence which is peculiar to you in making every one who converses with your lordship prefer you to himself without thinking the less meanly of his own talents but if i should take notice of all that might be observed in your lordship i should have nothing new to say upon any other character of distinction  i am  my lord  your lordships  most obedient  most devoted  humble servant  the spectator      footnote     in      when a student at oxford

meant to be what dr johnson called a kind of rhyming introduction to lord somers if you he said to somers then — if you well pleasd shall smile upon my lays secure of fame my voice ill boldly raise for next to what you write is what you praise somers did smile and at once held out to addison his helping hand mindful of this and of substantial friendship during the last seventeen years addison joined steele in dedicating to his earliest patron the first volume of the essays which include his best security of fame  at that time john somers aged    and retired from political life was weak in health and high in honours earned by desert only he was the son of an attorney at worcester rich enough to give him a liberal education at his city grammar school and at trinity college oxford where he was entered as a gentleman commoner he left the university without taking a degree to practise law having a strong bent towards literature as well as a keen manly interest in the vital questions which concerned the liberties of england under charles the second he distinguished himself by political tracts which maintained constitutional rights he rose at the bar to honour and popularity especially after his pleading as junior counsel for sancroft archbishop of canterbury and the six bishops lloyd turner lake ken white and trelawney who signed the petition against the kings order for reading in all churches a declaration for liberty of conscience which they said was founded upon such a dispensing power as hath been often declared illegal in parliament somers earned the gratitude of a people openly and loudly triumphing in the acquittal of the seven bishops he was active also in cooperation with those who were planning the expulsion of the stuarts and the bringing over of the prince of orange during the interregnum he and at the same time also charles montague afterwards lord halifax first entered parliament he was at the conference with the lords upon the question of declaring the throne vacant as chairman of the committee appointed for the purpose it was somers who drew up the declaration of right which in placing the prince and princess of orange on the throne set forth the grounds of the revolution and asserted against royal encroachment the ancient rights and liberties of england for these services and for his rare ability as a constitutional lawyer king william in the first year of his reign made somers solicitorgeneral in      he became attorneygeneral as sir john somers and soon afterwards in march       the great seal which had been four years in commission was delivered to his keeping with a patent entitling him to a pension of £ 000 a year from the day he quitted office he was then also sworn in as privy councillor in april      somers as lord keeper delivered up the great seal and received it back with the higher title of lord chancellor he was at the same time created baron somers of evesham crown property was also given to him to support his dignity one use that he made of his influence was to procure young addison a pension that he might be forwarded in service of the state party spirit among his political opponents ran high

addison   non fumum ex fulgore sed ex fumo dare lucem cogitat ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat  hor   i have observed that a reader seldom peruses a book with pleasure till he knows whether the writer of it be a black or a fair man of a mild or cholerick disposition married or a batchelor with other particulars of the like nature that conduce very much to the right understanding of an author to gratify this curiosity which is so natural to a reader i design this paper and my next as prefatory discourses to my following writings and shall give some account in them of the several persons that are engaged in this work as the chief trouble of compiling digesting and correcting will fall to my share i must do myself the justice to open the work with my own history  i was born to a small hereditary estate which according to the tradition of the village where it lies  was bounded by the same hedges and ditches in william the conquerors time that it is at present and has been delivered down from father to son whole and entire without the loss or acquisition of a single field or meadow during the space of six hundred years there runs  a story in the family that when my mother was gone with child of me about three months she dreamt that she was brought to bed of a judge whether this might proceed from a lawsuit which was then depending in the family or my fathers being a justice of the peace i cannot determine for i am not so vain as to think it presaged any dignity that i should arrive at in my future life though that was the interpretation which the neighbourhood put upon it the gravity of my behaviour at my very first appearance in the world and all the time that i sucked seemed to favour my mothers dream for as she has often told me i threw away my rattle before i was two months old and would not make use of my coral till they had taken away the bells from it  as for the rest of my infancy there being nothing in it remarkable i shall pass it over in silence i find that during my nonage i had the reputation of a very sullen youth but was always a favourite of my schoolmaster who used to say that my parts were solid and would wear well i had not been long at the university before i distinguished myself by a most profound silence for during the space of eight years excepting in the publick exercises of the college i scarce uttered the quantity of an hundred words and indeed do not remember that i ever spoke three sentences together in my whole life whilst i was in this learned body i applied myself with so much diligence to my studies that there are very few celebrated books either in the learned or the modern tongues which i am not acquainted with  upon the death of my father i was resolved to travel into foreign countries and therefore left the university with the character of an odd unaccountable fellow that had a great deal of learning if i would but show it an insatiable thirst after knowledge carried me into all the countries of europe in which  there was any thing new or strange to be seen nay to such a degree was my curiosity raised that having read the controversies of some great men concerning the antiquities of egypt i made a voyage to grand cairo on purpose to take the measure of a pyramid and as soon as i had set my self right in that particular returned to my native country with great satisfaction   i have passed my latter years in this city where i am frequently seen in most publick places tho there are not above half a dozen of my select friends that know me of whom my next paper shall give a more particular account there is no place of general  resort wherein i do not often make my appearance sometimes i am seen thrusting my head into a round of politicians at wills  and listning with great attention to the narratives that are made in those little circular audiences sometimes i smoak a pipe at childs  and while i seem attentive to nothing but the postman  overhear the conversation of every table in the room i appear on sunday nights at st jamess coffee house  and sometimes join the little committee of politicks in the innerroom as one who comes there to hear and improve my face is likewise very well known at the grecian 0 the cocoatree   and in the theaters both of drury lane and the haymarket   i have been taken for a merchant upon the exchange for above these ten years and sometimes pass for a jew in the assembly of stockjobbers at jonathans   in short whereever i see a cluster of people i always mix with them tho i never open my lips but in my own club  thus i live in the world rather as a spectator of mankind than as one of the species by which means i have made my self a speculative statesman soldier merchant and artizan without ever medling with any practical part in life i am very well versed in the theory of an husband or a father and can discern the errors in the œconomy business and diversion of others better than those who are engaged in them as standersby discover blots which are apt to escape those who are in the game i never espoused any party with violence and am resolved to observe an exact neutrality between the whigs and tories unless i shall be forcd to declare myself by the hostilities of either side in short i have acted in all the parts of my life as a lookeron which is the character i intend to preserve in this paper  i have given the reader just so much of my history and character as to let him see i am not altogether unqualified for the business i have undertaken as for other particulars in my life and adventures i shall insert them in following papers as i shall see occasion in the mean time when i consider how much i have seen read and heard i begin to blame my own taciturnity and since i have neither time nor inclination to communicate the fulness of my heart in speech i am resolved to do it in writing and to print my self out if possible before i die i have been often told by my friends that it is pity so many useful discoveries which i have made should be in the possession of a silent man for this reason therefore i shall publish a sheet full of thoughts every morning for the benefit of my contemporaries and if i can any way contribute to the diversion or improvement of the country in which i live i shall leave it when i am summoned out of it with the secret satisfaction of thinking that i have not lived in vain  there are three very material points which i have not spoken to in this paper and which for several important reasons i must keep to my self at least for some time i mean an account of my name my age and my lodgings i must confess i would gratify my reader in any thing that is reasonable but as for these three particulars though i am sensible they might tend very much to the embellishment of my paper i cannot yet come to a resolution of communicating them to the publick they would indeed draw me out of that obscurity which i have enjoyed for many years and expose me in publick places to several salutes and civilities which have been always very disagreeable to me for the greatest pain i can suffer is   the being talked to and being stared at it is for this reason likewise that i keep my complexion and dress as very great secrets tho it is not impossible but i may make discoveries of both in the progress of the work i have undertaken  after having been thus particular upon my self i shall in tomorrows paper give an account of those gentlemen who are concerned with me in this work for as i have before intimated a plan of it is laid and concerted as all other matters of importance are in a club however as my friends have engaged me to stand in the front those who have a mind to correspond with me may direct their letters to the spectator at mr buckleys in little britain   for i must further acquaint the reader that tho our club meets only on tuesdays and thursdays we have appointed a committee to sit every night for the inspection of all

house on the wednesdays when an opera was played  this was the relative position of drury lane and the haymarket theatres when the spectator first appeared drury lane had entered upon a long season of greater prosperity than it had enjoyed for thirty years before collier not finding the haymarket as prosperous as it was fashionable was planning a change of place with swiney and he so contrived by

society is a gentleman of worcestershire of antient descent a baronet his name sir roger de coverly  his great grandfather was inventor of that famous countrydance which is calld after him all who know that shire are very well acquainted with the parts and merits of sir roger he is a gentleman that is very singular in his behaviour but his singularities proceed from his good sense and are contradictions to the manners of the world only as he thinks the world is in the wrong however this humour creates him no enemies for he does nothing with sourness or obstinacy and his being unconfined to modes and forms makes him but the readier and more capable to please and oblige all who know him when he is in town he lives in soho square  it is said he keeps himself a batchelour by reason he was crossed in love by a perverse beautiful widow of the next county to him before this disappointment sir roger was what you call a fine gentleman had often supped with my lord rochester  and sir george etherege  fought a duel upon his first coming to town and kickd bully dawson  in a publick coffeehouse for calling him youngster but being illused by the abovementioned widow he was very serious for a year and a half and tho his temper being naturally jovial he at last got over it he grew careless of himself and never dressed afterwards he continues to wear a coat and doublet of the same cut that were in fashion at the time of his repulse which in his merry humours he tells us has been in and out twelve times since he first wore it tis said sir roger grew humble in his desires after he had forgot this cruel beauty insomuch that it is reported he has frequently offended in point of chastity with beggars and gypsies but this is lookd upon by his friends rather as matter of raillery than truth he is now in his fiftysixth year cheerful gay and hearty keeps a good house in both town and country a great lover of mankind but there is such a mirthful cast in his behaviour that he is rather beloved than esteemed his tenants grow rich his servants look satisfied all the young women profess love to him and the young men are glad of his company when he comes into a house he calls the servants by their names and talks all the way up stairs to a visit i must not omit that sir roger is a justice of the quorum that he fills the chair at a quartersession with great abilities and three months ago gained universal applause by explaining a passage in the gameact  the gentleman next in esteem and authority among us is another batchelour who is a member of the inner temple a man of great probity wit and understanding but he has chosen his place of residence rather to obey the direction of an old humoursome father than in pursuit of his own inclinations he was placd there to study the laws of the land and is the most learned of any of the house in those of the stage aristotle and longinus are much better understood by him than littleton or cooke the father sends up every post questions relating to marriagearticles leases and tenures in the neighbourhood all which questions he agrees with an attorney to answer and take care of in the lump he is studying the passions themselves when he should be inquiring into the debates among men which arise from them he knows the argument of each of the orations of demosthenes and tully but not one case in the reports of our own courts no one ever took him for a fool but none except his intimate friends know he has a great deal of wit this turn makes him at once both disinterested and agreeable as few of his thoughts are drawn from business they are most of them fit for conversation his taste of books is a little too just for the age he lives in he has read all but approves of very few his familiarity with the customs manners actions and writings of the antients makes him a very delicate observer of what occurs to him in the present world he is an excellent critick and the time of the play is his hour of business exactly at five he passes through new inn crosses through russel court and takes a turn at wills till the play begins he has his shoes rubbd and his perriwig powderd at the barbers as you go into the rose  — it is for the good of the audience when he is at a play for the actors have an ambition to please him  the person of next consideration is sir andrew freeport a merchant of great eminence in the city of london a person of indefatigable industry strong reason and great experience his notions of trade are noble and generous and as every rich man has usually some sly way of jesting which would make no great figure were he not a rich man he calls the sea the british common he is acquainted with commerce in all its parts and will tell you that it is a stupid and barbarous way to extend dominion by arms for true power is to be got by arts and industry he will often argue that if this part of our trade were well cultivated we should gain from one nation and if another from another i have heard him prove that diligence makes more lasting acquisitions than valour and that sloth has ruind more nations than the sword he abounds in several frugal maxims amongst which the greatest favourite is a penny saved is a penny got a general trader of good sense is pleasanter company than a general scholar and sir andrew having a natural unaffected eloquence the perspicuity of his discourse gives the same pleasure that wit would in another man he has made his fortunes himself and says that england may be richer than other kingdoms by as plain methods as he himself is richer than other men tho at the same time i can say this of him that there is not a point in the compass but blows home a ship in which he is an owner  next to sir andrew in the clubroom sits captain sentry  a gentleman of great courage good understanding but invincible modesty he is one of those that deserve very well but are very awkward at putting their talents within the observation of such as should take notice of them he was some years a captain and behaved himself with great gallantry in several engagements and at several sieges but having a small estate of his own and being next heir to sir roger he has quitted a way of life in which no man can rise suitably to his merit who is not something of a courtier as well as a soldier i have heard him often lament that in a profession where merit is placed in so conspicuous a view impudence should get the better of modesty when he has talked to this purpose i never heard him make a sour expression but frankly confess that he left the world because he was not fit for it a strict honesty and an even regular behaviour are in themselves obstacles to him that must press through crowds who endeavour at the same end with himself the favour of a commander he will however in this way of talk excuse generals for not disposing according to mens desert or enquiring into it for says he that great man who has a mind to help me has as many to break through to come at me as i have to come at him therefore he will conclude that the man who would make a figure especially in a military way must get over all false modesty and assist his patron against the importunity of other pretenders by a proper assurance in his own vindication he says it is a civil cowardice to be backward in asserting what you ought to expect as it is a military fear to be slow in attacking when it is your duty with this candour does the gentleman speak of himself and others the same frankness runs through all his conversation the military part of his life has furnished him with many adventures in the relation of which he is very agreeable to the company for he is never overbearing though accustomed to command men in the utmost degree below him nor ever too obsequious from an habit of obeying men highly above him  but that our society may not appear a set of humourists unacquainted with the gallantries and pleasures of the age we have among us the gallant will honeycomb  a gentleman who according to his years should be in the decline of his life but having ever been very careful of his person and always had a very easy fortune time has made but very little impression either by wrinkles on his forehead or traces in his brain his person is well turned and of a good height he is very ready at that sort of discourse with which men usually entertain women he has all his life dressed very well and remembers habits as others do men he can smile when one speaks to him and laughs easily he knows the history of every mode and can inform you from which of the french kings wenches our wives and daughters had this manner of curling their hair that way of placing their hoods whose frailty was covered by such a sort of petticoat and whose vanity to show her foot made that part of the dress so short in such a year in a word all his conversation and knowledge has been in the female world as other men of his age will take notice to you what such a minister said upon such and such an occasion he will tell you when the duke of monmouth danced at court such a woman was then smitten another was taken with him at the head of his troop in the park in all these important relations he has ever about the same time received a kind glance or a blow of a fan from some celebrated beauty mother of the present lord suchaone if you speak of a young commoner that said a lively thing in the house he starts up he has good blood in his veins tom mirabell begot him the rogue cheated me in that affair that young fellows mother used me more like a dog than any woman i ever made advances to this way of talking of his very much enlivens the conversation among us of a more sedate turn and i find there is not one of the company but myself who rarely speak at all but speaks of him as of that sort of man who is usually called a wellbred fine gentleman to conclude his character where women are not concerned he is an honest worthy man  i cannot tell whether i am to account him whom i am next to speak of as one of our company for he visits us but seldom but when he does it adds to every man else a new enjoyment of himself he is a clergyman a very philosophick man of general learning great sanctity of life and the most exact good breeding he has the misfortune to be of a very weak constitution and consequently cannot accept of such cares and business as preferments in his function would oblige him to he is therefore among divines what a chambercounsellor is among lawyers the probity of his mind and the integrity of his life create him followers as being eloquent or loud advances others he seldom introduces the subject he speaks upon but we are so far gone in years that he observes when he is among us an earnestness to have him fall on some divine topick which he always treats with much authority as one who has no interests in this world as one who is hastening to the object of all his wishes and conceives hope from

lucr l     in one of my late rambles or rather speculations i looked into the great hall where the bank  is kept and was not a little pleased to see the directors secretaries and clerks with all the other members of that wealthy corporation ranged in their several stations according to the parts they act in that just and regular œconomy this revived in my memory the many discourses which i had both read and heard concerning the decay of publick credit with the methods of restoring it and which in my opinion have always been defective because they have always been made with an eye to separate interests and party principles  the thoughts of the day gave my mind employment for the whole night so that i fell insensibly into a kind of methodical dream which disposed all my contemplations into a vision or allegory or what else the reader shall please to call it  methoughts i returned to the great hall where i had been the morning before but to my surprize instead of the company that i left there i saw towards the upperend of the hall a beautiful virgin seated on a throne of gold her name as they told me was publick credit the walls instead of being adorned with pictures and maps were hung with many acts of parliament written in golden letters at the upper end of the hall was the magna charta  with the act of uniformity  on the right hand and the act of toleration  on the left at the lower end of the hall was the act of settlement  which was placed full in the eye of the virgin that sat upon the throne both the sides of the hall were covered with such acts of parliament as had been made for the establishment of publick funds the lady seemed to set an unspeakable value upon these several pieces of furniture insomuch that she often refreshed her eye with them and often smiled with a secret pleasure as she looked upon them but at the same time showed a very particular uneasiness if she saw any thing approaching that might hurt them she appeared indeed infinitely timorous in all her behaviour and whether it was from the delicacy of her constitution or that she was troubled with the vapours as i was afterwards told by one who i found was none of her wellwishers she changed colour and startled at everything she heard she was likewise as i afterwards found a greater valetudinarian than any i had ever met with even in her own sex and subject to such momentary consumptions that in the twinkling of an eye she would fall away from the most florid complexion and the most healthful state of body and wither into a skeleton her recoveries were often as sudden as her decays insomuch that she would revive in a moment out of a wasting distemper into a habit of the highest health and vigour  i had very soon an opportunity of observing these quick turns and changes in her constitution there sat at her feet a couple of secretaries who received every hour letters from all parts of the world which the one or the other of them was perpetually reading to her and according to the news she heard to which she was exceedingly attentive she changed colour and discovered many symptoms of health or sickness  behind the throne was a prodigious heap of bags of mony which were piled upon one another so high that they touched the ceiling the floor on her right hand and on her left was covered with vast sums of gold that rose up in pyramids on either side of her but this i did not so much wonder at when i heard upon enquiry that she had the same virtue in her touch which the poets tell us a lydian king was formerly possessed of and that she could convert whatever she pleased into that precious metal  after a little dizziness and confused hurry of thought which a man often meets with in a dream methoughts the hall was alarmd the doors flew open and there entered half a dozen of the most hideous phantoms that i had ever seen even in a dream before that time they came in two by two though matchd in the most dissociable manner and mingled together in a kind of dance it would be tedious to describe their habits and persons for which reason i shall only inform my reader that the first couple were tyranny and anarchy the second were bigotry and atheism the third the genius of a commonwealth and a young man of about twentytwo years of age  whose name i could not learn he had a sword in his right hand which in the dance he often brandished at the act of settlement and a citizen who stood by me whispered in my ear that he saw a spunge in his left hand the dance of so many jarring natures put me in mind of the sun moon and earth in the rehearsal  that danced together for no other end but to eclipse one another  the reader will easily suppose by what has been before said that the lady on the throne would have been almost frightened to distraction had she seen but any one of these spectres what then must have been her condition when she saw them all in a body she fainted and dyed away at the sight et

former shrinking and falling into so many empty bags that i now found not above a tenth part of them had been filled with mony the rest that took up the same space and made the same figure as the bags that were really filled with mony had been blown up with air and called into my memory the bags full of wind which homer tells us his hero received as a present from æolus the great heaps of gold on either side of the throne now appeared to be only heaps of paper or little piles of notched sticks bound up together in bundles like bathfaggots  whilst i was lamenting this sudden desolation that had been made before me the whole scene vanished in the room of the frightful spectres there now entered a second dance of apparitions very agreeably matched together and made up of very amiable phantoms the first pair was liberty with monarchy at her right hand the second was moderation leading in religion and the third a person whom i had never seen  with the genius of great britain at their first entrance the lady revivd the bags swelld to their former bulk the piles of faggots and heaps of paper changed into pyramids of guineas  and for my own part i was so transported with joy that i awaked

barred the unconstitutional exercise of a dispensing power by the king and kept the settlement of its faith out of the hands of the clergy and in those of the people it was so contrived also according

nothing to think of but his performances with a good share of this vanity in my heart i made it my business these three days to listen after my own fame and as i have sometimes met with circumstances which did not displease me i have been encountered by others which gave me much mortification it is incredible to think how empty i have in this time observed some part of the species to be what mere blanks they are when they first come abroad in the morning how utterly they are at a stand until they are set a going by some paragraph in a newspaper such persons are very acceptable to a young author for they desire no more in anything but to be new to be agreeable if i found consolation among such i was as much disquieted by the incapacity of others these are mortals who have a certain curiosity without power of reflection and perused my papers like spectators rather than readers but there is so little pleasure in enquiries that so nearly concern our selves it being the worst way in the world to fame to be too anxious about it that upon the whole i resolvd for the future to go on in my ordinary way and without too much fear or hope about the business of reputation to be very careful of the design of my actions but very negligent of the consequences of them  it is an endless and frivolous pursuit to act by any other rule than the care of satisfying our own minds in what we do one would think a silent man who concerned himself with no one breathing should be very liable to misinterpretations and yet i remember i was once taken up for a jesuit for no other reason but my profound taciturnity it is from this misfortune that to be out of harms way i have ever since affected crowds he who comes into assemblies only to gratify his curiosity and not to make a figure enjoys the pleasures of retirement in a more exquisite degree than he possibly could in his closet the lover the ambitious and the miser are followed thither by a worse crowd than any they can withdraw from to be exempt from the passions with which others are tormented is the only pleasing solitude i can very justly say with the antient sage i am never less alone than when alone as i am insignificant to the company in publick places and as it is visible i do not come thither as most do to shew my self i gratify the vanity of all who pretend to make an appearance and often have as kind looks from welldressed gentlemen and ladies as a poet would bestow upon one of his audience there are so many gratifications attend this publick sort of obscurity that some little distastes i daily receive have lost their anguish and i did the other day  without the least displeasure overhear one say of me that strange fellow and another answer i have known the fellows face for these twelve years and so must you but i believe you are the first ever asked who he was there are i must confess many to whom my person is as well known as that of their nearest relations who give themselves no further trouble about calling me by my name or quality but speak of me very currently by mr whatdyecallhim  to make up for these trivial disadvantages i have the high satisfaction of beholding all nature with an unprejudiced eye and having nothing to do with mens passions or interests i can with the greater sagacity consider their talents manners failings and merits  it is remarkable that those who want any one sense possess the others with greater force and vivacity thus my want of or rather resignation of speech gives me all the advantages of a dumb man i have methinks a more than ordinary penetration in seeing and flatter my self that i have looked into the highest and lowest of mankind and make shrewd guesses without being admitted to their conversation at the inmost thoughts and reflections of all whom i behold it is from hence that good or ill fortune has no manner of force towards affecting my judgment i see men flourishing in courts and languishing in jayls without being prejudiced from their circumstances to their favour or disadvantage but from their inward manner of bearing their condition often pity the prosperous and admire the unhappy  those who converse with the dumb know from the turn of their eyes and the changes of their countenance their sentiments of the objects before them i have indulged my silence to such an extravagance that the few who are intimate with me answer my smiles with concurrent sentences and argue to the very point i shakd my head at without my speaking will honeycomb was very entertaining the other night at a play to a gentleman who sat on his right hand while i was at his left the gentleman believed will was talking to himself when upon my looking with great approbation at a young thing  in a box before us he said i am quite of another opinion she has i will allow a very pleasing aspect but methinks that simplicity in her countenance is rather childish than innocent when i observed her a second time he said i grant her dress is very becoming but perhaps the merit of choice is owing to her mother for though continued he i allow a beauty to be as much to be commended for the elegance of her dress as a wit for that of his language yet if she has stolen the colour of her ribbands from another or had advice about her trimmings i shall not allow her the praise of dress any more than i would call a plagiary an author when i threw my eye towards the next woman to her will spoke what i looked according to his romantic imagination in the following manner behold you who dare that charming virgin behold the beauty of her person chastised by the innocence of her thoughts chastity goodnature and affability are the graces that play in her countenance she knows she is handsome but she knows she is good conscious beauty adorned with conscious virtue what a spirit is there in those eyes what a bloom in that person how is the whole woman expressed in her appearance her air has the beauty of motion and her look the force of language it was prudence to turn away my eyes from this object and therefore i turned them to the thoughtless creatures who make up the lump of that sex and move a knowing eye no more than the portraitures of insignificant people by ordinary painters which are but pictures of pictures  thus the working of my own mind is the general entertainment of my life i never enter into the commerce of discourse with any but my particular friends and not in publick even with them such an habit has perhaps raised in me uncommon reflections but this effect i cannot communicate but by my writings as my pleasures are almost wholly confined to those of the sight i take it for a peculiar happiness that i have always had an easy and familiar admittance to the fair sex if i never praised or flattered i never belyed or contradicted them as these compose half the world and are by the just complaisance and gallantry of our nation the more powerful part of our people i shall dedicate a considerable share of these my speculations to their service and shall lead the young through all the becoming duties of virginity marriage and widowhood when it is a womans day in my works i shall endeavour at a stile and air suitable to their understanding when i say this i must be understood to mean that i shall not lower but exalt the subjects i treat upon discourse for their entertainment is not to be debased but refined a man may appear learned without talking sentences as in his ordinary gesture he discovers he can dance tho he does not cut capers in a word i shall take it for the greatest glory of my work if among reasonable women this paper may furnish teatable talk in order to it i shall treat on matters which relate to females as they are concernd to approach or fly from the other sex or as they are tyed to them by blood interest or affection upon this occasion i think it but reasonable to declare that whatever skill i may have in speculation i shall never betray what the eyes of lovers say to each other in my presence at the same time i shall not think my self obliged by this promise to conceal any false protestations which i observe made by glances in publick assemblies but endeavour to make both sexes appear in their conduct what they are in their hearts by this means love during the time of my speculations shall be carried on with the same sincerity as any other affair of less consideration as this is the greatest concern men shall be from henceforth liable to the greatest reproach for misbehaviour in it falsehood in love shall hereafter bear a blacker aspect than

be allowed to be extravagantly lavish in its decorations as its only design is to gratify the senses and keep up an indolent attention in the audience common sense however requires that there should be nothing in the scenes and machines which may appear childish and absurd how would the wits of king charless time have laughed to have seen nicolini exposed to a tempest in robes of ermin and sailing in an open boat upon a sea of pasteboard what a field of raillery would they have been let into had they been entertaind with painted dragons spitting wildfire enchanted chariots drawn by flanders mares and real cascades in artificial landskips a little skill in criticism would inform us that shadows and realities ought not to be mixd together in the same piece and that scenes which are designed as the representations of nature should be filled with resemblances and not with the things themselves if one would represent a wide champain country filled with herds and flocks it would be ridiculous to draw the country only upon the scenes and to crowd several parts of the stage with sheep and oxen this is joining together inconsistencies and making the decoration partly real and partly imaginary i would recommend what i have here said to the directors as well as to the admirers of our modern opera  as i was walking in the streets about a fortnight ago i saw an ordinary fellow carrying a cage full of little birds upon his shoulder and as i was wondering with my self what use he would put them to he was met very luckily by an acquaintance who had the same curiosity upon his asking him what he had upon his shoulder he told him that he had been buying sparrows for the opera sparrows for the opera says his friend licking his lips what are they to be roasted no no says the other they are to enter towards the end of the first act and to fly about the stage  this strange dialogue awakened my curiosity so far that i immediately bought the opera by which means i perceived the sparrows were to act the part of singing birds in a delightful grove though upon a nearer enquiry i found the sparrows put the same trick upon the audience that sir martin marall  practised upon his mistress for though they flew in sight the musick proceeded from a consort of flagellets and birdcalls which was planted behind the scenes at the same time i made this discovery i found by the discourse of the actors that there were great designs on foot for the improvement of the opera that it had been proposed to break down a part of the wall and to surprize the audience with a party of an hundred horse and that there was actually a project of bringing the new river into the house to be employed in jetteaus and waterworks this project as i have since heard is postponed till the summerseason when it is thought the coolness that proceeds from fountains and cascades will be more acceptable and refreshing to people of quality in the mean time to find out a more agreeable entertainment for the winterseason the opera of rinaldo  is filled with thunder and lightning illuminations and fireworks which the audience may look upon without catching cold and indeed without much danger of being burnt for there are several engines filled with water and ready to play at a minutes warning in case any such accident should happen however as i have a very great friendship for the owner of this theater i hope that he has been wise enough to insure his house before he would let this opera be acted in it  it is no wonder that those scenes should be very surprizing which were contrived by two poets of different nations and raised by two magicians of different sexes armida as we are told in the argument was an amazonian enchantress and poor seignior cassani as we learn from the persons represented a christian conjuror mago christiano i must confess i am very much puzzled to find how an amazon should be versed in the black art or how a good christian for such is the part of the magician should deal with the devil  to consider the poets after the conjurers i shall give you a taste of the italian from the first lines of his preface eccoti benigno lettore un parto di poche sere che se ben nato di notte non è però aborto di tenebre mà si farà conoscere figlio dapollo con qualche raggio di parnasso  behold gentle reader the birth of a few evenings which tho it be the offspring of the night is not the abortive of darkness but will make it self known to be the son of apollo with a certain ray of parnassus he afterwards proceeds to call minheer hendel  the orpheus of our age and to acquaint us in the same sublimity of stile that he composed this opera in a fortnight such are the wits to whose tastes we so ambitiously conform our selves the truth of it is the finest writers among the modern italians express themselves in such a florid form of words and such tedious circumlocutions as are used by none but pedants in our own country and at the same time fill their writings with such poor imaginations and conceits as our youths are ashamed of before they have been two years at the university some may be apt to think that it is the difference of genius which produces this difference in the works of the two nations but to show there is nothing in this if we look into the writings of the old italians such as cicero and virgil we shall find that the english writers in their way of thinking and expressing themselves resemble those authors much more than the modern italians pretend to do and as for the poet himself from whom the dreams of this opera are taken i must entirely agree with monsieur boileau that one verse in virgil is worth all the clincant or tinsel of tasso  but to return to the sparrows there have been so many flights of them let loose in this opera that it is feared the house will never get rid of them and that in other plays they may make their entrance in very wrong and improper scenes so as to be seen flying in a ladys bedchamber or perching upon a kings throne besides the inconveniences which the heads of the audience may sometimes suffer from them i am credibly informed that there was once a design of casting into an opera the story of whittington and his cat and that in order to it there had been got together a great quantity of mice but mr rich the proprietor of the playhouse very prudently considered that it would be impossible for the cat to kill them all and that consequently the princes of his stage might be as much infested with mice as the prince of the island was before the cats arrival upon it for which reason he would not permit it to be acted in his house and indeed i cannot blame him for as he said very well upon that occasion i do not hear that any of the performers in our opera pretend to equal the famous pied piper who made all the mice of a great town in germany  follow his musick and by that means cleared the place of those little noxious animals  before i dismiss this paper i must inform my reader that i hear there is a treaty on foot with london and wise  who will be appointed gardeners of the playhouse to furnish the opera of rinaldo and armida with an orangegrove and that the next time it is acted the singing birds will be personated by tomtits the undertakers being resolved to spare neither pains nor mony for the gratification of the audience  c      footnote

there is no one vice more common it has diffusd itself through both sexes and all qualities of mankind and there is hardly that person to be found who is not more concerned for the reputation of wit and sense than honesty and virtue but this unhappy affectation of being wise rather than honest witty than goodnaturd is the source of most of the ill habits of life such false impressions are owing to the abandond writings of men of wit and the awkward imitation of the rest of mankind  for this reason sir roger was saying last night that he was of opinion that none but men of fine parts deserve to be hanged the reflections of such men are so delicate upon all occurrences which they are concernd in that they should be exposd to more than ordinary infamy and punishment for offending against such quick admonitions as their own souls give them and blunting the fine edge of their minds in such a manner that they are no more shockd at vice and folly than men of slower capacities there is no greater monster in being than a very ill man of great parts he lives like a man in a palsy with one side of him dead while perhaps he enjoys the satisfaction of luxury of wealth of ambition he has lost the taste of goodwill of friendship of innocence scarecrow the beggar in lincolnsinnfields who disabled himself in his right leg and asks alms all day to get himself a warm supper and a trull at night is not half so despicable a wretch as such a man of sense the beggar has no relish above sensations he finds rest more agreeable than motion and while he has a warm fire and his doxy never reflects that he deserves to be whipped every man who terminates his satisfaction and enjoyments within the supply of his own necessities and passions is says sir roger in my eye as poor a rogue as scarecrow but continued he for the loss of publick and private virtue we are beholden to your men of parts forsooth it is with them no matter what is done so it is done with an air but to me who am so whimsical in a corrupt age as to act according to nature and reason a selfish man in the most shining circumstance and equipage appears in the same condition with the fellow abovementioned but more contemptible in proportion to what more he robs the publick of and enjoys above him i lay it down therefore for a rule that the whole man is to move together that every action of any importance is to have a prospect of publick good and that the general tendency of our indifferent actions ought to be agreeable to the dictates of reason of religion of good breeding without this a man as i have before hinted is hopping instead of walking he is not in his entire and proper motion  while the honest knight was thus bewildering himself in good starts i lookd intentively upon him which made him i thought collect his mind a little what i aim at says he is to represent that i am of opinion to polish our understandings and neglect our manners is of all things the most inexcusable reason should govern passion but instead of that you see it is often subservient to it and as unaccountable as one would think it a wise man is not always a good man this degeneracy is not only the guilt of particular persons but also at some times of a whole people and perhaps it may appear upon examination that the most polite ages are the least virtuous this may be attributed to the folly of admitting wit and learning as merit in themselves without considering the application of them by this means it becomes a rule not so much to regard what we do as how we do it but this false beauty will not pass upon men of honest minds and true taste sir richard blackmore says with as much good sense as virtue it is a mighty dishonour and shame to employ excellent faculties and abundance of wit to humour and please men in their vices and follies the great enemy of mankind notwithstanding his wit and angelick faculties is the most odious being in the whole creation he goes on soon after to say very generously that he undertook the writing of his poem to rescue the muses out of the hands of ravishers to restore them to their sweet and chaste mansions and to engage them in an employment suitable to their dignity  this certainly ought to be the purpose of every man who appears in publick and whoever does not proceed upon that foundation injures his country as fast as he succeeds in his studies when modesty ceases to be the chief ornament of one sex and integrity of the other society is upon a wrong basis and we shall be ever after without rules to guide our judgment in what is really becoming and ornamental nature and reason direct one thing passion and humour another to follow the dictates of the two latter is going into a road that is both endless and intricate when we pursue the other our passage is delightful and what we aim at easily attainable  i do not doubt but england is at present as polite a nation as any in the world but any man who thinks can easily see that the affectation of being gay and in fashion has very near eaten up our good sense and our religion is there anything so just as that mode and gallantry should be built upon exerting ourselves in what is proper and agreeable to the institutions of justice and piety among us and yet is there anything more common than that we run in perfect contradiction to them all which is supported by no other pretension than that it is done with what we call a good grace  nothing ought to be held laudable or becoming but what nature it self should prompt us to think so respect to all kind of superiours is founded methinks upon instinct and yet what is so ridiculous as age i make this abrupt transition to the mention of this vice more than any other in order to introduce a little story which i think a pretty instance that the most polite age is in danger of being the most vicious it happend at athens during a publick representation of some play exhibited in honour of the commonwealth that an old gentleman came too late for a place suitable to his age and quality many of the young gentlemen who observed the difficulty and confusion he was in made signs to him that they would accommodate him if he came where they sate the good man bustled through the crowd accordingly but when he came to the seats to which he was invited the jest was to sit close and expose him as he stood out of countenance to the whole audience the frolick went round all the athenian benches but on those occasions there were also particular places assigned for foreigners when the good man skulked towards the boxes appointed for the lacedemonians that honest people more virtuous than polite rose up all to a man and with the greatest respect received him among them the athenians being suddenly touched with a sense of the spartan virtue and their own degeneracy gave a thunder of applause and the old man cryd out the athenians understand what is good but the lacedemonians practise it r      footnote

dejected upon asking him the occasion of it he told me that his wife had dreamt a strange dream the night before which they were afraid portended some misfortune to themselves or to their children at her coming into the room i observed a settled melancholy in her countenance which i should have been troubled for had i not heard from whence it proceeded we were no sooner sat down but after having looked upon me a little while my dear says she turning to her husband you may now see the stranger that was in the candle last night soon after this as they began to talk of family affairs a little boy at the lower end of the table told her that he was to go into joinhand on thursday thursday says she no child if it please god you shall not begin upon childermasday tell your writingmaster that friday will be soon enough i was reflecting with my self on the odness of her fancy and wondering that any body would establish it as a rule to lose a day in every week in the midst of these my musings she desired me to reach her a little salt upon the point of my knife which i did in such a trepidation and hurry of obedience that i let it drop by the way at which she immediately startled and said it fell towards her upon this i looked very blank and observing the concern of the whole table began to consider my self with some confusion as a person that had brought a disaster upon the family the lady however recovering her self after a little space said to her husband with a sigh my dear misfortunes never come single my friend i found acted but an under part at his table and being a man of more goodnature than understanding thinks himself obliged to fall in with all the passions and humours of his yokefellow do not you remember child says she that the pidgeonhouse fell the very afternoon that our careless wench spilt the salt upon the table  yes says he my dear and the next post brought us an account of the battel of almanza  the reader may guess at the figure i made after having done all this mischief i dispatched my dinner as soon as i could with my usual taciturnity when to my utter confusion the lady seeing me quitting  my knife and fork and laying them across one another upon my plate desired me that i would humour her so far as to take them out of that figure and place them side by side what the absurdity was which i had committed i did not know but i suppose there was some traditionary superstition in it and therefore in obedience to the lady of the house i disposed of my knife and fork in two parallel lines which is the figure i shall always lay them in for the future though i do not know any reason for it  it is not difficult for a man to see that a person has conceived an aversion to him for my own part i quickly found by the ladys looks that she regarded me as a very odd kind of fellow with an unfortunate aspect for which reason i took my leave immediately after dinner and withdrew to my own lodgings upon my return home i fell into a profound contemplation on the evils that attend these superstitious follies of mankind how they subject us to imaginary afflictions and additional sorrows that do not properly come within our lot as if the natural calamities of life were not sufficient for it we turn the most indifferent circumstances into misfortunes and suffer as much from trifling accidents as from real evils i have known the shooting of a star spoil a nights rest and have seen a man in love grow pale and lose his appetite upon the plucking of a merrythought a screechowl at midnight has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers nay the voice of a cricket hath struck more terrour than the roaring of a lion there is nothing so inconsiderable which  may not appear dreadful to an imagination that is filled with omens and prognosticks a rusty nail or a crooked pin shoot up into prodigies  i remember i was once in a mixt assembly that was full of noise and mirth when on a sudden an old woman unluckily observed there were thirteen of us in company this remark struck a pannick terror into several who  were present insomuch that one or two of the ladies were going to leave the room but a friend of mine taking notice that one of our female companions was big with child affirmd there were fourteen in the room and that instead of portending one of the company should die it plainly foretold one of them should be born had not my friend found this expedient to break the omen i question not but half the women in the company would have fallen sick that very night  an old maid that is troubled with the vapours produces infinite disturbances of this kind among her friends and neighbours i know a maiden aunt of a great family who is one of these antiquated sybils that forebodes and prophesies from one end of the year to the other she is always seeing apparitions and hearing deathwatches and was the other day almost frighted out of her wits by the great housedog that howled in the stable at a time when she lay ill of the toothach such an extravagant cast of mind engages multitudes of people not only in impertinent terrors but in supernumerary duties of life and arises from that fear and ignorance which are natural to the soul of man the horrour with which we entertain the thoughts of death or indeed of any future evil and the uncertainty of its approach fill a melancholy mind with innumerable apprehensions and suspicions and consequently dispose it to the observation of such groundless prodigies and predictions for as it is the chief concern of wisemen to retrench the evils of life by the reasonings of philosophy it is the employment of fools to multiply them by the sentiments of superstition  for my own part i should be very much troubled were i endowed with this divining quality though it should inform me truly of every thing that can befall me i would not anticipate the relish of any happiness nor feel the weight of any misery before it actually arrives  i know but one way of fortifying my soul against these gloomy presages and terrours of mind and that is by securing to my self the friendship and protection of that being who disposes of events and governs futurity he sees at one view the whole thread of my existence not only that part of it which i have already passed through but that which runs forward into all the depths of eternity when i lay me down to sleep i recommend my self to his care when i awake i give my self up to his direction amidst all the evils that threaten me i will look up to him for help and question not but he will either avert them or turn them to my advantage though i know neither the time nor the manner of the death i am to die i am not at all sollicitous about it because i am sure that he knows them both and that he will not

have my correspondents in the remotest parts of the nation who send me up punctual accounts from time to time of all the little irregularities that fall under their notice in their several districts and divisions  i am no less acquainted with the particular quarters and regions of this great town than with the different parts and distributions of the whole nation i can describe every parish by its impieties and can tell you in which of our streets lewdness prevails which gaming has taken the possession of and where drunkenness has got the better of them both when i am disposed to raise a

masque which has of late been frequently held in one of the most conspicuous parts of the town and which i hear will be continued with additions and improvements as all the persons who compose this lawless assembly are masqued we dare not attack any of them in our way lest we should send a woman of quality to bridewell or a peer of greatbritain to the counter besides that their numbers are so very great that i am afraid they would be able to rout our whole fraternity tho we were accompanied with all our guard of constables both these reasons which secure them from our authority make them obnoxious to yours as both their disguise and their numbers will give no particular person reason to think himself affronted by you  if we are rightly informd the rules that are observed by this new society are wonderfully contrivd for the advancement of cuckoldom the women either come by themselves or are introduced by friends who are obliged to quit them upon their first entrance to the conversation of any body that addresses himself to them there are several rooms where the parties may retire and if they please show their faces by consent whispers squeezes nods and embraces are the innocent freedoms of the place in short the whole design of this libidinous assembly seems to terminate in assignations and intrigues and i hope you will take effectual methods by your publick advice

masquerade upon my first going in i was attacked by half a dozen female quakers who seemed willing to adopt me for a brother but upon a nearer examination i found they were a sisterhood of coquets disguised in that precise habit i was soon after taken out to dance and as i fancied by a woman of the first quality for she was very tall and moved gracefully as soon as the minuet was over we ogled one another through our masques and as i am very well read in waller i repeated to her the four following verses out of his poem to vandike the heedless lover does not know whose eyes they are that wound him so but confounded with thy art enquires her name that has his heart i pronounced these words with such a languishing air that i had some reason to conclude i had made a conquest she told me that she hoped my face was not akin to my tongue and looking upon her watch i accidentally discovered the figure of a coronet on the back part of it i was so transported with the thought of such an amour that i plied her from one room to another with all the gallantries i could invent and at length brought things to so happy an issue that she gave me a private meeting the next day without page or footman coach or equipage my heart danced in raptures but i had not lived in this golden dream above three days before i found good reason to wish that i had continued true to my landress i have since heard by a very great accident that this fine lady does not live far from coventgarden and that i am not the first cully whom she has passed herself upon for a countess  thus sir you see how i

which are commonly known by the name of clubs when a sett of men find themselves agree in any particular tho never so trivial they establish themselves into a kind of fraternity and meet once or twice a week upon the account of such a fantastickresemblance i know a considerable markettown in which there was a club of fatmen that did not come together as you may well suppose to entertain one another with sprightliness and wit but to keep one another in countenance the room where the club met was something of the largest and had two entrances the one by a door of a moderate size and the other by a pair of foldingdoors if a candidate for this corpulent club could make his entrance through the first he was looked upon as unqualified but if he stuck in the passage and could not force his way through it the foldingdoors were immediately thrown open for his reception and he was saluted as a brother i have heard that this club though it consisted but of fifteen persons weighed above three tun  in opposition to this society there sprung up another composed of scarecrows and skeletons who being very meagre and envious did all they could to thwart the designs of their bulky brethren whom they represented as men of dangerous principles till at length they worked them out of the favour of the people and consequently out of the magistracy these factions tore the corporation in pieces for several years till at length they came to this accommodation that the two bailiffs of the town should be annually chosen out of the two clubs by which means the principal magistrates are at this day coupled like rabbets one fat and one lean  every one has heard of the club or rather the confederacy of the kings this grand alliance was formed a little after the return of king charles the second and admitted into it men of all qualities and professions provided they agreed in this sirname of king which as they imagined sufficiently declared the owners of it to be altogether untainted with republican and antimonarchical principles  a christian name has likewise been often used as a badge of distinction and made the occasion of a club that of the georges which used to meet at the sign of the george on st georges day and swear before george is still fresh in every ones memory  there are at present in several parts of this city what they call streetclubs in which the chief inhabitants of the street converse together every night i remember upon my enquiring after lodgings in ormondstreet the landlord to recommend that quarter of the town told me there was at that time a very good club in it he also told me upon further discourse with him that two or three noisy country squires who were settled there the year before had considerably sunk the price of houserent and that the club to prevent the like inconveniencies for the future had thoughts of taking every house that became vacant into their own hands till they had found a tenant for it of a sociable nature and good conversation  the humdrum club of which i was formerly an unworthy member was made up of very honest gentlemen of peaceable dispositions that used to sit together smoak their pipes and say nothing till midnight the mum club as i am informed is an institution of the same nature and as great an enemy to noise  after these two innocent societies i cannot forbear mentioning a very mischievous one that was erected in the reign of king charles the second i mean the club of duellists in which none was to be admitted that had not fought his man the president of it was said to have killed half a dozen in single combat and as for the other members they took their seats according to the number of their slain there was likewise a sidetable for such as had only drawn blood and shown a laudable ambition of taking the first opportunity to qualify themselves for the first table this club consisting only of men of honour did not continue long most of the members of it being put to the sword or hanged a little after its institution  our modern celebrated clubs are founded upon eating and drinking which are points wherein most men agree and in which the learned and illiterate the dull and the airy the philosopher and the buffoon can all of them bear a part the kitcat  it self is said to have taken its original from a muttonpye the beefsteak  and october  clubs are neither of them averse to eating and drinking if we may form a judgment of them from their respective titles  when men are thus knit together by love of society not a spirit of faction and do not meet to censure or annoy those that are absent but to enjoy one another when they are thus combined for their own improvement or for the good of others or at least to relax themselves from the business of the day by an innocent and chearful conversation there may be something very useful in these little institutions and establishments  i cannot forbear concluding this paper with a scheme of laws that i met with upon a wall in a little alehouse how i came thither i may inform my reader at a more convenient time these laws were enacted by a knot of artizans and mechanicks who used to meet every night and as there is something in them which gives us a pretty picture of low life i shall transcribe them word for word rules to be observed in the twopenny club erected in this place for the preservation of friendship and good

these my papers and receiving my morning lectures with a becoming seriousness and attention my publisher tells me that there are already three thousand of them distributed every day so that if i allow twenty readers to every paper which i look upon as a modest computation i may reckon about threescore thousand disciples in london and westminster who i hope will take care to distinguish themselves from the thoughtless herd of their ignorant and unattentive brethren since i have raised to myself so great an audience i shall spare no pains to make their instruction agreeable and their diversion useful for which reasons i shall endeavour to enliven morality with wit and to temper wit with morality that my readers may if possible both ways find their account in the speculation of the day and to the end that their virtue and discretion may not be short transient intermitting starts of thought i have resolved to refresh their memories from day to day till i have recovered them out of that desperate state of vice and folly into which the age is fallen the mind that lies fallow but a single day sprouts up in follies that are only to be killed by a constant and assiduous culture it was said of socrates that he brought philosophy down from heaven to inhabit among men and i shall be ambitious to have it said of me that i have brought philosophy out of closets and libraries schools and colleges to dwell in clubs and assemblies at teatables and in coffeehouses  i would therefore in a very particular manner recommend these my speculations to all wellregulated families that set apart an hour in every morning for tea and bread and butter and would earnestly advise them for their good to order this paper to be punctually served up and to be looked upon as a part of the tea equipage

onesself than to hear what passes in muscovy or poland and to amuse our selves with such writings as tend to the wearing out of ignorance passion and prejudice than such as naturally conduce to inflame hatreds and make enmities irreconcileable  in the next place i would recommend this paper to the daily perusal of those gentlemen whom i cannot but consider as my good brothers and allies i mean the fraternity of spectators who live in the world without having any thing to do in it and either by the affluence of their fortunes or laziness of their dispositions have no other business with the rest of mankind but to look upon them under this class of men are comprehended all contemplative tradesmen titular physicians fellows of the royal society templers that are not given to be contentious and statesmen that are out of business in short every one that considers the world as a theatre and desires to form a right judgment of those who are the actors on it  there is another set of men that i must likewise lay a claim to whom i have lately called the blanks of society as being altogether unfurnishd with ideas till the business and conversation of the day has supplied them i have often considered these poor souls with an eye of great commiseration when i have heard them asking the first man they have met with whether there was any news stirring and by that means gathering together materials for thinking these needy persons do not know what to talk of till about twelve a clock in the morning for by that time they are pretty good judges of the weather know which way the wind sits and whether the dutch mail be come in as they lie at the mercy of the first man they meet and are grave or impertinent all the day long according to the notions which they have imbibed in the morning i would earnestly entreat them not to stir out of their chambers till they have read this paper and do promise them that i will daily instil into them such sound and wholesome sentiments as shall have a good effect on their conversation for the ensuing twelve hours  but there are none to whom this paper will be more useful than to the female world i have often thought there has not been sufficient pains taken in finding out proper employments and diversions for the fair ones their amusements seem contrived for them rather as they are women than as they are reasonable creatures and are more adapted to the sex than to the species the toilet is their great scene of business and the right adjusting of their hair the principal employment of their lives the sorting of a suit of ribbons is reckoned a very good mornings work and if they make an excursion to a mercers or a toyshop so great a fatigue makes them unfit for any thing else all the day after their more serious occupations are sowing and embroidery and their greatest drudgery the preparation of jellies and sweetmeats this i say is the state of ordinary women tho i know there are multitudes of those of a more elevated life and conversation that move in an exalted sphere of knowledge and virtue that join all the beauties of the mind to the ornaments of dress and inspire a kind of awe and respect as well as love into their malebeholders i hope to encrease the number of these by publishing this daily paper which i shall always endeavour to make an innocent if not an improving entertainment and by that means at least divert the minds of my female readers from greater trifles at the same time as i would fain give some finishing touches to those which are already the most beautiful pieces in humane nature i shall endeavour to point out all those imperfections that are the blemishes as well as those virtues which are the embellishments of the sex in the mean while i hope these my gentle readers who have so much time on their hands will not grudge throwing away a quarter of an hour in a day on this paper since they may do it without any hindrance to business  i know several of my friends and wellwishers are in great pain for me lest i should not be able to keep up the spirit of a paper which i oblige myself to furnish every day but to make them easy in this particular i will promise them faithfully to give it over as soon as i grow dull this i know will be matter of great raillery to the small wits who will frequently put me in mind of my promise desire me to keep my word assure me that it is high time to give over with many other little pleasantries of the like nature which men of a little smart genius cannot forbear throwing out against their best friends when they have such a

or infirmities of age and her conversation is so mixed with gaiety and prudence that she is agreeable both to the young and the old her behaviour is very frank without being in the least blameable and as she is out of the tract of any amorous or ambitious pursuits of her own her visitants entertain her with accounts of themselves very freely whether they concern their passions or their interests i made her a visit this afternoon having been formerly introduced to the honour of her acquaintance by my friend will honeycomb who has prevailed upon her to admit me sometimes into her assembly as a civil inoffensive man i found her accompanied with one person only a commonplace talker who upon my entrance rose and after a very slight civility sat down again then turning to arietta pursued his discourse which i found was upon the old topick of constancy in love he went on with great facility in repeating what he talks every day of his life and with the ornaments of insignificant laughs and gestures enforced his arguments by quotations out of plays and songs which allude to the perjuries of the fair and the general levity of women methought he strove to shine more than ordinarily in his talkative way that he might insult my silence and distinguish himself before a woman of ariettas taste and understanding she had often an inclination to interrupt him but could find no opportunity till the larum ceased of its self which it did not till he had repeated and murdered the celebrated story of the ephesian matron   arietta seemed to regard this piece of raillery as an outrage done to her sex as indeed i have always observed that women whether out of a nicer regard to their honour or what other reason i cannot tell are more sensibly touched with those general aspersions which are cast upon their sex than men are by what is said of theirs  when she had a little recovered her self from the serious anger she was in she replied in the following manner sir when i consider how perfectly new all you have said on this subject is and that the story you have given us is not quite two thousand years old i cannot but think it a piece of presumption to dispute with you but your quotations put me in mind of the fable of the lion and the man the man walking with that noble animal showed him in the ostentation of human superiority a sign of a man killing a lion upon which the lion said very justly we lions are none of us painters else we could show a hundred men killed by lions for one lion killed by a man you men are writers and can represent us women as unbecoming as you please in your works while we are unable to return the injury you have twice or thrice observed in your discourse that hypocrisy is the very foundation of our education and that an ability to dissemble our affections is a professed part of our breeding these and such other reflections are sprinkled up and down the writings of all ages by authors who leave behind them memorials of their resentment against the scorn of particular women in invectives against the whole sex such a writer i doubt not was the celebrated petronius who invented the pleasant aggravations of the frailty of the ephesian lady but when we consider this question between the sexes which has been either a point of dispute or raillery ever since there were men and women let us take facts from plain people and from such as have not either ambition or capacity to embellish their narrations with any beauties of imagination i was the other day amusing myself with ligons account of barbadoes and in answer to your wellwrought tale i will give you as it dwells upon my memory out of that honest traveller in his fifty fifth page the history of inkle and yarico   mr thomas inkle of london aged twenty years embarked in the downs on the good ship called the achilles bound for the west indies on the   th of june      in order to improve his fortune by trade and merchandize our adventurer was the third son of an eminent citizen who had taken particular care to instill into his mind an early love of gain by making him a perfect master of numbers and consequently giving him a quick view of loss and advantage and preventing the natural impulses of his passions by prepossession towards his interests with a mind thus turned young inkle had a person every way agreeable a ruddy vigour in his countenance strength in his limbs with ringlets of fair hair loosely flowing on his shoulders it happened in the course of the voyage that the achilles in some distress put into a creek on the main of america in search of provisions the youth who is the hero of my story among others went ashore on this occasion from their first landing they were observed by a party of indians who hid themselves in the woods for that purpose the english unadvisedly marched a great distance from the shore into the country and were intercepted by the natives who slew the greatest number of them our adventurer escaped among others by flying into a forest upon his coming into a remote and pathless part of the wood he threw himself tired and breathless on a little hillock when an indian maid rushed from a thicket behind him after the first surprize they appeared mutually agreeable to each other if the european was highly charmed with the limbs features and wild graces of the naked american the american was no less taken with the dress complexion and shape of an european covered from head to foot the indian grew immediately enamoured of him and consequently sollicitous for his preservation she therefore conveyed him to a cave where she gave him a delicious repast of fruits and led him to a stream to slake his thirst in the midst of these good offices she would sometimes play with his hair and delight in the opposition of its colour to that of her fingers then open his bosome then laugh at him for covering it she was it seems a person of distinction for she every day came to him in a different dress of the most beautiful shells bugles and bredes she likewise brought him a great many spoils which her other lovers had presented to her so that his cave was richly adorned with all the spotted skins of beasts and most partycoloured feathers of fowls which that world afforded to make his confinement more tolerable she would carry him in the dusk of the evening or by the favour of moonlight to unfrequented groves and solitudes and show him where to lye down in safety and sleep amidst the falls of waters and melody of nightingales her part was to watch and hold him in her arms for fear of her countrymen and wake on occasions to consult his safety in this manner did the lovers pass away their time till they had learnd a language of their own in which the voyager communicated to his mistress how happy he should be to have her in his country where she should be cloathed in such silks as his wastecoat was made of and be carried in houses drawn by horses without being exposed to wind or weather all this he promised her the enjoyment of without such fears and alarms as they were there tormented with in this tender correspondence these lovers lived for several months when yarico instructed by her lover discovered a vessel on the coast to which she made signals and in the night with the utmost joy and satisfaction accompanied him to a shipscrew of his countrymen bound for barbadoes when a vessel from the main arrives in that island it seems the planters come down to the shoar where there is an immediate market of the indians and other slaves as with us of horses and oxen  to be short mr thomas inkle now coming into english territories began seriously to reflect upon his loss of time and to weigh with himself how many days interest of his mony he had lost during his stay with yarico this thought made the young man very pensive and careful what account he should be able to give his friends of his voyage upon which considerations the prudent and frugal young man sold yarico to a barbadian merchant notwithstanding that the poor girl to incline him to commiserate her condition told him that she was with child by him but he only made use of that information to rise in his demands upon the purchaser i was so touchd with this story which i think should be always a counterpart to the ephesian matron that i left the room with tears in my eyes

clothes mr ligon says this indian dwelling near the sea coast upon the main an english ship put in to a bay and sent some of her men a shoar to try what victuals or water they could find for in some distress they were but the indians perceiving them to go up so far into the country as they were sure they could not make a safe retreat intercepted them in their return and fell upon them chasing them into a wood and being dispersed there some were taken and some killd but a young man amongst them straggling from the rest was met by this indian maid who upon the first sight fell in love with him and hid him close from her countrymen the indians in a cave and there fed him till they could safely go down to the shoar where the ship lay at anchor expecting the return of their friends but at last seeing them upon the shoar sent the longboat for them took them aboard and brought them away but the youth when he came ashoar in the barbadoes forgot the kindness of the poor maid that had

officious landlady that would be asking every morning how i had slept i then fell into an honest family and lived very happily for above a week when my landlord who was a jolly goodnaturd man took it into his head that i wanted company and therefore would frequently come into my chamber to keep me from being alone this i bore for two or three days but telling me one day that he was afraid i was melancholy i thought it was high time for me to be gone and accordingly took new lodgings that very night about a week after i found my jolly landlord who as i said before was an honest hearty man had put me into an advertisement of the daily courant in the following words whereas a melancholy man left his lodgings on thursday last in the afternoon and was afterwards seen going towards islington if any one can give notice of him to r b fishmonger in the strand he shall be very well rewarded for his pains as i am the best man in the world to keep my own counsel and my landlord the fishmonger not knowing my name this accident of my life was never discovered to this very day  i am now settled with a widowwoman who has a great many children and complies with my humour in everything i do not remember that we have exchangd a word together these five years my coffee comes into my chamber every morning without asking for it if i want fire i point to my chimney if water to my bason upon which my landlady nods as much as to say she takes my meaning and immediately obeys my signals she has likewise modeld her family so well that when her little boy offers to pull me by the coat or prattle in my face his eldest sister immediately calls him off and bids him not disturb the gentleman at my first entering into the family i was troubled with the civility of their rising up to me every time i came into the room but my landlady observing that upon these occasions i always cried pish and went out again has forbidden any such ceremony to be used in the house so that at present i walk into the kitchin or parlour without being taken notice of or giving any interruption to the business or discourse of the family the maid will ask her mistress tho i am by whether the gentleman is ready to go to dinner as the mistress who is indeed an excellent housewife scolds at the servants as heartily before my face as behind my back in short i move up and down the house and enter into all companies with the same liberty as a cat or any other domestick animal and am as little suspected of telling anything that i hear or see  i remember last winter there were several young girls of the neighbourhood sitting about the fire with my landladys daughters and telling stories of spirits and apparitions upon my opening the door the young women broke off their discourse but my landladys daughters telling them that it was no body but the gentleman for that is the name which i go by in the neighbourhood as well as in the family they went on without minding me i seated myself by the candle that stood on a table at one end of the room and pretending to read a book that i took out of my pocket heard several dreadful stories of ghosts as pale as ashes that had stood at the feet of a bed or walked over a churchyard by moonlight and of others that had been conjured into the redsea for disturbing peoples rest and drawing their curtains at midnight with many other old womens fables of the like nature as one spirit raised another i observed that at the end of every story the whole company closed their ranks and crouded about the fire i took notice in particular of a little boy who was so attentive to every story that i am mistaken if he ventures to go to bed by himself this twelvemonth indeed they talked so long that the imaginations of the whole assembly were manifestly crazed and i am sure will be the worse for it as long as they live i heard one of the girls that had looked upon me over her shoulder asking the company how long i had been in the room and whether i did not look paler than i used to do this put me under some apprehensions that i should be forced to explain my self if i did not retire for which reason i took the candle in my hand and went up into my chamber not without wondering at this unaccountable weakness in reasonable creatures that they should  love to astonish and terrify one another  were i a father i should take a particular care to preserve my children from these little horrours of imagination which they are apt to contract when they are young and are not able to shake off when they are in years i have known a soldier that has enterd a breach affrighted at his own shadow and look pale upon a little scratching at his door who the day before had marchd up against a battery of cannon there are instances of persons who have been terrifyd even to distraction at the figure of a tree or the shaking of a bullrush the truth of it is i look upon a sound imagination as the greatest blessing of life next to a clear judgment and a good conscience in the mean time since there are very few whose minds are not more or less subject to these dreadful thoughts and apprehensions we ought to arm our selves against them by the dictates of reason and religion to pull the old woman out of our hearts as persius expresses it in the motto of my paper and extinguish those impertinent notions which we imbibed at a time that we were not able to judge of their absurdity or if we believe as many wise and good men have done that there are such phantoms and apparitions as those i have been speaking of let us endeavour to establish to our selves an interest in him who holds the reins of the whole creation in his hand and moderates them after such a manner that it is impossible for one being to break loose upon another without his knowledge and permission  for my own part i am apt to join in opinion with those who believe that all the regions of nature swarm with spirits and that we have multitudes of spectators on all our actions when we think our selves most alone but instead of terrifying my self with such a notion i am wonderfully pleased to think that i am always engaged with such an innumerable society in

tu leo qualis eris  mart   there is nothing that of late years has afforded matter of greater amusement to the town than signior nicolinis combat with a lion in the haymarket  which has been very often exhibited to the general satisfaction of most of the nobility and gentry in the kingdom of great britain upon the first rumour of this intended combat it was confidently affirmed and is still believed by many in both galleries that there would be a tame lion sent from the tower every opera night in order to be killed by hydaspes this report tho altogether groundless so universally prevailed in the upper regions of the playhouse that some of the most refined politicians in those parts of the audience gave it out in whisper that the lion was a cousingerman of the tyger who made his appearance in king williams days and that the stage would be supplied with lions at the public expence during the whole session many likewise were the conjectures of the treatment which this lion was to meet with from the hands of signior nicolini some supposed that he was to subdue him in recitativo as orpheus used to serve the wild beasts in his time and afterwards to knock him on the head some fancied that the lion would not pretend to lay his paws upon the hero by reason of the received opinion that a lion will not hurt a virgin several who pretended to have seen the opera in italy had informed their friends that the lion was to act a part in high dutch and roar twice or thrice to a thorough base before he fell at the feet of hydaspes to clear up a matter that was so variously reported i have made it my business to examine whether this pretended lion is really the savage he appears to be or only a counterfeit  but before i communicate my discoveries i must acquaint the reader that upon my walking behind the scenes last winter as i was thinking on something else i accidentally jostled against a monstrous animal that extreamly startled me and upon my nearer survey of it appeared to be a lionrampant the lion seeing me very much surprized told me in a gentle voice that i might come by him if i pleased for says he i do not intend to hurt anybody i thanked him very kindly and passed by him and in a little time after saw him leap upon the stage and act his part with very great applause it has been observed by several that the lion has changed his manner of acting twice or thrice since his first appearance which will not seem strange when i acquaint my reader that the lion has been changed upon the audience three several times the first lion was a candlesnuffer who being a fellow of a testy cholerick temper overdid his part and would not suffer himself to be killed so easily as he ought to have done besides it was observd of him that he grew more surly every time he came out of the lion and having dropt some words in ordinary conversation as if he had not fought his best and that he suffered himself to be thrown upon his back in the scuffle and that he would wrestle with mr nicolini for what he pleased out of his lions skin it was thought proper to discard him and it is verily believed to this day that had he been brought upon the stage another time he would certainly have done mischief besides it was objected against the first lion that he reared himself so high upon his hinder paws and walked in so erect a posture that he looked more like an old man than a lion the second lion was a taylor by trade who belonged to the playhouse and had the character of a mild and peaceable man in his profession if the former was too furious this was too sheepish for his part insomuch that after a short modest walk upon the stage he would fall at the first touch of hydaspes without grappling with him and giving him an opportunity of showing his variety of italian tripps it is said indeed that he once gave him a ripp in his fleshcolour doublet but this was only to make work for himself in his private character of a taylor i must not omit that it was this second lion who  treated me with so much humanity behind the scenes the acting lion at present is as i am informed a country gentleman who does it for his diversion but desires his name may be concealed he says very handsomely in his own excuse that he does not act for gain that he indulges an innocent pleasure in it and that it is better to pass away an evening in this manner than in gaming and drinking but at the same time says with a very agreeable raillery upon himself that if his name should be known the illnatured world might call him the ass in the lions skin this gentlemans temper is made out of such a happy mixture of the mild and the cholerick that he outdoes both his predecessors and has drawn together greater audiences than have been known in the memory of man  i must not conclude my narrative without taking notice of a groundless report that has been raised to a gentlemans disadvantage of whom i must declare my self an admirer namely that signior nicolini and the lion have been seen sitting peaceably by one another and smoking a pipe together behind the scenes by which their common enemies would insinuate it is but a sham combat which they represent upon the stage but upon enquiry i find that if any such correspondence has passed between them it was not till the combat was over when the lion was to be looked upon as dead according to the received rules of the drama besides this is what is practised every day in westminsterhall where nothing is more usual than to see a couple of lawyers who have been rearing each other to pieces in the court embracing one another as soon as they are out of it  i would not be thought in any part of this relation to reflect upon signior nicolini who in acting this part only complies with the wretched taste of his audience he knows very well that the lion has many more admirers than himself as they say of the famous equestrian statue on the pontneuf at paris that more people go to see the horse than the king who sits upon it on the contrary it gives me a just indignation to see a person whose action gives new majesty to kings resolution to heroes and softness to lovers thus sinking from the greatness of his behaviour and degraded into the character of the london prentice i have often wished that our tragœdians would copy after this great master in action could they make the same use of their arms and legs and inform their faces with as significant looks and passions how glorious would an english tragedy appear with that action which is capable of giving a dignity to the forced thoughts cold conceits and unnatural expressions of an italian opera in the mean time i have related this combat of the lion to show what are at present the reigning entertainments of the politer part of great britain  audiences have often been reproached by writers for the coarseness of their taste but our present grievance does not seem to be the want of a good taste but of common sense  c      footnote     the famous neapolitan actor and singer cavalier nicolino grimaldi commonly called nicolini had made his first appearance in an opera called pyrrhus and demetrius which was the last attempt to combine english with italian his voice was a soprano but afterwards descended into a fine contralto and he seems to have been the finest actor of his day prices of seats at the opera were raised on his coming from  s  d to  0s for pit and boxes and from  0s  d to   s for boxes on the stage when this paper was written he had appeared also in a new opera on almahide and

that signior grimaldi and my self have a correspondence more friendly than is consistent with the valour of his character or the fierceness of mine i desire you would for your own sake forbear such intimations for the future and must say it is a great piece of illnature in you to show so great an esteem for a foreigner and to discourage a lyon that is your own countryman  i take notice of your fable of the lyon and man but am so equally concerned in that matter that i shall not be offended to which soever of the animals the superiority is given you have misrepresented me in saying that i am a countrygentleman who act only for my diversion whereas had i still the same woods to range in which i once had when i was a foxhunter i should not resign my manhood for a maintenance and assure you as low as my circumstances are at present i am so much a man of honour that i would scorn to be any beast for bread but a lyon  yours c  i had no sooner ended this than one of my landladys children brought me in several others with some of which i shall make up my present paper they all having a tendency to the same subject viz the elegance of our present diversions covent garden march     sir  i have been for twenty years undersexton of this parish of st pauls coventgarden and have not missed tolling in to prayers six times in all those years which office i have performed to my great satisfaction till this fortnight last past during which time i find my congregation take the warning of my bell morning and evening to go to a puppettshow set forth by one powell under the piazzas by this means i have not only lost my two customers whom i used to place for six pence a piece over against mrs rachel eyebright but mrs rachel herself is gone thither also there now appear among us none but a few ordinary people who come to church only to say their prayers so that i have no work worth speaking of but on sundays i have placed my son at the piazzas to acquaint the ladies that the bell rings for church and that it stands on the other side of the garden but they only laugh at the child  i desire you would lay this before all the world that i may not be made such a tool for the future and that punchinello may chuse hours less canonical as things are now mr powell has a full congregation while we have a very thin house which if you can remedy you will very much oblige  sir yours c  the following epistle i find is from the undertaker of the masquerade  sir  i have observed the rules of my masque so carefully in not enquiring into persons that i cannot tell whether you were one of the company or not last tuesday but if you were not and still design to come i desire you would for your own entertainment please to admonish the town that all persons indifferently are not fit for this sort of diversion i could wish sir you could make them understand that it is a kind of acting to go in masquerade and a man should be able to say or do things proper for the dress in which he appears we have now and then rakes in the habit of roman senators and grave politicians in the dress of rakes the misfortune of the thing is that people dress themselves in what they have a mind to be and not what they are fit for there is not a girl in the town but let her have her will in going to a masque and she shall dress as a shepherdess but let me beg of them to read the arcadia or some other good romance before they appear in any such character at my house the last day we presented every body was so rashly habited that when they came to speak to each other a nymph with a crook had not a word to say but in the pert stile of the pit bawdry and a man in the habit of a philosopher was speechless till an occasion offered of expressing himself in the refuse of the tyringrooms we had a judge that danced a minuet with a quaker for his partner while half a dozen harlequins stood by as spectators a turk drank me off two bottles of wine and a jew eat me up half a ham of bacon if i can bring my design to bear and make the maskers preserve their characters in my assemblies i hope you will allow there is a foundation laid for more elegant and improving gallantries than any the town at present affords and consequently that you will give your approbation to the endeavours of  sir your most obedient humble servant  i am very glad the following epistle obliges me to mention mr powell a second time in the same paper for indeed there cannot be too great encouragement given to his skill in motions provided he is under proper restrictions sir  the opera at the haymarket and that under the little piazza in coventgarden being at present the two leading diversions of the town and mr powell professing in his advertisements to set up whittington and his cat against rinaldo and armida my curiosity led me the beginning of last week to view both these performances and make my observations upon them  first therefore i cannot but observe that mr powell wisely forbearing to give his company a bill of fare beforehand every scene is new and unexpected whereas it is certain that the undertakers of the haymarket having raised too great an expectation in their printed opera very much disappointed their audience on the stage the king of jerusalem is obliged to come from the city on foot instead of being drawn in a triumphant chariot by white horses as my operabook had promised me and thus while i expected armidas dragons should rush forward towards argantes i found the hero was obliged to go to armida and hand her out of her coach we had also but a very short allowance of thunder and lightning tho i cannot in this place omit doing justice to the boy who had the direction of the two painted dragons and made them spit fire and smoke he flashd out his rosin in such just proportions and in such due time that i could not forbear conceiving hopes of his being one day a most excellent player i saw indeed but two things wanting to render his whole action compleat i mean the keeping his head a little lower and hiding his candle  i observe that mr powell and the undertakers had both the same thought and i think much about the same time of introducing animals on their several stages though indeed with very different success the sparrows and chaffinches at the haymarket fly as yet very irregularly over the stage and instead of perching on the trees and performing their parts these young actors either get into the galleries or put out the candles whereas mr powell has so well disciplined his pig that in the first scene he and punch dance a minuet together i am informed however that mr powell resolves to excell his adversaries in their own way and introduce larks in his next opera of susanna or innocence betrayed which will be exhibited next week with a pair of new elders   the moral of mr powells drama is violated i confess by punchs national reflections on the french and king harrys laying his leg upon his queens lap in too ludicrous a manner before so great an assembly  as to the mechanism and scenary every thing indeed was uniform and of a piece and the scenes were managed very dexterously which calls on me to take notice that at the haymarket the undertakers forgetting to change their sidescenes we were presented with a prospect of the ocean in the midst of a delightful grove and tho the gentlemen on the stage had very much contributed to the beauty of the grove by walking up and down between the trees i must own i was not a little astonished to see a welldressed young fellow in a fullbottomed wigg appear in the midst of the sea and without any visible concern taking snuff  i shall only observe one thing further in which both dramas agree which is that by the squeak of their voices the heroes of each are eunuchs and as the wit in both pieces are equal i must prefer the performance of mr powell because it is in our own language  i am c      footnote     masquerades took rank as a leading pleasure of the town under the

the splendid equipages and partycoloured habits of that fantastick nation i was one day in particular contemplating a lady that sate in a coach adorned with gilded cupids and finely painted with the loves of venus and adonis the coach was drawn by six milkwhite horses and loaden behind with the same number of powderd footmen just before the lady were a couple of beautiful pages that were stuck among the harness and by their gay dresses and smiling features looked like the elder brothers of the little boys that were carved and painted in every corner of the coach  the lady was the unfortunate cleanthe who afterwards gave an occasion to a pretty melancholy novel she had for several years received the addresses of a gentleman whom after a long and intimate acquaintance she forsook upon the account of this shining equipage which had been offered to her by one of great riches but a crazy constitution the circumstances in which i saw her were it seems the disguises only of a broken heart and a kind of pageantry to cover distress for in two months after she was carried to her grave with the same pomp and magnificence being sent thither partly by the loss of one lover and partly by the possession of another  i have often reflected with my self on this unaccountable humour in womankind of being smitten with every thing that is showy and superficial and on the numberless evils that befall the sex from this light fantastical disposition i my self remember a young lady that was very warmly sollicited by a couple of importunate rivals who for several months together did all they could to recommend themselves by complacency of behaviour and agreeableness of conversation at length when the competition was doubtful and the lady undetermined in her choice one of the young lovers very luckily bethought himself of adding a supernumerary lace to his liveries which had so good an effect that he married her the very week after  the usual conversation of ordinary women very much cherishes this natural weakness of being taken with outside and appearance talk of a newmarried couple and you immediately hear whether they keep their coach and six or eat in plate mention the name of an absent lady and it is ten to one but you learn something of her gown and petticoat a ball is a great help to discourse and a birthday furnishes conversation for a twelvemonth after a furbelow of precious stones an hat buttoned with a diamond a brocade waistcoat or petticoat are standing topicks in short they consider only the drapery of the species and never cast away a thought on those ornaments of the mind that make persons illustrious in themselves and useful to others when women are thus perpetually dazling one anothers imaginations and filling their heads with nothing but colours it is no wonder that they are more attentive to the superficial parts of life than the solid and substantial blessings of it a girl who has been trained up in this kind of conversation is in danger of every embroidered coat that comes in her way a pair of fringed gloves may be her ruin in a word lace and ribbons silver and gold galloons with the like glittering gewgaws are so many lures to women of weak minds or low educations and when artificially displayed are able to fetch down the most airy coquet from the wildest of her flights and rambles  true happiness is of a retired nature and an enemy to pomp and noise it arises in the first place from the enjoyment of ones self and in the next from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions it loves shade and solitude and naturally haunts groves and fountains fields and meadows in short it feels every thing it wants within itself and receives no addition from multitudes of witnesses and spectators on the contrary false happiness loves to be in a crowd and to draw the eyes of the world upon her she does not receive any satisfaction from the applauses which she gives her self but from the admiration which she raises in others she flourishes in courts and palaces theatres and assemblies and has no existence but when she is looked upon  aurelia tho a woman of great quality delights in the privacy of a country life and passes away a great part of her time in her own walks and gardens her husband who is her bosom friend and companion in her solitudes has been in love with her ever since he knew her they both abound with good sense consummate virtue and a mutual esteem and are a perpetual entertainment to one another their family is under so regular an œconomy in its hours of devotion and repast employment and diversion that it looks like a little commonwealth within it self they often go into company that they may return with the greater delight to one another and sometimes live in town not to enjoy it so properly as to grow weary of it that they may renew in themselves the relish of a country life by this means they are happy in each other beloved by their children adored by their servants and are become the envy or rather the delight of all that know them  how different to this is the life of fulvia she considers her husband as her steward and looks upon discretion and good housewifery as little domestick virtues unbecoming a woman of quality she thinks life lost in her own family and fancies herself out of the world when she is not in the ring the playhouse or the drawingroom she lives in a perpetual motion of body and restlessness of thought and is never easie in any one place when she thinks there is more company in another the missing of an opera the first night would be more afflicting to her than the death of a child she pities all the valuable part of her own sex and calls every woman of a prudent modest retired life a poorspirited unpolished creature what a mortification would it be to fulvia if she knew that her setting her self to view is but exposing her self and that she grows contemptible by being conspicuous  i cannot conclude my paper without observing that virgil has very finely touched upon this female passion for dress and show in the character of camilla who tho she seems to have shaken off all the other weaknesses of her sex is still described as a woman in this particular the poet tells us that after having made a great slaughter of the enemy she unfortunately cast her eye on a trojan who  wore an embroidered tunick a beautiful coat of mail with a mantle of the finest purple a golden bow says he hung upon his shoulder his garment was buckled with a golden clasp and his head was covered with an helmet of the same shining mettle the amazon immediately singled out this welldressed warrior being seized with a womans longing for the pretty trappings that he was adorned with  totumque incauta per agmen fæmineo

upon the little muff that is now in fashion another informs me of a pair of silver garters buckled below the knee that have been lately seen at the rainbow coffeehouse in fleetstreet  a third sends me an heavy complaint against fringed gloves to be brief there is scarce an ornament of either sex which one or other of my correspondents has not inveighed against with some bitterness and recommended to my observation i must therefore once for all inform my readers that it is not my intention to sink the dignity of this my paper with reflections upon redheels or topknots but rather to enter into the passions of mankind and to correct those depraved sentiments that give birth to all those little extravagancies which appear in their outward dress and behaviour foppish and fantastick ornaments are only indications of vice not criminal in themselves extinguish vanity in the mind and you naturally retrench the little superfluities of garniture and equipage the blossoms will fall of themselves when the root that nourishes them is destroyed  i shall therefore as i have said apply my remedies to the first seeds and principles of an affected dress without descending to the dress it self though at the same time i must own that i have thoughts of creating an officer under me to be entituled the censor of small wares and of allotting him one day in a week for the execution of such his office an operator of this nature might act under me with the same regard as a surgeon to a physician the one might be employd in healing those blotches and tumours which break out in the body while the other is sweetning the blood and rectifying the constitution to speak truly the young people of both sexes are so wonderfully apt to shoot out into long swords or sweeping trains bushy headdresses or fullbottomd perriwigs with several other incumbrances of dress that they stand in need of being pruned very frequently lest they should  be oppressed with ornaments and overrun with the luxuriency of their habits i am much in doubt whether i should give the preference to a quaker that is trimmed close and almost cut to the quick or to a beau that is loaden with such a redundance of excrescencies i must therefore desire my correspondents to let me know how they approve my project and whether they think the erecting of such a petty censorship may not turn to the emolument of the publick for i would not do any thing of this nature rashly and without advice  there is another set of correspondents to whom i must address my self in the second place i mean such as fill their letters with private scandal and black accounts of particular persons and families the world is so full of illnature that i have lampoons sent me by people who  cannot spell and satyrs composd by those who scarce know how to write by the last post in particular i receivd a packet of scandal that is not legible and have a whole bundle of letters in womens hands that are full of blots and calumnies insomuch that when i see the name cælia phillis pastora or the like at the bottom of a scrawl i conclude on course that it brings me some account of a fallen virgin a faithless wife or an amorous widow i must therefore inform these my correspondents that it is not my design to be a publisher of intreagues and cuckoldoms or to bring little infamous stories out of their present lurking holes into broad day light if i attack the vicious i shall only set upon them in a body and will not be provoked by the worst usage that i can receive from others to make an example of any particular criminal in short i have so much of a drawcansir  in me that i shall pass over a single foe to charge whole armies it is not lais or silenus but the harlot and the drunkard whom i shall endeavour to expose and shall consider the crime as it appears in a species not as it is circumstanced in an individual i think it was caligula who wished the whole city of rome had but one neck that he might behead them at a blow i shall do out of humanity what that emperor would have done in the cruelty of his temper and aim every stroak at a collective body of offenders at the same time i am very sensible that nothing spreads a paper like private calumny and defamation but as my speculations are not under this necessity they are not exposed to this temptation  in the next place i must apply my self to my partycorrespondents who are continually teazing me to take notice of one anothers proceedings how often am i asked by both sides if it is possible for me to be an unconcerned spectator of the rogueries that are committed by the party which is opposite to him that writes the letter about two days since i was reproached with an old grecian law that forbids any man to stand as a neuter or a lookeron in the divisions of his country however as i am very sensible my  paper would lose its whole effect should it run into the outrages of a party i shall take care to keep clear of every thing which  looks that way if i can any way asswage private inflammations or allay publick ferments i shall apply my self to it with my utmost endeavours but will never let my heart reproach me with having done any thing towards encreasing  those feuds and animosities that extinguish religion deface government and make a nation miserable  what i have said under the three foregoing heads will i am afraid very much retrench the number of my correspondents i shall therefore acquaint my reader that if he has started any hint which he is not able to pursue if he has met with any surprizing story which he does not know how to tell if he has discovered any epidemical vice which has escaped my observation or has heard of any uncommon virtue which he would desire to publish in short if he has any materials that can furnish out an innocent diversion i shall promise him my best assistance in the working of them up for a publick entertainment  this paper my reader will find was intended for an

themselves as founders kinsmen or to the obliquity of their figure in what sort soever  iii that if the quantity of any mans nose be eminently miscalculated whether as to length or breadth he shall

account of the italian opera and of the gradual progress which it has made upon the english stage for there is no question but our great grandchildren will be very curious to know the reason why their forefathers used to sit together like an audience of foreigners in their own country and to hear whole plays acted before them in a tongue which they did not understand  arsinoe  was the first opera that gave us a taste of italian musick the great success this opera met with produced some attempts of forming pieces upon italian plans which  should give a more natural and reasonable entertainment than what can be met with in the elaborate trifles of that nation this alarmd the poetasters and fidlers of the town who were used to deal in a more ordinary kind of ware and therefore laid down an establishd rule which is receivd as such to this day  that nothing is capable of being well set to musick that is not nonsense  this maxim was no sooner receivd but we immediately fell to translating the italian operas and as there was no great danger of hurting the sense of those extraordinary pieces our authors would often make words of their own which  were entirely foreign to the meaning of the passages they  pretended to translate their chief care being to make the numbers of the english verse answer to those of the italian that both of them might go to the same tune thus the famous song in camilla barbara si t intendo c  barbarous woman yes i know your meaning which expresses the resentments of an angry lover was translated into that english lamentation frail are a lovers hopes c and it was pleasant enough to see the most refined persons of the british nation dying away and languishing to notes that were filled with a spirit of rage and indignation it happend also very frequently where the sense was rightly translated the necessary transposition of words which  were drawn out of the phrase of one tongue into that of another made the musick appear very absurd in one tongue that was very natural in the other i remember an italian verse that ran thus word for word and turned my rage into pity which the english for rhime sake translated and into pity turnd my rage by this means the soft notes that were adapted to pity in the italian fell upon the word rage in the english and the angry sounds that were turnd to rage in the original were made to express pity in the translation it oftentimes happend likewise that the finest notes in the air fell upon the most insignificant words in the sentence i have known the word and pursud through the whole gamut have been entertained with many a melodious the and have heard the most beautiful graces quavers and divisions bestowed upon then for and from to the eternal honour of our english particles  the next step to our refinement was the introducing of italian actors into our opera who sung their parts in their own language at the same time that our countrymen performd theirs in our native tongue the king or hero of the play generally spoke in italian and his slaves answered him in english the lover frequently made his court and gained the heart of his princess in a language which she did not understand one would have thought it very difficult to have carryd on dialogues after this manner without an interpreter between the persons that conversd together but this was the state of the english stage for about three years  at length the audience grew tird of understanding half the opera and therefore to ease themselves entirely of the fatigue of thinking have so orderd it at present that the whole opera is performed in an unknown tongue we no longer understand the language of our own stage insomuch that i have often been afraid when i have seen our italian performers chattering in the vehemence of action that they have been calling us names and abusing us among themselves but i hope since we do put such an entire confidence in them they will not talk against us before our faces though they may do it with the same safety as if it were  behind our backs in the mean time i cannot forbear thinking how naturally an historian who writes two or three hundred years hence and does not know the taste of his wise forefathers will make the following reflection in the beginning of the eighteenth century the italian tongue was so well understood in england that operas were acted on the publick stage in that language  one scarce knows how to be serious in the confutation of an absurdity that shews itself at the first sight it does not want any great measure of sense to see the ridicule of this monstrous practice but what makes it the more astonishing it is not the taste of the rabble but of persons of the greatest politeness which has establishd it  if the italians have a genius for musick above the english the english have a genius for other performances of a much higher nature and capable of giving the mind a much nobler entertainment would one think it was possible at a time when an author lived that was able to write the phædra and hippolitus  for a people to be so stupidly fond of the italian opera as scarce to give a third days hearing to that admirable tragedy musick is certainly a very agreeable entertainment but if it would take the entire possession of our ears if it would make us incapable of hearing sense if it would exclude arts that have a much greater tendency to the refinement of humane nature i must confess i would allow it no better quarter than plato has done who banishes it out of his commonwealth  at present our notions of musick are so very uncertain that we do not know what it is we like only in general we are transported with any thing that is not english so if it be of a foreign growth let it be italian french or highdutch it is the same thing in short our english musick is quite rooted out and nothing yet planted in its stead  when a royal palace is burnt to the ground every man is at liberty to present his plan for a new one and tho it be but indifferently put together it may furnish several hints that may be of use to a good architect i shall take the same liberty in a following paper of giving my opinion upon the subject of musick which i shall lay down only in a problematical manner to be considered by those who are masters in the art  c      footnote    arsinoe was produced at drury lane in   0  with mrs

an utter stranger to him with a cast of his eye which methought expressed an emotion of heart very different from what could be raised by an object so agreeable as the gentleman he looked at i began to consider not without some secret sorrow the condition of an envious man some have fancied that envy has a certain magical force in it and that the eyes of the envious have by their fascination blasted the enjoyments of the happy sir francis bacon says  some have been so curious as to remark the times and seasons when the stroke of an envious eye is most effectually pernicious and have observed that it has been when the person envied has been in any circumstance of glory and triumph at such a time the mind of the prosperous man goes as it were abroad among things without him and is more exposed to the malignity but i shall not dwell upon speculations so abstracted as this or repeat the many excellent things which one might collect out of authors upon this miserable affection but keeping in the road of common life consider the envious man with relation to these three heads his pains his reliefs and his happiness  the envious man is in pain upon all occasions which ought to give him pleasure the relish of his life is inverted and the objects which administer the highest satisfaction to those who are exempt from this passion give the quickest pangs to persons who are subject to it all the perfections of their fellowcreatures are odious youth beauty valour and wisdom are provocations of their displeasure what a wretched and apostate state is this to be offended with excellence and to hate a man because we approve him the condition of the envious man is the most emphatically miserable he is not only incapable of rejoicing in anothers merit or success but lives in a world wherein all mankind are in a plot against his quiet by studying their own happiness and advantage will prosper is an honest talebearer he makes it his business to join in conversation with envious men he points to such an handsom young fellow and whispers that he is secretly married to a great fortune when they doubt he adds circumstances to prove it and never fails to aggravate their distress by assuring em that to his knowledge he has an uncle will leave him some thousands will has many arts of this kind to torture this sort of temper and delights in it when he finds them change colour and say faintly they wish such a piece of news is true he has the malice to speak some good or other of every man of their acquaintance  the reliefs of the envious man are those little blemishes and imperfections that discover themselves in an illustrious character it is matter of great consolation to an envious person when a man of known honour does a thing unworthy himself or when any action which was well executed upon better information appears so alterd in its circumstances that the fame of it is divided among many instead of being attributed to one this is a secret satisfaction to these malignants for the person whom they before could not but admire they fancy is nearer their own condition as soon as his merit is shared among others i remember some years ago there came out an excellent poem without the name of the author the little wits who were incapable of writing it began to pull in pieces the supposed writer when that would not do they took great pains to suppress the opinion that it was his that again failed the next refuge was to say it was overlookd by one man and many pages wholly written by another an honest fellow who sate among a cluster of them in debate on this subject cryed out gentlemen if you are sure none of you yourselves had an hand in it you are but where you were whoever writ it but the most usual succour to the envious in cases of nameless merit in this kind is to keep the property if possible unfixed and by that means to hinder the reputation of it from falling upon any particular person you see an envious man clear up his countenance if in the relation of any mans great happiness in one point you mention his uneasiness in another when he hears such a one is very rich he turns pale but recovers when you add that he has many children in a word the only sure way to an envious mans favour is not to deserve it  but if we consider the envious man in delight it is like reading the seat of a giant in a romance the magnificence of his house consists in the many limbs of men whom he has slain if any who promised themselves success in any uncommon undertaking miscarry in the attempt or he that aimed at what would have been useful and laudable meets with contempt and derision the envious man under the colour of hating vainglory can smile with an inward wantonness of heart at the ill effect it may have upon an honest ambition for the future  having throughly considered the nature of this passion i have made it my study how to avoid the envy that may acrue to me from these my speculations and if i am not mistaken in my self i think i have a genius to escape it upon hearing in a coffeehouse one of my papers commended i immediately apprehended the envy that would spring from that applause and therefore gave a description of my face the next day  being resolved as i grow in reputation for wit to resign my pretensions to beauty this i hope may give some ease to those unhappy gentlemen who do me the honour to torment themselves upon the account of this my paper as their case is very deplorable and deserves compassion i shall sometimes be dull in pity to them and will from time to time administer consolations to them by further discoveries of my person in the meanwhile if any one says the spectator has wit it may be some relief to them to think that he does not show it in company

astrologers call the evil influences of the stars evil aspects so that still there seemeth to be acknowledged in the act of envy an ejaculation or irradiation of the eye nay some have been so curious as to note that the times when the stroke or percussion of an envious eye doth most hurt are when the party envied is beheld in glory or triumph for that sets an edge upon envy and besides at such

manner is my province as spectator for it is generally an offence committed by the eyes and that against such as the offenders would perhaps never have an opportunity of injuring any other way the following letter is a complaint of a young lady who sets forth a trespass of this kind with that command of herself as befits beauty and innocence and yet with so much spirit as sufficiently expresses her indignation the whole transaction is performed with the eyes and the crime is no less than employing them in such a manner as to divert the eyes of others from the best use they can make of them even looking up to heaven sir  there never was i believe an acceptable man but had some awkward imitators ever since the spectator appeard have i remarked a kind of men whom i choose to call starers that without any regard to time place or modesty disturb a large company with their impertinent eyes spectators make up a proper assembly for a puppetshow or a beargarden but devout supplicants and attentive hearers are the audience one ought to expect in churches i am sir member of a small pious congregation near one of the north gates of this city much the greater part of us indeed are females and used to behave our selves in a regular attentive manner till very lately one whole isle has been disturbed with one of these monstrous starers hes the head taller than any one in the church but for the greater advantage of exposing himself stands upon a hassock and commands the whole congregation to the great annoyance of the devoutest part of the auditory for what with blushing confusion and vexation we can neither mind the prayers nor sermon your animadversion upon this insolence would be a great favour to  sir  your most humble servant  s c  i have frequently seen of this sort of fellows and do not think there can be a greater aggravation of an offence than that it is committed where the criminal is protected by the sacredness of the place which he violates many reflections of this sort might be very justly made upon this kind of behaviour but a starer is not usually a person to be convinced by the reason of the thing and a fellow that is capable of showing an impudent front before a whole congregation and can bear being a publick spectacle is not so easily rebuked as to amend by admonitions if therefore my correspondent does not inform me that within seven days after this date the barbarian does not at least stand upon his own legs only without an eminence my friend will prosper has promised to take an hassock opposite to him and stare against him in defence of the ladies i have given him directions according to the most exact rules of opticks to place himself in such a manner that he shall meet his eyes wherever he throws them i have hopes that when will confronts him and all the ladies in whose behalf he engages him cast kind looks and wishes of success at their champion he will have some shame and feel a little of the pain he has so often put others to of being out of countenance  it has indeed been time out of mind generally remarked and as often lamented that this family of starers have infested publick assemblies and i know no other way to obviate so great an evil except in the case of fixing their eyes upon women some male friend will take the part of such as are under the oppression of impudence and encounter the eyes of the starers wherever they meet them while we suffer our women to be thus impudently attacked they have no defence but in the end to cast yielding glances at the starers and in this case a man who has no sense of shame has the same advantage over his mistress as he who has no regard for his own life has over his adversary while the generality of the world are fetterd by rules and move by proper and just methods he who has no respect to any of them carries away the reward due to that propriety of behaviour with no other merit but that of having neglected it  i take an impudent fellow to be a sort of outlaw in goodbreeding and therefore what is said of him no nation or person can be concerned for for this reason one may be free upon him i have put my self to great pains in considering this prevailing quality which we call impudence and have taken notice that it exerts it self in a different manner according to the different soils wherein such subjects of these dominions as are masters of it were born impudence in an englishman is sullen and insolent in a scotchman it is untractable and rapacious in an irishman absurd and fawning as the course of the world now runs the impudent englishman behaves like a surly landlord the scot like an illreceived guest and the irishman like a stranger who knows he is not welcome there is seldom anything entertaining either in the impudence of a south or north briton but that of an irishman is always comick a true and genuine impudence is ever the effect of ignorance without the least sense of it the best and most successful starers now in this town are of that nation they have usually the advantage of the stature mentioned in the above letter of my correspondent and generally take their stands in the eye of women of fortune insomuch that i have known one of them three months after he came from plough with a tolerable good air lead out a woman from a play which one of our own breed after four years at oxford and two at the temple would have been afraid to look at  i cannot tell how to account for it but these people have usually the preference to our own fools in the opinion of the sillier part of womankind perhaps it is that an english coxcomb is seldom so obsequious as an irish one and when the design of pleasing is visible an absurdity in the way toward it is easily forgiven  but those who are downright impudent and go on without reflection that they are such are more to be tolerated than a set of fellows among us who profess impudence with an air of humour and think to carry off the most inexcusable of all faults in the world with no other apology than saying in a gay tone i put an impudent face upon the matter no no man shall be allowed the advantages of impudence who is conscious that he is such if he knows he is impudent he may as well be otherwise and it shall be expected that he blush when he sees he makes another do it for nothing can attone for the want of modesty without which beauty is ungraceful

divinity law and physick how they are each of them overburdened with practitioners and filled with multitudes of ingenious gentlemen that starve one another  we may divide the clergy into generals fieldofficers and subalterns among the first we may reckon bishops deans and archdeacons among the second are doctors of divinity prebendaries and all that wear scarfs the rest are comprehended under the subalterns as for the first class our constitution preserves it from any redundancy of incumbents notwithstanding competitors are numberless upon a strict calculation it is found that there has been a great exceeding of late years in the second division several brevets having been granted for the converting of subalterns into scarfofficers insomuch that within my memory the price of lutestring is raised above two pence in a yard as for the subalterns they are not to be numbred should our clergy once enter into the corrupt practice of the laity by the splitting of their freeholds they would be able to carry most of the elections in england  the body of the law is no less encumbered with superfluous members that are like virgils army which he tells us was so crouded  many of them had not room to use their weapons this prodigious society of men may be divided into the litigious and peaceable under the first are comprehended all those who are carried down in coachfulls to westminsterhall every morning in termtime martials description of this species of lawyers is full of humour iras et verba locant men that hire out their words and anger that are more or less passionate according as they are paid for it and allow their client a quantity of wrath proportionable to the fee which they receive from him i must however observe to the reader that above three parts of those whom i reckon among the litigious are such as are only quarrelsome in their hearts and have no opportunity of showing their passion at the bar nevertheless as they do not know what strifes may arise they appear at the hall every day that they may show themselves in a readiness to enter the lists whenever there shall be occasion for them  the peaceable lawyers are in the first place many of the benchers of the several inns of court who seem to be the dignitaries of the law and are endowed with those qualifications of mind that accomplish a man rather for a ruler than a pleader these men live peaceably in their habitations eating once a day and dancing once a year  for the honour of their respective societies  another numberless branch of peaceable lawyers are those young men who being placed at the inns of court in order to study the laws of their country frequent the playhouse more than westminsterhall and are seen in all publick assemblies except in a court of justice i shall say nothing of those silent and busie multitudes that are employed within doors in the drawing up of writings and conveyances nor of those greater numbers that palliate their want of business with a pretence to such chamberpractice  if in the third place we look into the profession of physick we shall find a most formidable body of men the sight of them is enough to make a man serious for we may lay it down as a maxim that when a nation abounds in physicians it grows thin of people sir william temple is very much puzzled to find a reason why the northern hive as he calls it does not send out such prodigious swarms and overrun the world with goths and vandals as it did formerly  but had that excellent author observed that there were no students in physick among the subjects of thor and woden and that this science very much flourishes in the north at present he might have found a better solution for this difficulty than any of those he has made use of this body of men in our own country may be described like the british army in cæsars time some of them slay in chariots and some on foot if the infantry do less execution than the charioteers it is because they cannot be carried so soon into all quarters of the town and dispatch so much business in so short a time besides this body of regular troops there are stragglers who without being duly listed and enrolled do infinite mischief to those who are so unlucky as to fall into their hands  there are besides the abovementioned innumerable retainers to physick who for want of other patients amuse themselves with the stifling of cats in an air pump cutting up dogs alive or impaling of insects upon the point of a needle for microscopical observations besides those that are employed in the gathering of weeds and the chase of butterflies not to mention the cockleshellmerchants and spidercatchers  when i consider how each of these professions are crouded with multitudes that seek their livelihood in them and how many men of merit there are in each of them who may be rather said to be of the science than the profession i very much wonder at the humour of parents who will not rather chuse to place their sons in a way of life where an honest industry cannot but thrive than in stations where the greatest probity learning and good sense may miscarry how many men are countrycurates that might have made themselves aldermen of london by a right improvement of a smaller sum of mony than what is usually laid out upon a learned education a sober frugal person of slender parts and a slow apprehension might have thrived in trade tho he starves upon physick as a man would be well enough pleased to buy silks of one whom he would not venture to feel his pulse vagellius is careful studious and obliging but withal a little thickskulld he has not a single client but might have had abundance of customers the misfortune is that parents take a liking to a particular profession and therefore desire their sons may be of it whereas in so great an affair of life they should consider the genius and abilities of their children more than their own inclinations  it is the great advantage of a trading nation that there are very few in it so dull and heavy who may not be placed in stations of life which may give them an opportunity of making their fortunes a wellregulated commerce is not like law physick or divinity to be overstocked with hands but on the contrary flourishes by multitudes and gives employment to all its professors fleets of merchantmen are so many

requires a degree of understanding to play justly but such is our condition that we are to suspend our reason to perform our parts as to scenes of madness you know sir there are noble instances of this kind in shakespear but then it is the disturbance of a noble mind from generous and humane resentments it is like that grief which we have for the decease of our friends it is no diminution but a recommendation of humane nature that in such incidents passion gets the better of reason and all we can think to comfort ourselves is impotent against half what we feel i will not mention that we had an idiot in the scene and all the sense it is represented to have is that of lust as for my self who have long taken pains in personating the passions i have to night acted only an appetite the part i playd is thirst but it is represented as written rather by a drayman than a poet i come in with a tub about me that tub hung with quartpots with a full gallon at my mouth  i am ashamed to tell you

immittere possit  vir   there is nothing that more betrays a base ungenerous spirit than the giving of secret stabs to a mans reputation lampoons and satyrs that are written with wit and spirit are like poisond darts which not only inflict a wound but make it incurable for this reason i am very much troubled when i see the talents of humour and ridicule in the possession of an illnatured man there cannot be a greater gratification to a barbarous and inhuman wit than to stir up sorrow in the heart of a private person to raise uneasiness among near relations and to expose whole families to derision at the same time that he remains unseen and undiscovered if besides the accomplishments of being witty and illnatured a man is vicious into the bargain he is one of the most mischievous creatures that can enter into a civil society his satyr will then chiefly fall upon those who ought to be the most exempt from it virtue merit and every thing that is praiseworthy will be made the subject of ridicule and buffoonry it is impossible to enumerate the evils which arise from these arrows that fly in the dark and i know no other excuse that is or can be made for them than that the wounds they give are only imaginary and produce nothing more than a secret shame or sorrow in the mind of the suffering person it must indeed be confessd that a lampoon or a satyr do not carry in them robbery or murder but at the same time how many are there that would not rather lose a considerable sum of mony or even life it self than be set up as a mark of infamy and derision and in this case a man should consider that an injury is not to be measured by the notions of him that gives but of him that receives it  those who can put the best countenance upon the outrages of this nature which are offered them are not without their secret anguish i have often observed a passage in socratess behaviour at his death in a light wherein none of the criticks have considered it that excellent man entertaining his friends a little before he drank the bowl of poison with a discourse on the immortality of the soul at his entering upon it says that he does not believe any the most comick genius can censure him for talking upon such a subject at such a time this passage i think evidently glances upon aristophanes who writ a comedy on purpose to ridicule the discourses of that divine philosopher  it has been observed by many writers that socrates was so little moved at this piece of buffoonry that he was several times present at its being acted upon the stage and never expressed the least resentment of it but with submission i think the remark i have here made shows us that this unworthy treatment made an impression upon his mind though he had been too wise to discover it  when julius cæsar was lampoond by catullus he invited him to a supper and treated him with such a generous civility that he made the poet his friend ever after  cardinal mazarine gave the same kind of treatment to the learned quillet who had reflected upon his eminence in a famous latin poem the cardinal sent for him and after some kind expostulations upon what he had written assured him of his esteem and dismissed him with a promise of the next good abby that should fall which he accordingly conferrd upon him in a few months after this had so good an effect upon the author that he dedicated the second edition of his book to the cardinal after having expunged the passages which had given him offence   sextus quintus was not of so generous and forgiving a temper upon his being made pope the statue of pasquin was one night dressed in a very dirty shirt with an excuse written under it that he was forced to wear foul linnen because his laundress was made a princess this was a reflection upon the popes sister who before the promotion of her brother was in those mean circumstances that pasquin represented her as this pasquinade made a great noise in rome the pope offered a considerable sum of mony to any person that should discover the author of it the author relying upon his holinesss generosity as also on some private overtures which he had received from him made the discovery himself upon which the pope gave him the reward he had promised but at the same time to disable the satyrist for the future ordered his tongue to be cut out and both his hands to be chopped off  aretine  is too trite an instance every one knows that all the kings of europe were his tributaries nay there is a letter of his extant in which he makes his boasts that he had laid the sophi of persia under contribution  though in the various examples which i have here drawn together these several great men behaved themselves very differently towards the wits of the age who had reproached them they all of them plainly showed that they were very sensible of their reproaches and consequently that they received them as very great injuries for my own part i would never trust a man that i thought was capable of giving these secret wounds and cannot but think that he would hurt the person whose reputation he thus assaults in his body or in his fortune could he do it with the same security there is indeed something very barbarous and inhuman in the ordinary scriblers of lampoons an innocent young lady shall be exposed for an unhappy feature a father of a family turnd to ridicule for some domestick calamity a wife be made uneasy all her life for a misinterpreted word or action nay a good a temperate and a just man shall be put out of countenance by the representation of those qualities that should do him honour so pernicious a thing is wit when it is not tempered with virtue and humanity  i have indeed heard of heedless inconsiderate writers that without any malice have sacrificed the reputation of their friends and acquaintance to a certain levity of temper and a silly ambition of distinguishing themselves by a spirit of raillery and satyr as if it were not infinitely more honourable to be a goodnatured man than a wit where there is this little petulant humour in an author he is often very mischievous without designing to be so for which reason i always lay it down as a rule that an indiscreet man is more hurtful than an illnatured one for as the former will only attack his enemies and those he wishes ill to the other injures indifferently both friends and foes i cannot forbear on this occasion transcribing a fable out of sir roger lestrange  which accidentally lies before me a company of waggish boys were watching of frogs at the side

letter will explain it self and needs no apology sir  i am one of that sickly tribe who are commonly known by the name of valetudinarians and do confess to you that i first contracted this ill habit of body or rather of mind by the study of physick i no sooner began to peruse books of this nature but i found my pulse was irregular and scarce ever read the account of any disease that i did not fancy my self afflicted with dr sydenhams learned treatise of fevers  threw me into a lingring hectick which hung upon me all the while i was reading that excellent piece i then applied my self to the study of several authors who have written upon phthisical distempers and by that means fell into a consumption till at length growing very fat i was in a manner shamed out of that imagination not long after this i found in my self all the symptoms of the gout except pain but was cured of it by a treatise upon the gravel written by a very ingenious author who as it is usual for physicians to convert one distemper into another eased me of the gout by giving me the stone i at length studied my self into a complication of distempers but accidentally taking into my hand that ingenious discourse written by sanctorius  i was resolved to direct my self by a scheme of rules which i had collected from his observations the learned world are very well acquainted with that gentlemans invention who for the better carrying on of his experiments contrived a certain mathematical chair which was so artifically hung upon springs that it would weigh any thing as well as a pair of scales by this means he discovered how many ounces of his food passd by perspiration what quantity of it was turned into nourishment and how much went away by the other channels and distributions of nature  having provided myself with this chair i used to study eat drink and sleep in it insomuch that i may be said for these three last years to have lived in a pair of scales i compute my self when i am in full health to be precisely two hundred weight falling short of it about a pound after a days fast and exceeding it as much after a very full meal so that it is my continual employment to trim the ballance between these two volatile pounds in my constitution in my ordinary meals i fetch my self up to two hundred weight and a half pound  and if after having dined i find my self fall short of it i drink just so much small beer or eat such a quantity of bread as is sufficient to make me weight in my greatest excesses i do not transgress more than the other half pound which for my healths sake i do the first monday in every month as soon as i find my self duly poised after dinner i walk till i have perspired five ounces and four scruples and when i discover by my chair that i am so far reduced i fall to my books and study away three ounces more as for the remaining parts of the pound i keep no account of them i do not dine and sup by the clock but by my chair for when that informs me my pound of food is exhausted i conclude my self to be hungry and lay in another with all diligence in my days of abstinence i lose a pound and an half and on solemn fasts am two pound lighter than on other days in the year  i allow my self one night with another a quarter of a pound of sleep within a few grains more or less and if upon my rising i find that i have not consumed my whole quantity i take out the rest in my chair upon an exact calculation of what i expended and received the last year which i always register in a book i find the medium to be two hundred weight so that i cannot discover that i am impaired one ounce in my health during a whole twelvemonth and yet sir notwithstanding this my great care to ballast my self equally every day and to keep my body in its proper poise so it is that i find my self in a sick and languishing condition my complexion is grown very sallow my pulse low and my body hydropical let me therefore beg you sir to consider me as your patient and to give me more certain rules to walk by than those i have already observed and you will very much oblige  your humble servant  this letter puts me in mind of an italian epitaph written on the monument of a valetudinarian stavo ben ma per star meglio sto qui which it is impossible to translate  the fear of death often proves mortal and sets people on methods to save their lives which infallibly destroy them this is a reflection made by some historians upon observing that there are many more thousands killed in a flight than in a battel and may be applied to those multitudes of imaginary sick persons that break their constitutions by physick and throw themselves into the arms of death by endeavouring to escape it this method is not only dangerous but below the practice of a reasonable creature to consult the preservation of life as the only end of it to make our health our business to engage in no action that is not part of a regimen or course of physick are purposes so abject so mean so unworthy human nature that a generous soul would rather die than submit to them besides that a continual anxiety for life vitiates all the relishes of it and casts a gloom over the whole face of nature as it is impossible we should take delight in any thing that we are every moment afraid of losing  i do not mean by what i have here said that i think any one to blame for taking due care of their health on the contrary as cheerfulness of mind and capacity for business are in a great measure the effects of a welltempered constitution a man cannot be at too much pains to cultivate and preserve it but this care which we are prompted to not only by common sense but by duty and instinct should never engage us in groundless fears melancholly apprehensions and imaginary distempers which are natural to every man who is more anxious to live than how to live in short the preservation of life should be only a secondary concern and the direction of it our principal if we have this frame of mind we shall take the best means to preserve life without being oversollicitous about the event and shall arrive at that point of felicity which martial has mentioned as the perfection of happiness of neither fearing nor wishing for death  in answer to the gentleman who tempers his health by ounces and by scruples and instead of complying with those natural sollicitations of hunger and thirst drowsiness or love of exercise governs himself by the prescriptions of his chair i shall tell him a short fable  jupiter says the mythologist to reward the piety of a certain countryman

abbey where the gloominess of the place and the use to which it is applied with the solemnity of the building and the condition of the people who lye in it are apt to fill the mind with a kind of melancholy or rather thoughtfulness that is not disagreeable i yesterday passd a whole afternoon in the churchyard the cloysters and the church amusing myself with the tombstones and inscriptions that i met with in those several regions of the dead most of them recorded nothing else of the buried person but that he was born upon one day and died upon another the whole history of his life being comprehended in those two circumstances that are common to all mankind i could not but look upon these registers of existence whether of brass or marble as a kind of satyr upon the departed persons who had left no other memorial of them but that they were born and that they died they put me in mind of several persons mentioned in the battles of heroic poems who have sounding names given them for no other reason but that they may be killed and are celebrated for nothing but being knocked on the head   glaucumque medontaque thersilochumque   virg the life of these men is finely described in holy writ by the path of an arrow which is immediately closed up and lost upon my going into the church i entertaind my self with the digging of a grave and saw in every shovelfull of it that was thrown up the fragment of a bone or skull intermixt with a kind of fresh mouldering earth that some time or other had a place in the composition of an humane body upon this i began to consider with my self what innumerable multitudes of people lay confusd together under the pavement of that ancient cathedral how men and women friends and enemies priests and soldiers monks and prebendaries were crumbled amongst one another and blended together in the same common mass how beauty strength and youth with oldage weakness and deformity lay undistinguishd in the same promiscuous heap of matter  after having thus surveyed this great magazine of mortality as it were in the lump i examined it more particularly by the accounts which i found on several of the monuments which  are raised in every quarter of that ancient fabrick some of them were covered with such extravagant epitaphs that if it were possible for the dead person to be acquainted with them he would blush at the praises which his friends have  bestowed upon him there are others so excessively modest that they deliver the character of the person departed in greek or hebrew and by that means are not understood once in a twelvemonth in the poetical quarter i found there were poets who  had no monuments and monuments which had  no poets i observed indeed that the present war  had filled the church with many of these uninhabited monuments which had been erected to the memory of persons whose bodies were perhaps buried in the plains of blenheim or in the bosom of the ocean  i could not but be very much delighted with several modern epitaphs which are written with great elegance of expression and justness of thought and therefore do honour to the living as well as to the dead as a foreigner is very apt to conceive an idea of the ignorance or politeness of a nation from the turn of their publick monuments and inscriptions they should be submitted to the perusal of men of learning and genius before they are put in execution sir cloudesly shovels monument has very often given me great offence instead of the brave rough english admiral which was the distinguishing character of that plain gallant man  he is represented on his tomb by the figure of a beau dressd in a long perriwig and reposing himself upon velvet cushions under a canopy of state the inscription is answerable to the monument for instead of celebrating the many remarkable actions he had performed in the service of his country it acquaints us only with the manner of his death in which it was impossible for him to reap any honour the dutch whom we are apt to despise for want of genius shew an infinitely greater taste of antiquity and politeness in their buildings and works of this nature than what we meet with in those of our own country the monuments of their admirals which have been erected at the publick expence represent them like themselves and are adorned with rostral crowns and naval ornaments with beautiful festoons of seaweed shells and coral  but to return to our subject i have left the repository of our english kings for the contemplation of another day when i shall find my mind disposed for so

not know what it is to be melancholy and can therefore take a view of nature in her deep and solemn scenes with the same pleasure as in her most gay and delightful ones by this means i can improve my self with those objects which others consider with terror when i look upon the tombs of the great every emotion of envy dies in me when i read the epitaphs of the beautiful every inordinate desire goes out when i meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone my heart melts with compassion when i see the tomb of the parents themselves i consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must

the world who is involved in the business of it but lives under a secret impatience of the hurry and fatigue he suffers and has formed a resolution to fix himself one time or other in such a state as is suitable to the end of his being you hear men every day in conversation profess that all the honour power and riches which they propose to themselves cannot give satisfaction enough to reward them for half the anxiety they undergo in the pursuit or possession of them while men are in this temper which happens very frequently how inconsistent are they with themselves they are wearied with the toil they bear but cannot find in their hearts to relinquish it retirement is what they want but they cannot betake themselves to it while they pant after shade and covert they still affect to appear in the most glittering scenes of life but sure this is but just as reasonable as if a man should call for more lights when he has a mind to go to sleep  since then it is certain that our own hearts deceive us in the love of the world and that we cannot command our selves enough to resign it tho we every day wish our selves disengaged from its allurements let us not stand upon a formal taking of leave but wean our selves from them while we are in the midst of them  it is certainly the general intention of the greater part of mankind to accomplish this work and live according to their own approbation as soon as they possibly can but since the duration of life is so incertain and that has been a common topick of discourse ever since there was such a thing as life it self how is it possible that we should defer a moment the beginning to live according to the rules of reason  the man of business has ever some one point to carry and then he tells himself hell bid adieu to all the vanity of ambition the man of pleasure resolves to take his leave at least and part civilly with his mistress but the ambitious man is entangled every moment in a fresh pursuit and the lover sees new charms in the object he fancyd he could abandon it is therefore a fantastical way of thinking when we promise our selves an alteration in our conduct from change of place and difference of circumstances the same passions will attend us whereever we are till they are conquered and we can never live to our satisfaction in the deepest retirement unless we are capable of living so in some measure amidst the noise and business of the world  i have ever thought men were better known by what could be observed of them from a perusal of their private letters than any other way my friend the clergyman  the other day upon serious discourse with him concerning the danger of procrastination gave me the following letters from persons with whom he lives in great friendship and intimacy according to the good breeding and good sense of his character the first is from a man of business who is his convert the second from one of whom he conceives good hopes the third from one who is in

me to pass away the remaining part of my life in such a retirement as i at first proposed to my self but to my great misfortune i have intirely lost the relish of it and shoud now return to the

which he thinks may very much contribute to the embellishment of the city and to the driving barbarity out of our streets i consider it as a satyr upon projectors in general and a lively picture of the whole art of modern criticism  sir  observing that you have thoughts of creating certain officers under you for the inspection of several petty enormities which you your self cannot attend to and finding daily absurdities hung out upon the signposts of this city  to the great scandal of foreigners as well as those of our own country who are curious spectators of the same i do humbly propose that you would be pleased to make me your superintendant of all such figures and devices as are or shall be made use of on this occasion with full powers to rectify or expunge whatever i shall find irregular or defective for want of such an officer there is nothing like sound literature and good sense to be met with in those objects that are everywhere thrusting themselves out to the eye and endeavouring to become visible our streets are filled with blue boars black swans and red lions not to mention flying pigs and hogs in armour with many other creatures more extraordinary than any in the desarts of africk strange that one who has all the birds and beasts in nature to chuse out of should live at the sign of an ens rationis  my first task therefore should be like that of hercules to clear the city from monsters in the second place i would forbid that creatures of jarring and incongruous natures should be joined together in the same sign such as the bell and the neatstongue the dog and gridiron the fox and goose may be supposed to have met but what has the fox and the seven stars to do together and when did the lamb  and dolphin ever meet except upon a signpost as for the cat and fiddle there is a conceit in it and therefore i do not intend that anything i have here said should affect it i must however observe to you upon this subject that it is usual for a young tradesman at his first setting up to add to his own sign that of the master whom he servd as the husband after marriage gives a place to his mistresss arms in his own coat this i take to have given rise to many of those absurdities which are committed over our heads and as i am informd first occasioned the three nuns and a hare which we see so frequently joined together i would therefore establish certain rules for the determining how far one tradesman may give the sign of another and in what cases he may be allowed to quarter it with his own  in the third place i would enjoin every shop to make use of a sign which bears some affinity to the wares in which it deals what can be more inconsistent than to see a bawd at the sign of the angel or a taylor at the lion a cook should not live at the boot nor a shoemaker at the roasted pig and yet for want of this regulation i have seen a goat set up before the door of a perfumer and the french kings head at a swordcutlers  an ingenious foreigner observes that several of those gentlemen who value themselves upon their families and overlook such as are bred to trade bear the tools of their forefathers in their coats of arms i will not examine how true this is in fact but though it may not be necessary for posterity thus to set up the sign of their forefathers i think it highly proper for those who actually profess the trade to shew some such marks of it before their doors  when the name gives an occasion for an ingenious signpost i would likewise advise the owner to take that opportunity of letting the world know who he is it would have been ridiculous for the ingenious mrs salmon  to have lived at the sign of the trout for which reason she has erected before her house the figure of the fish that is her namesake mr bell has likewise distinguished himself by a device of the same nature and here sir i must beg leave to observe to you that this particular figure of a bell has given occasion to several pieces of wit in this kind a man of your reading must know that abel drugger gained great applause by it in the time of ben johnson  our apocryphal heathen god  is also represented by this figure which in conjunction with the dragon make a very handsome picture in several of our streets as for the bellsavage which is the sign of a savage man standing by a bell i was formerly very much puzzled upon the conceit of it till i accidentally fell into the reading of an old romance translated out of the french which gives an account of a very beautiful woman who was found in a wilderness and is called in the french la belle sauvage and is everywhere translated by our countrymen the bellsavage this piece of philology will i hope convince you that i have made sign posts my study and consequently qualified my self for the employment which i sollicit at your hands but before i conclude my letter i must communicate to you another remark which i have made upon the subject with which i am now entertaining you namely that i can give a shrewd guess at the humour of the inhabitant by the sign that hangs before his door a surly cholerick fellow generally makes choice of a bear as men of milder dispositions frequently live at the lamb seeing a punchbowl painted upon a sign near charing cross and very curiously garnished with a couple of angels hovering over it and squeezing a lemmon into it i had the curiosity to ask after the master of the house and found upon inquiry as i had guessed by the little agréemens upon his sign that he was a frenchman i know sir it is not requisite for me to enlarge upon these hints to a gentleman of your great abilities so humbly recommending my self to your favour and patronage  i remain c  i shall add to the foregoing letter another

nota si commista falerni est  hor   there is nothing that has more startled our english audience than the italian recitativo at its first entrance upon the stage people were wonderfully surprized to hear generals singing the word of command and ladies delivering messages in musick our countrymen could not forbear laughing when they heard a lover chanting out a billetdoux and even the superscription of a letter set to a tune the famous blunder in an old play of enter a king and two fidlers solus was now no longer an absurdity when it was impossible for a hero in a desart or a princess in her closet to speak anything unaccompanied with musical instruments  but however this italian method of acting in recitativo might appear at first hearing i cannot but think it much more just than that which prevailed in our english opera before this innovation the transition from an air to recitative musick being more natural than the passing from a song to plain and ordinary speaking which was the common method in purcells operas  the only fault i find in our present practice is the making use of italian recitative with english words  to go to the bottom of this matter i must observe that the tone or as the french call it the accent of every nation in their ordinary speech is altogether different from that of every other people as we may see even in the welsh and scotch who  border so near upon us by the tone or accent i do not mean the pronunciation of each particular word but the sound of the whole sentence thus it is very common for an english gentleman when he hears a french tragedy to complain that the actors all of them speak in a tone and therefore he very wisely prefers his own countrymen not considering that a foreigner complains of the same tone in an english actor  for this reason the recitative musick in every language should be as different as the tone or accent of each language for otherwise what may properly express a passion in one language will not do it in another every one who has been long in italy knows very well that the cadences in the recitativo bear a remote affinity to the tone of their voices in ordinary conversation or to speak more properly are only the accents of their language made more musical and tuneful  thus the notes of interrogation or admiration in the italian musick if one may so call them which resemble their accents in discourse on such occasions are not unlike the ordinary tones of an english voice when we are angry insomuch that i have often seen our audiences extreamly mistaken as to what has been doing upon the stage and expecting to see the hero knock down his messenger when he has been asking  him a question or fancying that he quarrels with his friend when he only bids him goodmorrow  for this reason the italian artists cannot agree with our english musicians in admiring purcells compositions  and thinking his tunes so wonderfully adapted to his words because both nations do not always express the same passions by the same sounds  i am therefore humbly of opinion that an english composer should not follow the italian recitative too servilely but make use of many gentle deviations from it in compliance with his own native language he may copy out of it all the lulling softness and dying falls as shakespear calls them but should still remember that he ought to accommodate himself to an english audience and by humouring the tone of our voices in ordinary conversation have the same regard to the accent of his own language as those persons had to theirs whom he professes to imitate it is observed that several of the singing birds of our own country learn to sweeten their voices and mellow the harshness of their natural notes by practising under those that come from warmer climates in the same manner i would allow the italian opera to lend our english musick as much as may grace and soften it but never entirely to annihilate and destroy it let the infusion be as strong as you please but still let the subject matter of it be english  a composer should fit his musick to the genius of the people and consider that the delicacy of hearing and taste of harmony has been formed upon those sounds which every country abounds with in short that musick is of a relative nature and what is harmony to one ear may be dissonance to another  the same observations which i have made upon the recitative part of musick may be applied to all our songs and airs in general  signior baptist lully  acted like a man of sense in this particular he found the french musick extreamly defective and very often barbarous however knowing the genius of the people the humour of their language and the prejudiced ears he  had to deal with he did not pretend to extirpate the french musick and plant the italian in its stead but only to cultivate and civilize it with innumerable graces and modulations which he borrowd from the italian by this means the french musick is now perfect in its kind and when you say it is not so good as the italian you only mean that it does not please you so well for there is scarce a frenchman who would not wonder to hear you give the italian such a preference the musick of the french is indeed very properly adapted to their pronunciation and accent as their whole opera wonderfully favours the genius of such a gay airy people the chorus in which that opera abounds gives the parterre frequent opportunities of joining in consort with the stage this inclination of the audience to sing along with the actors so prevails with them that i have sometimes known the performer on the stage do no more in a celebrated song than the clerk of a parish church who serves only to raise the psalm and is afterwards drownd in the musick of the congregation every actor that comes on the stage is a beau the queens and heroines are so painted that they appear as ruddy and cherrycheekd as milkmaids the shepherds are all embroiderd and acquit themselves in a ball better than our english dancing masters i have seen a couple of rivers appear in red stockings and alpheus instead of having his head covered with sedge and bullrushes making love in a fair fullbottomed perriwig and a plume of feathers but with a voice so full of shakes and quavers that i should have thought the murmurs of a country brook the much more agreeable musick  i remember the last opera i saw in that merry nation was the rape of proserpine where pluto to make the more tempting figure puts himself in a french equipage and brings ascalaphus along with him as his valet de chambre this is what we call folly and impertinence but what the french look upon as gay and polite  i shall add no more to what i have here offerd than that musick architecture and painting as well as poetry and oratory are to deduce their laws and rules from the general sense and taste of mankind and not from the principles of those arts themselves or in other words the taste is not to conform to the art but the art to the taste music is not designd to please only chromatick ears but all that are capable ef distinguishing harsh from disagreeable notes a man of an ordinary ear is a judge whether a passion is expressd in proper sounds and whether the melody of those sounds be more or less pleasing  c      footnote     that return to footnote mark   footnote

my last advices from oxford that there are a set of sighers in that university who have erected themselves into a society in honour of that tender passion these gentlemen are of that sort of inamoratos who are not so very much lost to common sense but that they understand the folly they are guilty of and for that reason separate themselves from all other company because they will enjoy the pleasure of talking incoherently without being ridiculous to any but each other when a man comes into the club he is not obliged to make any introduction to his discourse but at once as he is seating himself in his chair speaks in the thread of his own thoughts she gave me a very obliging glance she never lookd so well in her life as this evening or the like reflection without regard to any other members of the society for in this assembly they do not meet to talk to each other but every man claims the full liberty of talking to himself instead of snuffboxes and canes which are the usual helps to discourse with other young fellows these have each some piece of ribbon a broken fan or an old girdle which they play with while they talk of the fair person rememberd by each respective token according to the representation of the matter from my letters the company appear like so many players rehearsing behind the scenes one is sighing and lamenting his destiny in beseeching terms another declaring he will break his chain and another in dumbshow striving to express his passion by his gesture it is very ordinary in the assembly for one of a sudden to rise and make a discourse concerning his passion in general and describe the temper of his mind in such a manner as that the whole company shall join in the description and feel the force of it in this case if any man has declared the violence of his flame in more pathetick terms he is made president for that night out of respect to his superior passion  we had some years ago in this town a set of people who met and dressed like lovers and were distinguished by the name of the fringeglove club but they were persons of such moderate intellects even before they were impaired by their passion that their irregularities could not furnish sufficient variety of folly to afford daily new impertinencies by which means that institution droppd these fellows could express their passion in nothing but their dress but the oxonians are fantastical now they are lovers in proportion to their learning and understanding before they became such the thoughts of the ancient poets on this agreeable phrenzy are translated in honour of some modern beauty and chloris is won to day by the same compliment that was made to lesbia a thousand years ago but as far as i can learn the patron of the club is the renowned don quixote the adventures of that gentle knight are frequently mentiond in the society under the colour of laughing at the passion and themselves but at the same time tho they are sensible of the extravagancies of that unhappy warrior they do not observe that to turn all the reading of the best and wisest writings into rhapsodies of love is a phrenzy no less diverting than that of the

 vir   last night upon my going into a coffeehouse not far from the haymarket theatre i diverted my self for above half an hour with overhearing the discourse of one who by the shabbiness of his dress the extravagance of his conceptions and the hurry of his speech i discovered to be of that species who are generally distinguished by the title of projectors this gentleman for i found he was treated as such by his audience was entertaining a whole table of listners with the project of an opera which he told us had not cost him above two or three mornings in the contrivance and which he was ready to put in execution provided he might find his account in it he said that he had observed the great trouble and inconvenience which ladies were at in travelling up and down to the several shows that are exhibited in different quarters of the town the dancing monkies are in one place the puppetshow in another the opera in a third not to mention the lions that are almost a whole days journey from the politer part of the town by this means people of figure are forced to lose half the winter after their coming to town before they have seen all the strange sights about it in order to remedy this great inconvenience our projector drew out of his pocket the scheme of an opera entitled the expedition of alexander the great in which he had disposed of all the remarkable shows about town among the scenes and decorations of his piece the thought he confessed was not originally his own but that he had taken the hint of it from several performances which he had seen upon our stage in one of which there was a raryshow in another a ladderdance and in others a postureman a moving picture with many curiosities of the like nature  this expedition of alexander opens with his consulting the oracle at delphos in which the dumb conjuror who has been visited by so many persons of quality of late years is to be introduced as telling him his fortune at the same time clench of barnet is represented in another corner of the temple as ringing the bells of delphos for joy of his arrival the tent of darius is to be peopled by the ingenious mrs salmon  where alexander is to fall in love with a piece of waxwork that represents the beautiful statira when alexander comes into that country in which quintus curtius tells us the dogs were so exceeding fierce that they would not loose their hold tho they were cut to pieces limb by limb and that they would hang upon their prey by their teeth when they had nothing but a mouth left there is to be a scene of hockley in the hole  in which is to be represented all the diversions of that place the bullbaiting only excepted which cannot possibly be exhibited in the theatre by reason of the lowness of the roof the several woods in asia which alexander must be supposed to pass through will give the audience a sight of monkies dancing upon ropes with many other pleasantries of that ludicrous species at the same time if there chance to be any strange animals in town whether birds or beasts they may be either let loose among the woods or driven across the stage by some of the country people of asia in the last great battel pinkethman  is to personate king porus upon an elephant and is to be encountered by powell  representing alexander the great upon a dromedary which nevertheless mr powell is desired to call by the name of bucephalus upon the close of this great decisive battel when the two kings are thoroughly reconciled to shew the mutual friendship and good correspondence that reigns between them they both of them go together to a puppetshow in which the ingenious mr powell junior  may have an opportunity of displaying his whole art of machinery for the diversion of the two monarchs some at the table urged that a puppetshow was not a suitable entertainment for alexander the great and that it might be introduced more properly if we suppose the conqueror touched upon that part of india which is said to be inhabited by the pigmies but this objection was looked upon as frivolous and the proposal immediately overruled our projector further added that after the reconciliation of these two kings they might invite one another to dinner and either of them entertain his guest with the german artist mr pinkethmans heathen gods  or any of the like diversions which shall then chance to be in vogue  this project was receivd with very great applause by the whole table upon which the undertaker told us that he had not yet communicated to us above half his design for that alexander being a greek it was his intention that the whole opera should be acted in that language which was a tongue he was sure would wonderfully please the ladies especially when it was a little raised and rounded by the ionick dialect and could not but be acceptable  to the whole audience because there are fewer of them who understand greek than italian the only difficulty that remained was how to get performers unless we could persuade some gentlemen of the universities to learn to sing in order to qualify themselves for the stage but this objection soon vanished when the projector informed us that the greeks were at present the only musicians in the turkish empire and that it would be very easy for our factory at smyrna to furnish us every year with a colony of musicians by the opportunity of the turkey fleet besides says he if we want any single voice for any lower part in the opera lawrence can learn to speak greek as well as he does italian in a fortnights time  the projector having thus settled matters to the good liking of all that heard him he left his seat at the table and planted himself before the fire where i had unluckily taken my stand for the convenience of overhearing what he said whether he had observed me to be more attentive than ordinary i cannot tell but he had not stood by me above a quarter of a minute but he turned short upon me on a sudden and catching me by a button of my coat attacked me very abruptly after the following manner besides sir i have heard of a very extraordinary genius for musick that lives in switzerland who has so strong a spring in his fingers that he

set every thing that should be sung upon the english stage after this he looked full in my face expecting i would make an answer when by good luck a gentleman that had entered the coffeehouse since the projector applied himself to me hearing him talk of his swiss compositions cryd out with a kind of laugh is our musick then to receive further improvements from switzerland  this alarmed the

the strict rules of the society they have been so partial as to take my own testimonial and admit me into that select body i could not restrain the vanity of publishing to the world the honour which is done me it is no small satisfaction that i have given occasion for the presidents shewing both his invention and reading to such advantage as my correspondent reports he did but it is not to be doubted there were many very proper hums and pauses in his harangue which lose their ugliness in the narration and which my correspondent begging his pardon has no very good talent at representing i very much approve of the contempt the society has of beauty nothing ought to be laudable in a man in which his will is not concerned therefore our society can follow nature and where she has thought fit as it were to mock herself we can do so too and be merry upon the occasion mr spectator  your making publick the late trouble i gave you you will find to have been the occasion of this who should

spectator has made honourable mention of the club man and published to the world his sincere desire to be a member with a recommendatory description of his phiz and tho our constitution has made no particular provision for short faces yet his being an extraordinary case i believe we shall find an hole for him to creep in at for i assure you he is not against the canon and if his sides are as compact as his joles he need not disguise himself to make one of us i presently called for the paper to see how you looked in print and after we had regaled our selves a while upon the pleasant image of our proselite mr president told me i should be his stranger at the next nights club where we were no sooner come and pipes brought but mr president began an harangue upon your introduction to my epistle setting forth with no less volubility of speech than strength of reason that a speculation of this nature was what had been long and much wanted and that he doubted not but it would be of inestimable value to the publick in reconciling even of bodies and souls in composing and quieting the minds of men under all corporal redundancies deficiencies and irregularities whatsoever and making every one sit down content in his own carcase though it were not perhaps so mathematically put together as he could wish and again how that for want of a due consideration of what you first advance viz that our faces are not of our own choosing people had been transported beyond all good breeding and hurried themselves into unaccountable and fatal extravagancies as how many impartial lookingglasses had been censured and calumniated nay and sometimes shivered into ten thousand splinters only for a fair representation of the truth how many headstrings and garters had been made accessory and actually forfeited only because folks must needs quarrel with their own shadows and who continues he but is deeply sensible that one great source of the uneasiness and misery of human life especially amongst those of distinction arises from nothing in the world else but too severe a contemplation of an indefeasible contexture of our external parts or certain natural and invincible disposition to be fat or lean when a little more of mr spectators philosophy would take off all this and in the mean time let them observe that theres not one of their grievances of this sort but perhaps in some ages of the world has been highly in vogue and may be so again nay in some country or other ten to one is so at this day my lady ample is the most miserable woman in the world purely

longshanks as coeur de lion to the saracens before him if we look farther back into history we shall find that alexander the great wore his head a little over the left shoulder and then not a soul stirred out till he had adjusted his neckbone the whole nobility addressed the prince and each other obliquely and all matters of importance were concerted and carried on in the macedonian court with their polls on one side for about the first century nothing made more noise in the world than roman noses and then not a word of them till they revived again in eighty eight  nor is it so very long since richard the third set up half the backs of the nation and high shoulders as well as high noses were the top of the fashion but to come to our selves gentlemen tho i find by my quinquennial

election night give me leave to propose mr spectator you see his inclinations and perhaps we may not have his fellow i found most of them as it is usual in all such cases were prepared but one of the seniors whom by the by mr president had taken all this pains to bring over sate still and cocking his chin which seemed only to be levelled at his nose very gravely declared that in case he had had sufficient knowledge of you no man should have been more willing to have served you but that he for his part had always had regard to his own conscience as well as other peoples merit and he did not know but that you might be a handsome fellow for as for your own certificate it was every bodys business to speak for themselves mr president immediately retorted a handsome fellow why he is a wit sir and you know the proverb and to ease the old gentleman of his scruples cried that for matter of merit it was all one you might wear a mask this threw him into a pause and he looked desirous of three days to consider on it but mr president improved the thought and followed him up with an old story that wits were privileged to wear what masks they pleased in all ages and that a vizard had been the constant crown of their labours which was generally presented them by the hand of some satyr and sometimes of apollo himself for the truth of which he appealed to the frontispiece of several books and particularly to the english juvenal  to which he referred him and only added that such authors were the larvati  or larvâ donati of the ancients this cleared up all and in the conclusion you were chose probationer and mr president put round your health as such protesting that tho indeed he talked of a vizard he did not believe all the while you had any more occasion for it than the

is one of the greatest beauties of the age in which she lives the latter no way remarkable for any charms in her person upon this one circumstance of their outward form the good and ill of their life seems to turn lætitia has not from her very childhood heard any thing else but commendations of her features and complexion by which means she is no other than nature made her a very beautiful outside the consciousness of her charms has rendered her insupportably vain and insolent towards all who have to do with her daphne who was almost twenty before one civil thing had ever been said to her found her self obliged to acquire some accomplishments to make up for the want of those attractions which she saw in her sister poor daphne was seldom submitted to in a debate wherein she was concerned her discourse had nothing to recommend it but the good sense of it and she was always under a necessity to have very well considered what she was to say before she uttered it while lætitia was listened to with partiality and approbation sate in the countenances of those she conversed with before she communicated what she had to say these causes have produced suitable effects and lætitia is as insipid a companion as daphne is an agreeable one lætitia confident of favour has studied no arts to please daphne despairing of any inclination towards her person has depended only on her merit lætitia has always something in her air that is sullen grave and disconsolate daphne has a countenance that appears chearful open and unconcerned a young gentleman saw lætitia this winter at a play and became her captive his fortune was such that he wanted very little introduction to speak his sentiments to her father the lover was admitted with the utmost freedom into the family where a constrained behaviour severe looks and distant civilities were the highest favours he could obtain of lætitia while daphne used him with the good humour familiarity and innocence of a sister insomuch that he would often say to her dear daphne wert thou but as handsome as lætitia — she received such language with that ingenuous and pleasing mirth which is natural to a woman without design he still sighed in vain for lætitia but found certain relief in the agreeable conversation of daphne at length heartily tired with the haughty impertinence of lætitia and charmed with repeated instances of good humour he had observed in daphne he one day told the latter that he had something to say to her he hoped she would be pleased with — faith daphne continued he i am in love with thee and despise thy sister sincerely the manner of his declaring himself gave his mistress occasion for a very hearty laughter — nay says he i knew you would laugh at me but ill ask your father he did so the father received his intelligence with no less joy than surprize and was very glad he had now no care left but for his beauty which he thought he could carry to market at his leisure i do not know any thing that has pleased me so much a great while as this conquest of my friend daphnes all her acquaintance congratulate her upon her chance medley and laugh at that premeditating murderer her sister as it is an argument of a light mind to think the worse of our selves for the imperfections of our persons it is equally below us to value our selves upon the advantages of them the female world seem to be almost incorrigibly gone astray in this particular for which reason i shall recommend the following extract out of a friends letter to the professd beauties who are a people almost as unsufferable as the professd wits monsieur st evremont  has concluded one of his essays with affirming that the last sighs of a handsome woman are not so much for the loss of her life as of her beauty perhaps this raillery is pursued too far yet it is turnd upon a very obvious remark that womans strongest passion is for her own beauty and that she values it as her favourite distinction from hence it is that all arts which pretend to improve or preserve it meet with so general a reception among the sex to say nothing of many false helps and contraband wares of beauty which are daily vended in this great mart there is not a maidengentlewoman of a good family in any county of southbritain who has not heard of the virtues of maydew or is unfurnished with some receipt or other in favour of her complexion and i have known a physician of learning and sense after eight years study in the university and a course of travels into most countries of europe owe the first raising of his fortunes to a cosmetick wash  this has given me occasion to consider how so universal a disposition in womankind which springs from a laudable motive the desire of pleasing and proceeds upon an opinion not altogether groundless that nature may be helped by art may be turnd to their advantage and methinks it would be an acceptable service to take them out of the hands of quacks and pretenders and to prevent their imposing upon themselves by discovering to them the true secret and art of improving beauty  in order to this before i touch upon it directly it will be necessary to lay down a few preliminary maxims viz  • that no woman can be handsome by the force of features alone any more than she can be witty only by the help of speech  • that pride destroys all symmetry and grace and affectation is a more terrible enemy to fine faces than the smallpox  • that no woman is capable of being beautiful who is not incapable of being false  • and that what would be odious in a friend is deformity in a mistress from these few principles thus laid down it will be easie to prove that the true art of assisting beauty consists in embellishing the whole person by the proper ornaments of virtuous and commendable qualities by this help alone it is that those who are the favourite work of nature or as mr dryden expresses it the porcelain clay of human kind  become animated and are in a capacity of exerting their charms and those who seem to have been neglected by her like models wrought in haste are capable in a great measure of finishing what she has left imperfect  it is methinks a low and degrading idea of that sex which was created to refine the joys and soften the cares of humanity by the most agreeable participation to consider them meerly as objects of sight this is abridging them of their natural extent of power to put them upon a level with their pictures at knellers how much nobler is the contemplation of beauty heightend by virtue and commanding our esteem and love while it draws our observation how faint and spiritless are the charms of a coquet when compard with the real loveliness of sophronias innocence piety good humour and truth virtues which add a new softness to her sex and even beautify her beauty that agreeableness which must otherwise have appeared no longer in the modest virgin is now preservd in the tender mother the prudent friend and the faithful wife colours artfully spread upon canvas may entertain the eye but not affect the heart and she who takes no care to add to the natural graces of her person any excelling qualities may be allowed still to amuse as a picture but not to triumph as a beauty  when adam is introduced by milton describing eve in paradise and relating to the angel the impressions he felt upon seeing her at her first creation

it were out of the most conspicuous classes of mankind by this means i am furnished with the greatest variety of hints and materials and know every thing that passes in the different quarters and divisions not only of this great city but of the whole kingdom my readers too have the satisfaction to find that there is no rank or degree among them who have not their representative in this club and that there is always some body present who will take care of their respective interests that nothing may be written or published to the prejudice or infringement of their just rights and privileges  i last night sat very late in company with this select body of friends who entertaind me with several remarks which they and others had made upon these my speculations as also with the various success which they had met with among their several ranks and degrees of readers will honeycomb told me in the softest manner he could that there were some ladies but for your comfort says will they are not those of the most wit that were offended at the liberties i had taken with the opera and the puppetshow that some of them were likewise very much surprizd that i should think such serious points as the dress and equipage of persons of quality proper subjects for raillery  he was going on when sir andrew freeport took him up short and told him that the papers he hinted at had done great good in the city and that all their wives and daughters were the better for them and further added that the whole city thought themselves very much obliged to me for declaring my generous intentions to scourge vice and folly as they appear in a multitude without condescending to be a publisher of particular intrigues and cuckoldoms in short says sir andrew if you avoid that foolish beaten road of falling upon aldermen and citizens and employ your pen upon the vanity and luxury of courts your paper must needs be of general use  upon this my friend the templar told sir andrew that he wondered to hear a man of his sense talk after that manner that the city had always been the province for satyr and that the wits of king charless time jested upon nothing else during his whole reign he then shewed by the examples of horace juvenal boileau and the best writers of every age that the follies of the stage and court had never been accounted too sacred for ridicule how great soever the persons might be that patronized them but after all says he i think your raillery has made too great an excursion in attacking several persons of the inns of court and i do not believe you can shew me any precedent for your behaviour in that particular my good friend sir roger de coverley who had said nothing all this while began his speech with a pish and told us that he wondered to see so many men of sense so very serious upon fooleries let our good friend says he attack every one that deserves it i would only advise you mr spectator applying himself to me to take care how you meddle with country squires they are the ornaments of the english nation men of good heads and sound bodies and let me tell you some of them take it ill of you that you mention foxhunters with so little respect  captain sentry spoke very sparingly on this occasion what he said was only to commend my prudence in not touching upon the army and advised me to continue to act discreetly in that point  by this time i found every subject of my speculations was taken away from me by one or other of the club and began to think my self in the condition of the good man that had one wife who took a dislike to his grey hairs and another to his black till by their picking out what each of them had an aversion to they left his head altogether bald and naked  while i was thus musing with my self my worthy friend the clergyman who very luckily for me was at the club that night undertook my cause he told us that he wondered any order of persons should think themselves too considerable to be advisd that it was not quality but innocence which exempted men from reproof that vice and folly ought to be attacked whereever they could be met with and especially when they were placed in high and conspicuous stations of life he further added that my paper would only serve to aggravate the pains of poverty if it chiefly exposd those who are already depressed and in some measure turnd into ridicule by the meanness of their conditions and circumstances he afterwards proceeded to take notice of the great use this paper might be of to the publick by reprehending those vices which are too trivial for the chastisement of the law and too fantastical for the cognizance of the pulpit he then advised me to prosecute my undertaking with chearfulness and assured me that whoever might be displeased with me i should be approved by all those whose praises do honour to the persons on whom they are bestowed the whole club pays a particular deference to the discourse of this gentleman and are drawn into what he says as much by the candid and ingenuous manner with which he delivers himself as by the strength of argument and force of reason which he makes use of will honeycomb immediately agreed that what he had said was right and that for his part he would not insist upon the quarter which he had demanded for the ladies sir andrew gave up the city with the same frankness the templar would not stand out and was followed by sir roger and the captain who all agreed that i should be at liberty to carry the war into what quarter i pleased provided i continued to combat with criminals in a body and to assault the vice without hurting the person  this debate which was held for the good of mankind put me in mind of that which the roman triumvirate were formerly engaged in for their destruction every man at first stood hard for his friend till they found that by this means they should spoil their proscription and at length making a sacrifice of all their acquaintance

authors are more apt to miscarry than in works of humour as there is none in which they are more ambitious to excell it is not an imagination that teems with monsters an head that is filled with extravagant conceptions which is capable of furnishing the world with diversions of this nature and yet if we look into the productions of several writers who set up for men of humour what wild irregular fancies what unnatural distortions of thought do we meet with if they speak nonsense they believe they are talking humour and when they have drawn together a scheme of absurd inconsistent ideas they are not able to read it over to themselves without laughing these poor gentlemen endeavour to gain themselves the reputation of wits and humourists by such monstrous conceits as almost qualify them for bedlam not considering that humour should always lye under the check of reason and that it requires the direction of the nicest judgment by so much the more as it indulges it self in the most boundless freedoms there is a kind of nature that is to be observed in this sort of compositions as well as in all other and a certain regularity of thought which  must discover the writer to be a man of sense at the same time that he appears altogether given up to caprice for my part when i read the delirious mirth of an unskilful author i cannot be so barbarous as to divert my self with it but am rather apt to pity the man than to laugh at any thing he writes  the deceased mr shadwell who had himself a great deal of the talent which i am treating of represents an empty rake in one of his plays as very much surprized to hear one say that breaking of windows was not humour  and i question not but several english readers will be as much startled to hear me affirm that many of those raving incoherent pieces which are often spread among us under odd chimerical titles are rather the offsprings of a distempered brain than works of humour  it is indeed much easier to describe what is not humour than what is and very difficult to define it otherwise than as cowley has done wit by negatives were i to give my own notions of it i would deliver them after platos manner in a kind of allegory and by supposing humour to be a person deduce to him all his qualifications according to the following genealogy truth was the founder of the family and the father of good sense good sense was the father of wit who married a lady of a collateral line called mirth by whom he had issue humour humour therefore being the youngest of this illustrious family and descended from parents of such different dispositions is very various and unequal in his temper sometimes you see him putting on grave looks and a solemn habit sometimes airy in his behaviour and fantastick in his dress insomuch that at different times he appears as serious as a judge and as jocular as a merryandrew but as he has a great deal of the mother in his constitution whatever mood he is in he never fails to make his company laugh  but since there is an impostor  abroad who takes upon him  the name of this young gentleman and would willingly pass for him in the world to the end that wellmeaning persons may not be imposed upon by cheats  i would desire my readers when they meet with this pretender  to look into his parentage and to examine him strictly whether or no he be remotely allied to truth and lineally descended from good sense if not they may conclude him a counterfeit they may likewise distinguish him by a loud and excessive laughter in which he seldom gets his company to join with him for as true humour generally looks serious whilst every body laughs about him  false humour is always laughing whilst every body about him looks serious i shall only add if he has not in him a mixture of both parents that is if he would pass for the offspring of wit without mirth or mirth without wit you may conclude him to be altogether spurious and a cheat  the impostor of whom i am speaking descends originally from falsehood who was the mother of nonsense who was brought to bed of a son called frenzy who married one of the daughters of folly commonly known by the name of laughter on whom he begot that monstrous infant of which i have been here speaking i shall set down at length the genealogical table of false humour and at the same time place under it the genealogy of true humour that the reader may at one view behold their different pedigrees and relations  falsehood truth   nonsense good sense      frenzylaughter    witmirth   false humour humour   i might extend the allegory by mentioning several of the children of false humour who are more in number than the sands of the sea and might in particular enumerate the many sons and daughters which he has begot in this island but as this would be a very invidious task i shall only observe in general that false humour differs from the true as a monkey does from a man    he is exceedingly given to little apish tricks and buffooneries    he so much delights in mimickry that it is all one to him whether he exposes by it vice and folly luxury and avarice or on the contrary virtue and wisdom pain and poverty    he is wonderfully unlucky insomuch that he will bite the hand that feeds him and endeavour to ridicule both friends and foes indifferently for having but small talents he must be merry where he can not where he should    being entirely void of reason he pursues no point either of morality or instruction but is ludicrous only for the sake of being so    being incapable of any thing but mockrepresentations his ridicule is always personal and aimed at the vicious man or the writer not at the vice or at the writing i have here only pointed at the whole species of false humourists but as one of my principal designs in this paper is to beat down that malignant spirit which discovers it self in the writings of the present age i shall not scruple for the future to single out any of the small wits that infest the world with such compositions as are illnatured immoral and absurd this is the only exception which i shall make to the general rule i have prescribed my self of attacking multitudes since every honest man ought to look upon himself as in a natural state of war with the libeller and lampooner and to annoy them whereever they fall in his way this is but

certain lady whom i shall here call by the name of leonora and as it contained matters of consequence desired me to deliver it to her with my own hand accordingly i waited upon her ladyship pretty early in the morning and was desired by her woman to walk into her ladys library till such time as she was in a readiness to receive me the very sound of a ladys library gave me a great curiosity to see it and as it was some time before the lady came to me i had an opportunity of turning over a great many of her books which were ranged together in a very beautiful order at the end of the folios which were finely bound and gilt were great jars of china placed one above another in a very noble piece of architecture the quartos were separated from the octavos by a pile of smaller vessels which rose in a delightful  pyramid the octavos were bounded by tea dishes of all shapes colours and sizes which were so disposed on a wooden frame that they looked like one continued pillar indented with the finest strokes of sculpture and stained with the greatest variety of dyes that part of the library which was designed for the reception of plays and pamphlets and other loose papers was enclosed in a kind of square consisting of one of the prettiest grotesque works that ever i saw and made up of scaramouches lions monkies mandarines trees shells and a thousand other odd figures in china ware in the midst of the room was a little japan table with a quire of gilt paper upon it and on the paper a silver snuffbox made in the shape of a little book i found there were several other counterfeit books upon the upper shelves which were carved in wood and served only to fill up the number like fagots in the muster of a regiment i was wonderfully pleased with such a mixt kind of furniture as seemed very suitable both to the lady and the scholar and did not know at first whether i should fancy my self in a grotto or in a library  upon my looking into the books i found there were some few which the lady had bought for her own use but that most of them had been got together either because she had heard them praised or because she had seen the authors of them among several that i examind i very well remember these that follow   • oglebys virgil  • drydens juvenal  • cassandra  • cleopatra  • astræa  • sir isaac newtons works  • the grand cyrus with a pin stuck in one of the middle leaves  • pembrokes arcadia  • locke of human understanding with a paper of patches in it  • a spellingbook  • a dictionary for the explanation of hard words  • sherlock upon death  • the fifteen comforts of matrimony  • sir william temptles essays  • father malbranches search after truth translated into english  • a book of novels  • the academy of compliments  • culpeppers midwifry  • the ladies calling  • tales in verse by mr durfey bound in red leather gilt on the back and doubled down in several places  • all the classick authors in wood  • a set of elzevers by the same hand  • clelia which opened of it self in the place that describes two lovers in a bower  • bakers chronicle  • advice to a daughter  • the new atalantis with a key to it  • mr steels christian heroe  • a prayer book with a bottle of hungary water by the side of it  • dr sacheverells speech  • fieldings tryal  • senecas morals  • taylors holy living and dying  • la fertes instructions for country dances i was taking a catalogue in my pocketbook of these and several other authors when leonora entred and upon my presenting her with the letter from the knight told me with an unspeakable grace that she hoped sir roger was in good health i answered yes for i hate long speeches and after a bow or two retired leonora was formerly a celebrated beauty and is still a very lovely woman she has been a widow for two or three years and being unfortunate in her first marriage has taken a resolution never to venture upon a second she has no children to take care of and leaves the management of her estate to my good friend sir roger but as the mind naturally sinks into a kind of lethargy and falls asleep that is not agitated by some favourite pleasures and pursuits leonora has turned all the passions of her sex into a love of books and retirement she converses chiefly with men as she has often said herself but it is only in their writings and admits of very few malevisitants except my friend sir roger whom she hears with great pleasure and without scandal as her reading has lain very much among romances it has given her a very particular turn of thinking and discovers it self even in her house her gardens and her furniture sir roger has entertained me an hour together with a description of her countryseat which is situated in a kind of wilderness about an hundred miles distant from london and looks like a little enchanted palace the rocks about her are shaped into artificial grottoes covered with woodbines and jessamines the woods are cut into shady walks twisted into bowers and filled with cages of turtles the springs are made to run among pebbles and by that means taught to murmur very agreeably they are likewise collected into a beautiful lake that is inhabited by a couple of swans and empties it self by a little rivulet which runs through a green meadow and is known in the family by the name of the purling stream the knight likewise tells me that this lady preserves her game better than any of the gentlemen in the country not says sir roger that she sets so great a value upon her partridges and pheasants as upon her larks and nightingales for she says that every bird which is killed in her ground will spoil a consort and that she shall certainly miss him the next year  when i think how odly this lady is improved by learning i look upon her with a mixture of admiration and pity amidst these innocent entertainments which she has formed to her self how much more valuable does she appear than those of her sex who  employ themselves in diversions that are less reasonable tho more in fashion what improvements would a woman have made who is so susceptible of impressions from what she reads had she been guided to such books as have a tendency to enlighten the understanding and rectify the passions as well as to those which are of little more use than to divert the imagination  but the manner of a ladys employing her self usefully in reading shall be the subject of another paper in which i design to recommend such particular books as may be proper for the improvement of the sex and as this is a subject of a very nice nature i shall desire

friday april         steele   cupias non placuisse nimis  mart   a late conversation which i fell into gave me an opportunity of observing a great deal of beauty in a very handsome woman and as much wit in an ingenious man turned into deformity in the one and absurdity in the other by the meer force of affectation the fair one had something in her person upon which her thoughts were fixed that she attempted to shew to advantage in every look word and gesture the gentleman was as diligent to do justice to his fine parts as the lady to her beauteous form you might see his imagination on the stretch to find out something uncommon and what they call bright to entertain her while she writhed her self into as many different postures to engage him when she laughed her lips were to sever at a greater distance than ordinary to shew her teeth her fan was to point to somewhat at a distance that in the reach she may discover the roundness of her arm then she is utterly mistaken in what she saw falls back smiles at her own folly and is so wholly discomposed that her tucker is to be adjusted her bosom exposed and the whole woman put into new airs and graces while she was doing all this the gallant had time to think of something very pleasant to say next to her or make some unkind observation on some other lady to feed her vanity these unhappy effects of affectation naturally led me to look into that strange state of mind which so generally discolours the behaviour of most people we meet with  the learned dr burnet  in his theory of the earth takes occasion to observe that every thought is attended with consciousness and representativeness the mind has nothing presented to it but what is immediately followed by a reflection or conscience which tells you whether that which was so presented is graceful or unbecoming this act of the mind discovers it self in the gesture by a proper behaviour in those whose consciousness goes no further than to direct them in the just progress of their present thought or action but betrays an interruption in every second thought when the consciousness is employed in too fondly approving a mans own conceptions which sort of consciousness is what we call affectation  as the love of praise is implanted in our bosoms as a strong incentive to worthy actions it is a very difficult task to get above a desire of it for things that should be wholly indifferent women whose hearts are fixed upon the pleasure they have in the consciousness that they are the objects of love and admiration are ever changing the air of their countenances and altering the attitude of their bodies to strike the hearts of their beholders with new sense of their beauty the dressing part of our sex whose minds are the same with the sillyer part of the other are exactly in the like uneasy condition to be regarded for a welltied cravat an hat cocked with an unusual briskness a very wellchosen coat or other instances of merit which they are impatient to see unobserved  but this apparent affectation arising from an illgoverned consciousness is not so much to be wonderd at in such loose and trivial minds as these but when you see it reign in characters of worth and distinction it is what you cannot but lament not without some indignation it creeps into the heart of the wise man as well as that of the coxcomb when you see a man of sense look about for applause and discover an itching inclination to be commended lay traps for a little incense even from those whose opinion he values in nothing but his own favour who is safe against this weakness or who knows whether he is guilty of it or not the best way to get clear of such a light fondness for applause is to take all possible care to throw off the love of it upon occasions that are not in themselves laudable but as it appears we hope for no praise from them of this nature are all graces in mens persons dress and bodily deportment which will naturally be winning and attractive if we think not of them but lose their force in proportion to our endeavour to make them such  when our consciousness turns upon the main design of life and our thoughts are employed upon the chief purpose either in business or pleasure we shall never betray an affectation for we cannot be guilty of it but when we give the passion for praise an unbridled liberty our pleasure in little perfections robs us of what is due to us for great virtues and worthy qualities how many excellent speeches and honest actions are lost for want of being indifferent where we ought men are oppressed with regard to their way of speaking and acting instead of having their thought bent upon what they should do or say and by that means bury a capacity for great things by their fear of failing in indifferent things this perhaps cannot be called affectation but it has some tincture of it at least so far as that their fear of erring in a thing of no consequence argues they would be too much pleased in performing it  it is only from a thorough disregard to himself in such particulars that a man can act with a laudable sufficiency his heart is fixed upon one point in view and he commits no errors because he thinks nothing an error but what deviates from that intention  the wild havock affectation makes in that part of the world which should be most polite is visible where ever we turn our eyes it pushes men not only into impertinencies in conversation but also in their premeditated speeches at the bar it torments the bench whose business it is to cut off all superfluities in what is spoken before it by the practitioner as well as several little pieces of injustice which arise from the law it self i have seen it make a man run from the purpose before a judge who was when at the bar himself so close and logical a pleader that with all the pomp of eloquence in his power he never spoke a word too much   it might be born even here but it often ascends the pulpit it self and the declaimer in that sacred place is frequently so impertinently witty speaks of the last day it self with so many quaint phrases that there is no man who understands raillery but must resolve to sin no more nay you may behold him sometimes in prayer for a proper delivery of the great truths he is to utter humble himself with so very well turned phrase and mention his own unworthiness in a way so very becoming

possession of it till proper periods of life or death it self if you would not rather be commended than be praiseworthy contemn little merits and allow no man to be so free with you as to praise you

but what a christian writer would be ashamed to own falls infinitely short of it in the moral part of the performance  this i may  shew more at large hereafter and in the mean time that i may contribute something towards the improvement of the english tragedy i shall take notice in this and in other following papers of some particular parts in it that seem liable to exception  aristotle  observes that the iambick verse in the greek tongue was the most proper for tragedy because at the same time that it lifted up the discourse from prose it was that which approached nearer to it than any other kind of verse for says he we may observe that men in ordinary discourse very often speak iambicks without taking notice of it we may make the same observation of our english blank verse which often enters into our common discourse though we do not attend to it and is such a due medium between rhyme and prose that it seems wonderfully adapted to tragedy i am therefore very much offended when i see a play in rhyme which is as absurd in english as a tragedy of hexameters would have been in greek or latin the solæcism is i think still greater in those plays that have some scenes in rhyme and some in blank verse which are to be looked upon as two several languages or where we see some particular similies dignifyed with rhyme at the same time that everything about them lyes in blank verse i would not however debar the poet from concluding his tragedy or if he pleases every act of it with two or three couplets which may have the same effect as an air in the italian opera after a long recitativo and give the actor a graceful exit besides that we see a diversity of numbers in some parts of the old tragedy in order to hinder the ear from being tired with the same continued modulation of voice for the same reason i do not dislike the speeches in our english tragedy that close with an hemistick or half verse notwithstanding the person who speaks after it begins a new verse without filling up the preceding one nor with abrupt pauses and breakingsoff in the middle of a verse when they humour any passion that is expressed by it  since i am upon this subject i must observe that our english poets have succeeded much better in the style than in the sentiments of their tragedies their language is very often noble and sonorous but the sense either very trifling or very common on the contrary in the ancient tragedies and indeed in those of corneille and racine  tho the expressions are very great it is the thought that bears them up and swells them for my own part i prefer a noble sentiment that is depressed with homely language infinitely before a vulgar one that is blown up with all the sound and energy of expression whether this defect in our tragedies may arise from want of genius knowledge or experience in the writers or from their compliance with the vicious taste of their readers who are better judges of the language than of the sentiments and consequently relish the one more than the other i cannot determine but i believe it might rectify the conduct both of the one and of the other if the writer laid down the whole contexture of his dialogue in plain english before he turned it into blank verse and if the reader after the perusal of a scene would consider the naked thought of every speech in it when divested of all its tragick ornaments by this means without being imposed upon by words we may judge impartially of the thought and consider whether it be natural or great enough for the person that utters it whether it deserves to shine in such a blaze of eloquence or shew itself in such a variety of lights as are generally made use of by the writers of our english tragedy  i must in the next place observe that when our thoughts are great and just they are often obscured by the sounding phrases hard metaphors and forced expressions in which they are cloathed shakespear is often very faulty in this particular there is a fine observation in aristotle to this purpose which i have never seen quoted the expression says he ought to be very much laboured in the unactive parts of the fable as in descriptions similitudes narrations and the like in which the opinions manners and passions of men are not represented for these namely the opinions manners and passions are apt to be obscured by pompous phrases and elaborate expressions  horace who copied most of his criticisms after aristotle seems to have had his eye on the foregoing rule in the following verses et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri telephus et peleus cum pauper et exul uterque projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba si curat cor spectantis tetigisse querelâ tragedians too lay by their state to grieve peleus and telephus exitd and poor forget their swelling and gigantick words  ld roscommon among our modern english poets there is none who was better turned for tragedy than lee  if instead of favouring the impetuosity of his genius he had restrained it and kept it within its proper bounds his thoughts are wonderfully suited to tragedy but frequently lost in such a cloud of words that it is hard to see the beauty of them there is an infinite fire in his works but so involved in smoak that it does not appear in half its lustre he frequently succeeds in the passionate parts of the tragedy but more particularly where he slackens his efforts and eases the style of those epithets and metaphors in which he so much abounds what can be more natural more soft or more passionate than that line in statiras speech where she describes the charms of alexanders conversation then he would talk good gods how he would talk that unexpected break in the line and turning the description of his manner of talking into an admiration of it is inexpressibly beautiful and wonderfully suited to the fond character of the person that speaks it there is a simplicity in the words that outshines the utmost pride of expression  otway  has followed nature in the language of his tragedy and therefore shines in the passionate parts more than any of our english poets as there is something familiar and domestick in the fable of his tragedy more than in those of any other poet he has little pomp but great force in his expressions for which reason though he has admirably succeeded in the tender and melting part of his tragedies he sometimes falls into too great a familiarity of phrase in those parts which by aristotles rule ought to have been raised and supported by the dignity of expression it has been observed by others that this poet has founded his tragedy of venice preserved on so wrong a plot that the greatest characters in it are those of rebels and traitors had the hero of his play discovered the same good qualities in the defence of his country that he showed for its ruin and subversion the audience could not enough pity and admire him but as he is now represented we can only say of him what the roman historian says of catiline that his fall would have been glorious si pro patriâ sic concidisset had he so fallen in the service of his country  c      footnote     from seneca on providence de providentiâ sive quare

laudare maligne ille per extentum funem mihi fosse videtur ire poeta meum qui pectus inaniter angit irritat mulcet falsis terroribus implet ut magus et modo me thebis modo ponit athenis  hor   the english writers of tragedy are possessed with a notion that when they represent a virtuous or innocent person in distress they ought not to leave him till they have delivered him out of his troubles or made him triumph over his enemies this error they have been led into by a ridiculous doctrine in modern criticism that they are obliged to an equal distribution of rewards and punishments and an impartial execution of poetical justice who were the first that established this rule i know not but i am sure it has no foundation in nature in reason or in the practice of the ancients we find that good and evil happen alike to all men on this side the grave and as the principal design of tragedy is to raise commiseration and terror in the minds of the audience we shall defeat this great end if we always make virtue and innocence happy and successful whatever crosses and disappointments a good man suffers in the body of the tragedy they will make but small impression on our minds when we know that in the last act he is to arrive at the end of his wishes and desires when we see him engaged in the depth of his afflictions we are apt to comfort our selves because we are sure he will find his way out of them and that his grief how great soever it may be at present will soon terminate in gladness for this reason the ancient writers of tragedy treated men in their plays as they are dealt with in the world by making virtue sometimes happy and sometimes miserable as they found it in the fable which they made choice of or as it might affect their audience in the most agreeable manner aristotle considers the tragedies that were written in either of these kinds and observes that those which ended unhappily had always pleased the people and carried away the prize in the publick disputes of the stage from those that ended happily  terror and commiseration leave a pleasing anguish in the mind and fix the audience in such a serious composure of thought as is much more lasting and delightful than any little transient starts of joy and satisfaction accordingly we find that more of our english tragedies have succeeded in which the favourites of the audience sink under their calamities than those in which they recover themselves out of them the best plays of this kind are the orphan venice preserved alexander the great theodosius all for love œdipus oroonoko othello  c king lear is an admirable tragedy of the same kind as shakespear wrote it but as it is reformed according to the chymerical notion of poetical justice in my humble opinion it has lost half its beauty at the same time i must allow that there are very noble tragedies which have been framed upon the other plan and have ended happily as indeed most of the good tragedies which have been written since the starting of the abovementioned criticism have taken this turn as the mourning bride tamerlane ulysses phædra and hippolitus with most of mr drydens  i must also allow that many of shakespears and several of the celebrated tragedies of antiquity are cast in the same form i do not therefore dispute against this way of writing tragedies but against the criticism that would establish this as the only method and by that means would very much cramp the english tragedy and perhaps give a wrong bent to the genius of our writers  the tragicomedy which is the product of the english theatre is one of the most monstrous inventions that ever entered into a poets thoughts an author might as well think of weaving the adventures of æneas and hudibras into one poem as of writing such a motly piece of mirth and sorrow but the absurdity of these performances is so very visible that i shall not insist upon it  the same objections which are made to tragicomedy may in some measure be applied to all tragedies that have a double plot in them which are likewise more frequent upon the english stage than upon any other for though the grief of the audience in such performances be not changed into another passion as in tragicomedies it is diverted upon another object which weakens their concern for the principal action and breaks the tide of sorrow by throwing it into different channels this inconvenience however may in a great measure be cured if not wholly removed by the skilful choice of an underplot which may bear such a near relation to the principal design as to contribute towards the completion of it and be concluded by the same catastrophe  there is also another particular which may be reckoned among the blemishes or rather the false beauties of our english tragedy i mean those particular speeches which are commonly known by the name of rants the warm and passionate parts of a tragedy are always the most taking with the audience for which reason we often see the players pronouncing in all the violence of action several parts of the tragedy which the author writ with great temper and designed that they should have been so acted i have seen powell very often raise himself a loud clap by this artifice the poets that were acquainted with this secret have given frequent occasion for such emotions in the actor by adding vehemence to words where there was no passion or inflaming a real passion into fustian this hath filled the mouths of our heroes with bombast and given them such sentiments as proceed rather from a swelling than a greatness of mind unnatural exclamations curses vows blasphemies a defiance of mankind and an outraging of the gods frequently pass upon the audience for towring thoughts and have accordingly met with infinite applause  i shall here add a remark which i am afraid our tragick writers may make an ill use of as our heroes are generally lovers their swelling and blustring upon the stage very much recommends them to the fair part of their audience the ladies are wonderfully pleased to see a man insulting kings or affronting the gods in one scene and throwing himself at the feet of his mistress in another let him behave himself insolently towards the men and abjectly towards the fair one and it is ten to one but he proves a favourite of the boxes dryden and lee in several of their tragedies have practised this secret with good success  but to shew how a rant pleases beyond the most just and natural thought that is not pronounced with vehemence i would desire the reader when he sees the tragedy of œdipus to observe how quietly the hero is dismissed at the end of the third act after having pronounced the following lines in which the thought is very natural and apt to move compassion to you good gods i make my last appeal or clear my virtues or my crimes reveal if in the maze of fate i blindly run and backward trod those paths i sought to shun impute my errors to your own decree my hands are guilty but my heart is free let us then observe with what thunderclaps of applause he leaves the stage after the impieties and execrations at the end of the fourth act  and you will wonder to see an audience so cursed and so pleased at the same time o that as oft have at athens seen where by the way there was no stage till many years after œdipus the stage arise and the big clouds descend so now in very deed i might behold this pondrous globe and all yen marble roof meet like the hands of jove and crush mankind for all the elements c      footnote     here aristotle is not quite accurately quoted

on his side i have indeed very long observed this evil and distinguished those of our women who wear their own from those in borrowed complexions by the picts and the british there does not need any great discernment to judge which are which the british have a lively animated aspect the picts tho never so beautiful have dead uninformed countenances the muscles of a real face sometimes swell with soft passion sudden surprize and are flushed with agreeable confusions according as the objects before them or the ideas presented to them affect their imagination but the picts behold all things with the same air whether they are joyful or sad the same fixed insensibility appears upon all occasions a pict tho she takes all that pains to invite the approach of lovers is obliged to keep them at a certain distance a sigh in a languishing lover if fetched too near her would dissolve a feature and a kiss snatched by a forward one might transfer the complexion of the mistress to the admirer it is hard to speak of these false fair ones without saying something uncomplaisant but i would only recommend to them to consider how they like coming into a room new painted they may assure themselves the near approach of a lady who uses this practice is much more offensive  will honeycomb told us one day an adventure he once had with a pict this lady had wit as well as beauty at will and made it her

provocation her illnature and vanity made my friend very easily proof against the charms of her wit and conversation but her beauteous form instead of being blemished by her falshood and inconstancy every day increased upon him and she had new attractions every time he saw her when she observed will irrevocably her slave she began to use him as such and after many steps towards such a cruelty she at last utterly banished him the unhappy lover strove in vain by servile epistles to revoke his doom till at length he was forced to the last refuge a round sum of money to her maid this corrupt attendant placed him early in the morning behind the hangings in her mistresss dressingroom he stood very conveniently to observe without being seen the pict begins the face she designed to wear that day and i have heard him protest she had worked a full half hour before he knew her to be the same woman as soon as he saw the dawn of that complexion for which he had so long languished he thought fit to break from his concealment repeating that of cowley th adorning thee with so much art is but a barbarous skill tis like the poisning of a dart too apt before to kill  the pict stood before him in the utmost confusion with the prettiest smirk imaginable on the finished side of her face pale as ashes on the other honeycomb seized all her gallypots and washes and carried off his han kerchief full of brushes scraps of spanish wool and phials of unguents the lady went into the country the lover was cured  it is certain no faith ought to be kept with cheats and an oath made to a pict is of it self void i would therefore exhort all the british ladies to single them out nor do i know any but lindamira who should be exempt from discovery for her own complexion is so delicate that she ought to be allowed the covering it with paint as a punishment for choosing to be the worst piece of art extant instead of the masterpiece of nature as for my part who have no expectations from women and

violas imitata veneno  hor   aristotle  has observed that ordinary writers in tragedy endeavour to raise terror and pity in their audience not by proper sentiments and expressions but by the dresses and decorations of the stage there is something of this kind very ridiculous in the english theatre when the author has a mind to terrify us it thunders when he would make us melancholy the stage is darkened but among all our tragick artifices i am the most offended at those which are made use of to inspire us with magnificent ideas of the persons that speak the ordinary method of making an hero is to clap a huge plume of feathers upon his head which rises so very high that there is often a greater length from his chin to the top of his head than to the sole of his foot one would believe that we thought a great man and a tall man the same thing this very much embarrasses the actor who is forced to hold his neck extremely stiff and steady all the while he speaks and notwithstanding any anxieties which he pretends for his mistress his country or his friends one may see by his action that his greatest care and concern is to keep the plume of feathers from falling off his head for my own part when i see a man uttering his complaints under such a mountain of feathers i am apt to look upon him rather as an unfortunate lunatick than a distressed hero as these superfluous ornaments upon the head make a great man a princess generally receives her grandeur from those additional incumbrances that fall into her tail i mean the broad sweeping train that follows her in all her motions and finds constant employment for a boy who stands behind her to open and spread it to advantage i do not know how others are affected at this sight but i must confess my eyes are wholly taken up with the pages part and as for the queen i am not so attentive to any thing she speaks as to the right adjusting of her train lest it should chance to trip up her heels or incommode her as she walks to and fro upon the stage it is in my opinion a very odd spectacle to see a queen venting her passion in a disordered motion and a little boy taking care all the while that they do not ruffle the tail of her gown the parts that the two persons act on the stage at the same time are very different the princess is afraid lest she should incur the displeasure of the king her father or lose the hero her lover whilst her attendant is only concerned lest she should entangle her feet in her petticoat  we are told that an ancient tragick poet to move the pity of his audience for his exiled kings and distressed heroes used to make the actors represent them in dresses and cloaths that were threadbare and decayed this artifice for moving pity seems as illcontrived as that we have been speaking of to inspire us with a great idea of the persons introduced upon the stage in short i would have our conceptions raised by the dignity of thought and sublimity of expression rather than by a train of robes or a plume of feathers  another mechanical method of making great men and adding dignity to kings and queens is to accompany them with halberts and battleaxes two or three shifters of scenes with the two candlesnuffers make up a compleat body of guards upon the english stage and by the addition of a few porters dressed in red coats can represent above a dozen legions i have sometimes seen a couple of armies drawn up together upon the stage when the poet has been disposed to do honour to his generals it is impossible for the readers imagination to multiply twenty men into such prodigious multitudes or to fancy that two or three hundred thousand soldiers are fighting in a room of forty or fifty yards in compass incidents of such a nature should be told not represented non tamen intus digna geri promes in scenam multaque tolles ex oculis qua mox narret facundia prœsens  hor   yet there are things improper for a scene which men of judgment only will relate  l roscom i should therefore in this particular recommend to my countrymen the example of the french stage where the kings and queens always appear unattended and leave their guards behind the scenes i should likewise be glad if we imitated the french in banishing from our stage the noise of drums trumpets and huzzas which is sometimes so very great that when there is a battle in the haymarket theatre one may hear it as far as charingcross  i have here only touched upon those particulars which are made use of to raise and aggrandize persons in tragedy and shall shew in another paper the several expedients which are practised by authors of a vulgar genius to move terror pity or admiration in their hearers  the tailor and the painter often contribute to the success of a tragedy more than the poet scenes affect ordinary minds as much as speeches and our actors are very sensible that a welldressed play his sometimes brought them as full audiences as a wellwritten one the italians have a very good phrase to express this art of imposing upon the spectators by appearances they call it the fourberia della scena the knavery or trickish part of the drama but however the show and outside of the tragedy may work upon the vulgar the more understanding part of the audience immediately see through it and despise it  a good poet will give the reader a more lively idea of an army or a battle in a description than if he actually saw them drawn up in squadrons and battalions or engaged in the confusion of a fight our minds should be opened to great conceptions and inflamed with glorious sentiments by what the actor speaks more than by what he appears can all the trappings or equipage of a king or hero give brutus half that pomp and majesty which he receives from a few lines in shakespear  c

that would gravel them and put an end to their enquiries which dull fellows do not make for information but for exercise i do not know but this may be a very good way of accounting for what we frequently see to wit that dull fellows prove very good men of business business relieves them from their own natural heaviness by furnishing them with what to do whereas business to mercurial men is an interruption from their real existence and happiness tho the dull part of mankind are harmless in their amusements it were to be wished they had no vacant time because they usually undertake something that makes their wants conspicuous by their manner of supplying them you shall seldom find a dull fellow of good education but if he happens to have any leisure upon his hands will turn his head to one of those two amusements for all fools of eminence politicks or poetry the former of these arts is the study of all dull people in general but when dulness is lodged in a person of a quick animal life it generally exerts it self in poetry one might here mention a few military writers who give great entertainment to the age by reason that the stupidity of their heads is quickened by the alacrity of their hearts this constitution in a dull fellow gives vigour to nonsense and makes the puddle boil which would otherwise stagnate the british prince that celebrated poem which was written

as stupid he could not in the warmth and hurry of nonsense have been capable of forgetting that neither prince voltager nor his grandfather could strip a naked man of his doublet but a fool of a colder constitution would have staid to have flead the pict and made buff of his skin for the wearing of the conqueror  to bring these observations to some useful purpose of life what i would propose

addison   tu quid ego et populus mecum desideret audi  hor   among the several artifices which are put in practice by the poets to fill the minds of an  audience with terror the first place is due to thunder and lightning which are often made use of at the descending of a god or the rising of a ghost at the vanishing of a devil or at the death of a tyrant i have known a bell introduced into several tragedies with good effect and have seen the whole assembly in a very great alarm all the while it has been ringing but there is nothing which delights and terrifies our english theatre so much as a ghost especially when he appears in a bloody shirt a spectre has very often saved a play though he has done nothing but stalked across the stage or rose through a cleft of it and sunk again without speaking one word there may be a proper season for these several terrors and when they only come in as aids and assistances to the poet they are not only to be excused but to be applauded thus the sounding of the clock in venice preserved  makes the hearts of the whole audience quake and conveys a stronger terror to the mind than it is possible for words to do the appearance of the ghost in hamlet is a masterpiece in its kind and wrought up with all the circumstances that can create either attention or horror the mind of the reader is wonderfully prepared for his reception by the discourses that precede it his dumb behaviour at his first entrance strikes the imagination very strongly but every time he enters he is still more terrifying who can read the speech with which young hamlet accosts him without trembling  hor look my lord it comes ham angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd bring with thee airs from heavn or blasts from hell be thy events wicked or charitable thou comst in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee ill call thee hamlet king father royal dane oh oh answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canonizd bones hearsed in death have burst their cearments why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd hath opd his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead coarse again in compleat steel revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous   i do not therefore find fault with the artifices abovementioned when they are introduced with skill and accompanied by proportionable sentiments and expressions in the writing  for the moving of pity our principal machine is the handkerchief and indeed in our common tragedies we should not know very often that the persons are in distress by any thing they say if they did not from time to time apply their handkerchiefs to their eyes far be it from me to think of banishing this instrument of sorrow from the stage i know a tragedy could not subsist without it all that i would contend for is to keep it from being misapplied in a word i would have the actors tongue sympathize with his eyes  a disconsolate mother with a child in her hand has frequently drawn compassion from the audience and has therefore gained a place in several tragedies a modern writer that observed how this had took in other plays being resolved to double the distress and melt his audience twice as much as those before him had done brought a princess upon the stage with a little boy in one hand and a girl in the other this too had a very good effect a third poet being resolved to outwrite all his predecessors a few years ago introduced three children with great success and as i am informed a young gentleman who is fully determined to break the most obdurate hearts has a tragedy by him where the first person that appears upon the stage is an afflicted widow in her mourning weeds with half a dozen fatherless children attending her like those that usually hang about the figure of charity thus several incidents that are beautiful in a good writer become ridiculous by falling into the hands of a bad one  but among all our methods of moving pity or terror there is none so absurd and barbarous and what more exposes us to the contempt and ridicule of our neighbours than that dreadful butchering of one another which is so very frequent upon the english stage to delight in seeing men stabbed poysoned racked or impaled is certainly the sign of a cruel temper and as this is often practised before the british audience several french criticks who think these are grateful spectacles to us take occasion from them to represent us as a people that delight in blood  it is indeed very odd to see our stage strowed with carcasses in the last scene of a tragedy and to observe in the wardrobe of a playhouse several daggers poniards wheels bowls for poison and many other instruments of death murders and executions are always transacted behind the scenes in the french theatre which in general is very agreeable to the manners of a polite and civilized people but as there are no exceptions to this rule on the french stage it leads them into absurdities almost as ridiculous as that which falls under our present censure i remember in the famous play of corneille written upon the subject of the horatii and curiatii the fierce young hero who had overcome the curiatii one after another instead of being congratulated by his sister for his victory being upbraided by her for having slain her lover in the height of his passion and resentment kills her if any thing could extenuate so brutal an action it would be the doing of it on a sudden before the sentiments of nature reason or manhood could take place in him however to avoid publick bloodshed as soon as his passion is wrought to its height he follows his sister the whole length of the stage and forbears killing her till they are both withdrawn behind the scenes i must confess had he murderd her before the audience the indecency might have been greater but as it is it appears very unnatural and looks like killing in cold blood to give my opinion upon this case the fact ought not to have been represented but to have been told if there was any occasion for it  it may not be unacceptable to the reader to see how sophocles has conducted a tragedy under the like delicate circumstances orestes was in the same condition with hamlet in shakespear his mother having murdered his father and taken possession of his kingdom in conspiracy with her adulterer that young prince therefore being determined to revenge his fathers death upon those who filled his throne conveys himself by a beautiful stratagem into his mothers apartment with a resolution to kill her but because such a spectacle would have been too shocking to the audience this dreadful resolution is executed behind the scenes the mother is heard calling out to her son for mercy and the son answering her that she shewed no mercy to his father after which she shrieks out that she is wounded and by what follows we find that she is slain i do not remember that in any of our plays there are speeches made behind the scenes though there are other instances of this nature to be met with in those of the ancients and i believe my reader will agree with me that there is something infinitely more affecting in this dreadful dialogue between the mother and her son behind the scenes than could have been in anything transacted before the audience orestes immediately after meets the usurper at the entrance of his palace and by a very happy thought of the poet avoids killing him before the audience by telling him that he should live some time in his present bitterness of soul before he would dispatch him and by ordering him to retire into that part of the palace where he had slain his father whose murther he would revenge in the very same place where it was committed by this means the poet observes that decency which horace afterwards established by a rule of forbearing to commit parricides or unnatural murthers before the audience nec coram populo natos medea trucidet  let not medea draw her murthring knife and spill her childrens blood upon the stage the french have therefore refind too much upon horaces rule who never designed to banish all kinds of death from the stage but only such as had too much horror in them and which would have a better effect upon the audience when transacted behind the scenes i would therefore recommend to my countrymen the practice of the ancient poets who were very sparing of their publick executions and rather chose to perform them behind the scenes if it could be done with as great an effect upon the audience at the same time i must observe that though the devoted persons of the tragedy were seldom slain before the audience which has generally something ridiculous in it their bodies were often produced after their death which has always in it something melancholy or terrifying so that the killing on the stage does not seem to have been avoided only as an indecency but also as an improbability nec pueros coram populo medea trucidet aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius atreus aut in avem progne vertatur cadmus in anguem quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi  hor   medea must not draw her murthring knife nor atreus there his horrid feast prepare cadmus and prognes metamorphosis she to a swallow turnd he to a snake and

place of tragedy and by the skilful to improve it some of which i could wish entirely rejected and the rest to be used with caution it would be an endless task to consider comedy in the same light and to mention the innumerable shifts that small wits put in practice to raise a laugh bullock in a short coat and norris in a long one seldom fail of this effect  in ordinary comedies a broad and a narrow brimd hat are different characters sometimes the wit of the scene lies in a shoulderbelt and sometimes in a pair of whiskers a lover running about the stage with his head peeping out of a barrel was thought a very good jest in king charles the seconds time and invented by one of the first wits of that age  but because ridicule is not so delicate as compassion and because  the objects that make us laugh are infinitely more numerous than those that make us weep there is a much greater latitude for comick than tragick artifices and by consequence a much greater indulgence to be allowed them  c      footnote     the return to footnote mark   footnote     in act v the toll of the passing bell for pierre in the parting scene between jaffier and belvidera return   footnote

ribbons and brocades will break in upon us what peals of laughter and impertinence shall we be exposed to for the prevention of these great evils i could heartily wish that there was an act of parliament for prohibiting the importation of french fopperies  the female inhabitants of our island have already received very strong impressions from this ludicrous nation tho by the length of the war as there is no evil which has not some good attending it they are pretty well worn out and forgotten i remember the time when some of our wellbred countrywomen kept their valet de chambre because forsooth a man was much more handy about them than one of their own sex i myself have seen one of these male abigails tripping about the room with a lookingglass in his hand and combing his ladys hair a whole morning together whether or no there was any truth in the story of a ladys being got with child by one of these her handmaids i cannot tell but i think at present the whole race of them is extinct in our own country  about the time that several of our sex were taken into this kind of service the ladies likewise brought up the fashion of receiving visits in their beds  it was then lookd upon as a piece of ill breeding for a woman to refuse to see a man because she was not stirring and a porter would have been thought unfit for his place that could have made so awkward an excuse as i love to see every thing that is new i once prevailed upon my friend will honeycomb to carry me along with him to one of these travelled ladies desiring him at the same time to present me as a foreigner who could not speak english that so i might not be obliged to bear a part in the discourse the lady tho willing to appear undrest had put on her best looks and painted her self for our reception her hair appeared in a very nice disorder as the nightgown which was thrown upon her shoulders was ruffled with great care for my part i am so shocked with every thing which looks immodest in the fair sex that i could not forbear taking off my eye from her when she moved in her bed and was in the greatest confusion imaginable every time she stired a leg or an arm as the coquets who introduced this custom grew old they left it off by degrees well knowing that a woman of threescore may kick and tumble her heart out without making any impressions  sempronia is at present the most profest admirer of the french nation but is so modest as to admit her visitants no further than her toilet it is a very odd sight that beautiful creature makes when she is talking politicks with her tresses flowing about her shoulders and examining that face in the glass which does such execution upon all the male standersby how prettily does she divide her discourse between her woman and her visitants what sprightly transitions does she make from an opera or a sermon to an ivory comb or a pincushion how have i been pleased to see her interrupted in an account of her travels by a message to her footman and holding her tongue in the midst of a moral reflexion by applying the tip of it to a patch  there is nothing which exposes a woman to greater dangers than that gaiety and airiness of temper which are natural to most of the sex it should be therefore the concern of every wise and virtuous woman to keep this sprightliness from degenerating into levity on the contrary the whole discourse and behaviour of the french is to make the sex more fantastical or as they are pleased to term it more awakened than is consistent either with virtue or discretion to speak loud in publick assemblies to let every one hear you talk of things that should only be mentioned in private or in whisper are looked upon as parts of a refined education at the same time a blush is unfashionable and silence more illbred than any thing that can be spoken in short discretion and modesty which in all other ages and countries have been regarded as the greatest ornaments of the fair sex are considered as the ingredients of narrow conversation and family behaviour  some years ago i was at the tragedy of macbeth and unfortunately placed myself under a woman of quality that is since dead who as i found by the noise she made was newly returned from france a little before the rising of the curtain she broke out into a loud soliloquy when will the dear witches enter and immediately upon their first appearance asked a lady that sat three boxes from her on her righthand if those witches were not charming creatures a little after as betterton was in one of the finest speeches of the play she shook her fan at another lady who sat as far on the left hand and told her with a whisper that might be heard all over the pit we must not expect to see balloon tonight  not long after calling out to a young baronet by his name who sat three seats before me she asked him whether macbeths wife was still alive and before he could give an answer fell a talking of the ghost of banquo she had by this time formed a little audience to herself and fixed the attention of all about her but as i had a mind to hear the play i got out of the sphere of her impertinence and planted myself in one of the remotest corners of the pit  this pretty childishness of behaviour is one of the most refined parts of coquetry and is not to be attained in perfection by ladies that do not travel for their improvement a natural and unconstrained behaviour has something in it so agreeable that it is no wonder to see people endeavouring after it but at the same time it is so very hard to hit when it is not born with us that people often make themselves ridiculous in attempting it  a very ingenious french author  tells us that the ladies of the court of france in his time thought it illbreeding and a kind of female pedantry to pronounce an hard word right for which reason they took frequent occasion to use hard words that they might shew a politeness in murdering them he further adds that a lady of some quality at court having accidentally made use of an hard word in a proper place and pronounced it right the whole assembly was out of countenance for her  i must however be so just to own that there are many ladies who have travelled several thousand of miles without being the worse for it and have brought home with them all the modesty discretion and good sense that they went abroad with

in it that for his part he looked upon the dromedary the gridiron and the barbers pole to signify something more than what is usually meant by those words and that he thought the coffeeman could not

curious observations upon laughter concludes thus the passion of laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from some sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves by comparison with the infirmity of others or with our own formerly for men laugh at the follies of themselves past when they come suddenly to remembrance except they bring with them any present dishonour according to this author therefore when we hear a man laugh excessively instead of saying he is very merry we ought to tell him he is very proud and indeed if we look into the bottom of this matter we shall meet with many observations to confirm us in his opinion every one laughs at some body that is in an inferior state of folly to himself it was formerly the custom for every great house in england to keep a tame fool dressed in petticoats that the heir of the family might have an opportunity of joking upon him and diverting himself with his absurdities for the same reason idiots are still in request in most of the courts of germany where there is not a prince of any great magnificence who has not two or three dressed distinguished undisputed fools in his retinue whom the rest of the courtiers are always breaking their jests upon  the dutch who are more famous for their industry and application than for wit and humour hang up in several of their streets what they call the sign of the gaper that is the head of an idiot dressed in a cap and bells and gaping in a most immoderate manner this is a standing jest at amsterdam  thus every one diverts himself with some person or other that is below him in point of understanding and triumphs in the superiority of his genius whilst he has such objects of derision before his eyes mr dennis has very well expressed this in a couple of humourous lines which are part of a translation of a satire in monsieur boileau  thus one fool lolls his tongue out at another and shakes his empty noddle at his brother mr hobbss reflection gives us the reason why the insignificant people abovementioned are stirrers up of laughter among men of a gross taste but as the more understanding part of mankind do not find their risibility affected by such ordinary objects it may be worth the while to examine into the several provocatives of laughter in men of superior sense and knowledge  in the first place i must observe that there is a set of merry drolls whom the common people of all countries admire and seem to love so well that they could eat them according to the old proverb i mean those circumforaneous wits whom every nation calls by the name of that dish of meat which it loves best in holland they are termed pickled herrings in france jean pottages in italy maccaronies and in great britain jack puddings these merry wags from whatsoever food they receive their titles that they may make their audiences laugh always appear in a fools coat and commit such blunders and mistakes in every step they take and every word they utter as those who listen to them would be ashamed of  but this little triumph of the understanding under the disguise of laughter is no where more visible than in that custom which prevails every where among us on the first day of the present month when every body takes it in his head to make as many fools as he can in proportion as there are more follies discovered so there is more laughter raised on this day than on any other in the whole year a neighbour of mine who is a haberdasher by trade and a very shallow conceited fellow makes his boasts that for these ten years successively he has not made less than an hundred april fools my landlady had a falling out with him about a fortnight ago for sending every one of her children upon some sleeveless errand as she terms it her eldest son went to buy an halfpenny worth of inkle at a shoemakers the eldest daughter was dispatchd half a mile to see a monster and in short the whole family of innocent children made april fools nay my landlady herself did not escape him this empty fellow has laughed upon these conceits ever since  this art of wit is well enough when confined to one day in a twelvemonth but there is an ingenious tribe of men sprung up of late years who are for making april fools every day in the year these gentlemen are commonly distinguished by the name of biters a race of men that are perpetually employed in laughing at those mistakes which are of their own production  thus we see in proportion as one man is more refined than another he chooses his fool out of a lower or higher class of mankind or to speak in a more philosophical language that secret elation and pride of heart which is generally called laughter arises in him from his comparing himself with an object below him whether it so happens that it be a natural or an artificial fool it is indeed very possible that the persons we laugh at may in the main of their characters be much wiser men than ourselves but if they would have us laugh at them they must fall short of us in those respects which stir up this passion  i am afraid i shall appear too abstracted in my speculations if i shew that when a man of wit makes us laugh it is by betraying some oddness or infirmity in his own character or in the representation which he makes of others and that when we laugh at a brute or even at an inanimate thing it is at some action or incident that bears a remote analogy to any blunder or absurdity in reasonable creatures  but to come into common life i shall pass by the consideration of those stage coxcombs that are able to shake a whole audience and take notice of a particular sort of men who are such provokers of mirth in conversation that it is impossible for a club or merrymeeting to subsist without them i mean those honest gentlemen that are always exposed to the wit and raillery of their wellwishers and companions that are pelted by men women and children friends and foes and in a word stand as butts in conversation for every one to shoot at that pleases i know several of these butts who are men of wit and sense though by some odd turn of humour some unlucky cast in their person or behaviour they have always the misfortune to make the company merry the truth of it is a man is not qualified for a butt who has not a good deal of wit and vivacity even in the ridiculous side of his character a stupid butt is only fit for the conversation of ordinary people men of wit require one that will give them play and bestir himself in the absurd part of his behaviour a butt with these accomplishments frequently gets the laugh of his side and turns the ridicule upon him that attacks him sir john falstaff was an hero of this species and gives a good description of himself in his capacity of a butt after the following manner men of all sorts says that merry knight take a pride to gird at me the brain of man is not able to invent any thing that tends to laughter more than i invent or is invented on me i am not only witty in my

steele    hominem pagina nostra sapit  mart   it is very natural for a man who is not turned for mirthful meetings of men or assemblies of the fair sex to delight in that sort of conversation which we find in coffeehouses here a man of my temper is in his element for if he cannot talk he can still be more agreeable to his company as well as pleased in himself in being only an hearer it is a secret known but to few yet of no small use in the conduct of life that when you fall into a mans conversation the first thing you should consider is whether he has a greater inclination to hear you or that you should hear him the latter is the more general desire and i know very able flatterers that never speak a word in praise of the persons from whom they obtain daily favours but still practise a skilful attention to whatever is uttered by those with whom they converse we are very curious to observe the behaviour of great men and their clients but the same passions and interests move men in lower spheres and i that have nothing else to do but make observations see in every parish street lane and alley of this populous city a little potentate that has his court and his flatterers who lay snares for his affection and favour by the same arts that are practised upon men in higher stations  in the place i most usually frequent men differ rather in the time of day in which they make a figure than in any real greatness above one another i who am at the coffeehouse at six in a morning know that my friend beaver the haberdasher has a levy of more undissembled friends and admirers than most of the courtiers or generals of greatbritain every man about him has perhaps a newspaper in his hand but none can pretend to guess what step will be taken in any one court of europe till mr beaver has thrown down his pipe and declares what measures the allies must enter into upon this new posture of affairs our coffeehouse is near one of the inns of court and beaver has the audience and admiration of his neighbours from six till within a quarter of eight at which time he is interrupted by the students of the house some of whom are ready dressd for westminster at eight in a morning with faces as busie as if they were retained in every cause there and others come in their nightgowns to saunter away their time as if they never designed to go thither i do not know that i meet in any of my walks objects which move both my spleen and laughter so effectually as these young fellows at the grecian squires searles  and all other coffeehouses adjacent to the law who rise early for no other purpose but to publish their laziness one would think these young virtuosos take a gay cap and slippers with a scarf and partycoloured gown to be ensigns of dignity for the vain things approach each other with an air which shews they regard one another for their vestments i have observed that the superiority among these proceeds from an opinion of gallantry and fashion the gentleman in the strawberry sash who presides so much over the rest has it seems subscribed to every opera this last winter and is supposed to receive favours from one of the actresses  when the day grows too busie for these gentlemen to enjoy any longer the pleasures of their deshabilé with any manner of confidence they give place to men who have business or good sense in their faces and come to the coffeehouse either to transact affairs or enjoy conversation the persons to whose behaviour and discourse i have most regard are such as are between these two sorts of men such as have not spirits too active to be happy and well pleased in a private condition nor complexions too warm to make them neglect the duties and relations of life of these sort of men consist the worthier part of mankind of these are all good fathers generous brothers sincere friends and faithful subjects their entertainments are derived rather from reason than imagination which is the cause that there is no impatience or instability in their speech or action you see in their countenances they are at home and in quiet possession of the present instant as it passes without desiring to quicken it by gratifying any passion or prosecuting any new design these are the men formed for society and those little communities which we express by the word neighbourhoods  the coffeehouse is the place of rendezvous to all that live near it who are thus turned to relish calm and ordinary life eubulus presides over the middle hours of the day when this assembly of men meet together he enjoys a great fortune handsomely without launching into expence and exerts many noble and useful qualities without appearing in any publick employment his wisdom and knowledge are serviceable to all that think fit to make use of them and he does the office of a council a judge an executor and a friend to all his acquaintance not only without the profits which attend such offices but also without the deference and homage which are usually paid to them the giving of thanks is displeasing to him the greatest gratitude you can shew him is to let him see you are the better man for his services and that you are as ready to oblige others as he is to oblige you  in the private exigencies of his friends he lends at legal value considerable sums which he might highly increase by rolling in the publick stocks he does not consider in whose hands his mony will improve most but where it will do most good  eubulus has so great an authority in his little diurnal audience that when he shakes his head at any piece of publick news they all of them appear dejected and on the contrary go home to their dinners with a good stomach and cheerful aspect when eubulus seems to intimate that things go well nay their veneration towards him is so great that when they are in other company they speak and act after him are wise in his sentences and are no sooner sat down at their own tables but they hope or fear rejoice or despond as

twelvemonth ago  i often mixed with the rabble and followed them a whole day together being wonderfully struck with the sight of every thing that is new or uncommon i have since their departure employed a friend to make many inquiries of their landlord the upholsterer relating to their manners and conversation as also concerning the remarks which they made in this country for next to the forming a right notion of such strangers i should be desirous of learning what ideas they have conceived of us  the upholsterer finding my friend very inquisitive about these his lodgers brought him some time since a little bundle of papers which he assured him were written by king sa ga yean qua rash tow and as he supposes left behind by some mistake these papers are now translated and contain abundance of very odd observations which i find this little fraternity of kings made during their stay in the isle of great britain i shall present my reader with a short specimen of them in this paper and may perhaps communicate more to him hereafter in the article of london are the following words which without doubt are meant of the church of st paul on the most rising part of the town there stands a huge house big enough to contain the whole nation of which i am king our good brother e tow o koam king of the rivers is of opinion it was made by the hands of that great god to whom it is consecrated the kings of granajah and of the six nations believe that it was created with the earth and produced on the same day with the sun and moon but for my own part by the best information that i could get of this matter i am apt to think that this prodigious pile was fashioned into the shape it now bears by several tools and instruments of which they have a wonderful variety in this country it was probably at first an huge misshapen rock that grew upon the top of the hill which the natives of the country after having cut it into a kind of regular figure bored and hollowed with incredible pains and industry till they had wrought in it all those beautiful vaults and caverns into which it is divided at this day as soon as this rock was thus curiously scooped to their liking a prodigious number of hands must have been employed in chipping the outside of it which is now as smooth as the surface of a pebble  and is in several places hewn out into pillars that stand like the trunks of so many trees bound about the top with garlands of leaves it is probable that when this great work was begun which must have been many hundred years ago there was some religion among this people for they give it the name of a temple and have a tradition that it was designed for men to pay their devotions in and indeed there are several reasons which make us think that the natives of this country had formerly among them some sort of worship for they set apart every seventh day as sacred but upon my going into one of these  holy houses on that day i could not observe any circumstance of devotion in their behaviour there was indeed a man in black who was mounted above the rest and seemed to utter something with a great deal of vehemence but as for those underneath him instead of paying their worship to the deity of the place they were most of them bowing and curtisying to one another and a considerable number of them fast asleep  the queen of the country appointed two men to attend us that had enough of our language to make themselves understood in some few particulars but we soon perceived these two were great enemies to one another and did not always agree in the same story we could make a shift to gather out of one of them that this island was very much infested with a monstrous kind of animals in the shape of men called whigs and he often told us that he hoped we should meet with none of them in our way for that if we did they would be apt to knock us down for being kings  our other interpreter used to talk very much of a kind of animal called a tory that was as great a monster as the whig and would treat us as ill for being foreigners these two creatures it seems are born with a secret antipathy to one another and engage when they meet as naturally as the elephant and the rhinoceros but as we saw none of either of these species we are apt to think that our guides deceived us with misrepresentations and fictions and amused us with an account of such monsters as are not really in their country  these particulars we made a shift to pick out from the discourse of our interpreters which we put together as well as we could being able to understand but here and there a word of what they said and afterwards making up the meaning of it among ourselves the men of the country are very cunning and ingenious in handicraft works but withal so very idle that we often saw young lusty rawboned fellows carried up and down the streets in little covered rooms by a couple of porters who are hired for that service their dress is likewise very barbarous for they almost strangle themselves about the neck and bind their bodies with many ligatures that we are apt to think are the occasion of several distempers among them which our country is entirely free from instead of those beautiful feathers with which we adorn our heads they often buy up a monstrous bush of hair which covers their heads and falls down in a large fleece below the middle of their backs with which they walk up and down the streets and are as proud of it as if it was of their own growth  we were invited to one of their publick diversions where we hoped to have seen the great men of their country running down a stag or pitching a bar that we might have discovered who were the persons of the greatest abilities among them  but instead of that they conveyed us into a huge room lighted up with abundance of candles where this lazy people sat still above three hours to see several feats of ingenuity performed by others who it seems were paid for it  as for the women of the country not being able to talk with them we could only make our remarks upon them at a distance they let the hair of their heads grow to a great length but as the men make a great show with heads of hair that are not of their own the women who they say have very fine heads of hair tie it up in a knot and cover it from being seen the women look like angels and would be more beautiful than the sun were it not for little black spots that are apt to break out in their faces and sometimes rise in very odd figures i have observed that those little blemishes wear off very soon but when they disappear in one part of the face they are very apt to break out in another insomuch that i have seen a spot upon the forehead in the afternoon which was upon the chin in the morning  the author then proceeds to shew the absurdity of breeches and petticoats with many other curious observations which i shall reserve for another occasion i cannot however conclude this paper without taking notice that amidst these wild remarks there now and then appears something very reasonable i cannot likewise forbear observing that we are all guilty in some measure of the same narrow way of thinking which we meet with in this abstract of the indian journal when we fancy the customs dress and manners of other countries are ridiculous and extravagant if they do not resemble those of our own  c

fortune quality and person are such as render me as conspicuous as any young woman in town it is in my power to enjoy it in all its vanities but i have from a very careful education contracted a great aversion to the forward air and fashion which is practised in all publick places and assemblies i attribute this very much to the stile and manners of our plays i was last night at the funeral where a confident lover in the play speaking of his mistress cries out oh that harriot to fold these arms about the waste of that beauteous strugling and at last yielding fair  such an image as this ought by no means to be presented to a chaste and regular audience i expect your opinion of this sentence and recommend to your consideration as a spectator the conduct of the stage at present with relation to chastity and modesty  i am sir your constant reader and wellwisher  the complaint of this young lady is so just that the offence is great  enough to have displeased persons who cannot pretend to that delicacy and modesty of which she is mistress but there is a great deal to be said in behalf of an author if the audience would but consider the difficulty of keeping up a sprightly dialogue for five acts together they would allow a writer when he wants wit and cant please any otherwise to help it out with a little smuttiness i will answer for the poets that no one ever writ bawdy for any other reason but dearth of invention when the author cannot strike out of himself any more of that which he has superior to those who make up the bulk of his audience his natural recourse is to that which he has in common with them and a description which gratifies a sensual appetite will please when the author has nothing about him to delight  a refined imagination it is to such a poverty we must impute this and all other sentences in plays which are of this kind and which are commonly termed luscious expressions  this expedient to supply the deficiencies of wit has been used more or less by most of the authors who have succeeded on the stage tho i know but one who has professedly writ a play upon the basis of the desire of multiplying our species and that is the polite sir george etherege if i understand what the lady would be at in the play called she would if she could other poets have here and there given an intimation that there is this design under all the disguises and affectations which a lady may put on but no author except this has made sure work of it and put the imaginations of the audience upon this one purpose from the beginning to the end of the comedy it has always fared accordingly for whether it be that all who go to this piece would if they could or that the innocents go to it to guess only what she would if she could the play has always been well received it lifts an heavy empty sentence when there is added to it a lascivious gesture of body and when it is too low to be raised even by that a flat meaning is enlivened by making it a double one writers who want genius never fail of keeping this secret in reserve to create a laugh or raise a clap i who know nothing of women but from seeing plays can give great guesses at the whole structure of the fair sex by being innocently placed in the pit and insulted by the petticoats of their dancers the advantages of whose pretty persons are a great help to a dull play when a poet flags in writing lusciously a pretty girl can move lasciviously and have the same good consequence for the author dull poets in this case use their audiences as dull parasites do their patrons when they cannot longer divert them  with their wit or humour they bait their  ears with something which is agreeable to their  temper though below their  understanding apicius cannot resist being pleased if you give him an account of a delicious meal or clodius if you describe a wanton beauty tho at the same time if you do not awake those inclinations in them no men are better judges of what is just and delicate in conversation but as i have before observed it is easier to talk to the man than to the man of sense  it is remarkable that the writers of least learning are best skilled in the luscious way the poetesses of the age have done wonders in this kind and we are obliged to the lady who writ ibrahim  for introducing a preparatory scene to the very action when the emperor throws his handkerchief as a signal for his mistress to follow him into the most retired part of the seraglio it must be confessed his turkish majesty went off with a good air but methought we made but a sad figure who waited without this ingenious gentlewoman in this piece of bawdry refined upon an author of the same sex  who in the rover makes a country squire strip to his holland drawers for blunt is disappointed and the emperor is understood to go on to the utmost the pleasantry of stripping almost naked has been since practised where indeed it should have begun very successfully at bartholomew fair  it is not here to be omitted that in one of the abovementioned female compositions the rover is very frequently sent on the same errand as i take it above once every act this is not wholly unnatural for they say the menauthors draw themselves in their chief characters and the womenwriters may be allowed the same liberty thus as the male wit gives his hero a good fortune the female gives her heroin a great gallant at the end of the play but indeed there is hardly a play one can go to but the hero or fine gentleman of it struts off upon the same account and leaves us to consider what good office he has put us to or to employ our selves as we please to be plain a man who frequents plays would have a very respectful notion of himself were he to recollect how often he has been used as a pimp to ravishing tyrants or successful rakes when the actors make their exit on this good occasion the ladies are sure to have an examining glance from the pit to see how they relish what passes and a few lewd fools are very ready to employ their talents upon the composure or freedom of their looks such incidents as these make some ladies wholly absent themselves from the playhouse and others never miss the first day of a play lest it should prove too luscious to admit their going with any countenance to it on the second  if men of wit who think fit to write for the stage instead of this pitiful way of giving delight would turn their thoughts upon raising it from good natural impulses as are in the audience but are choked up by vice and luxury they would not only please but befriend us at the same time if a man had a mind to be new in his way of writing might not he who is now represented as a fine gentleman tho he betrays the honour and bed of his neighbour and friend and lies with half the women in the play and is at last rewarded with her of the best character in it i say upon giving the comedy another cast might not such a one divert the audience quite as well if at the catastrophe he were found out for a traitor and met with contempt accordingly there is seldom a person devoted to above one darling vice at a time so that there is room enough to catch at mens hearts to their good and advantage if the poets will attempt it with the honesty which becomes their characters  there is no man who loves his bottle or his mistress in a manner so very abandoned as not to be capable of relishing an agreeable character that is no way a slave to either of those pursuits a man that is temperate generous valiant chaste faithful and honest may at the same time have wit humour mirth goodbreeding and gallantry while he exerts these latter qualities twenty occasions might be invented to shew he is master of the other noble virtues such characters would smite and reprove the heart of a man of sense when he is given up to his pleasures he would see he has been mistaken all this while and be convinced that a sound constitution and an innocent mind are the true ingredients for becoming and enjoying life all men of true taste would call a man of wit who should turn his ambition this way a friend and benefactor to his country but i am at a loss what name they

not unsuccessful the triumph of daphne over her sister letitia has been the subject of conversation at several teatables where i have been present and i have observed the fair circle not a little pleased to find you considering them as reasonable creatures and endeavouring to banish that mahometan custom which had too much prevailed even in this island of treating women as if they had no souls i must do them the justice to say that there seems to be nothing wanting to the finishing of these lovely pieces of human nature besides the turning and applying their ambition properly and the keeping them up to a sense of what is their true merit epictetus that plain honest philosopher as little as he had of gallantry appears to have understood them as well as the polite st evremont and has hit this point very luckily  when young women says he arrive at a certain age they hear themselves called mistresses and are made to believe that their only business is to please the men they immediately begin to dress and place all their hopes in the adorning of their persons it is therefore continues he worth the while to endeavour by all means to make them sensible that the honour paid to them is only upon account of their conducting themselves with virtue modesty and discretion  now to pursue the matter yet further and to render your cares for the improvement of the fair ones more effectual i would propose a new method like those applications which are said to convey their virtues by sympathy and that is in order to embellish the mistress you should give a new education to the lover and teach the men not to be any longer dazzled by false charms and unreal beauty i cannot but think that if our sex knew always how to place their esteem justly the other would not be so often wanting to themselves in deserving it for as the being enamoured with a woman of sense and virtue is an improvement to a mans understanding and morals and the passion is ennobled by the object which inspires it so on the other side the appearing amiable to a man of a wise and elegant mind carries in it self no small degree of merit and accomplishment i conclude therefore that one way to make the women yet more agreeable is to make the men more virtuous i am sir  your most humble servant  r b     april     sir  yours of saturday last i read not without some resentment but i will suppose when

that i cannot bear the least impropriety of language or rusticity of behaviour now sir i have ever looked upon this as a wise distemper but by late observations find that every heavy wretch who has nothing to say excuses his dulness by complaining of the spleen nay i saw the other day two fellows in a tavern kitchen set up for it call for a pint and pipes and only by guzling liquor to each others health and wafting smoke in each others face pretend to throw off the spleen i appeal to you whether these dishonours are to be done to the distemper of the great and the polite i beseech you sir to inform these fellows that they have not the spleen because they cannot talk without the help of a glass at their mouths or convey their meaning to each other without the interposition of clouds

learned university of cambridge i could not but do my self the honour of publishing it it gives an account of a new sect of philosophers which has arose in that famous residence of learning and is perhaps the only sect this age is likely to produce cambridge april     mr spectator  believing you to be an universal encourager of liberal arts and sciences and glad of any information from the learned world i thought an account of a sect of philosophers very frequent among us but not taken notice of as far as i can remember by any writers either ancient or modern would not be unacceptable to you the philosophers of this sect are in the language of our university called lowngers i am of opinion that as in many other things so likewise in this the ancients have been defective viz in mentioning no philosophers of this sort some indeed will affirm that they are a kind of peripateticks because we see them continually walking about but i would have these gentlemen consider that tho the ancient peripateticks walked much yet they wrote much also witness to the sorrow of this sect aristotle and others whereas it is notorious that most of our professors never lay out a farthing either in pen ink or paper others are for deriving them from diogenes because several of the leading men of the sect have a great deal of the cynical humour in them and delight much in sunshine but then again diogenes was content to have his constant habitation in a narrow tub whilst our philosophers are so far from being of his opinion that its death to them to be confined within the limits of a good handsome convenient chamber but for half an hour others there are who from the clearness of their heads deduce the pedigree of lowngers from that great man i think it was either plato or socrates  who after all his study and learning professed that all he then knew was that he knew nothing you easily see this is but a shallow argument and may be soon confuted  i have with great pains and industry made my observations from time to time upon these sages and having now all materials ready am compiling a treatise wherein i shall set forth the rise and progress of this famous sect together with their maxims austerities manner of living c having prevailed with a friend who designs shortly to publish a new edition of diogenes laertius to add this treatise of mine by way of supplement i shall now to let the world see what may be expected from me first begging mr spectators leave that the world may see it briefly touch upon some of my chief observations and then subscribe my self your humble servant in the first place i shall give you two or three of their maxims the fundamental one upon which their whole system is built is this viz that time being an implacable enemy to and destroyer of all things ought to be paid in his own coin and be destroyed and murdered without mercy by all the ways that can be invented another favourite saying of theirs is that business was designed only for knaves and study for blockheads a third seems to be a ludicrous one but has a great effect upon their lives and is this that the devil is at home now for their manner of living and here i have a large field to expatiate in but i shall reserve particulars for my intended discourse and now only mention one or two of their principal exercises the elder proficients employ themselves in inspecting mores hominum multorum in getting acquainted with all the signs and windows in the town some are arrived at so great knowledge that they can tell every time any butcher kills a calf every time any old womans cat is in the straw and a thousand other matters as important one ancient philosopher contemplates two or three hours every day over a sundial and is true to the dial  as the dial to the sun although it be not shone upon  our younger students are content to carry their speculations as yet no farther than bowlinggreens billiardtables and such like places this may serve for a sketch of my design in which i hope i shall have your encouragement i am  sir  yours   i must be so just as to observe i have formerly seen of this sect at our other university tho not distinguished by the appellation which the learned historian my correspondent reports they bear at cambridge they were ever looked upon as a people that impaired themselves more by their strict application to the rules of their order than any other students whatever others seldom hurt themselves any further than to gain weak eyes and sometimes headaches but these philosophers are seized all over with a general inability indolence and weariness and a certain impatience of the place they are in with an heaviness in removing to another  the lowngers are satisfied with being merely part of the number of mankind without distinguishing themselves from amongst them they may be said rather to suffer their time to pass than to spend it without regard to the past or prospect of the future all they know of life is only the present instant and do not taste even that when one of this order happens to be a man of fortune the expence of his time is transferrd to his coach and horses and his life is to be measured by their motion not his own enjoyments or sufferings the chief entertainment one of these philosophers can possibly propose to himself is to get a relish of dress this methinks might diversifie the person he is weary of his own dear self to himself i have known these two amusements make one of these philosophers make a tolerable figure in the world with a variety of dresses in publick assemblies in town and quick motion of his horses out of it now to bath now to tunbridge then to newmarket and then to london he has in process of time brought it to pass that his coach and his horses have been mentioned in all those places when the lowngers leave an academick life and instead of this more elegant way of appearing in the polite world retire to the seats of their ancestors they usually join a pack of dogs and employ their days in defending their poultry from foxes i do not know any other method that any of this order has ever taken to make a noise in the world but i shall enquire into such about this town as have arrived at the dignity of being lowngers by the force of natural parts without having ever seen an university and send my correspondent for the embellishment of his book the names and history of those who pass their lives without any incidents at all and how they shift coffeehouses and chocolatehouses from hour to hour to get over the insupportable labour of doing nothing

for death will make us all a name a nothing but an old wifes tale speak wilt thou avarice or pleasure choose to be thy lord take one and one refuse when a government flourishes in conquests and is secure from foreign attacks it naturally falls into all the pleasures of luxury and as these pleasures are very expensive they put those who are addicted to them upon raising fresh supplies of mony by all the methods of rapaciousness and corruption so that avarice and luxury very often become one complicated principle of action in those whose hearts are wholly set upon ease magnificence and pleasure the most elegant and correct of all the latin historians observes that in his time when the most formidable states of the world were subdued by the romans the republick sunk into those two vices of a quite different nature luxury and avarice  and accordingly describes catiline as one who coveted the wealth of other men at the same time that he squanderd away his own this observation on the commonwealth when it was in its height of power and riches holds good of all governments that are settled in a state of ease and prosperity at such times men naturally endeavour to outshine one another in pomp and splendor and having no fears to alarm them from abroad indulge themselves in the enjoyment of all the pleasures they can get into their possession which naturally produces avarice and an immoderate pursuit after wealth and riches  as i was humouring my self in the speculation of these two great principles of action i could not forbear throwing my thoughts into a little kind of allegory or fable with which i shall here present my reader  there were two very powerful tyrants engaged in a perpetual war against each other the name of the first was luxury and of the second avarice the aim of each of them was no less than universal monarchy over the hearts of mankind luxury had many generals under him who did him great service as pleasure mirth pomp and fashion avarice was likewise very strong in his officers being faithfully served by hunger industry care and watchfulness he had likewise a privycounsellor who was always at his elbow and whispering something or other in his ear the name of this privycounsellor was poverty as avarice conducted himself by the counsels of poverty his antagonist was entirely guided by the dictates and advice of plenty who was his first counsellor and minister of state that concerted all his measures for him and never departed out of his sight while these two great rivals were thus contending for empire their conquests were very various luxury got possession of one heart and avarice of another the father of a family would often range himself under the banners of avarice and the son under those of luxury the wife and husband would often declare themselves on the two different parties nay the same person would very often side with one in his youth and revolt to the other in his old age indeed the wise men of the world stood neuter but alas their numbers were not considerable at length when these two potentates had wearied themselves with waging war upon one another they agreed upon an interview at which neither of their counsellors were to be present it is said that luxury began the parley and after having represented the endless state of war in which they were engaged told his enemy with a frankness of heart which is natural to him that he believed they two should be very good friends were it not for the instigations of poverty that pernicious counsellor who made an ill use of his ear and filled him with groundless apprehensions and prejudices to this avarice replied that he looked upon plenty the first minister of his antagonist to be a much more destructive counsellor than poverty for that he was perpetually suggesting pleasures banishing all the necessary cautions against want and consequently undermining those principles on which the government of avarice was founded at last in order to an accommodation they agreed upon this preliminary that each of them should immediately dismiss his privycounsellor when things were thus far adjusted towards a peace all other differences were soon accommodated insomuch that for the future they resolved to live as good friends and confederates and to share between them whatever conquests were made on either side for this reason we now find luxury and avarice taking possession of the same heart and dividing the same person between them to which i shall only add that since the discarding of the counsellors abovementioned avarice supplies luxury in the room of plenty as luxury prompts avarice in the place of poverty  c      footnote     alieni appetens sui profusus sallust return to footnote mark  contents contents p     no    friday

stones they believe the same of all the works of art as of knives boats lookingglasses and that as any of these things perish their souls go into another world which is inhabited by the ghosts of men and women for this reason they always place by the corpse of their dead friend a bow and arrows that he may make use of the souls of them in the other world as he did of their wooden bodies in this how absurd soever such an opinion as this may appear our european philosophers have maintained several notions altogether as improbable some of platos followers in particular when they talk of the world of ideas entertain us with substances and beings no less extravagant and chimerical many aristotelians have likewise spoken as unintelligibly of their substantial forms i shall only instance albertus magnus who in his dissertation upon the loadstone observing that fire will destroy its magnetick vertues tells us that he took particular notice of one as it lay glowing amidst an heap of burning coals and that he perceived a certain blue vapour to arise from it which he believed might be the substantial form that is in our westindian phrase the soul of the loadstone   there is a tradition among the americans that one of their countrymen descended in a vision to the great repository of souls or as we call it here to the other world and that upon his return he gave his friends a distinct account of every thing he saw among those regions of the dead a friend of mine whom i have formerly mentioned prevailed upon one of the interpreters of the indian kings  to inquire of them if possible what tradition they have among them of this matter which as well as he could learn by those many questions which he asked them at several times was in substance as follows  the visionary whose name was marraton after having travelled for a long space under an hollow mountain arrived at length on the confines of this world of spirits but could not enter it by reason of a thick forest made up of bushes brambles and pointed thorns so perplexed and interwoven with one another that it was impossible to find a passage through it whilst he was looking about for some track or pathway that might be worn in any part of it he saw an huge lion crouched under the side of it who kept his eye upon him in the same posture as when he watches for his prey the indian immediately started back whilst the lion rose with a spring and leaped towards him being wholly destitute of all other weapons he stooped down to take up an huge stone in his hand but to his infinite surprize grasped nothing and found the supposed stone to be only the apparition of one if he was disappointed on this side he was as much pleased on the other when he found the lion which had seized on his left shoulder had no power to hurt him and was only the ghost of that ravenous creature which it appeared to be he no sooner got rid of his impotent enemy but he marched up to the wood and after having surveyed it for some time endeavoured to press into one part of it that was a little thinner than the rest when again to his great surprize he found the bushes made no resistance but that he walked through briars and brambles with the same ease as through the open air and in short that the whole wood was nothing else but a wood of shades he immediately concluded that this huge thicket of thorns and brakes was designed as a kind of fence or quickset hedge to the ghosts it inclosed and that probably their soft substances might be torn by these subtle points and prickles which were too weak to make any impressions in flesh and blood with this thought he resolved to travel through this intricate wood when by degrees he felt a gale of perfumes breathing upon him that grew stronger and sweeter in proportion as he advanced he had not proceeded much further when he observed the thorns and briars to end and give place to a thousand beautiful green trees covered with blossoms of the finest scents and colours that formed a wilderness of sweets and were a kind of lining to those ragged scenes which he had before passed through as he was coming out of this delightful part of the wood and entering upon the plains it inclosed he saw several horsemen rushing by him and a little while after heard the cry of a pack of dogs he had not listned long before he saw the apparition of a milkwhite steed with a young man on the back of it advancing upon full stretch after the souls of about an hundred beagles that were hunting down the ghost of an hare which ran away before them with an unspeakable swiftness as the man on the milkwhite steed came by him he looked upon him very attentively and found him to be the young prince nicharagua who died about half a year before and by reason of his great vertues was at that time lamented over all the western parts of america  he had no sooner got out of the wood but he was entertained with such a landskip of flowry plains green meadows running streams sunny hills and shady vales as were not to be represented  by his own expressions nor as he said by the conceptions of others this happy region was peopled with innumerable swarms of spirits who applied themselves to exercises and diversions according as their fancies led them some of them were tossing the figure of a colt others were pitching the shadow of a bar others were breaking the apparition of a  horse and multitudes employing themselves upon ingenious handicrafts with the souls of departed utensils for that is the name which in the indian language they give their tools when they are burnt or broken as he travelled through this delightful scene he was very often tempted to pluck the flowers that rose every where about him in the greatest variety and profusion having never seen several of them in his own country but he quickly found that though they were objects of his sight they were not liable to his touch he at length came to the side of a great river and being a good fisherman himself stood upon the banks of it some time to look upon an angler that had taken a great many shapes of fishes which lay flouncing up and down by him  i should have told my reader that this indian had been formerly married to one of the greatest beauties of his country by whom he had several children this couple were so famous for their love and constancy to one another that the indians to this day when they give a married man joy of his wife wish that they may live together like marraton and yaratilda marraton had not stood long by the fisherman when he saw the shadow of his beloved yaratilda who had for some time fixed her eye upon him before he discovered her her arms were stretched out towards him floods of tears ran down her eyes her looks her hands her voice called him over to her and at the same time seemed to tell him that the river was impassable who can describe the passion made up of joy sorrow love desire astonishment that rose in the indian upon the sight of his dear yaratilda he could express it by nothing but his tears which ran like a river down his cheeks as he looked upon her he had not stood in this posture long before he plunged into the stream that lay before him and finding it to be nothing but the phantom of a river walked on the bottom of it till he arose on the other side at his approach yaratilda flew into his arms whilst marraton wished himself disencumbered of that body which kept her from his embraces after many questions and endearments on both sides she conducted him to a bower which she had dressed with her own hands with all the ornaments that could be met with in those blooming regions she had made it gay beyond imagination and was every day adding something new to it as marraton stood astonished at the unspeakable beauty of her habitation and ravished with the fragrancy that came from every part of it yaratilda told him that she was preparing this bower for his reception as well knowing that his piety to his god and his faithful dealing towards men would certainly bring him to that happy place whenever his life should be at an end she then brought two of her children to him who died some years before and resided with her in the same delightful bower advising him to breed up those others which were still with him in such a manner that they might hereafter all of them meet together in this happy place  the tradition tells us further that he had afterwards a sight of those dismal habitations which are the portion of ill men after death and mentions several molten seas of gold in which were plunged the souls of barbarous europeans who  put to the sword so many thousands of poor indians for the sake of that precious metal but having already touched upon the chief points of this

and blemishes that are apt to rise among the charms which nature has poured out upon them i shall dedicate this paper to their service the spot which i would here endeavour to clear them of is that partyrage which of late years is very much crept into their conversation this is in its nature a male vice and made up of many angry and cruel passions that are altogether repugnant to the softness

have ended  there is one consideration which i would earnestly recommend to all my female readers and which i hope will have some weight with them in short it is this that there is nothing so bad for the face as partyzeal it gives an illnatured cast to the eye and a disagreeable sourness to the look besides that it makes the lines too strong and flushes them worse than brandy i have seen a womans face break out in heats as she has been talking against a great lord whom she had never seen in her life and indeed never knew a partywoman that kept her beauty for a twelvemonth i would therefore advise all my female readers as they value their complexions to let alone all disputes of this nature though at the same time i would give free liberty to all superannuated motherly partizans to be as violent as they please since there will be no danger either of their spoiling their faces or of their gaining converts  for my own part i think a man makes an odious and despicable figure that is violent in a party but a woman is too sincere to mitigate the fury of her principles with temper and discretion and to act with that caution and reservedness which are requisite in our sex when this unnatural zeal gets into them it throws them into ten thousand heats and extravagancies their generous souls  set no bounds to their love or to their hatred and whether a whig or tory a lapdog or a

nothing is so much admired and so little understood as wit no author that i know of has written professedly upon it and as for those who make any mention of it they only treat on the subject as it has accidentally fallen in their way and that too in little short reflections or in general declamatory flourishes without entering into the bottom of the matter i hope therefore i shall perform an acceptable work to my countrymen if i treat at large upon this subject which i shall endeavour to do in a manner suitable to it that i may not incur the censure which a famous critick bestows upon one who had written a treatise upon the sublime in a low groveling stile i intend to lay aside a whole week for this undertaking that the scheme of my thoughts may not be broken and interrupted and i dare promise my self if my readers will give me a weeks attention that this great city will be very much changed for the better by next saturday night i shall endeavour to make what i say intelligible to ordinary capacities but if my readers meet with any paper that in some parts of it may be a little out of their reach i would not have them discouraged for they may assure themselves the next shall be much clearer  as the great and only end of these my speculations is to banish vice and ignorance out of the territories of greatbritain i shall endeavour as much as possible to establish among us a taste of polite writing it is with this view that i have endeavoured to set my readers right in several points relating to operas and tragedies and shall from time to time impart my notions of comedy as i think they may tend to its refinement and perfection i find by my bookseller that these papers of criticism with that upon humour have met with a more kind reception than indeed i could have hoped for from such subjects for which reason i shall enter upon my present undertaking with greater chearfulness  in this and one or two following papers i shall trace out the history of false wit and distinguish the several kinds of it as they have prevailed in different ages of the world this i think the more necessary at present because i observed there were attempts on foot last winter to revive some of those antiquated modes of wit that have been long exploded out of the commonwealth of letters there were several satyrs and panegyricks handed about in acrostick by which means some of the most arrant undisputed blockheads about the town began to entertain ambitious thoughts and to set up for polite authors i shall therefore describe at length those many arts of false wit in which a writer does not show himself a man of a beautiful genius but of great industry  the first species of false wit which i have met with is very venerable for its antiquity and has produced several pieces which have lived very near as long as the iliad it self i mean those short poems printed among the minor greek poets which resemble the figure of an egg a pair of wings an ax a shepherds pipe and an altar   as for the first it is a little oval poem and may not improperly be called a scholars egg i would endeavour to hatch it or in more intelligible language to translate it into english did not i find the interpretation of it very difficult for the author seems to have been more intent upon the figure of his poem than upon the sense of it  the pair of wings consist of twelve verses or rather feathers every verse decreasing gradually in its measure according to its situation in the wing the subject of it as in the rest of the poems which follow bears some remote affinity with the figure for it describes a god of love who is always painted with wings  the ax methinks would have been a good figure for a lampoon had the edge of it consisted of the most satyrical parts of the work but as it is in the original i take it to have been nothing else but the posy of an ax which was consecrated to minerva and was thought to have been the same that epeus made use of in the building of the trojan horse which is a hint i shall leave to the consideration of the criticks i am apt to think that the posy was written originally upon the ax like those which our modern cutlers inscribe upon their knives and that therefore the posy still remains in its ancient shape tho the ax it self is lost  the shepherds pipe may be said to be full of musick for it is composed of nine different kinds of verses which by their several lengths resemble the nine stops of the old musical instrument that  is likewise the subject of the poem   the altar is inscribed with the epitaph of troilus the son of hecuba which by the way makes me believe that these false pieces of wit are much more ancient than the authors to whom they are generally ascribed at least i will never be perswaded that so fine a writer as theocritus could have been the author of any such simple works  it was impossible for a man to succeed in these performances who was not a kind of painter or at least a designer he was first of all to draw the outline of the subject which he intended to write upon and afterwards conform the description to the figure of his subject the poetry was to contract or dilate itself according to the mould in which it was cast in a word the verses were to be cramped or extended to the dimensions of the frame that was prepared for them and to undergo the fate of those persons whom the tyrant procrustes used to lodge in his iron bed if they were too short he stretched them on a rack and if they were too long chopped off a part of their legs till they fitted the couch which he had prepared for them  mr dryden hints at this obsolete kind of wit in one of the following verses in his mac flecno which an english reader cannot understand who does not know that there are those little poems abovementioned in the shape of wings and altars  chuse for thy command some peaceful province in acrostick land there mayst thou wings display and altars raise and torture one poor word a thousand ways this fashion of false wit was revived by several poets of the last age and in particular may be met with among mr herberts poems and if i am not mistaken in the translation of du bartas  — i do not remember any other kind of work among the moderns which more resembles the performances i have mentioned than that famous picture of king charles the first which has the whole book of psalms written in the lines of the face and the hair of the head when i was last at oxford i perused one of the whiskers and was reading the other but could not go so far in it as i would have done by reason of the impatience of my friends and fellowtravellers who all of them pressed to see such a piece of curiosity i have since heard that there is now an eminent writingmaster in town who has transcribed all the old testament in a fullbottomed periwig and if the fashion should introduce the thick kind of wigs which were in vogue some few years ago he promises to add two or three supernumerary locks that shall contain all the apocrypha he designed this wig originally for king william having disposed of the two books of kings in the two forks of the foretop but that glorious monarch dying before the wig was finished there is a space left in it for the face of any one that has a mind to purchase it  but to return to our ancient poems in picture i would humbly propose for the benefit of our modern smatterers in poetry that they would imitate their brethren among the ancients in those ingenious devices i have communicated this thought to a young poetical lover of my acquaintance who intends to present his mistress with a copy of verses made in the shape of her fan and if he tells me true has already finished the three first sticks of it he has likewise promised me to get the measure of his mistresss marriagefinger with a design to make a posy in the fashion of a ring which shall exactly fit it it is so very easy to enlarge upon a good hint that i do not question but my ingenious readers will apply what i have said to many other particulars and that we shall see the town filled in a very little time with poetical tippets handkerchiefs snuffboxes and the like female ornaments i shall therefore conclude with a word of advice to those admirable english authors who call themselves pindarick writers  that they would apply themselves to this kind of wit without loss of time as being provided better than any other poets with verses of all sizes and dimensions  c      footnote     not a new paragraph in the first issue return to footnote mark   footnote     which

pretended depth and solidity are apt to decry the writings of a polite author as flash and froth they all of them shew upon occasion that they would spare no pains to arrive at the character of those whom they seem to despise for this reason we often find them endeavouring at works of fancy which cost them infinite pangs in the production the truth of it is a man had better be a gallyslave than a wit were one to gain that title by those elaborate trifles which have been the inventions of such authors as were often masters of great learning but no genius  in my last paper i mentioned some of these false wits among the ancients and in this shall give the reader two or three other species of them that flourished in the same early ages of the world the first i shall produce are the lipogrammiatists  or letterdroppers of antiquity that would take an exception without any reason against some particular letter in the alphabet so as not to admit it once into a whole poem one tryphiodorus was a great master in this kind of writing he composed an odyssey or epick poem on the adventures of ulysses consisting of four and twenty books having entirely banished the letter a from his first book which was called alpha as lucus a non lucendo because there was not an alpha in it his second book was inscribed beta for the same reason in short the poet excluded the whole four and twenty letters in their turns and shewed them one after another that he could do his business without them  it must have been very pleasant to have seen this poet avoiding the reprobate letter as much as another would a false quantity and making his escape from it through the several greek dialects when he was pressed with it in any particular syllable for the most apt and elegant word in the whole language was rejected like a diamond with a flaw in it if it appeared blemished with a wrong letter i shall only observe upon this head that if the work i have here mentioned had been now extant the odyssey of tryphiodorus in all probability would have been oftner quoted by our learned pedants than the odyssey of homer what a perpetual fund would it have been of obsolete words and phrases unusual barbarisms and rusticities absurd spellings and complicated dialects i make no question but it would have been looked upon as one of the most valuable treasuries of the greek tongue  i find likewise among the ancients that ingenious kind of conceit which the moderns distinguish by the name of a rebus  that does not sink a letter but a whole word by substituting a picture in its place when cæsar was one of the masters of the roman mint he placed the figure of an elephant upon the reverse of the publick mony the word cæsar signifying an elephant in the punick language this was artificially contrived by cæsar because it was not lawful for a private man to stamp his own figure upon the coin of the commonwealth cicero who was so called from the founder of his family that was marked on the nose with a little wen like a vetch which is cicer in latin instead of marcus tullius cicero orderd the words marcus tullius with the figure of a vetch at the end of them to be inscribed on a publick monument  this was done probably to shew that he was neither ashamed of his name or family notwithstanding the envy of his competitors had often reproached him with both in the same manner we read of a famous building that was marked in several parts of it with the figures of a frog and a lizard those words in greek having been the names of the architects who by the laws of their country were never permitted to inscribe their own names upon their works for the same reason it is thought that the forelock of the horse in the antique equestrian statue of marcus aurelius represents at a distance the shape of an owl to intimate the country of the statuary who in all probability was an athenian this kind of wit was very much in vogue among our own countrymen about an age or two ago who did not practise it for any oblique reason as the ancients abovementioned but purely for the sake of being witty among innumerable instances that may be given of this nature i shall produce the device of one mr newberry as i find it mentioned by our learned cambden in his remains mr newberry to represent his name by a picture hung up at his door the sign of a yewtree that had several berries upon it and in the midst of them a great golden n hung upon a bough of the tree which by the help of a little false spelling made up the word newberry  i shall conclude this topick with a rebus which has been lately hewn out in freestone and erected over two of the portals of blenheim house being the figure of a monstrous lion tearing to pieces a little cock for the better understanding of which device i must acquaint my english reader that a cock has the misfortune to be called in latin by the same word that signifies a frenchman as a lion is the emblem of the english nation such a device in so noble a pile of building looks like a punn in an heroick poem and i am very sorry the truly ingenious architect would suffer the statuary to blemish his excellent plan with so poor a conceit but i hope what i have said will gain quarter for the cock and deliver him out of the lions paw  i find likewise in ancient times the conceit of making an eccho talk sensibly and give rational answers if this could be excusable in any writer it would be in ovid where he introduces the eccho as a nymph before she was worn away into nothing but a voice the learned erasmus tho a man of wit and genius has composed a dialogue  upon this silly kind of device and made use of an eccho who seems to have been a very extraordinary linguist for she answers the person she talks with in latin greek and hebrew according as she found the syllables which she was to repeat in any one of those learned languages hudibras in ridicule of this false kind of wit has described bruin bewailing the loss of his bear to a solitary eccho who is of great used to the poet in several disticks as she does not only repeat after him but helps out his verse and furnishes him with rhymes he ragd and kept as heavy a coil as stout hercules for loss of hylas forcing the valleys to repeat the accents of his sad regret he beat his breast and tore his hair for loss of his dear crony bear that eccho from the hollow ground his doleful wailings did resound more wistfully but many times then in small poets splayfoot rhymes that make her in her rueful stories to answer to introgatories and most unconscionably depose things of

false wit that vanished in the refined ages of the world discovered themselves again in the times of monkish ignorance  as the monks were the masters of all that little learning which was then extant and had their whole lives entirely disengaged from business it is no wonder that several of them who wanted genius for higher performances employed many hours in the composition of such tricks in writing as required much time and little capacity i have seen half the æneid turned into latin rhymes by one of the beaux esprits of that dark age who says in his preface to it that the æneid wanted nothing but the sweets of rhyme to make it the most perfect work in its kind i have likewise seen an hymn in hexameters to the virgin mary which filled a whole book tho it consisted but of the eight following words tot tibi sunt virgo dotes quot sidera cælo  thou hast as many virtues o virgin as there are stars in heaven the poet rung the changes  upon these eight several words and by that means made his verses almost as numerous as the virtues and the stars which they celebrated it is no wonder that men who had so much time upon their hands did not only restore all the antiquated pieces of false wit but enriched the world with inventions of their own it was to this age that we owe the production of anagrams  which is nothing else but a transmutation of one word into another or the turning of the same set of letters into different words which may change night into day or black into white if chance who is the goddess that presides over these sorts of composition shall so direct i remember a witty author in allusion to this kind of writing calls his rival who it seems was distorted and had his limbs set in places that did not properly belong to them the anagram of a man  when the anagrammatist takes a name to work upon he considers it at first as a mine not broken up which will not shew the treasure it contains till he shall have spent many hours in the search of it for it is his business to find out one word that conceals it self in another and to examine the letters in all the variety of stations in which they can possibly be ranged i have heard of a gentleman who when this kind of wit was in fashion endeavoured to gain his mistresss heart by it she was one of the finest women of her age and known  by the name of the lady mary boon the lover not being able to make any thing of mary by certain liberties indulged to this kind of writing converted it into moll and after having shut himself up for half a year with indefatigable industry produced an anagram upon the presenting it to his mistress who was a little vexed in her heart to see herself degraded into moll boon she told him to his infinite surprise that he had mistaken her sirname for that it was not boon but bohun  ibi omnis effusus labor  the lover was thunderstruck with his misfortune insomuch that in a little time after he lost his senses which indeed had been very much impaired by that continual application he had given to his anagram  the acrostick  was probably invented about the same time with the anagram tho it is impossible to decide whether the inventor of the one of the other were  the greater blockhead the simple acrostick is nothing but the name or title of a person or thing made out of the initial letters of several verses and by that means written after the manner of the chinese in a perpendicular line but besides these there are compound acrosticks where the principal letters stand two or three deep i have seen some of them where the verses have not only been edged by a name at each extremity but have had the same name running down like a seam through the middle of the poem  there is another near relation of the anagrams and acrosticks which is commonly called  a chronogram this kind of wit appears very often on many modern medals especially those of germany  when they represent in the inscription the year in which they were coined thus we see on a medal of gustavus adolphus the following words christvs dux ergo trivmphvs if you take the pains to pick the figures out of the several words and range them in their proper order you will find they amount to mdcxvvvii or      the year in which the medal was stamped for as some of the letters distinguish themselves from the rest and overtop their fellows they are to be considered in a double capacity both as letters and as figures your laborious german wits will turn over a whole dictionary for one of these ingenious devices a man would think they were searching after an apt classical term but instead of that they are looking out a word that has an l and m or a d in it when therefore we meet with any of these inscriptions we are not so much to look in em for the thought as for the year of the lord  the boutz rimez  were the favourites of the french nation for a whole age together and that at a time when it abounded in wit and learning they were a list of words that rhyme to one another drawn up by another hand and given to a poet who was to make a poem to the rhymes in the same order that they were placed upon the list the more uncommon the rhymes were the more extraordinary was the genius of the poet that could accommodate his verses to them i do not know any greater instance of the decay of wit and learning among the french which generally follows the declension of empire than the endeavouring to restore this foolish kind of wit if the reader will be at the trouble to see examples of it let him look into the new mercure galant where the author every month gives a list of rhymes to be filled up by the ingenious in order to be communicated to the publick in the mercure for the succeeding month that for the month of november last which now lies before me is as

see so learned a man as menage talking seriously on this kind of trifle in the following passage monsieur de la chambre has told me that he never knew what he was going to write when he took his pen into his hand but that one sentence always produced another for my own part i never knew what i should write next when i was making verses in the first place i got all my rhymes together and was afterwards perhaps three or four months in filling them up i one day shewed monsieur gombaud a composition of this nature in which among others i had made use of the four following rhymes amaryllis phillis marne arne desiring him to give me his opinion of it he told me immediately that my verses were good for nothing and upon my asking his reason he said because the rhymes are too common and for that reason easy to be put into verse marry says i if it be so i am very well rewarded for all the pains i have been at but by monsieur gombauds leave notwithstanding the severity of the criticism the verses were good vid menagiana thus far the learned menage whom i have translated word for word   the first occasion of these bouts rimez made them in some manner excusable as they were tasks which the french ladies used to impose on their lovers but when a grave author like him abovementioned tasked himself could there be anything more ridiculous or would not one be apt to believe that the author played booty 0 and did not make his list of rhymes till he had finished his poem  i shall only add that this piece of false wit has been finely ridiculed by monsieur sarasin in a poem intituled la defaite des boutsrimez the rout of the boutsrimez    i must subjoin to this last kind of wit the double rhymes which are used in doggerel poetry and generally applauded by ignorant readers if the thought of the couplet in such compositions is good the rhyme adds little   to it and if bad it will not be in the power of the rhyme to recommend it i am afraid that great numbers of those who admire the incomparable hudibras do it more on account of these doggerel rhymes than of the parts that really deserve admiration i am sure i have heard the pulpit drum ecclesiastick was beat with fist

which consists in a jingle of words and is comprehended under the general name of punning it is indeed impossible to kill a weed which the soil has a natural disposition to produce the seeds of punning are in the minds of all men and tho they may be subdued by reason reflection and good sense they will be very apt to shoot up in the greatest genius that is not broken and cultivated by the rules of art imitation is natural to us and when it does not raise the mind to poetry painting musick or other more noble arts it often breaks out in punns and quibbles  aristotle in the eleventh chapter of his book of rhetorick describes two or three kinds of punns which he calls paragrams among the beauties of good writing and produces instances of them out of some of the greatest authors in the greek tongue cicero has sprinkled several of his works with punns and in his book where he lays down the rules of oratory quotes abundance of sayings as pieces of wit which also upon examination prove arrant punns but the age in which the punn chiefly flourished was the reign of king james the first that learned monarch was himself a tolerable punnster and made very few bishops or privycounsellors that had not some time or other signalized themselves by a clinch or a conundrum it was therefore in this age that the punn appeared with pomp and dignity it had before been admitted into merry speeches and ludicrous compositions but was now delivered with great gravity from the pulpit or pronounced in the most solemn manner at the counciltable the greatest authors in their most serious works made frequent use of punns the sermons of bishop andrews and the tragedies of shakespear are full of them the sinner was punned into repentance by the former as in the latter nothing is more usual than to see a hero weeping and quibbling for a dozen lines together  i must add to these great authorities which seem to have given a kind of sanction to this piece of false wit that all the writers of rhetorick have treated of punning with very great respect and divided the several kinds of it into hard names that are reckoned among the figures of speech and recommended as ornaments in discourse i remember a country schoolmaster of my acquaintance told me once that he had been in company with a gentleman whom he looked upon to be the greatest paragrammatist among the moderns upon inquiry i found my learned friend had dined that day with mr swan the famous punnster and desiring him to give me some account of mr swans conversation he told me that he generally talked in the paranomasia that he sometimes gave into the plocè but that in his humble opinion he shined most in the antanaclasis  i must not here omit that a famous university of this land was formerly very much infested with punns but whether or no this might not arise from the fens and marshes in which it was situated and which are now drained i must leave to the determination of more skilful naturalists  after this short history of punning one would wonder how it should be so entirely banished out of the learned world as it is at present especially since it had found a place in the writings of the most ancient polite authors to account for this we must consider that the first race of authors who were the great heroes in writing were destitute of all rules and arts of criticism and for that reason though they excel later writers in greatness of genius they fall short of them in accuracy and correctness the moderns cannot reach their beauties but can avoid their imperfections when the world was furnished with these authors of the first eminence there grew up another set of writers who gained themselves a reputation by the remarks which they made on the works of those who preceded them it was one of the employments of these secondary authors to distinguish the several kinds of wit by terms of art and to consider them as more or less perfect according as they were founded in truth it is no wonder therefore that even such authors as isocrates plato and cicero should have such little blemishes as are not to be met with in authors of a much inferior character who have written since those several blemishes were discovered i do not find that there was a proper separation made between punns and true  wit by any of the ancient authors except quintilian and longinus but when this distinction was once settled it was very natural for all men of sense to agree in it as for the revival of this false wit it happened about the time of the revival of letters but as soon as it was once detected it immediately vanished and disappeared at the same time there is no question but as it has sunk in one age and rose in another it will again recover it self in some distant period of time as pedantry and ignorance shall prevail upon wit and sense and to speak the truth i do very much apprehend by some of the last winters productions which had their sets of admirers that our posterity will in a few years degenerate into a race of punnsters at least a man may be very excusable for any apprehensions of this kind that has seen acrosticks handed about the town with great secrecy and applause to which i must also add a little epigram called the witches prayer that fell into verse when it was read either backward or forward excepting only that it cursed one way and blessed the other when one sees there are actually such painstakers among our british wits who can tell what it may end in if we must lash one another let it be with the manly strokes of wit and satyr for i am of the old philosophers opinion that if i must suffer from one or the other i would rather it should be from the paw of a lion than the hoof of an ass i do not speak this out of any spirit of party there is a most crying dulness on both sides i have seen tory acrosticks and whig anagrams and do not quarrel with either of them because they are whigs or tories but because they are anagrams and acrosticks  but to return to punning having pursued the history of a punn from its original to its downfal i shall here define it to be a conceit arising from the use of two words that agree in the sound but differ in the sense the only way therefore to try a piece of wit is to translate it into a different language if it bears the test you may pronounce it true but if it vanishes in the experiment you may conclude it to have been a punn in short one may say of a punn as the countryman described his nightingale that it is vox et præterea nihil a sound and nothing but a sound on the contrary one may represent true wit by the description which aristinetus makes of a fine woman when she is dressed she is beautiful when she is undressed she is beautiful or as mercerus has translated

et principium et fons  hor   mr lock has an admirable reflexion upon the difference of wit and judgment whereby he endeavours to shew the reason why they are not always the talents of the same person his words are as follows and hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observation that men who have a great deal of wit and prompt memories have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason for wit lying most in the assemblage of ideas and putting those together with quickness and variety wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy judgment on the contrary lies quite on the other side in separating carefully one from another ideas wherein can be found the least difference thereby to avoid being misled by similitude and by affinity to take one thing for another this is a way of proceeding quite contrary to metaphor and allusion wherein for the most part lies that entertainment and pleasantry of wit which strikes so lively on the fancy and is therefore so acceptable to all people  this is i think the best and most philosophical account that i have ever met with of wit which generally though not always consists in such a resemblance and congruity of ideas as this author mentions i shall only add to it by way of explanation that every resemblance of ideas is not that which we call wit unless it be such an one that gives delight and surprise to the reader these two properties seem essential to wit more particularly the last of them in order therefore that the resemblance in the ideas be wit it is necessary that the ideas should not lie too near one another in the nature of things for where the likeness is obvious it gives no surprize to compare one mans singing to that of another or to represent the whiteness of any object by that of milk and snow or the variety of its colours by those of the rainbow cannot be called wit unless besides this obvious resemblance there be some further congruity discovered in the two ideas that is capable of giving the reader some surprize thus when a poet tells us the bosom of his mistress is as white as snow there is no wit in the comparison but when he adds with a sigh that it is as cold too it then grows into wit every readers memory may supply him with innumerable instances of the same nature for this reason the similitudes in heroick poets who endeavour rather to fill the mind with great conceptions than to divert it with such as are new and surprizing have seldom any thing in them that can be called wit mr locks account of wit with this short explanation comprehends most of the species of wit as metaphors similitudes allegories ænigmas mottos parables fables dreams visions dramatick writings burlesque and all the methods of allusion as there are many other pieces of wit how remote soever they may appear at first sight from the foregoing description which upon examination will be found to agree with it  as true wit generally consists in this resemblance and congruity of ideas false wit chiefly consists in the resemblance and congruity sometimes of single letters as in anagrams chronograms lipograms and acrosticks sometimes of syllables as in ecchos and doggerel rhymes sometimes of words as in punns and quibbles and sometimes of whole sentences or poems cast into the figures of eggs axes or altars nay some carry the notion of wit so far as to ascribe it even to external mimickry and to look upon a man as an ingenious person that can resemble the tone posture or face of another  as true wit consists in the resemblance of ideas and false wit in the resemblance of words according to the foregoing instances there is another kind of wit which consists partly in the resemblance of ideas and partly in the resemblance of words which for distinction sake i shall call mixt wit this kind of wit is that which abounds in cowley more than in any author that ever wrote mr waller has likewise a great deal of it mr dryden is very sparing in it milton had a genius much above it spencer is in the same class with milton the italians even in their epic poetry are full of it monsieur boileau who formed himself upon the ancient poets has every where rejected it with scorn if we look after mixt wit among the greek writers we shall find it no where but in the epigrammatists there are indeed some strokes of it in the little poem ascribed to musœus which by that as well as many other marks betrays it self to be a modern composition if we look into the latin writers we find none of this mixt wit in virgil lucretius or catullus very little in horace but a great deal of it in ovid and scarce any thing else in martial  out of the innumerable branches of mixt wit i shall choose one instance which may be met with in all the writers of this class the passion of love in its nature has been thought to resemble fire for which reason the words fire and flame are made use of to signify love the witty poets therefore have taken an advantage from the doubtful meaning of the word fire to make an infinite number of witticisms cowley observing the cold regard of his mistresss eyes and at the same time their power of producing love in him considers them as burningglasses made of ice and finding himself able to live in the greatest extremities of love concludes the torrid zone to be habitable when his mistress has read his letter written in juice of lemmon by holding it to the fire he desires her to read it over a second time by loves flames when she weeps he wishes it were inward heat that distilled those drops from the limbeck when she is absent he is beyond eighty that is thirty degrees nearer the pole than when she is with him his ambitious love is a fire that naturally mounts upwards his happy love is the beams of heaven and his unhappy love flames of hell when it does not let him sleep it is a flame that sends up no smoak when it is opposed by counsel and advice it is a fire that rages the more by the winds blowing upon it upon the dying of a tree in which he had cut his loves he observes that his written flames had burnt up and withered the tree when he resolves to give over his passion he tells us that one burnt like him for ever dreads the fire his heart is an ætna that instead of vulcans shop incloses cupids forge in it his endeavouring to drown his love in wine is throwing oil upon the fire he would insinuate to his mistress that the fire of love like that of the sun which produces so many living creatures should not only warm but beget love in another place cooks pleasure at his fire sometimes the poets heart is frozen in every breast and sometimes scorched in every eye sometimes he is drowned in tears and burnt in love like a ship set on fire in the middle of the sea  the reader may observe in every one of these instances that the poet mixes the qualities of fire with those of love and in the same sentence speaking of it both as a passion and as real fire surprizes the reader with those seeming resemblances or contradictions that make up all the wit in this kind of writing mixt wit therefore is a composition of punn and true wit and is more or less perfect as the resemblance lies in the ideas or in the words its foundations are laid partly in falsehood and partly in truth reason puts in her claim for one half of it and extravagance for the other the only province therefore for this kind of wit is epigram or those little occasional poems that in their own nature are nothing else but a tissue of epigrams i cannot conclude this head of mixt wit without owning that the admirable poet out of whom i have taken the examples of it had as much true wit as any author that ever writ and indeed all other talents of an extraordinary genius  it may be expected since i am upon this subject that i should take notice of mr drydens definition of wit which with all the deference that is due to the judgment of so great a man is not so properly a definition of wit as of good writing in general wit as he defines it is a propriety of words and thoughts adapted to the subject  if this be a true definition of wit i am apt to think that euclid was  the greatest wit that ever set pen to paper it is certain that never was a greater propriety of words and thoughts adapted to the subject than what that author has made use of in his elements i shall only appeal to my reader if this definition agrees with any notion he has of wit if it be a true one i am sure mr dryden was not only a better poet but a greater wit than mr cowley and virgil a much more facetious man than either ovid or martial  bouhours whom i look upon to be the most penetrating of all the french criticks has taken pains to shew that it is impossible for any thought to be beautiful which is not just and has not its foundation in the nature of things that the basis of all wit is truth and that no thought can be valuable of which good sense is not the groundwork  boileau has endeavoured to inculcate the same notions in several parts of his writings both in prose and verse  this is that natural way of writing that beautiful simplicity which we so much admire in the compositions of the ancients and which no body deviates from but those who want strength of genius to make a thought shine in its own natural beauties poets who want this strength of genius to give that majestick simplicity to nature which we so much admire in the works of the ancients are forced to hunt after foreign ornaments and not to let any piece of wit of what kind soever escape them i look upon these writers as goths in poetry who like those in architecture not being able to come up to the beautiful simplicity of the old greeks and romans have endeavoured to supply its place with all the extravagancies of an irregular fancy mr dryden makes a very handsome observation on ovids writing a letter from dido to æneas in the following words  ovid says he speaking of virgils fiction of dido and æneas takes it up after him even in the same age and makes an ancient heroine of virgils newcreated dido dictates a letter for her just before her death to the ungrateful fugitive and very unluckily for himself is for measuring a sword with a man so much superior in force to him on the same subject i think i may be judge of this because i have translated both the famous author of the art of love has nothing of his own he borrows all from a greater master in his own profession and which is worse improves nothing which he finds nature fails him and being forced to his old shift he has recourse to witticism this passes indeed with his soft admirers and gives him the preference to virgil in their esteem were not i supported by so great an authority as that of mr dryden i should not venture to observe that the taste of most of our english poets as well as readers is extremely gothick he quotes monsieur segrais  for a threefold distinction of the readers of poetry in the first of which he comprehends the rabble of readers whom he does not treat as such with regard to their quality but to their numbers and coarseness of their taste his words are as follow segrais has distinguished the readers of poetry according to their capacity of judging into three classes he might have said the same of writers too if he had pleased in the lowest form he places those whom he calls les petits esprits such things as are our uppergallery audience in a playhouse who like nothing but the husk and rind of wit prefer a quibble a conceit an epigram before solid sense and elegant expression these are mob readers if virgil and martial stood for parliamentmen we know already who would carry it but though they make the greatest appearance in the field and cry the loudest the best ont is they are but a sort of french huguenots or dutch boors brought over in herds but not naturalized who have not lands of two pounds per annum in parnassus and therefore are not privileged to poll their authors are of the same level fit to represent them on a mountebanks stage or to be masters of the ceremonies in a beargarden yet these are they who have the most admirers but it often happens to their mortification that as their readers improve their stock of sense as they may by reading better books and by conversation with men of judgment they soon forsake them i must not dismiss this subject without  observing that as mr lock in the passage abovementioned has discovered the most fruitful source of wit so there is another of a quite contrary nature to it which does likewise branch it self out into several kinds for not only the resemblance but the opposition of ideas does very often produce wit as i could shew in several little points

natural several of the trees blossomed in leafgold some of them produced bonelace and some of them precious stones the fountains bubbled in an opera tune and were filled with stags wildboars and mermaids that lived among the waters at the same time that dolphins and several kinds of fish played upon the banks or took their pastime in the meadows the birds had many of them golden beaks and human voices the flowers perfumed the air with smells of incense ambergreese and pulvillios  and were so interwoven with one another that they grew up in pieces of embroidery the winds were filled with sighs and messages of distant lovers as i was walking to and fro in this enchanted wilderness i could not forbear breaking out into soliloquies upon the several wonders which lay before me when to my great surprize i found there were artificial ecchoes in every walk that by repetitions of certain words which i spoke agreed with me or contradicted me in every thing i said in the midst of my conversation with these invisible companions i discovered in the centre of a very dark grove a monstrous fabrick built after the gothick manner and covered with innumerable devices in that barbarous kind of sculpture i immediately went up to it and found it to be a kind of heathen temple consecrated to the god of dullness upon my entrance i saw the deity of the place dressed in the habit of a monk with a book in one hand and a rattle in the other upon his right hand was industry with a lamp burning before her and on his left caprice with a monkey sitting on her shoulder before his feet there stood an altar of a very odd make which as i afterwards found was shaped in that manner to comply with the inscription that surrounded it upon the altar there lay several offerings of axes wings and eggs cut in paper and inscribed with verses the temple was filled with votaries who applied themselves to different diversions as their fancies directed them in one part of it i saw a regiment of anagrams who were continually in motion turning to the right or to the left facing about doubling their ranks shifting their stations and throwing themselves into all the figures and countermarches of the most changeable and perplexed exercise  not far from these was a body of acrosticks made up of very disproportioned persons it was disposed into three columns the officers planting themselves in a line on the left hand of each column the officers were all of them at least six foot high and made three rows of very proper men but the common soldiers who filled up the spaces between the officers were such dwarfs cripples and scarecrows that one could hardly look upon them without laughing there were behind the acrosticks two or three files of chronograms which differed only from the former as their officers were equipped like the figure of time with an hourglass in one hand and a scythe in the other and took their posts promiscuously among the private men whom they commanded  in the body of the temple and before the very face of the deity methought i saw the phantom of tryphiodorus the lipogrammatist engaged in a ball with four and twenty persons who pursued him by turns thro all the intricacies and labyrinths of a country dance without being able to overtake him  observing several to be very busie at the western end of the temple i inquired into what they were doing and found there was in that quarter the great magazine of rebuss these were several things of the most different natures tied up in bundles and thrown upon one another in heaps like faggots you might behold an anchor a nightrail and a hobbyhorse bound up together one of the workmen seeing me very much surprized told me there was an infinite deal of wit in several of those bundles and that he would explain them to me if i pleased i thanked him for his civility but told him i was in very great haste at that time as i was going out of the temple i observed in one corner of it a cluster of men and women laughing very heartily and diverting themselves at a game of crambo i heard several double rhymes as i passed by them which raised a great deal of mirth  not far from these was another set of merry people engaged at a diversion in which the whole jest was to mistake one person for another to give occasion for these ludicrous mistakes they were divided into pairs every pair being covered from head to foot with the same kind of dress though perhaps there was not the least resemblance in their faces by this means an old man was sometimes mistaken for a boy a woman for a man and a blackamoor for an european which very often produced great peals of laughter these i guessed to be a party of punns but being very desirous to get out of this world of magick which had almost turned my brain i left the temple and crossed over the fields that lay about it with all the speed i could make i was not gone far before i heard the sound of trumpets and alarms which seemed to proclaim the march of an enemy and as i afterwards found was in reality what i apprehended it there appeared at a great distance a very shining light and in the midst of it a person of a most beautiful aspect her name was truth on her right hand there marched a male deity who bore several quivers on his shoulders — and grasped several arrows in his hand his name was wit the approach of these two enemies filled all the territories of false wit with an unspeakable consternation insomuch that the goddess of those regions appeared in person upon her frontiers with the several inferior deities and the different bodies of forces which i had before seen in the temple who were now drawn up in array and prepared to give their foes a warm reception as the march of the enemy was very slow it gave time to the several inhabitants who bordered upon the regions of falsehood to draw their forces into a body with a design to stand upon their guard as neuters and attend the issue of the combat  i must here inform my reader that the frontiers of the enchanted region which i have before described were inhabited by the species of mixed wit who made a very odd appearance when they were mustered together in an army there were men whose bodies were stuck full of darts and women whose eyes were burningglasses men that had hearts of fire and women that had breasts of snow it would be endless to describe several monsters of the like nature that composed this great army which immediately fell asunder and divided itself into two parts the one half throwing themselves behind the banners of truth and the others behind those of falsehood  the goddess of falsehood was of a gigantick stature and advanced some paces before the front of her army but as the dazling light which flowed from truth began to shine upon her she faded insensibly insomuch that in a little space she looked rather like an huge phantom than a real substance at length as the goddess of truth approached still nearer to her she fell away entirely and vanished amidst the brightness of her presence so that there did not remain the least trace or impression of her figure in the place where she had been seen  as at the rising of the sun the constellations grow thin and the stars go out one after another till the whole hemisphere is extinguished such was the vanishing of the goddess and not only of the goddess her self but of the whole army that attended her which sympathized with their leader and shrunk into nothing in proportion as the goddess disappeared at the same time the whole temple sunk the fish betook themselves to the streams and the wild beasts to the woods the fountains recovered their murmurs the birds their voices the trees their leaves the flowers their scents and the whole face of nature its true and genuine appearance tho i still continued asleep i fancied my self as it were awakened out of a dream when i saw this region of prodigies restored to woods and rivers fields and meadows  upon the removal of that wild scene of wonders which had very much disturbed my imagination i took a full survey of the persons of wit and truth for indeed it was impossible to look upon the first without seeing the other at the same time there was behind them a strong and compact body of figures the genius of heroic poetry appeared with a sword in her hand and a lawrel on her head tragedy was crowned

awed and delighted with the appearance of the god of wit there was something so amiable and yet so piercing in his looks as inspired me at once with love and terror as i was gazing on him to my unspeakable joy he took a quiver of arrows from his shoulder in order to make me a present of it but as i was reaching out my hand to receive it of him i knocked it against a chair and by that means

against the rules of nature law and common sense but at present i shall confine my consideration of the effect it has upon mens minds by looking into our behaviour when it is the fashion to go into mourning the custom of representing the grief we have for the loss of the dead by our habits certainly had its rise from the real sorrow of such as were too much distressed to take the proper care they ought of their dress by degrees it prevailed that such as had this inward oppression upon their minds made an apology for not joining with the rest of the world in their ordinary diversions by a dress suited to their condition this therefore was at first assumed by such only as were under real distress to whom it was a relief that they had nothing about them so light and gay as to be irksome to the gloom and melancholy of their inward reflections or that might misrepresent them to others in process of time this laudable distinction of the sorrowful was lost and mourning is now worn by heirs and widows you see nothing but magnificence and solemnity in the equipage of the relict and an air of  release from servitude in the pomp of a son who has lost a wealthy father this fashion of sorrow is now become a generous part of the ceremonial between princes and sovereigns who in the language of all nations are stiled brothers to each other and put on the purple upon the death of any potentate with whom they live in amity courtiers and all who wish themselves such are immediately seized with grief from head to foot upon this disaster to their prince so that one may know by the very buckles of a gentlemanusher what degree of friendship any deceased monarch maintained with the court to which he belongs a good courtiers habit and behaviour is hieroglyphical on these occasions he deals much in whispers and you may see he dresses according to the best intelligence  the general affectation among men of appearing greater than they are makes the whole world run into the habit of the court you see the lady who the day before was as various as a rainbow upon the time appointed for beginning to mourn as dark as a cloud this humour does not prevail only on those whose fortunes can support any change in their equipage not on those only whose incomes demand the wantonness of new appearances but on such also who have just enough to cloath them an old acquaintance of mine of ninety pounds a year who has naturally the vanity of being a man of fashion deep at his heart is very much put to it to bear the mortality of princes he made a new black suit upon the death of the king of spain he turned it for the king of portugal and he now keeps his chamber while it is scouring for the emperor  he is a good œconomist in his extravagance and makes only a fresh black button upon his irongray suit for any potentate of small territories he indeed adds his crape hatband for a prince whose exploits he has admired in the gazette but whatever compliments may be made on these occasions the true mourners are the mercers silkmen lacemen and milliners a prince of merciful and royal disposition would reflect with great anxiety upon the prospect of his death if he considered what numbers would be reduced to misery by that accident only he would think it of moment enough to direct that in the notification of his departure the honour done to him might be restrained to those of the houshold of the prince to whom it should be signified he would think a general mourning to be in a less degree the same ceremony which is practised in barbarous nations of killing their slaves to attend the obsequies of their kings  i had been wonderfully at a loss for many months together to guess at the character of a man who came now and then to our coffeehouse he ever ended a newspaper with this reflection well i see all the foreign princes are in good health if you asked pray sir what says the postman from vienna he answered make us thankful the german princes are all well what does he say from barcelona he does not speak but that the country agrees very well with the new queen after very much enquiry i found this man of universal loyalty was a wholesale dealer in silks and ribbons his way is it seems if he hires a weaver or workman to have it inserted in his articles that all this shall be well and truly performed provided no foreign potentate shall depart this life within the time abovementioned it happens in all publick mournings that the many trades which depend upon our habits are during that folly either pinched with present want or terrified with the apparent approach of it all the atonement which men can make for wanton expences which is a sort of insulting the scarcity under which others labour is that the superfluities of the wealthy give supplies to the necessities of the poor but instead of any other good arising from the affectation of being in courtly habits of mourning all order seems to be destroyed by it and the true honour which one court does to another on that occasion loses its force and efficacy when a foreign minister beholds the court of a nation which flourishes in riches and plenty lay aside upon the loss of his master all marks of splendor and magnificence though the head of such a joyful people he will conceive greater idea of the honour done his master than when he sees the generality of the people in the same habit when one is afraid to ask the wife of a tradesman whom she has lost of her family and after some preparation endeavours to know whom she mourns for how ridiculous is it to hear her explain her self that we have lost one of the house of austria princes are elevated so highly above the rest of mankind that it is a presumptuous distinction to take a part in honours done to their memories except we have authority for it by being related in a particular manner to the court which pays that veneration to their friendship and seems to express on such an occasion the sense of the uncertainty of human life in general by assuming the habit of sorrow though in the full possession of triumph and royalty  r      footnote     of a return to footnote mark   footnote    the death of

all that labour seems but an useless enquiry without some time be spent in considering the application of it the seat of wit when one speaks as a man of the town and the world is the playhouse i shall therefore fill this paper with reflections upon the use of it in that place the application of wit in the theatre has as strong an effect upon the manners of our gentlemen as the taste of it has upon the writings of our authors it may perhaps look like a very presumptuous work though not foreign from the duty of a spectator to tax the writings of such as have long had the general applause of a nation but i shall always make reason truth and nature the measures of praise and dispraise if those are for me the generality of opinion is of no consequence against me if they are against me the general opinion cannot long support me  without further preface i am going to look into some of our most applauded plays and see whether they deserve the figure they at present bear in the imagination of men or not  in reflecting upon these works i shall chiefly dwell upon that for which each respective play is most celebrated the present paper shall be employed upon sir fopling flutter  the received character of this play is that it is the pattern of genteel comedy dorimant and harriot are the characters of greatest consequence and if these are low and mean the reputation of the play is very unjust  i will take for granted that a fine gentleman should be honest in his actions and refined in his language instead of this our hero in this piece is a direct knave in his designs and a clown in his language bellair is his admirer and friend in return for which because he is forsooth a greater wit than his said friend he thinks it reasonable to persuade him to marry a young lady whose virtue he thinks will last no longer than till she is a wife and then she cannot but fall to his share as he is an irresistible fine gentleman the falshood to mrs loveit and the barbarity of triumphing over her anguish for losing him is another instance of his honesty as well as his goodnature as to his fine language he calls the orangewoman who it seems is inclined to grow fat an overgrown jade with a flasket of guts before her and salutes her with a pretty phrase of how now double tripe upon the mention of a country gentlewoman whom he knows nothing of no one can imagine why he will lay his life she is some awkward illfashioned country toad who not having above four dozen of hairs on her head has adorned her baldness with a large white fruz that she may look sparkishly in the forefront of the kings box at an old play unnatural mixture of senseless commonplace  as to the generosity of his temper he tells his poor footman if he did not wait better — he would turn him away in the insolent phrase of ill uncase you  now for mrs harriot she laughs at obedience to an absent mother whose tenderness busie describes to be very exquisite for that she is so pleased with finding harriot again that she cannot chide her for being out of the way this witty daughter and fine lady has so little respect for this good woman that she ridicules her air in taking leave and cries in what struggle is my poor mother yonder see see her head tottering her eyes staring and her under lip trembling but all this is atoned for because she has more wit than is usual in her sex and as much malice tho she is as wild as you would wish her and has a demureness in her looks that makes it so surprising then to recommend her as a fit spouse for his hero the poet makes her speak her sense of marriage very ingeniously i think says she i might be brought to endure him and that is all a reasonable woman should expect in an husband it is methinks unnatural that we are not made to understand how she that was bred under a silly pious old mother that would never trust her out of her sight came to be so polite it cannot be denied but that the negligence of every thing which engages the attention of the sober and valuable part of mankind appears very well drawn in this piece but it is denied that it is necessary to the character of a fine gentleman that he should in that manner trample upon all order and decency as for the character of dorimant it is more of a coxcomb than that of fopling he says of one of his companions that a good correspondence between them is their mutual interest speaking of that friend he declares their being much together makes the women think the better of his understanding and judge more favourably of my reputation it makes him pass upon some for a man of very good sense and me upon others for a very civil person  this whole celebrated piece is a perfect contradiction to good manners good sense and common honesty and as there is nothing in it but what is built upon the ruin of virtue and innocence according to the notion of merit in this comedy i take the shoemaker to be in reality the fine gentleman of the play for it seems he is an atheist if we may depend upon his character as given by the orangewoman who is her self far from being the lowest in the play she says of a fine man who is dorimants companion there is not such another heathen in the town except the shoemaker his pretension to be the hero of the drama appears still more in his own description of his way of living with his lady there is says he never a man in town lives more like a gentleman with his wife than i do i never mind her motions she never enquires into mine we speak to one another civilly hate one another heartily and because it is vulgar to lye and soak together we have each of us our several settlebed that of soaking together is as good as if dorimant had spoken it himself and i think since he puts human nature in as ugly a form as the circumstances will bear and is a staunch unbeliever he is very much wronged in having no part of the good fortune bestowed in the last act  to speak plainly of this whole work i think nothing but being lost to a sense of innocence and virtue can make any one see this comedy without observing more frequent occasion to move sorrow and indignation than mirth and laughter at the same time i allow it to be nature but it is nature in its utmost corruption and degeneracy   r      footnote     the man of mode or sir fopling flutter by sir george etherege produced in      etherege painted

behalf of a young country kinswoman of mine who is lately come to town and under my care for her education she is very pretty but you cant imagine how unformed a creature it is she comes to my hands just as nature left her halffinished and without any acquired improvements when i look on her i often think of the belle sauvage mentioned in one of your papers dear mr spectator help me to make her comprehend the visible graces of speech and the dumb eloquence of motion for she is at present a perfect stranger to both she knows no way to express her self but by her tongue and that always to signify her meaning her eyes serve her yet only to see with and she is utterly a foreigner to the language of looks and glances in this i fancy you could help her better than any body i have bestowed two months in teaching her to sigh when she is not concerned and to smile when she is not pleased and am ashamed to own she makes little or no improvement then she is no more able now to walk than she was to go at a year old by walking you will easily know i mean that regular but easy motion which gives our persons so irresistible a grace as if we moved to musick and is a kind of disengaged figure or if i may so speak recitative dancing but the want of this i cannot blame in her for i find she has no ear and means nothing by walking but to change her place i could pardon too her blushing if she knew how to carry her self in it and if it did not manifestly injure her complexion  they tell me you are a person who have seen the world and are a judge of fine breeding which makes me ambitious of some instructions from you for her improvement which when you have favoured me with i shall further advise with you about the disposal of this fair forrester in marriage for i will make it no secret to you that her person and education are to be her fortune i am sir your very humble servant celimene     sir being employed by celimene to make up and send to you her letter i make bold to recommend the case therein mentioned to your consideration because she and i happen to differ a little in our notions i who am a rough man am afraid the young girl is in a fair way to be spoiled therefore pray mr spectator let us have your opinion of this fine thing called fine breeding for i am afraid it differs too much from that plain thing called good breeding your most humble servant  the general mistake among us in the educating our children is that in our daughters we take care of their persons and neglect their minds in our sons we are so intent upon adorning their minds that we wholly neglect their bodies it is from this that you shall see a young lady celebrated and admired in all the assemblies about town when her elder brother is afraid to come into a room from this ill management it arises that we frequently observe a mans life is half spent before he is taken notice of and a woman in the prime of her years is out of fashion and neglected the boy i shall consider upon some other occasion and at present stick to the girl and i am the more inclined to this because i have several letters which complain to me that my female readers have not understood me for some days last past and take themselves to be unconcerned in the present turn of my writings when a girl is safely brought from her nurse before she is capable of forming one simple notion of any thing in life she is delivered to the hands of her dancingmaster and with a collar round her neck the pretty wild thing is taught a fantastical gravity of behaviour and forced to a particular way of holding her head heaving her breast and moving with her whole body and all this under pain of never having an husband if she steps looks or moves awry this gives the young lady wonderful workings of imagination what is to pass between her and this husband that she is every moment told of and for whom she seems to be educated thus her fancy is engaged to turn all her endeavours to the ornament of her person as what must determine her good and ill in this life and she naturally thinks if she is tall enough she is wise enough for any thing for which her education makes her think she is designed to make her an agreeable person is the main purpose of her parents to that is all their cost to that all their care directed and from this general folly of parents we owe our present numerous race of coquets these reflections puzzle me when i think of giving my advice on the subject of managing the wild thing mentioned in the letter of my correspondent but sure there is a middle way to be followed the management of a young ladys person is not to be overlooked but the erudition of her mind is much more to be regarded according as this is managed you will see the mind follow the appetites of the body or the body express the virtues of the mind  cleomira dances with all the elegance of motion imaginable but her eyes are so chastised with the simplicity and innocence of her thoughts that she raises in her beholders admiration and good will but no loose hope or wild imagination the true art in this case is to make the mind and body improve together and if possible to make gesture follow

a philosopher chiding his friend for his being a lover of dancing and a frequenter of balls  the other undertakes the defence of his favourite diversion which he says was at first invented by the goddess rhea and preserved the life of jupiter himself from the cruelty of his father saturn he proceeds to shew that it had been approved by the greatest men in all ages that homer calls merion a fine dancer and says that the graceful mien and great agility which he had acquired by that exercise distinguished him above the rest in the armies both of greeks and trojans  he adds that pyrrhus gained more reputation by inventing the dance which is called after his name than by all his other actions that the lacedæmonians who were the bravest people in greece gave great encouragement to this diversion and made their hormus a dance much resembling the french brawl famous over all asia that there were still extant some thessalian statues erected to the honour of their best dancers and that he wondered how his brother philosopher could declare himself against the opinions of those two persons whom he professed so much to admire homer and hesiod the latter of which compares valour and dancing together and says that the gods have bestowed fortitude on some men and on others a disposition for dancing  lastly he puts him in mind that socrates who in the judgment of apollo was the wisest of men was not only a professed admirer of this exercise in others but learned it himself when he was an old man  the morose philosopher is so much affected by these and some other authorities that he becomes a convert to his friend and desires he would take him with him when he went to his next ball  i love to shelter my self under the examples of great men and i think i have sufficiently shewed that it is not below the dignity of these my speculations to take notice of the following letter which i suppose is sent me by some substantial tradesman about change sir  i am a man in years and by an honest industry in the world have acquired enough to give my children a liberal education tho i was an utter stranger to it my self my eldest daughter a girl of sixteen has for some time been under the tuition of monsieur rigadoon a dancingmaster in the city and i was prevailed upon by her and her mother to go last night to one of his balls i must own to you sir that having never been at any such place before i was very much pleased and surprized with that part of his entertainment which he called french dancing there were several young men and women whose limbs seemed to have no other motion but purely what the musick gave them after this part was over they began a diversion which they call country dancing and wherein there were also some things not disagreeable and divers emblematical figures composd as i guess by wise men for the instruction of youth  among the rest i observed one which i think they call hunt the squirrel in which while the woman flies the man pursues her but as soon as she turns he runs away and she is obliged to follow  the moral of this dance does i think very aptly recommend modesty and discretion to the female sex  but as the best institutions are liable to corruptions so sir i must acquaint you that very great abuses are crept into this entertainment i was amazed to see my girl handed by and handing young fellows with so much familiarity and i could not have thought it had been in the child they very often made use of a most impudent and lascivious step called setting which i know not how to describe to you but by telling you that it is the very reverse of back to back at last an impudent young dog bid the fidlers play a dance called mol patley  and after having made two or three capers ran to his partner locked his arms in hers and whisked her round cleverly above ground in such manner that i who sat upon one of the lowest benches saw further above her shoe than i can think fit to acquaint you with i could no longer endure these enormities wherefore just as my girl was going to be made a whirligig i ran in seized on the child and carried her home  sir i am not yet old enough to be a fool i suppose this diversion might be at first invented to keep up a good understanding between young men and women and so far i am not against it but i shall never allow of these things i know not what you will say to this case at present but am sure that had you been with me you would have seen matter of great speculation  i am  yours c  i must confess i am afraid that my correspondent had too much reason to be a little out of humour at the treatment of his daughter but i conclude that he would have been much more so had he seen one of those kissing dances in which will honeycomb assures me they are obliged to dwell almost a minute on the fair ones lips or they will be too quick for the musick and dance quite out of time  i am not able however to give my final sentence against this diversion and am of mr cowleys opinion  that so much of dancing at least as belongs to the behaviour and an handsome carriage of the body is extreamly useful if not absolutely necessary  we generally form such ideas of people at first sight as we are hardly ever persuaded to lay aside afterwards for this reason a man would wish to have nothing disagreeable or uncomely in his approaches and to be able to enter a room with a good grace  i might add that a moderate knowledge in the little rules of goodbreeding gives a man some assurance and makes him easie in all companies for want of this i have seen a professor of a liberal science at a loss to salute a lady and a most excellent mathematician not able to determine whether he should stand or sit while my lord drank to him  it is the proper business of a dancingmaster to regulate these matters tho i take it to be a just observation that unless you add something of your own to what these fine gentlemen teach you and which they are wholly ignorant of themselves you will much sooner get the character of an affected fop than of a wellbred man  as for country dancing it must indeed be confessed that the great familiarities between the two sexes on this occasion may sometimes produce very dangerous consequences and i have often thought that few ladies hearts are so obdurate as not to be melted by the charms of musick the force of motion and an handsome young fellow who is continually playing before their eyes and convincing them that he has the perfect use of all his limbs  but as this kind of dance is the particular invention of our own country and as every one is more or less a proficient in it i would not discountenance it but rather suppose it may be practised innocently by others as well as myself who am often partner to my landladys eldest

contracted assembly of men and women the talk generally runs upon the weather fashions news and the like publick topicks in proportion as conversation gets into clubs and knots of friends it descends

indeed there is no subject of morality which has been better handled and more exhausted than this among the several fine things which have been spoken of it i shall beg leave to quote some out of a very ancient author whose book would be regarded by our modern wits as one of the most shining tracts of morality that is extant if it appeared under the name of a confucius or of any celebrated grecian philosopher i mean the little apocryphal treatise entitled the wisdom of the son of sirach how finely has he described the art of making friends by an obliging and affable behaviour and laid down that precept which a late excellent author has delivered as his own that we should have many wellwishers but few friends  sweet language will multiply friends and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings be in peace with many nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand  with what prudence does he caution us in the choice of our friends and with what strokes of nature i could almost say of humour has he described the behaviour of a treacherous and selfinterested friend if thou wouldst get a friend prove him first and be not hasty to credit him for some man is a friend for his own occasion and will not abide in the day of thy trouble and there is a friend who being turned to enmity and strife will discover thy reproach again some friend is a companion at the table and will not continue in the day of thy affliction but in thy prosperity he will be as thy self and will be bold over thy servants if thou be brought low he will be against thee and hide himself from thy face  what can be more strong and pointed than the following verse separate thy self from thine enemies and take heed of thy friends in the next words he particularizes one of those fruits of friendship which is described at length by the two famous authors abovementioned and falls into a general elogium of friendship which is very just as well as very sublime a faithful friend is a strong defence and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure nothing doth countervail a faithful friend and his excellency is unvaluable a faithful friend is the medicine of life and they that fear the lord shall find him whoso feareth the lord shall direct his friendship aright for as he is so shall his neighbour that is his friend be also  i do not remember to have met with any saying that has pleased me more than that of a friends being the medicine of life to express the efficacy of friendship in healing the pains and anguish which naturally cleave to our existence in this world and am wonderfully pleased with the turn in the last sentence that a virtuous man shall as a blessing meet with a friend who is as virtuous as himself there is another saying in the same author which would have been very much admired in an heathen writer forsake not an old friend for the new is not comparable to him a new friend is as new wine when it is old thou shalt drink it with pleasure  with what strength of allusion and force of thought has he described the breaches and violations of friendship whoso casteth a stone at the birds frayeth them away and he that upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship tho thou drawest a sword at a friend yet despair not for there may be a returning to favour if thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend fear not for there may be a reconciliation except for upbraiding or pride or disclosing of secrets or a treacherous wound for for these things every friend will depart  we may observe in this and several other precepts in this author those little familiar instances and illustrations which are so much admired in the moral writings of horace and epictetus there are very beautiful instances of this nature in the following passages which are likewise written upon the same subject whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit and shall never find a friend to his mind love thy friend and be faithful unto him but if thou bewrayest his secrets follow no more after him for as a man hath destroyed his enemy so hast thou lost the love of thy friend as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand so hast thou let thy friend go and shalt not get him again follow after him no mere for he is too far off he is as a roe escaped out of the snare as for a wound it may be bound up and after reviling there may be reconciliation but he that bewrayeth secrets is without hope  among the several qualifications of a good friend this wise man has very justly singled out constancy and faithfulness as the principal to these others have added virtue knowledge discretion equality in age and fortune and as cicero calls it morum comitas a pleasantness of temper  if i were to give my opinion upon such an exhausted subject i should join to these other qualifications a certainæquability or evenness of behaviour a man often contracts a friendship with one whom perhaps he does not find out till after a years conversation when on a sudden some latent ill humour breaks out upon him which he never discovered or suspected at his first entering into an intimacy with him there are several persons who in some certain periods of their lives are inexpressibly agreeable and in others as odious and detestable martial has given us a very pretty picture of one of this species in the following epigram difficilis facilis jucundus acerbus es idem nec tecum possum vivere nec sine te  in all thy humours whether grave or mellow thourt such a touchy testy pleasant fellow hast so much wit and mirth and spleen about thee there is no living with thee nor without thee it is very unlucky for a man to be entangled in a friendship with one who by these changes and vicissitudes of humour is sometimes amiable and sometimes odious and as most men are at some times in an admirable frame and disposition of mind it should be one of the greatest tasks of wisdom to keep our selves well when we are so and never to go out of that which is the agreeable part of our character  c      footnote     ecclesiasticus vii     return to footnote mark   footnote     ecclesiasticus vi   and following verses return   footnote     ecclesiasticus vi

naturally overflows with pleasure at the sight of a prosperous and happy multitude insomuch that at many publick solemnities i cannot forbear expressing my joy with tears that have stolen down my

the songs and fables that are come from father to son and are most in vogue among the common people of the countries through which i passed for it is impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approved by a multitude tho they are only the rabble of a nation which hath not in it some peculiar aptness to please and gratify the mind of man human nature is the same in all reasonable creatures and whatever falls in with it will meet with admirers amongst readers of all qualities and conditions molière as we are told by monsieur boileau used to read all his comedies to an  old woman who  was his housekeeper as she sat with him at her work by the chimneycorner and could foretel the success of his play in the theatre from the reception it met at his fireside for he tells us the audience always followed the old woman and never failed to laugh in the same place   i know nothing which more shews the essential and inherent perfection of simplicity of thought above that which i call the gothick manner in writing than this that the first pleases all kinds of palates and the latter only such as have formed to themselves a wrong artificial taste upon little fanciful authors and writers of epigram homer virgil or milton so far as the language of their poems is understood will please a reader of plain common sense who would neither relish nor comprehend an epigram of martial or a poem of cowley so on the contrary an ordinary song or ballad that is the delight of the common people cannot fail to please all such readers as are not unqualified for the entertainment by their affectation or ignorance and the reason is plain because the same paintings of nature which recommend it to the most ordinary reader will appear beautiful to the most refined  the old song of chevey chase is the favourite ballad of the common people of england and ben johnson used to say he had rather have been the author of it than of all his works sir philip sidney in his discourse of poetry  speaks of it in the following words i never heard the old song of piercy and douglas that i found not my heart more moved than with a trumpet and yet it is sung by some blind crowder with no rougher voice than rude stile which being so evil apparelled in the dust and cobweb of that uncivil age what would it work trimmed in the gorgeous eloquence of pindar for my own part i am so professed an admirer of this antiquated song that i shall give my reader a critick upon it without any further apology for so doing  the greatest modern criticks have laid it down as a rule that an heroick poem should be founded upon some important precept of morality adapted to the constitution of the country in which the poet writes homer and virgil have formed their plans in this view as greece was a collection of many governments who suffered very much among themselves and gave the persian emperor who was their common enemy many advantages over them by their mutual jealousies and animosities homer in order to establish among them an union which was so necessary for their safety grounds his poem upon the discords of the several grecian princes who were engaged in a confederacy against an asiatick prince and the several advantages which the enemy gained by such their discords at the time the poem we are now treating of was written the dissentions of the barons who were then so many petty princes ran very high whether they quarrelled among themselves or with their neighbours and produced unspeakable calamities to the country  the poet to deter men from such unnatural contentions describes a bloody battle and dreadful scene of death occasioned by the mutual feuds which reigned in the families of an english and scotch nobleman that he designed this for the instruction of his poem we may learn from his four last lines in which after the example of the modern tragedians he draws from it a precept for the benefit of his readers god save the king and bless the land in plenty joy and peace and grant henceforth that foul debate twixt noblemen may cease the next point observed by the greatest heroic poets hath been to celebrate persons and actions which do honour to their country thus virgils hero was the founder of rome homers a prince of greece and for this reason valerius flaccus and statius who were both romans might be justly derided for having chosen the expedition of the golden fleece and the wars of thebes for the subjects of their epic writings  the poet before us has not only found out an hero in his own country but raises the reputation of it by several beautiful incidents the english are the first who  take the field and the last who  quit it the english bring only fifteen hundred to the battle the scotch two thousand the english keep the field with fifty three the scotch retire with fifty five all the rest on each side being slain in battle but the most remarkable circumstance of this kind is the different manner in which the scotch and english kings receive  the news of this fight and of the great mens deaths who commanded in it this news was brought to edinburgh where scotlands king did reign that brave earl douglas suddenly was with an arrow slain  o heavy news king james did say scotland can witness be i have not any captain more of such account as he  like tydings to king henry came within as short a space that piercy of northumberland was slain in chevychase  now god be with him said our king sith twill no better be i trust i have within my realm five hundred as good as he  yet shall not scot nor scotland say but i will vengeance take and be revenged on them all for brave lord piercys sake  this vow full well the king performed after on humbledown in one day fifty knights were slain with lords of great renown  and of the rest of small account did many thousands dye c at the same time that our poet shews a laudable partiality to his countrymen he represents the scots after a manner not unbecoming so bold and brave a people earl douglas on a milkwhite steed most like a baron bold rode foremost of the company whose armour shone like gold his sentiments and actions are every way suitable to an hero one of us two says he must dye i am an earl as well as your self so that you can have no pretence for refusing the combat however says he tis pity and indeed would be a sin that so many innocent men should perish for our sakes rather let you and i end our quarrel in single fight  ere thus i will outbraved be one of us two shall dye i know thee well an earl thou art lord piercy so am i  but trust me

is denyd when these brave men had distinguished themselves in the battle and a single combat with each other in the midst of a generous parly full of heroic sentiments the scotch earl falls and with his dying words encourages his men to revenge his death representing to them as the most bitter circumstance of it that his rival saw him fall with that there came an arrow keen out of an english bow which struck earl douglas to the heart a deep and deadly blow  who never spoke more words than these fight on my merry men all for why my life is at an end lord piercy sees my fall merry men in the language of those times is no more than a cheerful word for companions and fellowsoldiers a passage in the eleventh book of virgils æneid is very much to be admired where camilla in her last agonies instead of weeping over the wound she had received as one might have expected from a warrior of her sex considers only like the hero of whom we are now speaking how the battle should be continued after her death tum sic exspirans c  a gathering mist overclouds her chearful eyes and from her cheeks the rosie colour flies then turns to her whom of her female train she trusted most and thus she speaks with pain acca tis past he swims before my sight inexorable death and claims his right bear my last words to turnus fly with speed and bid him timely to my charge succeed repel the trojans and

palmas ausonii videre  earl piercys lamentation over his enemy is generous beautiful and passionate i must only caution the reader not to let the simplicity of the stile which one may well pardon in so old a poet prejudice him against the greatness of the thought then leaving life earl piercy took the dead man by the hand and said earl douglas for thy life would i had lost my land  o christ my

any more narratives of this nature but i have lately received information of a club which i can call neither ancient nor modern that i dare say will be no less surprising to my reader than it was to my self for which reason i shall communicate it to the publick as one of the greatest curiosities in its kind  a friend of mine complaining of a tradesman who is related to him after having represented him as a very idle worthless fellow who neglected his family and spent most of his time over a bottle told me to conclude his character that he was a member of the everlasting club so very odd a title raised my curiosity to enquire into the nature of a club that had such a sounding name upon which my friend gave me the following account  the everlasting club consists of a hundred members who divide the whole twenty four hours among them in such a manner that the club sits day and night from one end of the year to another  no party presuming to rise till they are relieved by those who are in course to succeed them by this means a member of the everlasting club never wants company for tho he is not upon duty himself he is sure to find some who  are so that if he be disposed to take a whet a nooning an evenings draught or a bottle after midnight he goes to the club and finds a knot of friends to his mind  it is a maxim in this club that the steward never dies for as they succeed one another by way of rotation no man is to quit the great elbowchair which  stands at the upper end of the table till his successor is in a readiness to fill it insomuch that there has not been a sede vacante in the memory of man  this club was instituted towards the end or as some of them say about the middle of the civil wars and continued without interruption till the time of the great fire  which burnt them out and dispersed them for several weeks the steward at that time maintained his post till he had like to have been blown up with a neighbouringhouse which was demolished in order to stop the fire and would not leave the chair at last till he had emptied all the bottles upon the table and received repeated directions from the club to withdraw himself this steward is frequently talked of in the club and looked upon by every member of it as a greater man than the famous captain mentioned in my lord clarendon who  was burnt in his ship because he would not quit it without orders it is said that towards the close of   00 being the great year of jubilee the club had it under consideration whether they should break up or continue their session but after many speeches and debates it was at length agreed to sit out the other century this resolution passed in a general club nemine contradicente  having given this short account of the institution and continuation of the everlasting club i should here endeavour to say something of the manners and characters of its several members which i shall do according to the best lights i have received in this matter  it appears by their books in general that since their first institution they have smoked fifty tun of tobacco drank thirty thousand butts of ale one thousand hogsheads of red port two hundred barrels of brandy and a kilderkin of small beer there has been likewise a great consumption of cards it is also said that they observe the law in ben johnsons club which orders the fire to be always kept in focus perennis esto as well for the convenience of lighting their pipes as to cure the dampness of the clubroom they have an old woman in the nature of a vestal whose business it is to cherish and perpetuate the fire which  burns from generation to generation and has seen the glasshouse fires in and out above an hundred times  the everlasting club treats all other clubs with an eye of contempt and talks even of the kitcat and october as of a couple of upstarts their ordinary discourse as much as i have been able to learn of it turns altogether upon such adventures as have passed in their own assembly of members who have taken the glass in their turns for a week together without stirring out of their club of others who  have smoaked an hundred pipes at a sitting of others who  have not missed their mornings draught for twenty years together sometimes they speak in raptures of a run of ale in king charless reign and sometimes reflect with astonishment upon games at whisk

sensible of so many weaknesses and imperfections should be actuated by a love of fame that vice and ignorance imperfection and misery should contend for praise and endeavour as much as possible to make themselves objects of admiration  but notwithstanding mans essential perfection is but very little his comparative perfection may be very considerable if he looks upon himself in an abstracted light he has not much to boast of but if he considers himself with regard to it in others he may find occasion of glorying if not in his own virtues at least in the absence of anothers imperfections this gives a different turn to the reflections of the wise man and the fool the first endeavours to shine in himself and the last to outshine others the first is humbled by the sense of his own infirmities the last is lifted up by the discovery of those which he observes in other men the wise man considers what he wants and the fool what he abounds in the wise man is happy when he gains his own approbation and the fool when he recommends himself to the applause of those about him  but however unreasonable and absurd this passion for admiration may appear in such a creature as man it is not wholly to be discouraged since it often produces very good effects not only as it restrains him from doing any thing which  is mean and contemptible but as it pushes him to actions which  are great and glorious the principle may be defective or faulty but the consequences it produces are so good that for the benefit of mankind it ought not to be extinguished  it is observed by cicero  — that men of the greatest and the most shining parts are the most actuated by ambition and if we look into the two sexes i believe we shall find this principle of action stronger in women than in men  the passion for praise which is so very vehement in the fair sex produces excellent effects in women of sense who desire to be admired for that only which deserves admiration  and i think we may observe without a compliment to them that many of them do not only live in a more uniform course of virtue but with an infinitely greater regard to their honour than what we find in the generality of our own sex how many instances have we of chastity fidelity devotion how many ladies distinguish themselves by the education of their children care of their families and love of their husbands which are the great qualities and atchievements of womankind as the making of war the carrying on of traffic the administration of justice are those by which men grow famous and get themselves a name  but as this passion for admiration when it works according to reason improves the beautiful part of our species in every thing that is laudable so nothing is more destructive to them when it is governed by vanity and folly what i have therefore here to say only regards the vain part of the sex whom for certain reasons which the reader will hereafter see at large i shall distinguish by the name of idols an idol is wholly taken up in the adorning of her person you see in every posture of her body air of her face and motion of her head that it is her business and employment to gain adorers for this reason your idols appear in all publick places and assemblies in order to seduce men to their worship the playhouse is very frequently filled with idols several of them are carried in procession every evening about the ring and several of them set up their worship even in churches they are to be accosted in the language proper to the deity life and death are in their power joys of heaven and pains of hell are at their disposal paradise is in their arms and eternity in every moment that you are present with them raptures transports and ecstacies are the rewards which they confer sighs and tears prayers and broken hearts are the offerings which are paid to them their smiles make men happy their frowns drive them to despair i shall only add under this head that ovids book of the art of love is a kind of heathen ritual which contains all the forms of worship which are made use of to an idol  it would be as difficult a task to reckon up these different kinds of idols as miltons was  to number those that were known in canaan and the lands adjoining most of them are worshipped like moloch in fire and flames some of them like baal love to see their votaries cut and slashed and shedding their blood for them some of them like the idol in the apocrypha must have treats and collations prepared for them every night it has indeed been known that some of them have been used by their incensed worshippers like the chinese idols who are whipped and scourged when they refuse to comply with the prayers that are offered to them  i must here observe that those idolaters who devote themselves to the idols i am here speaking of differ very much from all other kinds of idolaters for as others fall out because they worship different idols these idolaters quarrel because they worship the same  the intention therefore of the idol is quite contrary to the wishes of the idolater as the one desires to confine the idol to himself the whole business and ambition of the other is to multiply adorers this humour of an idol is prettily described in a tale of chaucer he represents one of them sitting at a table with three of her votaries about her who are all of them courting her favour and paying their adorations she smiled upon one drank to another and trod upon the others foot which was under the table now which of these three says the old bard do you think was the favourite in troth says he not one of all the three   the behaviour of this old idol in chaucer puts me in mind of the beautiful clarinda one of the greatest idols among the moderns she is worshipped once a week by candlelight in the midst of a large congregation generally called an assembly some of the gayest youths in the nation endeavour to plant themselves in her eye whilst she sits in form with multitudes of tapers burning about her to encourage the zeal of her idolaters she bestows a mark of her favour upon every one of them before they go out of her presence she asks a question of one tells a story to another glances an ogle upon a third takes a pinch of snuff from the fourth lets her fan drop by accident to give the fifth an occasion of taking it up in short every one goes away satisfied with his success and encouraged to renew his devotions on the same canonical hour that day sevennight  an idol may be undeified by many accidental causes marriage in particular is a kind of counterapotheosis or a deification inverted when a man becomes familiar with his goddess she quickly sinks into a woman  old age is likewise a great decayer of your idol the truth of it is there is not a more unhappy being than a superannuated idol especially when she has contracted such airs and behaviour as are only graceful when her worshippers are about her  considering therefore that in these and many other cases the woman generally outlives the idol i must return to the moral of this paper and desire my fair readers to give a proper direction to their passion for being admired in order to which they must endeavour to make themselves the objects of a reasonable and lasting admiration this is not to be hoped for from beauty or dress or fashion but from those inward ornaments which are not to be defaced by time or sickness and which appear most amiable to those who are most acquainted with them  c      footnote     that return to footnote mark   footnote    tuscul quæst

opera interrupta   virg   in my last mondays paper i gave some general instances of those beautiful strokes which please the reader in the old song of cheveychase i shall here according to my promise be more particular and shew that the sentiments in that ballad are extremely natural and poetical and full of the  majestick simplicity which we admire in the greatest of the ancient poets for which reason i shall quote several passages of it in which the thought is altogether the same with what we meet in several passages of the æneid not that i would infer from thence that the poet whoever he was proposed to himself any imitation of those passages but that he was directed to them in general by the same kind of poetical genius and by the same copyings after nature  had this old song been filled with epigrammatical turns and points of wit it might perhaps have pleased the wrong taste of some readers but it would never have become the delight of the common people nor have warmed the heart of sir philip sidney like the sound of a trumpet it is only nature that can have this effect and please those tastes which are the most unprejudiced or the most refined i must however beg leave to dissent from so great an authority as that of sir philip sidney in the judgment which he has passed as to the rude stile and evil apparel of this antiquated song for there are several parts in it where not only the thought but the language is majestick and the numbers sonorous  at least the apparel is much more gorgeous than many of the poets made use of in queen elizabeths time as the reader will see in several of the following quotations  what can be greater than either the thought or the expression in that stanza to drive the deer with hound and horn earl piercy took his way the child may rue that was unborn the hunting of that day this way of considering the misfortunes which this battle would bring upon posterity not only on those who were born immediately after the battle and lost their fathers in it but on those also who perished  in future battles which took their rise  from this quarrel of the two earls is wonderfully beautiful and conformable to the way of thinking among the ancient poets audiet pugnas vilio parentum rara juventus  hor what can be more sounding and poetical resemble more the majestic simplicity of the ancients than the following stanzas the stout earl of northumberland a vow to god did make his pleasure in the scotish woods three summers days to take  with fifteen hundred bowmen bold all chosen men of might who knew full well in time of need to aim their shafts aright  the hounds ran swiftly thro the woods the nimble deer to take and with their cries the hills and dales an eccho shrill did make      vocat ingenti clamore cithseron taygetique canes domitrixque epidaurus equorum et vox assensu nemorum ingeminata remugit     lo yonder doth earl dowglas come his men in armour bright full twenty hundred scottish spears all marching in our sight  all men of pleasant tividale fast by the river tweed etc the country of the scotch warriors described in these two last verses has a fine romantick situation and affords a couple of smooth words for verse if the reader compares the forgoing six lines of the song with the following latin verses he will see how much they are written in the spirit of virgil adversi campo apparent hastasque reductis protendunt longe dextris et spicula vibrant quique altum preneste viri quique arva gabinæ junonis gelidumque anienem et roscida rivis hernica saxa colunt  qui rosea rura velini qui terticæ horrentes rupes montemque severum casperiamque colunt forulosque et flumen himellæ qui tiberim fabarimque bibunt  but to proceed earl dowglas on a milkwhite steed most like a baron bold rode foremost of the company whose armour shone like gold turnus ut antevolans tardum precesserat agmen c vidisti quo turnus equo quibus ibat in armis aureus  our english archers bent their bows their hearts were good and true at the first flight of arrows sent full threescore scots they slew  they closd full fast on evry side no slackness there was found and many a gallant gentleman lay gasping on the ground  with that there came an arrow keen out of an english bow which struck earl dowglas to the heart a deep and deadly blow æneas was wounded after the same manner by an unknown hand in the midst of a parly has inter voces media inter talia verba ecce viro stridens alis allapsa sagitta est incertum quâ pulsa manu  but of all the descriptive parts of this song there are none more beautiful than the four following stanzas which have a great force and spirit in them and are filled with very natural circumstances the thought in the third stanza was never touched by any other poet and is such an one as would have shined in homer or in virgil so thus did both those nobles die whose courage none could stain an english archer then perceived the noble earl was slain  he had a bow bent in his hand made of a trusty tree an arrow of a clothyard long unto the head drew he  against sir hugh montgomery so right his shaft he set the graygoose wing that was thereon in his heartblood was wet  this fight did last from break of day till setting of the sun for when they rung the evening bell the battle scarce was done one may observe likewise that in the catalogue of the slain the author has followed the example of the greatest ancient poets not only in giving a long list of the dead but by diversifying it with little characters of particular persons and with earl dowglas there was slain sir hugh montgomery sir charles carrel that from the field one foot would never fly  sir charles murrel of ratcliff too his sisters son was he sir david lamb so well esteemd yet saved could not be the familiar sound in these names destroys the majesty of the description for this reason i do not mention this part of the poem but to shew the natural cast of thought which appears in it as the two last verses look almost like a translation of virgil  cadit et ripheus justissimus unus qui fuit in teucris et servantissimus æqui diis aliter visum est  in the catalogue of the english who  fell witheringtons behaviour is in the same manner particularized very artfully as the reader is prepared for it by that account which is given of him in the beginning of the battle  though i am satisfied your little buffoon readers who have seen that passage ridiculed in hudibras will not be able to take the beauty of it for which reason i dare not so much as quote it then stept a gallant squire forth witherington was his name who said i would not have it told to henry our king for shame  that eer my captain fought on foot and i stood looking on we meet with the same heroic sentiments in virgil non pudet o rutuli cunctis pro talibus unam objectare animam numerone an viribus æqui non sumus   what can be more natural or more moving than the circumstances in which he describes the behaviour of those women who had lost their husbands on this fatal day next day did many widows come their husbands to bewail they washed their wounds in brinish tears but all would not prevail  their bodies bathd in purple blood they bore with them away they kissd them dead a thousand times when they were clad in clay thus we see how the thoughts of this poem which naturally arise from the subject are always simple and sometimes exquisitely noble that the language is often very sounding and that the whole is written with a true poetical spirit  if this song had been written in the gothic manner which is the delight of all our little wits whether writers or readers it would not have hit the taste of so many ages and have pleased the readers of all ranks and conditions i shall only beg pardon for such a profusion of latin quotations which i should not have made use of but that i feared my own judgment would have looked too singular on such a subject had not i supported it by the practice

my acquaintance for calling in one of my papers dorimant a clown she was so unmerciful as to take advantage of my invincible taciturnity and on that occasion with great freedom to consider the air the height the face the gesture of him who could pretend to judge so arrogantly of gallantry she is full of motion janty and lively in her impertinence and one of those that commonly pass among the ignorant for persons who have a great deal of humour she had the play of sir fopling in her hand and after she had said it was happy for her there was not so charming a creature as dorimant now living she began with a theatrical air and tone of voice to read by way of triumph over me some of his speeches tis she that lovely hair that easy shape those wanton eyes and all those melting charms about her mouth which medley spoke of ill follow the lottery and put in for a prize with my friend bellair in love the victors from the vanquishd fly they fly that wound and they pursue that dye then

admire most where he begins to teize loveit and mimick sir fopling oh the pretty satyr in his resolving to be a coxcomb to please since noise and nonsense have such powerful charms i that i may successful prove transform my self to what you love then how like a man of the town so wild and gay is that the wife will find a diffrence in our fate you wed a woman i a good estate it would have been a very wild endeavour for a man of my temper to offer any opposition to so nimble a speaker as my fair enemy is but her discourse gave me very many reflections when i had left her company among others i could not but consider with some attention the false impressions the generality the fair sex more especially have of what should be intended when they say a fine gentleman and could not help revolving that subject in my thoughts and settling as it were an idea of that character in my own imagination  no man ought to have the esteem of the rest of the world for any actions which are disagreeable to those maxims which prevail as the standards of behaviour in the country wherein he lives what is opposite to the eternal rules of reason and good sense must be excluded from any place in the carriage of a wellbred man i did not i confess explain myself enough on this subject when i called dorimant a clown and made it an instance of it that he called the orange wench double tripe i should have shewed that humanity obliges a gentleman to give no part of humankind reproach for what they whom they reproach may possibly have in common with the most virtuous and worthy amongst us when a gentleman speaks coarsly he has dressed himself clean to no purpose the cloathing of our minds certainly ought to be regarded before that of our bodies to betray in a mans talk a corrupted imagination is a much greater offence against the conversation of gentlemen than any negligence of dress imaginable but this sense of the matter is so far from being received among people even of condition that vocifer passes for a fine gentleman he is loud haughty gentle soft lewd and obsequious by turns just as a little understanding and great impudence prompt him at the present moment he passes among the silly part of our women for a man of wit because he is generally in doubt he contradicts with a shrug and confutes with a certain sufficiency in professing such and such a thing is above his capacity what makes his character the pleasanter is that he is a professed deluder of women and because the empty coxcomb has no regard to any thing that is of it self sacred and inviolable i have heard an unmarried lady of fortune say it is pity so fine a gentleman as vocifer is so great an atheist the crowds of such inconsiderable creatures that infest all places of assembling every reader will have in his eye from his own observation but would it not be worth considering what sort of figure a man who formed himself upon those principles among us which are agreeable to the dictates of honour and religion would make in the familiar and ordinary occurrences of life  i hardly have observed any one fill his several duties of life better than ignotus all the under parts of his behaviour and such as are exposed to common observation have their rise in him from great and noble motives a firm and unshaken expectation of another life makes him become this humanity and goodnature fortified by the sense of virtue has the same effect upon him as the neglect of all goodness has upon many others being firmly established in all matters of importance that certain inattention which makes mens actions look easie appears in him with greater beauty by a thorough contempt of little excellencies he is perfectly master of them this temper of mind leaves him under no necessity of studying his air and he has this peculiar distinction that his negligence is unaffected  he that can work himself into a pleasure in considering this being as an uncertain one and think to reap an advantage by its discontinuance is in a fair way of doing all things with a graceful unconcern and gentlemanlike ease such a one does not behold his life as a short transient perplexing state made up of trifling pleasures and great anxieties but sees it in quite another light his griefs are momentary and his joys immortal reflection upon death is not a gloomy and sad thought of resigning every thing that he delights in but it is a short night followed by an endless day what i would here contend for is that the more virtuous the man is the nearer he will naturally be to the character of genteel and agreeable a man whose fortune is plentiful shews an ease in his countenance and confidence in his behaviour which he that is under wants and difficulties cannot assume it is thus with the state of the mind he that governs his thoughts with the everlasting rules of reason and sense must have something so inexpressibly graceful in his words and actions that every circumstance must become him the change of persons or things around him do not at all alter his situation but he looks disinterested in the occurrences with which others are distracted because the greatest purpose of his life is to maintain an indifference both to it and all its enjoyments in a word to be a fine gentleman is to be a generous and a brave man what can make a man so much in constant goodhumour and shine as we call it than to be supported by what can never fail him and to believe that whatever happens to him was the best thing that could possibly befal him or else he on

common as to find a man whom in the general observations of his carriage you take to be of an uniform temper subject to such unaccountable starts of humour and passion that he is as much unlike himself and differs as much from the man you at first thought him as any two distinct persons can differ from each other this proceeds from the want of forming some law of life to our selves or fixing some notion of things in general which may affect us in such manner as to create proper habits both in our minds and bodies the negligence of this leaves us exposed not only to an unbecoming levity in our usual conversation but also to the same instability in our friendships interests and alliances a man who is but a mere spectator of what passes around him and not engaged in commerces of any consideration is but an ill judge of the secret motions of the heart of man and by what degrees it is actuated to make such visible alterations in the same person but at the same time when a man is no way concerned in the effects of such inconsistences in the behaviour of men of the world the speculation must be in the utmost degree both diverting and instructive yet to enjoy such observations in the highest relish he ought to be placed in a post of direction and have the dealing of their fortunes to them i have therefore been wonderfully diverted with some pieces of secret history which an antiquary my very good friend lent me as a curiosity they are memoirs of the private life of pharamond of france  pharamond says my author was a prince of infinite humanity and generosity and at the same time the most pleasant and facetious companion of his time he had a peculiar taste in him which would have been unlucky in any prince but himself he thought there could be no exquisite pleasure in conversation but among equals and would pleasantly bewail himself that he always lived in a crowd but was the only man in france that never could get into company this turn of mind made him delight in midnight rambles attended only with one person of his bedchamber he would in these excursions get acquainted with men whose temper he had a mind to try and recommend them privately to the particular observation of his first minister he generally found himself neglected by his new acquaintance as soon as they had hopes of growing great and used on such occasions to remark that it was a great injustice to tax princes of forgetting themselves in their high fortunes when there were so few that could with constancy bear the favour of their very creatures my author in these loose hints has one passage that gives us a very lively idea of the uncommon genius of pharamond he met with one man whom he had put to all the usual proofs he made of those he had a mind to know thoroughly and found him for his purpose in discourse with him one day he gave him opportunity of saying how much would satisfy all his wishes the prince immediately revealed himself doubled the sum and spoke to him in this manner sir you have twice what you desired by the favour of pharamond but look to it that you are satisfied with it for tis the last you shall ever receive i from this moment consider you as mine and to make you truly so i give you my royal word you shall never be greater or less than you are at present answer me not concluded the prince smiling but enjoy the fortune i have put you in which is above my own condition for you have hereafter nothing to hope or to fear his majesty having thus well chosen and bought a friend and companion he enjoyed alternately all the pleasures of an agreeable private man and a great and powerful monarch he gave himself with his companion the name of the merry tyrant for he punished his courtiers for their insolence and folly not by any act of publick disfavour but by humorously practising upon their imaginations if he observed a man untractable to his inferiors he would find an opportunity to take some favourable notice of him and render him insupportable he knew all his own looks words and actions had their interpretations and his friend monsieur eucrate for so he was called having a great soul without ambition he could communicate all his thoughts to him and fear no artful use would be made of that freedom it was no small delight when they were in private to reflect upon all which had passed in publick  pharamond would often to satisfy a vain fool of power in his country talk to him in a full court and with one whisper make him despise all his old friends and acquaintance he was come to that knowledge of men by long observation that he would profess altering the whole mass of blood in some tempers by thrice speaking to them as fortune was in his power he gave himself constant entertainment in managing the mere followers of it with the treatment they deserved he would by a skilful cast of his eye and half a smile make two fellows who hated embrace and fall upon each others neck with as much eagerness as if they followed their real inclinations and intended to stifle one another when he was in high good humour he would lay the scene with eucrate and on a publick night exercise tho passions of his whole court he was pleased to see an haughty beauty watch the looks of the man she had long despised from observation of his being taken notice of by pharamond and the lover conceive higher hopes than to follow the woman he was dying for the day before in a court where men speak affection in the strongest terms and dislike in the faintest it was a comical mixture of incidents to see disguises thrown aside in one case and encreased on the other according as favour or disgrace attended the respective objects of mens approbation or disesteem pharamond in his mirth upon the meanness of mankind used to say as he could take away a mans five senses he could give him an hundred the man in disgrace shall immediately lose all his natural endowments and he that finds favour have the attributes of an angel he would carry it so far as to say it should not be only so in the opinion of the lower part of his court but the men themselves shall think thus meanly or greatly of themselves as they are out or in the good graces of a court a monarch who had wit and humour like pharamond must have pleasures which no man else can ever have opportunity of enjoying he gave fortune to none but those whom he knew could receive it without transport he made a noble and generous use of his observations and did not regard his ministers as they were agreeable to himself but as they were useful to his kingdom by this means the king appeared in every officer of state and no man had a participation of the power who had not a similitude of the virtue of pharamond  r      footnote     pharamond or faramond was

very often absent in conversation and what the french call a reveur and a distrait a little before our clubtime last night we were walking together in somerset garden where will had picked up a small pebble of so odd a make that he said he would present it to a friend of his an eminent virtuoso after we had walked some time i made a full stop with my face towards the west which will knowing to be my usual method of asking whats a clock in an afternoon immediately pulled out his watch and told me we had seven minutes good we took a turn or two more when to my great surprize i saw him squirr away his watch a considerable way into the thames and with great sedateness in his looks put up the pebble he had before found in his fob as i have naturally an aversion to much speaking and do not love to be the messenger of ill news especially when it comes too late to be useful i left him to be convinced of his mistake in due time and continued my walk reflecting on these little absences and distractions in mankind and resolving to make them the subject of a future speculation  i was the more confirmed in my design when i considered that they were very often blemishes in the characters of men of excellent sense and helped to keep up the reputation of that latin proverb  which mr dryden has translated in the following lines great wit to madness sure is near allyd and thin partitions do their bounds divide my reader does i hope perceive that i distinguish a man who is absent because he thinks of something else from one who is absent because he thinks of nothing at all the latter is too innocent a creature to be taken notice of but the distractions of the former may i believe be generally accounted for from one of these reasons  either their minds are wholly fixed on some particular science which is often the case of mathematicians and other learned men or are wholly taken up with some violent passion such as anger fear or love which ties the mind to some distant object or lastly these distractions proceed from a certain vivacity and fickleness in a mans temper which while it raises up infinite numbers of ideas in the mind is continually pushing it on without allowing it to rest on any particular image nothing therefore is more unnatural than the thoughts and conceptions of such a man which are seldom occasioned either by the company he is in or any of those objects which are placed before him while you fancy he is admiring a beautiful woman tis an even wager that he is solving a proposition in euclid and while you may imagine he is reading the paris gazette it is far from being impossible that he is pulling down and rebuilding the front of his countryhouse  at the same time that i am endeavouring to expose this weakness in others i shall readily confess that i once laboured under the same infirmity myself the method i took to conquer it was a firm resolution to learn something from whatever i was obliged to see or hear there is a way of thinking if a man can attain to it by which he may strike somewhat out of any thing i can at present observe those starts of good sense and struggles of unimproved reason in the conversation of a clown with as much satisfaction as the most shining periods of the most finished orator and can make a shift to command my attention at a puppetshow or an opera as well as at hamlet or othello i always make one of the company i am in for though i say little myself my attention to others and those nods of approbation which i never bestow unmerited sufficiently shew that i am among them whereas will honeycomb tho a fellow of good sense is every day doing and saying an hundred things which he afterwards confesses with a wellbred frankness were somewhat mal a propos and undesigned  i chanced the other day to go into a coffeehouse where will was standing in the midst of several auditors whom he had gathered round him and was giving them an account of the person and character of moll hinton my appearance before him just put him in mind of me without making him reflect that i was actually present so that keeping his eyes full upon me to the great surprize of his audience he broke off his first harangue and proceeded thus why now theres my friend mentioning me by my name he is a fellow that thinks a great deal but never opens his mouth i warrant you he is now thrusting his short face into some coffeehouse about change i was his bail in the time of the popishplot when he was taken up for a jesuit if he had looked on me a little longer he had certainly described me so particularly without ever considering what led him into it that the whole company must necessarily have found me out for which reason remembering the old proverb out of sight out of mind i left the room and upon meeting him an hour afterwards was asked by him with a great deal of goodhumour in what part of the world i had lived that he had not seen me these three days  monsieur bruyere has given us the character of an absent man  with a great deal of humour which he has pushed to an agreeable extravagance with the heads of it i shall conclude my present paper menalcas says that excellent author

sword on his right side that his stockings are about his heels and that his shirt is over his breeches when he is dressed he goes to court comes into the drawingroom and walking boltupright under a branch of candlesticks his wig is caught up by one of them and hangs dangling in the air all the courtiers fall a laughing but menalcas laughs louder than any of them and looks about for the person that is the jest of the company coming down to the courtgate he finds a coach which taking for his own he whips into it and the coachman drives off not doubting but he carries his master as soon as he

i send you the inclosed to be inserted if you think them worthy of it in your spectators in which so surprizing a genius appears that it is no wonder if all mankind endeavours to get somewhat into a paper which will always live  as to the cambridge affair the humour was really carried on in the way i described it however you have a full commission to put out or in and to do whatever you think fit with it i have already had the satisfaction of seeing you take that liberty with some things i have before sent you   go on sir and prosper you have the best wishes of  sir your very affectionate and obliged humble servant     cambridge  mr spectator  you well know it is of great consequence to clear titles and it is of importance that it be done in the proper season on which account this is to assure you that the club of ugly faces was instituted originally at cambridge in the merry reign of king charles ii as in great bodies of men it is not difficult to find members enough for such a club so i remember it was then feared upon their intention of dining together that the hall belonging to clarehall the ugliest then in the town tho now the neatest would not be large enough handsomely to hold the company invitations were made to great numbers but very few accepted them without much difficulty one pleaded that being at london in a booksellers shop a lady going by with a great belly longed to kiss him he had certainly been excused but that evidence appeared that indeed one in london did pretend she longed to kiss him but that it was only a pickpocket who during his kissing her stole away all his money another would have got off by a dimple in his chin but it was proved upon him that he had by coming into a room made a woman miscarry and frightened two children into fits a third alledged that he was taken by a lady for another gentleman who was one of the handsomest in the university but upon enquiry it was found that the lady had actually lost one eye and the other was very much upon the decline a fourth produced letters out of the country in his vindication in which a gentleman offered him his daughter who had lately fallen in love with him with a good fortune but it was made appear that the young lady was amorous and had like to have run away with her fathers coachman so that it was supposed that her pretence of falling in love with him was only in order to be well married it was pleasant to hear the several excuses which were made insomuch that some made as much interest to be excused as they would from serving sheriff however at last the society was formed and proper officers were appointed and the day was fixd for the entertainment which was in venison season a pleasant fellow of kings college commonly called crab from his sour look and the only man who did not pretend to get off was nominated for chaplain and nothing was wanting but some one to sit in the elbowchair by way of president at the upper end of the table and there the business stuck for there was no contention for superiority there this affair made so great a noise that the king who was then at newmarket heard of it and was pleased merrily and graciously to say he could not be there himself but he would send them a brace of bucks  i would desire you sir to set this affair in a true light that posterity may not be misled in so important a point for when the wise man who shall write your true history shall acquaint the world that you had a diploma sent from the ugly club at oxford and that by vertue of it you were admitted into it what a learned work will there be among future criticks about the original of that club which both universities will contend so warmly for and perhaps some hardy cantabrigian author may then boldly affirm that the word oxford was an interpolation of some oxonian instead of cambridge this affair will be best adjusted in your lifetime but i hope your affection to your mother will not make you partial to your aunt  to tell you sir my own opinion tho i cannot find any ancient records of any acts of the society of the ugly faces considered in a publick capacity yet in a private one they have certainly antiquity on their side i am perswaded they will hardly give place to the lowngers and the lowngers are of the same standing with the university itself  tho we well know sir you want no motives to do justice yet i am commissiond to tell you that you are invited to be admitted ad eundem at cambridge and i believe i may venture safely to deliver this as the wish of our whole university     to mr spectator  the humble petition

are descended of ancient families and kept up our dignity and honour many years till the jacksprat that supplanted us how often have we found ourselves slighted by the clergy in their pulpits and the lawyers at the bar nay how often have we heard in one of the most polite and august assemblies in the universe to our great mortification these words that that that noble lord urged which if one of us had had justice done would have sounded nobler thus that which that noble lord urged senates themselves the guardians of british liberty have degraded us and preferred that to us and yet no decree was

own we would desire to be heard by our counsel but that we fear in their very pleadings they would betray our cause besides we have been oppressed so many years that we can appear no other way but in

pleasures and looking severely upon things in themselves indifferent but i think they are extremely unjust to me in this imputation all that i contend for is that those excellencies which are to be regarded but in the second place should not precede more weighty considerations the heart of man deceives him in spite of the lectures of half a life spent in discourses on the subjection of passion and i do not know why one may not think the heart of woman as unfaithful to itself if we grant an equality in the faculties of both sexes the minds of women are less cultivated with precepts and consequently may without disrespect to them be accounted more liable to illusion in cases wherein natural inclination is out of the interests of virtue i shall take up my present time in commenting upon a billet or two which came from ladies and from thence leave the reader to judge whether i am in the right or not in thinking it is possible fine women may be mistaken  the following address seems to have no other design in it but to tell me the writer will do what she pleases for all me mr spectator i am young and very much inclind to follow the paths of innocence but at the same time as i have a plentiful fortune and of quality i am unwilling to resign the pleasures of distinction some little satisfaction in being admired in general and much greater in being beloved by a gentleman whom i design to make my husband but i have a mind to put off entering into matrimony till another winter is over my head which whatever musty sir you may think of the matter i design to pass away in hearing music going to plays visiting and all other satisfactions which fortune and youth protected by innocence and virtue can procure for   sir  your most humble servant  m t  my lover does not know i like him therefore having no engagements upon me i think to stay and know whether i may not like any one else better  i have heard will honeycomb say a woman seldom writes her mind but in her postscript i think this gentlewoman has sufficiently discovered hers in this ill lay what wager she pleases against her present favourite and can tell her that she will like ten more before she is fixed and then will take the worst man she ever liked in her life there is no end of affection taken in at the eyes only and you may as well satisfie those eyes with seeing as controul any passion received by them only it is from loving by sight that coxcombs so frequently succeed with women and very often a young lady is bestowed by her parents to a man who weds her as innocence itself tho she has in her own heart given her approbation of a different man in every assembly she was in the whole year before what is wanting among women as well as among men is the love of laudable things and not to rest only in the forbearance of such as are reproachful  how far removed from a woman of this light imagination is eudosia eudosia has all the arts of life and good breeding with so much ease that the virtue of her conduct looks more like an instinct than choice it is as little difficult to her to think justly of persons and things as it is to a woman of different accomplishments to move ill or look awkward that which was at first the effect of instruction is grown into an habit and it would be as hard for eudosia to indulge a wrong suggestion of thought as it would be for flavia the fine dancer to come into a room with an unbecoming air  but the misapprehensions people themselves have of their own state of mind is laid down with much discerning in the following letter which is but an extract of a kind epistle from my charming mistress hecatissa who is above the vanity of external beauty and is the best judge of the perfections of the mind mr spectator  i write this to acquaint you that very many ladies as well as myself spend many hours more than we used at the glass for want of the female library of which you promised us a catalogue i hope sir in the choice of authors for us you will have a particular regard to books of devotion what they are and how many must be your chief care for upon the propriety of such writings depends a great deal i have known those among us who think if they every morning and evening spend an hour in their closet and read over so many prayers in six or seven books of devotion all equally nonsensical with a sort of warmth that might as well be raised by a glass of wine or a drachm of citron they may all the rest of their time go on in whatever their particular passion leads them to the beauteous philautia who is in your language an idol is one of these votaries she has a very pretty furnished closet to which she retires at her appointed hours this is her dressingroom as well as chapel she has constantly before her a large lookingglass and upon the table according to a very witty author together lye her prayerbook and paint at once t improve the sinner and the saint it must be a good scene if one could be present at it to see this idol by turns lift up her eyes to heaven and steal glances at her own dear person it cannot but be a pleasing conflict between vanity and humiliation when you are upon this subject choose books which elevate the mind above the world and give a pleasing indifference to little things in it for want of such instructions i am apt to believe so many people take it in their heads to be sullen cross and angry under pretence of being abstracted from the affairs of this life when at the same time they betray their fondness for them by doing their duty as a task and pouting and reading good books for a week together much of this i take to proceed from the indiscretion of the books themselves whose very titles of weekly preparations and such limited godliness lead people of ordinary capacities into great errors and raise in them a mechanical religion entirely distinct from morality i know a lady so given up to this sort of devotion that tho she employs six or eight hours of the twentyfour at cards she never misses one constant hour of prayer for which time another holds her cards to which she returns with no little anxiousness till two or three in the morning all these acts are but empty shows and as it were compliments made to virtue the mind is all the while untouched with any true pleasure in the pursuit of it from hence i presume it arises that so many people call themselves virtuous from no other pretence to it but an absence of ill there is dulcianara is the most insolent of all creatures to her friends and domesticks upon no other pretence in nature but that as her silly phrase is no one can say black is her eye she has no secrets forsooth which should make her afraid to speak her mind and therefore she is impertinently blunt to all her acquaintance and unseasonably imperious to all her family dear sir be pleased to put such books in our hands as may make our virtue more inward and convince some of us that in a mind truly virtuous the scorn of vice is always accompanied with the pity of it this and other things are impatiently expected from you by our whole sex among the rest by  sir  your most humble servant  b  contents contents p     no  0

shape the one we shall call brunetta the other phillis a close intimacy between their parents made each of them the first acquaintance the other knew in the world they played dressed babies acted visitings learned to dance and make curtesies together they were inseparable companions in all the little entertainments their tender years were capable of which innocent happiness continued till the beginning of their fifteenth year when it happened that mrs phillis had an headdress on which became her so very well that instead of being beheld any more with pleasure for their amity to each other the eyes of the neighbourhood were turned to remark them with comparison of their beauty they now no longer enjoyed the ease of mind and pleasing indolence in which they were formerly happy but all their words and actions were misinterpreted by each other and every excellence in their speech and behaviour was looked upon as an act of emulation to surpass the other these beginnings of disinclination soon improved into a formality of behaviour a general coldness and by natural steps into an irreconcilable hatred  these two rivals for the reputation of beauty were in their stature countenance and mien so very much alike that if you were speaking of them in their absence the words in which you described the one must give you an idea of the other they were hardly distinguishable you would think when they were apart tho extremely different when together what made their enmity the more entertaining to all the rest of their sex was that in detraction from each other neither could fall upon terms which did not hit herself as much as her adversary their nights grew restless with meditation of new dresses to outvie each other and inventing new devices to recal admirers who observed the charms of the one rather than those of the other on the last meeting their colours failed at each others appearance flushed with pleasure at the report of a disadvantage and their countenances withered upon instances of applause the decencies to which women are obliged made these virgins stifle their resentment so far as not to break into open violences while they equally suffered the torments of a regulated anger their mothers as it is usual engaged in the quarrel and supported the several pretensions of the daughters with all that illchosen sort of expence which is common with people of plentiful fortunes and mean taste the girls preceded their parents like queens of may in all the gaudy colours imaginable on every sunday to church and were exposed to the examination of the audience for superiority of beauty  during this constant straggle it happened that phillis one day at publick prayers smote the heart of a gay westindian who appeard in all the colours which can affect an eye that could not distinguish between being fine and tawdry this american in a summerisland suit was too shining and too gay to be resisted by phillis and too intent upon her charms to be diverted by any of the laboured attractions of brunetta soon after brunetta had the mortification to see her rival disposed of in a wealthy marriage while she was only addressed to in a manner that shewed she was the admiration of all men but the choice of none phillis was carried to the habitation of her spouse in barbadoes brunetta had the illnature to inquire for her by every opportunity and had the misfortune to hear of her being attended by numerous slaves fanned into slumbers by successive hands of them and carried from place to place in all the pomp of barbarous magnificence brunetta could not endure these repeated advices but employed all her arts and charms in laying baits for any of condition of the same island out of a mere ambition to confront her once more before she died she at last succeeded in her design and was taken to wife by a gentleman whose estate was contiguous to that of her enemys husband it would be endless to enumerate the many occasions on which these irreconcileable beauties laboured to excel each other but in process of time it happened that a ship put into the island consigned to a friend of phillis who had directions to give her the refusal of all goods for apparel before brunetta could be alarmed of their arrival he did so and phillis was dressed in a few days in a brocade more gorgeous and costly than had ever before appeared in that latitude brunetta languished at the sight and could by no means come up to the bravery of her antagonist she communicated her anguish of mind to a faithful friend who by an interest in the wife of philliss merchant procured a remnant of the same silk for brunetta phillis took pains to appear in all public places where she was sure to meet brunetta brunetta was now prepared for the insult and came to a public ball in a plain black silk mantua attended by a beautiful negro girl in a petticoat of the same brocade with which phillis was attired this drew the attention of the whole company upon which the unhappy phillis swooned away and was immediately conveyd to her house as soon as she came to herself she fled from her husbands house went on board a ship

over others make a discourse of any tolerable length without that is and if he be a very grave man indeed without that is to say and how instructive as well as entertaining are those usual expressions in the mouths of great men such things as that and the like of that  i am not against reforming the corruptions of speech you mention and own there are proper seasons for the introduction of other

venantum murmure tigris horruit in maculas   statins   about the middle of last winter i went to see an opera at the theatre in the haymarket where i could not but take notice of two parties of very fine women that had placed themselves in the opposite sideboxes and seemed drawn up in a kind of battlearray one against another after a short survey of them i found they were patchd differently the faces on one hand being spotted on the right side of the forehead and those upon the other on the left i quickly perceived that they cast hostile glances upon one another and that their patches were placed in those different situations as partysignals to distinguish friends from foes in the middleboxes between these two opposite bodies were several ladies who patched indifferently on both sides of their faces and seemd to sit there with no other intention but to see the opera upon inquiry i found that the body of amazons on my right hand were whigs and those on my left tories and that those who had placed themselves in the middle boxes were a neutral party whose faces had not yet declared themselves these last however as i afterwards found diminished daily and took their party with one side or the other insomuch that i observed in several of them the patches which were before dispersed equally are now all gone over to the whig or tory side of the face the censorious say that the men whose hearts are aimed at are very often the occasions that one part of the face is thus dishonoured and lies under a kind of disgrace while the other is so much set off and adorned by the owner and that the patches turn to the right or to the left according to the principles of the man who is most in favour but whatever may be the motives of a few fantastical coquets who do not patch for the publick good so much as for their own private advantage it is certain that there are several women of honour who patch out of principle and with an eye to the interest of their country nay i am informed that some of them adhere so stedfastly to their party and are so far from sacrificing their zeal for the publick to their passion for any particular person that in a late draught of marriagearticles a lady has stipulated with her husband that whatever his opinions are she shall be at liberty to patch on which side she pleases  i must here take notice that rosalinda a famous whig partizan has most unfortunately a very beautiful mole on the tory part of her forehead which being very conspicuous has occasioned many mistakes and given an handle to her enemies to misrepresent her face as tho it had revolted from the whig interest but whatever this natural patch may seem to intimate it is well known that her notions of government are still the same this unlucky mole however has misled several coxcombs and like the hanging out of false colours made some of them converse with rosalinda in what they thought the spirit of her party when on a sudden she has given them an unexpected fire that has sunk them all at once if rosalinda is unfortunate in her mole nigranilla is as unhappy in a pimple which forces her against her inclinations to patch on the whig side  i am told that many virtuous matrons who formerly have been taught to believe that this artificial spotting of the face was unlawful are now reconciled by a zeal for their cause to what they could not be prompted by a concern for their beauty this way of declaring war upon one another puts me in mind of what is reported of the tigress that several spots rise in her skin when she is angry or as mr cowley has imitated the verses that stand as the motto on this paper  she swells with angry pride and calls forth all her spots on evry side  when i was in the theatre the time abovementioned i had the curiosity to count the patches on both sides and found the tory patches to be about twenty stronger than the whig but to make amends for this small inequality i the next morning found the whole puppetshow filled with faces spotted after the whiggish manner whether or no the ladies had retreated hither in order to rally their forces i cannot tell but the next night they came in so great a body to the opera that they outnumberd the enemy  this account of party patches will i am afraid appear improbable to those who live at a distance from the fashionable world but as it is a distinction of a very singular nature and what perhaps may never meet with a parallel i think i should not have discharged the office of a faithful spectator had i not recorded it  i have in former papers endeavoured to expose this partyrage in women as it only serves to aggravate the hatreds and animosities that reign among men and in a great measure deprive the fair sex of those peculiar charms with which nature has endowed them  when the romans and sabines were at war and just upon the point of giving battel the women who were allied to both of them interposed with so many tears and intreaties that they prevented the mutual slaughter which threatned both parties and united them together in a firm and lasting peace  i would recommend this noble example to our british ladies at a time when their country is torn with so many unnatural divisions that if they continue it will be a misfortune to be born in it the greeks thought it so improper for women to interest themselves in competitions and contentions that for this reason among others they forbad them under pain of death to be present at the olympick games notwithstanding these were the publick diversions of all greece  as our english women excel those of all nations in beauty they should endeavour to outshine them in all other accomplishments proper  to the sex and to distinguish themselves as tender mothers and faithful wives rather than as furious partizans female virtues are of a domestick turn the family is the proper province for private women to shine in if they must be shewing their zeal for the publick let it not be against those who are perhaps of the same family or at least of the same religion or nation but against those who are the open professed undoubted enemies of their faith liberty and country when the romans were pressed with a foreign enemy the ladies voluntarily contributed all their rings and jewels to assist the government under a publick exigence which appeared so laudable an action in the eyes of their countrymen that from thenceforth it was permitted by a law to pronounce publick orations at the funeral of a woman in praise of the deceased person which till that time was peculiar to men would our english ladies instead of sticking on a patch against those of their own country shew themselves so truly publickspirited as to sacrifice every one her necklace against the common enemy what decrees ought not to be made in favour of them  since i am recollecting upon this subject such passages as occur to my memory out of ancient authors i cannot omit a sentence in the celebrated funeral oration of pericles  which he made in honour of those brave athenians that were slain in a fight with the lacedæmonians after having addressed himself to the several ranks and orders of his countrymen and shewn them how they should behave themselves in the publick cause he turns to the female part of his audience and as for you says he i shall advise you in very few words

my name and desired i would throw something into the box i was out of countenance for him and did as he bid me by putting in half a crown i went away reflecting upon the strange constitution of some men and how meanly they behave themselves in all sorts of conditions the person who begged of me is now as i take it fifty i was well acquainted with him till about the age of twentyfive at which time a good estate fell to him by the death of a relation upon coming to this unexpected good fortune he ran into all the extravagancies imaginable was frequently in drunken disputes broke drawers heads talked and swore loud was unmannerly to those above him and insolent to those below him i could not but remark that it was the same baseness of spirit which worked in his behaviour in both fortunes the same little mind was insolent in riches and shameless in poverty this accident made me muse upon the circumstances of being in debt in general and solve in my mind what tempers were most apt to fall into this error of life as well as the misfortune it must needs be to languish under such pressures as for my self my natural aversion to that sort of conversation which makes a figure with the generality of mankind exempts me from any temptations to expence and all my business lies within a very narrow compass which is only to give an honest man who takes care of my estate proper vouchers for his quarterly payments to me and observe what linnen my laundress brings and takes away with her once a week my steward brings his receipt ready for my signing and i have a pretty implement with the respective names of shirts cravats handkerchiefs and stockings with proper numbers to know how to reckon with my laundress this being almost all the business i have in the world for the care of my own affairs i am at full leisure to observe upon what others do with relation to their equipage and œconomy  when i walk the street and observe the hurry about me in this town where with like haste tho diffrent ways they run some to undo and some to be undone  i say when i behold this vast variety of persons and humours with the pains they both take for the accomplishment of the ends mentioned in the above verse of denham i cannot much wonder at the endeavour after gain but am extremely astonished that men can be so insensible of the danger of running into debt one would think it impossible a man who is given to contract debts should know that his creditor has from that moment in which he transgresses payment so much as that demand comes to in his debtors honour liberty and fortune one would think he did not know that his creditor can say the worst thing imaginable of him to wit that he is unjust without defamation and can seize his person without being guilty of an assault yet such is the loose and abandoned turn of some mens minds that they can live under these constant apprehensions and still go on to encrease the cause of them can there be a more low and servile condition than to be ashamed or afraid to see any one man breathing yet he that is much in debt is in that condition with relation to twenty different people there are indeed circumstances wherein men of honest natures may become liable to debts by some unadvised behaviour in any great point of their life or mortgaging a mans honesty as a security for that of another and the like but these instances are so particular and circumstantiated that they cannot come within general considerations for one such case as one of these there are ten where a man to keep up a farce of retinue and grandeur within his own house shall shrink at the expectation of surly demands at his doors the debtor is the creditors criminal and all the officers of power and state whom we behold make so great a figure are no other than so many persons in authority to make good his charge against him human society depends upon his having the vengeance law allots him and the debtor owes his liberty to his neighbour as much as the murderer does his life to his prince our gentry are generally speaking in debt and many families have put it into a kind of method of being so from generation to generation the father mortgages when his son is very young and the boy is to marry as soon as he is at age to redeem it and find portions for his sisters this forsooth is no great inconvenience to him for he may wench keep a publick table or feed dogs like a worthy english gentleman till he has outrun half his estate and leave the same incumbrance upon his firstborn and so on till one man of more vigour than ordinary goes quite through the estate or some man of sense comes into it and scorns to have an estate in partnership that is to say liable to the demand or insult of any man living there is my friend sir andrew tho for many years a great and general trader was never the defendant in a lawsuit in all the perplexity of business and the iniquity of mankind at present no one had any colour for the least complaint

friend of his had suffered in the vice of the town all the physick his friend took was conveyed to him by jack and inscribed a bolus or an electuary for mr truepenny jack had a good estate left him which came to nothing because he believed all who pretended to demands upon it this easiness and credulity destroy all the other merit he has and he has all his life been a sacrifice to others without ever receiving thanks or doing one good action  i will end this discourse with a speech which i heard jack make to one of his creditors of whom he deserved gentler usage after lying a whole night in custody at his suit sir your ingratitude for the many kindnesses i have done you shall not make me unthankful for the good you have done me in letting me see there is such a man as you in the world i

weather hinders me from taking my diversions without doors i frequently make a little party with two or three select friends to visit any thing curious that may be seen under covert my principal entertainments of this nature are pictures insomuch that when i have found the weather set in to be very bad i have taken a whole days journey to see a gallery that is furnished by the hands of great masters by this means when the heavens are filled with clouds when the earth swims in rain and all nature wears a lowering countenance i withdraw myself from these uncomfortable scenes into the visionary worlds of art where i meet with shining landskips gilded triumphs beautiful faces and all those other objects that fill the mind with gay ideas and disperse that gloominess which is apt to hang upon it in those dark disconsolate seasons  i was some weeks ago in a course of these diversions which had taken such an entire possession of my imagination that they formed in it a short mornings dream which i shall communicate to my reader rather as the first sketch and outlines of a vision than as a finished piece  i dreamt that i was admitted into a long spacious gallery which had one side covered with pieces of all the famous painters who are now living and the other with the works of the greatest masters that are dead  on the side of the living i saw several persons busy in drawing colouring and designing on the side of the dead painters i could not discover more than one person at work who was exceeding slow in his motions and wonderfully nice in his touches  i was resolved to examine the several artists that stood before me and accordingly applied my self to the side of the living the first i observed at work in this part of the gallery was vanity with his hair tied behind him in a ribbon and dressed like a frenchman all the faces he drew were very remarkable for their smiles and a certain smirking air which he bestowed indifferently on every age and degree of either sex the toujours gai appeared even in his judges bishops and privycounsellors in a word all his men were petits maitres and all his women coquets the drapery of his figures was extreamly wellsuited to his faces and was made up of all the glaring colours that could be mixt together every part of the dress was in a flutter and endeavoured to distinguish itself above the rest  on the left hand of vanity stood a laborious workman who i found was his humble admirer and copied after him he was dressed like a german and had a very hard name that sounded something like stupidity  the third artist that i looked over was fantasque dressed like a venetian scaramouch he had an excellent hand at a chimera and dealt very much in distortions and grimaces he would sometimes affright himself with the phantoms that flowed from his pencil in short the most elaborate of his pieces was at best but a terrifying dream and one could say nothing more of his finest figures than that they were agreeable monsters  the fourth person i examined was very remarkable for his hasty hand which left his pictures so unfinished that the beauty in the picture which was designed to continue as a monument of it to posterity faded sooner than in the person after whom it was drawn he made so much haste to dispatch his business that he neither gave himself time to clean his pencils nor  mix his colours the name of this expeditious workman was avarice  not far from this artist i saw another of a quite different nature who was dressed in the habit of a dutchman and known by the name of industry his figures were wonderfully laboured if he drew the portraiture of a man he did not omit a single hair in his face if the figure of a ship there was not a rope among the tackle that escaped him he had likewise hung a great part of the wall with nightpieces that seemed to shew themselves by the candles which were lighted up in several parts of them and were so inflamed by the sunshine which accidentally fell upon them that at first sight i could scarce forbear crying out fire  the five foregoing artists were the most considerable on this side the gallery there were indeed several others whom i had not time to look into one of them however i could not forbear observing who was very busie in retouching the finest pieces tho he produced no originals of his own his pencil aggravated every feature that was before overcharged loaded every defect and poisoned every colour it touched though this workman did so much mischief on the side of the living he never turned his eye towards that of the dead his name was envy  having taken a cursory view of one side of the gallery i turned my self to that which was filled by the works of those great masters that were dead when immediately i fancied my self standing before a multitude of spectators and thousands of eyes looking upon me at once for all before me appeared so like men and women that i almost forgot they were pictures raphaels figures stood in one row titians in another guido rhenis in a third one part of the wall was peopled by hannibal carrache another by correggio and another by rubens to be short there was not a great master among the dead who had not contributed to the embellishment of this side of the gallery the persons that owed their being to these several masters appeared all of them to be real and alive and differed among one another only in the variety of their shapes complexions and cloaths so that they looked like different nations of the same species  observing an old man who was the same person i before mentioned as the only artist that was at work on this side of the gallery creeping up and down from one picture to another and retouching all the fine pieces that stood before me i could not but be very attentive to all his motions i found his pencil was so very light that it worked imperceptibly and after a thousand touches scarce produced any visible effect in the picture on which he was employed however as he busied himself incessantly and repeated touch after touch without rest or intermission he wore off insensibly every little disagreeable gloss that hung upon a figure he also added such a beautiful brown to the shades and mellowness to the colours that he made every picture appear more perfect than when it came fresh from the  masters pencil i could not forbear looking upon the face of this ancient workman and immediately by the long lock of hair upon his forehead discovered him to be time  whether it were because the thread of my dream was at an end

by way of tablebook i found many things which gave me great delight and as human life turns upon the same principles and passions in all ages i thought it very proper to take minutes of what passed in that age for the instruction of this the antiquary who lent me these papers gave me a character of eucrate the favourite of pharamond extracted from an author who lived in that court the account he gives both of the prince and this his faithful friend will not be improper to insert here because i may have occasion to mention many of their conversations into which these memorials of them may give light pharamond when he had a mind to retire for an hour or two from the hurry of business and fatigue of ceremony made a signal to eucrate by putting his hand to his face placing his arm negligently on a window or some such action as appeared indifferent to all the rest of the company upon such notice unobserved by others for their entire intimacy was always a secret eucrate repaired to his own apartment to receive the king there was a secret access to this part of the court at which eucrate used to admit many whose mean appearance in the eyes of the ordinary waiters and doorkeepers made them be repulsed from other parts of the palace such as these were let in here by order of eucrate and had audiences of pharamond this entrance pharamond called the gate of the unhappy and the tears of the afflicted who came before him he would say were bribes received by eucrate for eucrate had the most compassionate spirit of all men living except his generous master who was always kindled at the least affliction which was communicated to him in the regard for the miserable eucrate took particular care that the common forms of distress and the idle pretenders to sorrow about courts who wanted only supplies to luxury should never obtain favour by his means but the distresses which arise from the many inexplicable occurrences that happen among men the unaccountable alienation of parents from their children cruelty of husbands to wives poverty occasioned from shipwreck or fire the falling out of friends or such other terrible disasters to which the life of man is exposed in cases of this nature eucrate was the patron and enjoyed this part of the royal favour so much without being envied that it was never inquired into by whose means what no one else cared for doing was brought about one evening when pharamond came into the apartment of eucrate he found him extremely dejected upon which he asked with a smile which was natural to him what is there any one too miserable to be relieved by pharamond that eucrate is melancholy  i fear there is answered the favourite a person without of a good air well dressed and tho a man in the strength of his life seems to faint under some inconsolable calamity all his features seem suffused with agony of mind but i can observe in him that it is more inclined to break away in tears than rage i asked him what he would have he said he would speak to pharamond i desired his business he could hardly say to me eucrate carry me to the king my story is not to be told twice i fear i shall not be able to speak it at all pharamond commanded eucrate to let him enter he did so and the gentleman approached the king with an air which spoke him under the greatest concern in what manner to demean himself  the king who had a quick discerning relieved him from the oppression he was under and with the most beautiful complacency said to him sir do not add to that load of sorrow i see in your countenance the awe of my presence think you are speaking to your friend if the circumstances of your distress will admit of it you shall find me so to whom the stranger oh excellent pharamond name not a friend to the unfortunate spinamont i had one but he is dead by my own hand  but oh pharamond tho it was by the hand of spinamont it was by the guilt of pharamond i come not oh excellent prince to implore your pardon i come to relate my sorrow a sorrow too great for human life to support from henceforth shall all occurrences appear dreams or short intervals of amusement from this one affliction which has seizd my very being pardon me oh pharamond if my griefs give me leave that i lay before you in the anguish of a wounded mind that you good as you are are guilty of the generous blood spilt this day by this unhappy hand oh that it had perished before that instant here the stranger paused and recollecting his mind after some little meditation he went on in a calmer tone and gesture as follows there is an authority due to distress and as none of human race is above the reach of sorrow none should be above the hearing the voice of it i am sure pharamond is not know then that i have this morning unfortunately killed in a duel the man whom of all men living i most loved i command my self too much in your royal presence to say pharamond give me my friend pharamond has taken him from me i will not say shall the merciful pharamond destroy his own subjects will the father of his country murder his people but the merciful pharamond does destroy his subjects the father of his country does murder his people fortune is so much the pursuit of mankind that all glory and honour is in the power of a prince because he has the distribution of their fortunes it is therefore the inadvertency negligence or guilt of princes to let any thing grow into custom which is against their laws a court can make fashion and duty walk together it can never without the guilt of a court happen that it shall not be unfashionable to do what is unlawful but alas in the dominions of pharamond by the force of a tyrant custom which is misnamed a point of honour the duellist kills his friend whom he loves and the judge condemns the duellist while he approves his behaviour shame is the greatest of all evils what avail laws when death only attends the breach of them and shame obedience to them as for me oh pharamond were it possible to describe the nameless kinds of compunctions and tendernesses i feel when i reflect upon the little accidents in our former familiarity my mind swells into sorrow which cannot be resisted enough to be silent in the presence of pharamond with that he fell into a flood of tears and wept aloud why should not pharamond hear the anguish he only can relieve others from in time to come let him hear from me what they feel who have given death by the false mercy of his administration and form to himself the vengeance calld for by those who have perished by his negligence

what use his works may some time or other be applied a man may often meet with very celebrated names in a paper of tobacco i have lighted my pipe more than once with the writings of a prelate and know a friend of mine who for these several years has converted the essays of a man of quality into a kind of fringe for his candlesticks i remember in particular after having read over a poem of an eminent author on a victory i met with several fragments of it upon the next rejoicing day which had been employd in squibs and crackers and by that means celebrated its subject in a double capacity i once met with a page of mr baxter under a christmas pye whether or no the pastrycook had made use of it through chance or waggery for the defence of that superstitious viande i know not but upon the perusal of it i conceived so good an idea of the authors piety that i bought the whole book i have often profited by these accidental readings and have sometimes found very curious pieces that are either out of print or not to be met with in the shops of our london booksellers for this reason when my friends take a survey of my library they are very much surprised to find upon the shelf of folios two long bandboxes standing upright among my books till i let them see that they are both of them lined with deep erudition and abstruse literature i might likewise mention a paperkite from which i have received great improvement and a hatcase which i would not exchange for all the beavers in greatbritain this my inquisitive temper or rather impertinent humour of prying into all sorts of writing with my natural aversion to loquacity give me a good deal of employment when i enter any house in the country for i cannot for my heart leave a room before i have thoroughly studied the walls of it and examined the several printed papers which are usually pasted upon them the last piece that i met with upon this occasion gave me a most exquisite pleasure my reader will think i am not serious when i acquaint him that the piece i am going to speak of was the old ballad of the two children in the wood which is one of the darling songs of the common people and has been the delight of most englishmen in some part of their age  this song is a plain simple copy of nature destitute of the helps and ornaments of art the tale of it is a pretty tragical story and pleases for no other reason but because it is a copy of nature there is even a despicable simplicity in the verse and yet because the sentiments appear genuine and unaffected they are able to move the mind of the most polite reader with inward meltings of humanity and compassion the incidents grow out of the subject and are such as are the most proper to excite pity for   which reason the whole narration has something in it very moving notwithstanding the author of it whoever he was has deliverd it in such an abject phrase and poorness of expression that the quoting any part of it would look like a design of turning it into ridicule but though the language is mean the thoughts  as i have before said from one end to the other are natural  and therefore cannot fail to please those who are not judges of language or those who notwithstanding they are judges of language have a true  and unprejudiced taste of nature the condition speech and behaviour of the dying parents with the age innocence and distress of the children are set forth in such tender circumstances that it is impossible for a reader of common humanity  not to be affected with them as for the circumstance of the robinredbreast it is indeed a little poetical ornament and to shew the genius of the author  amidst all his simplicity it is just the same kind of fiction which one of the greatest of the latin poets has made use of upon a parallel occasion i mean that passage in horace where he describes himself when he was a child fallen asleep in a desart wood and covered with leaves by the turtles that took pity on him me

expressed them in the character of the misanthrope but those only who are endowed with a true greatness of soul and genius can divest themselves of the little images of ridicule and admire nature in her simplicity and nakedness as for the little conceited wits of the age who can only shew their judgment by finding fault they cannot be supposed to admire these productions which  have nothing to recommend them but the beauties of nature when they do not know how to relish even those compositions that with all the beauties of nature have also the additional advantages of art       footnote

difficile est crimen non prodere vultu  ovid   there are several arts which all men are in  some measure masters  of without having been at the pains of learning them every one that speaks or reasons is a grammarian and a logician tho he may be wholly unacquainted with the rules of grammar or logick as they are delivered in books and systems in the same manner every one is in some degree a master of that art which is generally distinguished by the name of physiognomy and naturally forms to himself the character or fortune of a stranger from the features and lineaments of his face we are no sooner presented to any one we never saw before but we are immediately struck with the idea of a proud a reserved an affable or a goodnatured man and upon our first going into a company of strangers  our benevolence or aversion awe or contempt rises naturally towards several particular persons before we have heard them speak a single word or so much as know who they are  every passion gives a particular cast to the countenance and is apt to discover itself in some feature or other i have seen an eye curse for half an hour together and an eyebrow call a man scoundrel nothing is more common than for lovers to complain resent languish despair and die in dumb show for my own part i am so apt to frame a notion of every mans humour or circumstances by his looks that i have sometimes employed my self from charingcross to the royalexchange in drawing the characters of those who have passed by me when i see a man with a sour rivelld face i cannot forbear pitying his wife and when i meet with an open ingenuous countenance think on the happiness of his friends his family and relations  i cannot recollect the author of a famous saying to a stranger who stood silent in his company speak that i may see thee  but with submission i think we may be better known by our looks than by our words and that a mans speech is much more easily disguised than his countenance in this case however i think the air of the whole face is much more expressive than the lines of it the truth of it is the air is generally nothing else but the inward disposition of the mind made visible  those who have established physiognomy into an art and laid down rules of judging mens tempers by their faces have regarded the features much more than the air martial has a pretty epigram on this subject crine ruber niger ore brevis pede lumine lœsus rem magnam prœstas zoile si bonus es  epig           thy beard and head are of a diffrent dye short of one foot distorted in an eye with all these tokens of a knave compleat shouldst thou be honest thourt a devlish cheat i have seen a very ingenious author on this subject who  founds his speculations on the supposition that as a man hath in the mould of his face a remote likeness to that of an ox a sheep a lion an hog or any other creature he hath the same resemblance in the frame of his mind and is subject to those passions which are predominant in the creature that appears in his countenance  accordingly he gives the prints of several faces that are of a different mould and by a little overcharging the likeness discovers the figures of these several kinds of brutal faces in human features i remember in the life of the famous prince of conde  the writer observes the  face of that prince was like the face of an eagle and that the prince was very well pleased to be told so in this case therefore we may be sure that he had in his mind some general implicit notion of this art of physiognomy which i have just now mentioned and that when his courtiers told him his face was made like an eagles he understood them in the same manner as if they had told him there was something in his looks which shewed him to be strong active piercing and of a royal descent whether or no the different motions of the animal spirits in different passions may have any effect on the mould of the face when the lineaments are pliable and tender or whether the same kind of souls require the same kind of habitations i shall leave to the consideration of the curious in the mean time i think nothing can be more glorious than for a man to give the lie to his face and to be an honest just goodnatured man in spite of all those marks and signatures which nature seems to have set upon him for the contrary this very often happens among those who instead of being exasperated by their own looks or envying the looks of others apply themselves entirely to the cultivating of their minds and getting those beauties which are more lasting and more ornamental i have seen many an amiable piece of deformity and have observed a certain chearfulness in as bad a system of features as ever was clapped together which hath appeared more lovely than all the blooming charms of an insolent beauty there is a double praise due to virtue when it is lodged in a body that seems to have been prepared for the reception of vice in many such cases the soul and the body do not seem to be fellows  socrates was an extraordinary instance of this nature there chanced to be a great physiognomist in his time at athens  who had made strange discoveries of mens tempers and inclinations by their outward appearances socratess disciples that they might put this artist to the trial carried him to their master whom he had never seen before and did not know he was then in company with him 0 after a short examination of his face the physiognomist pronounced him the most lewd libidinous drunken old fellow that he had ever met with   in his whole life upon which the disciples all burst out a laughing as thinking they had detected the falshood and vanity of his art but socrates told them that the principles of his art might be very true notwithstanding his present mistake for that he himself was naturally inclined to those particular vices which the physiognomist had discovered in his countenance but that he had conquered the strong dispositions he was born with by the dictates of philosophy  we are indeed told by an ancient author that socrates very much resembled silenus in his face   which we find to have been very rightly observed from the statues and busts of both that   are still extant as well as on several antique seals and precious stones which are frequently enough to be met with in the cabinets of the curious but however observations of this nature may sometimes hold a wise man should be particularly cautious how he gives credit to a mans outward appearance it is an irreparable injustice we   are guilty of towards one another when we are prejudiced by the looks and features of those whom we do not know how often do we conceive hatred against a person of worth or fancy a man to be proud and illnatured by his aspect whom we think we cannot esteem too much when we are acquainted with his real character dr moore   in his admirable system of ethicks reckons this particular inclination to take a prejudice against a man for his looks

ugly club were exposed to the publick that men might see there were some noble spirits in the age who are not at all displeased with themselves upon considerations which they had no choice in so the discourse concerning idols tended to lessen the value people put upon themselves from personal advantages and gifts of nature as to the latter species of mankind the beauties whether male or female they are generally the most untractable people of all others you are so excessively perplexed with the particularities in their behaviour that to be at ease one would be apt to wish there were no such creatures they expect so great allowances and give so little to others that they who have to do with them find in the main a man with a better person than ordinary and a beautiful woman might be very happily changed for such to whom nature has been less liberal the handsome fellow is usually so much a gentleman and the fine woman has something so becoming that there is no enduring either of them it has therefore been generally my choice to mix with chearful ugly creatures rather than gentlemen who are graceful enough to omit or do what they please or beauties who have charms enough to do and say what would be disobliging in any but themselves  diffidence and presumption upon account of our persons are equally faults and both arise from the want of knowing or rather endeavouring to know our selves and for what we ought to be valued or neglected but indeed i did not imagine these little considerations and coquetries could have the ill consequences as i find they have by the following

long the adoration of the youth within such and such districts i know in particular goods are not entered as they ought to be at the customhouse nor lawreports perused at the temple by reason of one beauty who detains the young merchants too long near change and another fair one who keeps the students at her house when they should be at study it would be worth your while to see how the idolaters alternately offer incense to their idols and what heartburnings arise in those who wait for their turn to receive kind aspects from those little thrones which all the company but these lovers call the bars i saw a gentleman turn as pale as ashes because an idol turned the sugar in a teadish for his rival and carelessly called the boy to serve him with a sirrah why dont you give the gentleman the box to please himself certain it is that a very hopeful young man was taken with leads in his pockets below bridge where he intended to drown himself because his idol would wash the dish in which she had but just then  drank tea before she would let him use it  i am sir a person past being amorous and do not give this information out of envy or jealousy but i am a real sufferer by it these lovers take any thing for tea and coffee i saw one yesterday surfeit to make his court and all his rivals at the same time loud in the commendation of liquors that went against every body in the room that was not in love while these young fellows resign their stomachs with their hearts and drink at the idol in this manner we who come to do business or talk politicks are utterly poisoned they have also drams for those who are more enamoured than ordinary and it is very common for such as are too low in constitution to ogle the idol upon the strength of tea to fluster themselves with warmer liquors thus all pretenders advance as fast as they can to a feaver or a diabetes i must repeat to you that i do not look with an evil eye upon the profit of the idols or the diversion of the lovers what i hope from this remonstrance is only that we plain people may not be served as if we were idolaters but that from the time of publishing this in your paper the idols would mix ratsbane only for their

highly conduces to their service you have i think succeeded very well on many subjects and seem to have been conversant in very different scenes of life but in the considerations of mankind as a spectator you should not omit circumstances which relate to the inferior part of the world any more than those which concern the greater there is one thing in particular which i wonder you have not touched upon and that is the general corruption of manners in the servants of great britain i am a man that have travelled and seen many nations but have for seven years last past resided constantly in london or within twenty miles of it in this time i have contracted a numerous acquaintance among the best sort of people and have hardly found one of them happy in their servants this is matter of great astonishment to foreigners and all such as have visited foreign countries especially since we cannot but observe that there is no part of the world where servants have those privileges and advantages as in england they have no where else such plentiful diet large wages or indulgent liberty there is no place wherein they labour less and yet where they are so little respectful more wasteful more negligent or where they so frequently change their masters to this i attribute in a great measure the frequent robberies and losses which we suffer on the high road and in our own houses that indeed which gives me the present thought of this kind is that a careless groom of mine has spoiled me the prettiest pad in the world with only riding him ten miles and i assure you if i were to make a register of all the horses i have known thus abused by negligence of servants the number would mount a regiment i wish you would give us your observations that we may know how to treat these rogues or that we masters may enter into measures to reform them pray give us a speculation in general about servants and you make me  pray do not omit the mention of grooms in particular  yours  philobritannicus  this honest gentleman who is so desirous that i should write a satyr upon grooms has a great deal of reason for his resentment and i know no evil which touches all mankind so much as this of the misbehaviour of servants  the complaint of this letter runs wholly upon menservants and i can attribute the licentiousness which has at present prevailed among them to nothing but what an hundred before me have ascribed it to the custom of giving boardwages this one instance of false œconomy is sufficient to debauch the whole nation of servants and makes them as it were but for some part of their time in that quality they are either attending in places where they meet and run into clubs or else if they wait at taverns they eat after their masters and reserve their wages for other occasions from hence it arises that they are but in a lower degree what their masters themselves are and usually affect an imitation of their manners and you have in liveries beaux fops and coxcombs in as high perfection as among people that keep equipages it is a common humour among the retinue of people of quality when they are in their revels that is when they are out of their masters sight to assume in a humourous way the names and titles of those whose liveries they wear by which means characters and distinctions become so familiar to them that it is to this among other causes one may impute a certain insolence among our servants that they take no notice of any gentleman though they know him ever so well except he is an acquaintance of their masters  my obscurity and taciturnity leave me at liberty without scandal to dine if i think fit at a common ordinary in the meanest as well as the most sumptuous house of entertainment falling in the other day at a victuallinghouse near the house of peers i heard the maid come down and tell the landlady at the bar that my lord bishop swore he would throw her out a  window if she did not bring up more mild beer and that my lord duke would have a double mug of purle my surprize was encreased in hearing loud and rustick voices speak and answer to each other upon the publick affairs by the names of the most illustrious of our nobility till of a sudden one came running in and cryd the house was rising down came all the company together and away the alehouse was immediately filled with clamour and scoring one mug to the marquis of such a place oyl and vinegar to such an earl three quarts to my new lord for wetting his title and so forth it is a thing too notorious to mention the crowds of servants and their insolence near the courts of justice and the stairs towards the supreme assembly where there is an universal mockery of all order such riotous clamour and licentious confusion that one would think the whole nation lived in jest and there were no such thing as rule and distinction among us  the next place of resort wherein the servile world are let loose is at the entrance of hidepark while the gentry are at the ring hither people bring their lacqueys out of state and here it is that all they say at their tables and act in their houses is communicated to the whole town there are men of wit in all conditions of life and mixing with these people at their diversions i have heard coquets and prudes as well rallied and insolence and pride exposed allowing for their want of education with as much humour and good sense as in the politest companies it is a general observation that all dependants run in some measure into the manners and behaviour of those whom they serve you shall frequently meet with lovers and men of intrigue among the lacqueys as well as at whites  or in the sideboxes i remember some years ago an instance of this kind a footman to a captain of the guard used frequently when his master was out of the way to carry on amours and make assignations in his masters cloaths the fellow had a very good person and there are very many women that think no further than the outside of a gentleman besides which he was almost as learned a man as the colonel himself i say thus qualified the fellow could scrawl billetsdoux so well and furnish a conversation on the common topicks that he had as they call it a great deal of good business on his hands it happened one day that coming down a tavernstairs in his masters fine guardcoat with a welldressd woman masked he met the colonel coming up with other company but with a ready assurance he quitted his lady came up to him and said sir i know you have too much respect for yourself to cane me in this honourable habit but you see there is a lady in the case and i hope on that score also you will put off your anger till i have told you all another time after a little pause the colonel cleared up his countenance and with an air of familiarity whispered his man apart sirrah bring the lady with you to ask pardon for you then aloud look to it will ill never forgive you else the fellow went back to his mistress and telling her with a loud voice and an oath that was the honestest fellow in the world conveyd her to an hackneycoach  but the many irregularities committed by servants in the places abovementioned as well as in

subject of love are very numerous it is my design if possible to range them under several heads and address my self to them at different times the first branch of them to whose service i shall dedicate these papers are those that have to do with women of dilatory tempers who are for spinning out the time of courtship to an immoderate length without being able either to close with their lovers or to dismiss them i have many letters by me filled with complaints against this sort of women in one of them no less a man than a brother of the coif tells me that he began his suit vicesimo nono caroli secundi before he had been a twelvemonth at the temple that he prosecuted it for many years after he was called to the bar that at present he is a sergeant at law and notwithstanding he hoped that matters would have been long since brought to an issue the fair one still demurrs i am so well pleased with this gentlemans phrase that i shall distinguish this sect of women by the title of demurrers i find by another letter from one that calls himself thirsis that his mistress has been demurring above these seven years but among all my plaintiffs of this nature i most pity the unfortunate philander a man of a constant passion and plentiful fortune who sets forth that the timorous and irresolute silvia has demurred till she is past childbearing strephon appears by his letter to be a very cholerick lover and irrevocably smitten with one that demurrs out of selfinterest he tells me with great passion that she has bubbled him out of his youth that she drilled him on to five and fifty and that he verily believes she will drop him in his old age if she can find her account in another i shall conclude this narrative with a letter from honest sam hopewell a very pleasant fellow who it seems has at last married a demurrer i must only premise that sam who is a very good bottlecompanion has been the diversion of his friends upon account of his passion ever since the year one thousand six hundred and eighty one dear sir  you know very well my passion for mrs martha and what a dance she has led me she took me at the age of two and twenty and dodged with me above thirty years i have loved her till she is grown as grey as a cat and am with much ado become the master of her person such as it is at present she is however in my eye a very charming old woman we often lament that we did not marry sooner but she has no body to blame for it but her self you know very well that she would never think of me whilst she had a tooth in her head i have put the date of my passion anno amoris trigesimo primo instead of a posy on my weddingring i expect you should send me a congratulatory letter or if you please an epithalamium upon this occasion  mrs marthas and yours eternally sam hopewell  in order to banish an evil out of the world that does not only produce great uneasiness to private persons but has also a very bad influence on the publick i shall endeavour to shew the folly of demurrage from two or three reflections which i earnestly recommend to the thoughts of my fair readers  first of all i would have them seriously think on the shortness of their time life is not long enough for a coquet to play all her tricks in a timorous woman drops into her grave before she has done deliberating were the age of man the same that it was before the flood a lady might sacrifice half a century to a scruple and be two or three ages in demurring had she nine hundred years good she might hold out to the conversion of the jews before she thought fit to be prevailed upon but alas she ought to play her part in haste when she considers that she is suddenly to quit the stage and make room for others  in the second place i would desire my female readers to consider that as the term of life is short that of beauty is much shorter the finest skin wrinkles in a few years and loses the strength of its colourings so soon that we have scarce time to admire it i might embellish this subject with roses and rainbows and several other ingenious conceits which i may possibly reserve for another opportunity  there is a third consideration which i would likewise recommend to a demurrer and that is the great danger of her falling in love when she is about threescore if she cannot satisfie her doubts and scruples before that time there is a kind of latter spring that sometimes gets into the blood of an old woman and turns her into a very odd sort of an animal i would therefore have the demurrer consider what a strange figure she will make if she chances to get over all difficulties and comes to a final resolution in that unseasonable part of her life  i would not however be understood by any thing i have here said to discourage that natural modesty in the sex which renders a retreat from the first approaches of a lover both fashionable and graceful all that i intend is to advise them when they are prompted by reason and inclination to demurr only out of form and so far as decency requires a virtuous woman should reject the first offer of marriage as a good man does that of a bishoprick but i would advise neither the one nor the other to persist in refusing what they secretly approve i would in this particular propose the example of eve to all her daughters as milton has represented her in the following passage which i cannot forbear transcribing intire tho only the twelve last lines are to my present purpose the rib he formd and fashiond with his hands under his forming hands a creature grew manlike but diffrent sex so

        addison    magnus sine viribus ignis incassum furit  virg   there is not in my opinion a consideration more effectual to extinguish inordinate desires in the soul of man than the notions of plato and his followers  upon that subject they tell us that every passion which has been contracted by the soul during her residence in the body remains with her in a separate state and that the soul in the body or out of the body differs no more than the man does from himself when he is in his house or in open air when therefore the obscene passions in particular have once taken root and spread themselves in the soul they cleave to her inseparably and remain in her for ever after the body is cast off and thrown aside as an argument to confirm this their doctrine they observe that a lewd youth who goes on in a continued course of voluptuousness advances by degrees into a libidinous old man and that the passion survives in the mind when it is altogether dead in the body nay that the desire grows more violent and like all other habits gathers strength by age at the same time that it has no power of executing its own purposes if say they the soul is the most subject to these passions at a time when it has the least instigations from the body we may well suppose she will still retain them when she is entirely divested of it the very substance of the soul is festered with them the gangrene is gone too far to be ever cured the inflammation will rage to all eternity  in this therefore say the platonists consists the punishment of a voluptuous man after death he is tormented with desires which it is impossible for him to gratify solicited by a passion that has neither objects nor organs adapted to it he lives in a state of invincible desire and impotence and always burns in the pursuit of what he always despairs to possess it is for this reason says plato that the souls of the dead appear frequently in cœmiteries and hover about the places where their bodies are buried as still hankering after their old brutal pleasures and desiring again to enter the body that gave them an opportunity of fulfilling them  some of our most eminent divines have made use of this platonick notion so far as it regards the subsistence of our passions after death with great beauty and strength of reason plato indeed carries the thought very far when he grafts upon it his opinion of ghosts appearing in places of burial though i must confess if one did believe that the departed souls of men and women wandered up and down these lower regions and entertained themselves with the sight of their species one could not devise a more proper hell for an impure spirit than that which plato has touched upon  the ancients seem to have drawn such a state of torments in the description of tantalus who was punished with the rage of an eternal thirst and set up to the chin in water that fled from his lips whenever he attempted to drink it  virgil who has cast the whole system of platonick philosophy so far as it relates to the soul of man in beautiful allegories in the sixth book of his æneid gives us the punishment of a voluptuary after death not unlike that which we are here speaking of  lucent genialibus altis aurea fulcra toris epulæque ante ora paratæ regifico luxu furiarum maxima juxta accubat et manibus prohibet contingere mensas exurgitque facem

which if they touch her hissing snakes she rears tossing her torch and thundring in their ears  dryd that i may a little alleviate the severity of this my speculation which otherwise may lose me several of my polite readers i shall translate a story that  has been quoted upon another occasion by one of the most learned men of the present age as i find it in the original the reader will see it is not foreign to my present subject and i dare say will think it a lively representation of a person lying under the torments of such a kind of tantalism or platonick hell as that which we have now under consideration monsieur pontignan speaking of a loveadventure that happened to him in the country gives the following account of it  when i was in the country last summer i was often in company with a couple of charming women who had all the wit and beauty one could desire in female companions with a dash of coquetry that from time to time gave me a great many agreeable torments i was after my way in love with both of them and had such frequent opportunities of pleading my passion to them when they were asunder that i had reason to hope for particular favours from each of them as i was walking one evening in my chamber with nothing about me but my night gown they both came into my room and told me they had a very pleasant trick to put upon a gentleman that was in the same house provided i would bear a part in it upon this they told me such a plausible story that i laughed at their contrivance and agreed to do whatever they should require of me they immediately began to swaddle me up in my nightgown with long pieces of linnen which they folded about me till they had wrapt me in above an hundred yards of swathe my arms were pressed to my sides and my legs closed together by so many wrappers one over another that i looked like an ægyptian mummy as i stood bolt upright upon one end in this antique figure one of the ladies burst out a laughing and now pontignan says she we intend to perform the promise that we find you have extorted from each of us you have often asked the favour of us and i dare say you are a better bred cavalier than to refuse to go to bed to two ladies that desire it of you after having stood a fit of laughter i begged them to uncase me and do with me what they pleased no no said they we like you very well as you are and upon that ordered me to be carried to one of their houses and put to bed in all my swaddles the room was lighted up on all sides and i was laid very decently between a pair  of sheets with my head which was indeed the only part i could move upon a very high pillow this was no sooner done but my two female friends came into bed to me in their finest nightclothes you may easily guess at the condition of a man that saw a couple of the most beautiful women in the world undrest and abed with him without being able to stir hand or foot i begged them to release me and struggled all i could to get loose which i did with so much violence that about midnight they both leaped out of the bed crying out they were undone but seeing me safe they took their posts again and renewed their raillery finding all my prayers and endeavours were lost i composed my self as well as i could and told them that if they would not unbind me i would fall asleep between them and by that means disgrace them for ever but alas this was impossible could i have been disposed to it they would have prevented me by several little illnatured caresses and endearments which they bestowed upon me as much devoted as i am to womankind i would not pass such another night to be master of the whole sex my reader will doubtless be curious to know what became of me the next morning why truly my bedfellows left me about an hour before day and told me if i would be good and lie still they would send somebody to take me up as soon as it was time for me to rise accordingly about nine a clock in the morning an old woman came to unswathe me i bore all this very patiently being resolved to take my revenge of my tormentors and to keep no measures with them as soon as i was at liberty but upon asking my old woman what was become

and mrs suchaone i shall call them by feigned names without further preface you are to know that within the liberties of the city of westminster lives the lady honoria a widow about the age of forty of a healthy constitution gay temper and elegant person she dresses a little too much like a girl affects a childish fondness in the tone of her voice sometimes a pretty sullenness in the leaning of her head and now and then a downcast of her eyes on her fan neither her imagination nor her health would ever give her to know that she is turned of twenty but that in the midst of these pretty softnesses and airs of delicacy and attraction she has a tall daughter within a fortnight of fifteen who impertinently comes into the room and towers so much towards woman that her mother is always checked by her presence and every charm of honoria droops at the entrance of flavia the agreeable flavia would be what she is not as well as her mother honoria but all their beholders are more partial to an affectation of what a person is growing up to than of what has been already enjoyed and is gone for ever it is therefore allowed to flavia to look forward but not to honoria to look back flavia is no way dependent on her mother with relation to her fortune for which reason they live almost upon an equality in conversation and as honoria has given flavia to understand that it is illbred to be always calling mother flavia is as well pleased never to be called child it happens by this means that these ladies are generally rivals in all places where they appear and the words mother and daughter never pass between them but out of spite flavia one night at a play observing honoria draw the eyes of several in the pit called to a lady who sat by her and bid her ask her mother to lend her her snuffbox for one moment another time when a lover of honoria was on his knees beseeching the favour to kiss her hand flavia rushing into the room kneeled down by him and asked blessing several of these contradictory acts of duty have raised between them such a coldness that they generally converse when they are in mixed company by way of talking at one another and not to one another honoria is ever complaining of a certain sufficiency in the young women of this age who assume to themselves an authority of carrying all things before them as if they were possessors of the esteem of mankind and all who were but a year before them in the world were neglected or deceased flavia upon such a provocation is sure to observe that there are people who can resign nothing and know not how to give up what they know they cannot hold that there are those who will not allow youth their follies not because they are themselves past them but because they love to continue in them these beauties rival each other on all occasions not that they have always had the same lovers but each has kept up a vanity to shew the other the charms of her lover dick crastin and tom tulip among many others have of late been pretenders in this family dick to honoria tom to flavia dick is the only surviving beau of the last age and tom almost the only one that keeps up that order of men in this i wish i could repeat the little circumstances of a conversation of the four lovers with the spirit in which the young lady i had my account from represented it at a visit where i had the honour to be present but it seems dick crastin the admirer of honoria and tom tulip the pretender to flavia were purposely admitted together by the ladies that each might shew the other that her lover had the superiority in the accomplishments of that sort of creature whom the sillier part of women call a fine gentleman as this age has a much more gross taste in courtship as well as in every thing else than the last had these gentlemen are instances of it in their different manner of application tulip is ever making allusions to the vigour of his person the sinewy force of his make while crastin professes a wary observation of the turns of his mistresss mind tulip gives himself the air of a restless ravisher crastin practises that of a skilful lover poetry is the inseparable property of every man in love and as men of wit write verses on those occasions the rest of the world repeat the verses of others these servants of the ladies were used to imitate their manner of conversation and allude to one another rather than interchange discourse in what they said when they met tulip the other day seized his mistresss hand and repeated out of ovids art of love tis i can in soft battles pass the night yet rise next morning vigorous for the fight fresh as the day and active as the light upon hearing this crastin with an air of deference played honorias fan and repeated sedley has that prevailing gentle art

calculated for male readers and generally written with an eye to men of learning makes a work of this nature the more necessary besides i am the more encouraged because i flatter myself that i see the

the shortness of time saith seneca  and yet have much more than we know what to do with our lives says he are spent either in doing nothing at all or in doing nothing to the purpose or in doing nothing that we ought to do we are always complaining our days are few and acting as though there would be no end of them that noble philosopher has described our inconsistency with our selves in this particular by all those various turns of expression and thought which are peculiar to his writings  i often consider mankind as wholly inconsistent with itself in a point that bears some affinity to the former though we seem grieved at the shortness of life in general we are wishing every period of it at an end the minor longs to be at age then to be a man of business then to make up an estate then to arrive at honours then to retire thus although the whole of life is allowed by every one to be short the several divisions of it appear long and tedious we are for lengthening our span in general but would fain contract the parts of which it is composed the usurer would be very well satisfied to have all the time annihilated that lies between the present moment and next quarterday the politician would be contented to lose three years in his life could he place things in the posture which he fancies they will stand in after such a revolution of time the lover would be glad to strike out of his existence all the moments that are to pass away before the happy meeting thus as fast as our time runs we should be very glad in most parts of our lives that it ran much faster than it does several hours of the day hang upon our hands nay we wish away whole years and travel through time as through a country filled with many wild and empty wastes which we would fain hurry over that we may arrive at those several little settlements or imaginary points of rest which are dispersed up and down in it  if we divide the life of most men into twenty parts we shall find that at least nineteen of them are meer gaps and chasms which are neither filled with pleasure nor business i do not however include in this calculation the life of those men who are in a perpetual hurry of affairs but of those only who are not always engaged in scenes of action and i hope i shall not do an unacceptable piece of service to these persons if i point out to them certain methods for the filling up their empty spaces of life the methods i shall propose to them are as follow  the first is the exercise of virtue in the most general acceptation of the word that particular scheme which comprehends the social virtues may give employment to the most industrious temper and find a man in business more than the most active station of life to advise the ignorant relieve the needy comfort the afflicted are duties that fall in our way almost every day of our lives a man has frequent opportunities of mitigating the fierceness of a party of doing justice to the character of a deserving man of softning the envious quieting the angry and rectifying the prejudiced which are all of them employments suited to a reasonable nature and bring great satisfaction to the person who can busy himself in them with discretion  there is another kind of virtue that may find employment for those retired hours in which we are altogether left to our selves and destitute of company and conversation i mean that intercourse and communication which every reasonable creature ought to maintain with the great author of his being the man who lives under an habitual sense of the divine presence keeps up a perpetual chearfulness of temper and enjoys every moment the satisfaction of thinking himself in company with his dearest and best of friends the time never lies heavy upon him it is impossible for him to be alone his thoughts and passions are the most busied at such hours when those of other men are the most unactive he no sooner steps out of the world but his heart burns with devotion swells with hope and triumphs in the consciousness of that presence which every where surrounds him or on the contrary pours out its fears its sorrows its apprehensions to the great supporter of its existence  i have here only considered the necessity of a mans being virtuous that he may have something to do but if we consider further that the exercise of virtue is not only an amusement for the time it lasts but that its influence extends to those parts of our existence which lie beyond the grave and that our whole eternity is to take its colour from those hours which we here employ in virtue or in vice the argument redoubles upon us for putting in practice this method of passing away our time  when a man has but a little stock to improve and has opportunities of turning it all to good account what shall we think of him if he suffers nineteen parts of it to lie dead and perhaps employs even the twentieth to his ruin or disadvantage but because the mind cannot be always in its fervours nor strained up to a pitch of virtue it is necessary to find out proper employments for it in its relaxations  the next method therefore that i would propose to fill up our time should be useful and innocent diversions i must confess i think it is below reasonable creatures to be altogether conversant in such diversions as are meerly innocent and have nothing else to recommend them but that there is no hurt in them whether any kind of gaming has even thus much to say for it self i shall not determine but i think it is very wonderful to see persons of the best sense passing away a dozen hours together in shuffling and dividing a pack of cards with no other conversation but what is made up of a few game phrases and no other ideas but those of black or red spots ranged together in different figures would not a man laugh to hear any one of this species complaining that life is short  the stage might be made a perpetual source of the most noble and useful entertainments were it under proper regulations  but the mind never unbends itself so agreeably as in the conversation of a well chosen friend there is indeed no blessing of life that is any way comparable to the enjoyment of a discreet and virtuous friend it eases and unloads the mind clears and improves the understanding engenders thoughts and knowledge animates virtue and good resolution sooths and allays the passions and finds employment for most of the vacant hours of life  next to such an intimacy with a particular person one would endeavour after a more general conversation with such as are able to entertain and improve those with whom they converse which are qualifications that seldom go asunder  there are many other useful amusements of life which one would endeavour to multiply that one might on all occasions have recourse to something rather than suffer the mind to lie idle or run adrift with any passion that chances to rise in it  a man that has a taste of musick painting or architecture is like one that has another sense when compared with such as have no relish of those arts the florist the planter the gardiner the husbandman when they are only as accomplishments to the man of fortune are great reliefs to a country life and many ways useful to those who are possessed of them  but of all the diversions of life there is none so proper to fill up its empty spaces as the reading of useful and entertaining authors but this i shall only touch upon because it in some measure interferes with the third method which i shall propose in another paper for the employment of our dead unactive hours and which i shall only mention in general to be the pursuit of knowledge      footnote     epist    and in his de brevitate vita return to footnote mark  contents contents p     no    monday june         addison    hoc est vivere bis vita posse priore frui  mart   the last method which i proposed in my saturdays paper for filling up those empty spaces of life which are so tedious and burdensome to idle people is the employing ourselves in the pursuit of knowledge i remember mr boyle  speaking of a certain mineral tells us that a man may consume his whole life in the study of it without arriving at the knowledge of all its qualities the truth of it is there is not a single science or any branch of it that might not furnish a man with business for life though it were much longer than it is  i shall not here engage on those beaten subjects of the usefulness of knowledge nor of the pleasure and perfection it gives the mind nor on the methods of attaining it nor recommend any particular branch of it all which have been the topicks of many other writers but shall indulge my self in a speculation that is more uncommon and may therefore perhaps be more entertaining  i have before shewn how the unemployed parts of life appear long and tedious and shall here endeavour to shew how those parts of life which are exercised in study reading and the pursuits of knowledge are long but not tedious and by that means discover a method of lengthening our lives and at the same time of turning all the parts of them to our advantage  mr lock observes  that we get the idea of time or duration by reflecting on that train of ideas which succeed one another in our minds that for this reason when we sleep soundly without dreaming we have no perception of time or the length of it whilst we sleep and that the moment wherein we leave off to think till the moment we begin to think again seems to have no distance to which the author adds and so i doubt not but it would be to a waking man if it were possible for him to keep only one idea in his mind without variation and the succession of others and we see that one who fixes his thoughts very intently on one thing so as to take but little notice of the succession of ideas that pass in his mind whilst he is taken up with that earnest contemplation lets slip out of his account a good part of that duration and thinks that time shorter than it is we might carry this thought further and consider a man as on one side shortening his time by thinking on nothing or but a few things so on the other as lengthening it by employing his thoughts on many subjects or by entertaining a quick and constant succession of ideas accordingly monsieur mallebranche in his enquiry after truth  which was published several years before mr locks essay on human understanding tells us that it is possible some creatures may think half an hour as long as we do a thousand years or look upon that space of duration which we call a minute as an hour a week a month or an whole age  this notion of monsieur mallebranche is capable of some little explanation from what i have quoted out of mr lock for if our notion of time is produced by our reflecting on the succession of ideas in our mind and this succession may be infinitely accelerated or retarded it will follow that different beings may have different notions of the same parts of duration according as their ideas which we suppose are equally distinct in each of them follow one another in a greater or less degree of rapidity  there is a famous passage in the alcoran which looks as if mahomet had been possessed of the notion we are now speaking of it is there said  that the angel gabriel took mahomet out of his bed one morning to give him a sight of all things in the seven heavens in paradise and in hell which the prophet took a distinct view of and after having held ninety thousand conferences with god was brought back again to his bed all this says the alcoran was transacted in so small a space of time that mahomet at his return found his bed still warm and took up an earthen pitcher which was thrown down at the very instant that the angel gabriel carried him away before the water was all spilt  there is a very pretty story in the turkish tales which relates to this passage of that famous impostor and bears some affinity to the subject we are now upon a sultan of egypt who was an infidel used to laugh at this circumstance in mahomets life as what was altogether impossible and absurd but conversing one day with a great doctor in the law who had the gift of working miracles the doctor told him he would quickly convince him of the truth of this passage in the history of mahomet if he would consent to do what he should desire of him upon this the sultan was directed to place himself by an huge tub of water which he did accordingly and as he stood by the tub amidst a circle of his great men the holy man bid him plunge his head into the water and draw it up again the king accordingly thrust his head into the water and at the same time found himself at the foot of a mountain on a seashore the king immediately began to rage against his doctor for this piece of treachery and witchcraft but at length knowing it was in vain to be angry he set himself to think on proper methods for getting a livelihood in this strange country accordingly he applied himself to some people whom he saw at work in a neighbouring wood these people conducted him to a town that stood at a little distance from the wood where after some adventures he married a woman of great beauty and fortune he lived with this woman so long till he had by her seven sons and seven daughters he was afterwards reduced to great want and forced to think of plying in the streets as a porter for his livelihood one day as he was walking alone by the seaside being seized with many melancholy reflections upon his former and his present state of life which had raised a fit of devotion in him he threw off his clothes with a design to wash himself according to the custom of the mahometans before he said his prayers  after his first plunge into the sea he no sooner raised his head above the water but he found himself standing by the side of the tub with the great men of his court about him and the holy man at his side he immediately upbraided his teacher for having sent him on such a course of adventures and betrayed him into so long a state of misery and servitude but was wonderfully surprised when he heard that the state he talked of was only a dream and delusion that he had not stirred from the place where he then stood and that he had only dipped his head into the water and immediately taken it out again  the mahometan doctor took this occasion of instructing the sultan that nothing was impossible with god and that he with whom a thousand years are but as one day can if he pleases make a single day nay a single moment appear to any of his creatures as a thousand years  i shall leave my reader to compare these eastern fables with the notions of those two great philosophers whom i have quoted in this paper and shall only by way of application desire him to consider how we may extend life beyond its natural dimensions by applying our selves diligently to the pursuits of knowledge  the hours of a wise man are lengthened by his ideas as those of a fool are by his passions the time of the one is long because he does not know what to do with it so is that of the other because he distinguishes every moment of it with useful or amusing thought or in other words because the one is always wishing it away and the other always enjoying it  how different is the view of past life in the man who is grown old in knowledge and wisdom from that of him who is grown old in ignorance and folly the latter is like the owner of a barren country that fills his eye with the prospect of naked hills and plains which produce nothing either profitable or ornamental the other beholds a beautiful and spacious landskip divided into delightful gardens green meadows fruitful fields and can scarce cast his eye on a single spot of his

following letters with much pleasure i cannot but think the good sense of them will be as agreeable to the town as any thing i could say either on the topicks they treat of or any other they both allude to former papers of mine and i do not question but the first which is upon inward mourning will be thought the production of a man who is well acquainted with the generous earnings of distress in a manly temper which is above the relief of tears a speculation of my own on that subject i shall defer till another occasion  the second letter is from a lady of a mind as great as her understanding there is perhaps something in the beginning of it which i ought in modesty to conceal but i have so much esteem for this correspondent that i will not alter a tittle of what she writes tho i am thus scrupulous at the price of being ridiculous mr spectator  i was very well pleased with your discourse upon general mourning and should be obliged to you if you would enter into the matter more deeply and give us your thoughts upon the common sense the ordinary people have of the demonstrations of grief who prescribe rules and fashions to the most solemn affliction such as the loss of the nearest relations and dearest friends you cannot go to visit a sick friend but some impertinent waiter about him observes the muscles of your face as strictly as if they were prognosticks of his death or recovery if he happens to be taken from you you are immediately surrounded with numbers of these spectators who expect a melancholy shrug of your shoulders a pathetical shake of your head and an expressive distortion of your face to measure your affection and value for the deceased but there is nothing on these occasions so much in their favour as immoderate weeping as all their passions are superficial they imagine the seat of love and friendship to be placed visibly in the eyes they judge what stock of kindness you had for the living by the quantity of tears you pour out for the dead so that if one body wants that quantity of saltwater another abounds with he is in great danger of being thought insensible or illnatured they are strangers to friendship whose grief happens not to be moist enough to wet such a parcel of handkerchiefs but experience has told us nothing is so fallacious as this outward sign of sorrow and the natural history of our bodies will teach us that this flux of the eyes this faculty of weeping is peculiar only to some constitutions we observe in the tender bodies of children when crossed in their little wills and expectations how dissolvable they are into tears if this were what grief is in men nature would not be able to support them in the excess of it for one moment add to this observation how quick is their transition from this passion to that of their joy i wont say we see often in the next tender things to children tears shed without much grieving thus it is common to shed tears without much sorrow and as common to suffer much sorrow without shedding tears grief and weeping are indeed frequent companions but i believe never in their highest excesses as laughter does not proceed from profound joy so neither does weeping from profound sorrow the sorrow which appears so easily at the eyes cannot have pierced deeply into the heart the heart distended with grief stops all the passages for tears or lamentations  now sir what i would incline you to in all this is that you would inform the shallow criticks and observers upon sorrow that true affliction labours to be invisible that it is a stranger to ceremony and that it bears in its own nature a dignity much above the little circumstances which are affected under the notion of decency you must know sir i have lately lost a dear friend for whom i have not yet shed a tear and for that reason your animadversions on that subject would be the more acceptable to sir your most humble servant bd     june the   th  mr spectator  as i hope there are but few who have so little gratitude as not to acknowledge the usefulness of your pen and to esteem it a publick benefit so i am sensible be that as it will you must nevertheless find the secret and incomparable pleasure of doing good and be a great sharer in the entertainment you give i acknowledge our sex to be much obliged and i hope improved by your labours and even your intentions more particularly for our service if it be true as tis sometimes said that our sex have an influence on the other your paper may be a yet more general good your directing us to reading is certainly the best means to our instruction but i think with you caution in that particular very useful since the improvement of our understandings may or may not be of service to us according as it is managed it has been thought we are not generally so ignorant as illtaught or that our sex does so often want wit judgment or knowledge as the right application of them you are so wellbred as to say your fair readers are already deeper scholars than the beaus and that you could name some of them that talk much better than several gentlemen that make a figure at wills this may possibly be and no great compliment in my opinion even supposing your comparison to reach toms and the grecian surely you are too wise to think that a real commendation of a woman were it not rather to be wished we improved in our own sphere and approved our selves better daughters wives mothers and friends  i cant but agree with the judicious trader in cheapside though i am not at all prejudiced in his favour in recommending the study of arithmetick and must dissent even from the authority which you mention when it advises the making our sex scholars indeed a little more philosophy in order to the subduing our passions to our reason might be sometimes serviceable and a treatise of that nature i should approve of even in exchange for theodosius or the force of love but as i well know you want not hints i will proceed no further than to recommend the bishop of cambrays education of a daughter as tis translated into the only language i have any knowledge of  tho perhaps very much to its disadvantage i have heard it objected against that piece that its instructions are not of general use but only fitted for a great lady but i confess i am not of that opinion for i dont remember that there are any rules laid down for the expences of a woman in which particular only i think a gentlewoman ought to differ from a lady of the best fortune or highest quality and not in their principles of justice gratitude sincerity prudence or modesty i ought perhaps to make an apology for this long epistle but as i rather believe you a friend to sincerity than ceremony shall only assure you i am sir your most humble servant

in that variety of forms wherein you considered the bad you found no place to mention the good there is however one observation of yours i approve which is that there are men of wit and good sense among all orders of men and that servants report most of the good or ill which is spoken of their masters that there are men of sense who live in servitude i have the vanity to say i have felt to my woful experience you attribute very justly the source of our general iniquity to boardwages and the manner of living out of a domestick way but i cannot give you my thoughts on this subject any way so well as by a short account of my own life to this the forty fifth year of my age that is to say from my being first a footboy at fourteen to my present station of a noblemans porter in the year of my age abovementioned know then that my father was a poor tenant to the family of sir stephen rackrent sir stephen put me to school or rather made me follow his son harry to school from my ninth year and there tho sir stephen paid something for my learning i was used like a servant and was forced to get what scraps of learning i could by my own industry for the schoolmaster took very little notice of me my young master was a lad of very sprightly parts and my being constantly about him and loving him was no small advantage to me my master loved me extreamly and has often been whipped for not keeping me at a distance he used always to say that when he came to his estate i should have a lease of my fathers tenement for nothing i came up to town with him to westminster school at which time he taught me at night all he learnt and put me to find out words in the dictionary when he was about his exercise it was the will of providence that master harry was taken very ill of a fever of which he died within ten days after his first falling sick here was the first sorrow i ever knew and i assure you mr spectator i remember the beautiful action of the sweet youth in his fever as fresh as if it were yesterday if he wanted any thing it must be given him by tom when i let any thing fall through the grief i was under he would cry do not beat the poor boy give him some more julep for me no body else shall give it me he would strive to hide his being so bad when he saw i could not bear his being in so much danger and comforted me saying tom tom have a good heart when i was holding a cup at his mouth he fell into convulsions and at this very time i hear my dear masters last groan i was quickly turned out of the room and left to sob and beat my head against the wall at my leisure the grief i was in was inexpressible and every body thought it would have cost me my life in a few days my old lady who was one of the housewives of the world thought of turning me out of doors because i put her in mind of her son sir stephen proposed putting me to prentice but my lady being an excellent manager would not let her husband throw away his money in acts of charity i had sense enough to be under the utmost indignation to see her discard with so little concern one her son had loved so much and went out of the house to ramble wherever my feet would carry me  the third day after i left sir stephens family i was strolling up and down the walks in the temple a young gentleman of the house who as i heard him say afterwards seeing me halfstarved and welldressed thought me an equipage ready to his hand after very little inquiry more than did i want a master bid me follow him i did so and in a very little while thought myself the happiest creature in this world my time was taken up in carrying letters to wenches or messages to young ladies of my masters acquaintance we rambled from tavern to tavern to the playhouse the mulberrygarden  and all places of resort where my master engaged every night in some new amour in which and drinking he spent all his time when he had money during these extravagancies i had the pleasure of lying on the stairs of a tavern half a night playing at dice with other servants and the like idleness when my master was moneyless i was generally employd in transcribing amorous pieces of poetry old songs and new lampoons this life held till my master married and he had then the prudence to turn me off because i was in the secret of his intreagues  i was utterly at a loss what course to take next when at last i applied my self to a

coat some shewing the terrour she was in of a jealous old husband others explaining that the severity of her parents was such tho her fortune was settled that she was willing to run away with such a

pretended to have received a letter out of the country that my father was dying and got my discharge with a bounty for my discretion  the next i lived with was a peevish single man whom i stayed with for a year and a half most part of the time i passed very easily for when i began to know him i minded no more than he meant what he said so that one day in a good humour he said i was the best man he ever had by my want of respect to him  these sir are the chief occurrences of my life and i will not dwell upon very many other places i have been in where i have been the strangest fellow in the

find a conversation between pharamond and eucrate upon the subject of duels and the copy of an edict issued in consequence of that discourse eucrate argued that nothing but the most severe and vindictive punishments such as placing the bodies of the offenders in chains and putting them to death by the most exquisite torments would be sufficient to extirpate a crime which had so long prevailed and was so firmly fixed in the opinion of the world as great and laudable but the king answered that indeed instances of ignominy were necessary in the cure of this evil but considering that it prevailed only among such as had a nicety in their sense of honour and that it often happened that a duel was fought to save appearances to the world when both parties were in their hearts in amity and reconciliation to each other it was evident that turning the mode another way would effectually put a stop to what had being only as a mode that to such persons poverty and shame were torments sufficient that he would not go further in punishing in others crimes which he was satisfied he himself was most guilty of in that he might have prevented them by speaking his displeasure sooner besides which the king said he was in general averse to tortures which was putting human nature it self rather than the criminal to disgrace and that he would be sure not to use this means where the crime was but an ill effect arising from a laudable cause the fear of shame the king at the same time spoke with much grace upon the subject of mercy and repented of many acts of that kind which had a magnificent aspect in the doing but dreadful consequences in the example mercy to particulars he observed was cruelty in the general that though a prince could not revive a dead man by taking the life of him who killed him neither could he make reparation to the next that should die by the evil example or answer to himself for the partiality in not pardoning the next as well as the former offender as for me says pharamond i have conquerd france and yet have given laws to my people the laws are my methods of life they are not a diminution but a direction to my power i am still absolute to distinguish the innocent and the virtuous to give honours to the brave and generous i am absolute in my goodwill none can oppose my bounty or prescribe rules for my favour while i can as i please reward the good i am under no pain that i cannot pardon the wicked for which reason continued pharamond i will effectually put a stop to this evil by exposing no more the tenderness of my nature to the importunity of having the same respect to those who are miserable by their fault and those who are so by their misfortune flatterers concluded the king smiling repeat to us princes that we are

their own hands and of their own authority to decide their controversies by combat we have thought fit to take the said custom into our royal consideration and find upon enquiry into the usual causes whereon such fatal decisions have arisen that by this wicked custom maugre all the precepts of our holy religion and the rules of right reason the greatest act of the human mind forgiveness of injuries is become vile and shameful that the rules of good society and virtuous conversation are hereby inverted that the loose the vain and the impudent insult the careful the discreet and the

long impunity our royal attention being employed upon matters of more general concern is become honourable and the refusal to engage in it ignominious in these our royal cares and enquiries we are yet farther made to understand that the persons of most eminent worth and most hopeful abilities accompanied with the strongest passion for true glory are such as are most liable to be involved in the dangers arising from this licence now taking the said premises into our serious consideration and well weighing that all such emergencies wherein the mind is incapable of commanding it self and where the injury is too sudden or too exquisite to be born are particularly provided for by laws heretofore enacted and that the qualities of less injuries like those of ingratitude are too nice and delicate to come under general rules we do resolve to blot this fashion or wantonness of anger out of the minds of our subjects by our royal resolutions declared in this edict as follow  no person who either sends or accepts a challenge or the posterity of either tho no death ensues thereupon shall be after the publication of this our edict capable of bearing office in these our dominions  the person who shall prove the sending or receiving a challenge shall receive to his own use and property the whole personal estate of both parties and their real estate shall be immediately vested in the

the criminal is condemned by the said appeal he shall not only suffer death but his whole estate real mixed and personal shall from the hour of his death be vested in the next heir of the person whose

very great height  insomuch that the female part of our species were much taller than the men the women were of such an enormous stature that we appeared as grasshoppers before them  at present the whole sex is in a manner dwarfed and shrunk into a race of beauties that seems almost another species i remember several ladies who were once very near seven foot high that at present want some inches of five how they came to be thus curtailed i cannot learn whether the whole sex be at present under any penance which we know nothing of or whether they have cast their headdresses in order to surprize us with something in that kind which shall be entirely new or whether some of the tallest of the sex being too cunning for the rest have contrived this method to make themselves appear sizeable is still a secret tho i find most are of opinion they are at present like trees new lopped and pruned that will certainly sprout up and flourish with greater heads than before for my own part as i do not love to be insulted by women who are taller than my self i admire the sex much more in their present humiliation which has reduced them to their natural dimensions than when they had extended their persons and lengthened themselves out into formidable and gigantick figures i am not for adding to the beautiful edifices of nature nor for raising any whimsical superstructure upon her plans i must therefore repeat it that i am highly pleased with the coiffure now in fashion and think it shews the good sense which at present very much reigns among the valuable part of the sex one may observe that women in all ages have taken more pains than men to adorn the outside of their heads and indeed i very much admire that those female architects who raise such wonderful structures out

aspired to so great an extravagance as in the fourteenth century when it was built up in a couple of cones or spires which stood so excessively high on each side of the head that a woman who was but a pigmie without her headdress appeard like a colossus upon putting it on monsieur paradin  says that these oldfashioned fontanges rose an ell above the head that they were pointed like steeples and had long loose pieces of crape fastened to the tops of them which were curiously fringed and hung down their backs like streamers the women might possibly have carried this gothick building much higher had not a famous monk thomas conecte  by name attacked it with great zeal and resolution  this holy man travelled from place to place to preach down this monstrous commode and succeeded so well in it that as the magicians sacrificed their books to the flames upon the preaching of an apostle many of the women threw down their headdresses in the middle of his sermon and made a bonfire of them within sight of the pulpit he was so renowned as well for the sanctity of his life as his manner of preaching that he had often a congregation of twenty thousand people the men placing themselves on the one side of his pulpit and the women on the other that appeared to use the similitude of an ingenious writer like a forest of cedars with their heads reaching to the clouds he so warmed and animated the people against this monstrous ornament that it lay under a kind of persecution and whenever it appeared in publick was pelted down by the rabble who flung stones at the persons that wore it but notwithstanding this prodigy vanished while the preacher was among them it began to appear again some months after his departure or to tell it in monsieur paradins own words the women that like snails in a fright had drawn in their horns shot them out again as soon as the danger was over this extravagance of the womens headdresses in that age is taken notice of by monsieur dargentré  in the history of bretagne and by other historians as well as the person i have here quoted  it is usually observed that a good reign is the only proper time for making of laws against the exorbitance of power in the same manner an excessive headdress may be attacked the most effectually when the fashion is against it i do therefore recommend this paper to my female readers by way of prevention  i would desire the fair sex to consider how impossible it is for them to add any thing that can be ornamental to what is already the masterpiece of nature the head has the most beautiful appearance as well as the highest station in a human figure nature has laid out all her art in beautifying the face she has touched it with vermilion planted in it a double row of ivory made it the seat of smiles and blushes lighted it up and enlivened it with the brightness of the eyes hung it on each side with curious organs of sense given it airs and graces that cannot be described and surrounded it with such a flowing shade of hair as sets all its beauties in the most agreeable light in short she seems to have designed the head as the cupola to the most glorious of her works and when we load it with such a pile of supernumerary ornaments we destroy the symmetry of the human figure and foolishly contrive to call off the eye from great and real beauties to childish gewgaws ribbands and bonelace  l      footnote

were last night engaged in a discourse upon that which passes for the chief point of honour among men and women and started a great many hints upon the subject which i thought were entirely new i shall therefore methodize the several reflections that arose upon this occasion and present my reader with them for the speculation of this day after having premised that if there is any thing in this paper which seems to differ with any passage of last thursdays the reader will consider this as the sentiments of the club and the other as my own private thoughts or rather those of pharamond  the great point of honour in men is courage and in women chastity if a man loses his honour in one rencounter it is not impossible for him to regain it in another a slip in a womans honour is irrecoverable i can give no reason for fixing the point of honour to these two qualities unless it be that each sex sets the greatest value on the qualification which renders them the most amiable in the eyes of the contrary sex had men chosen for themselves without regard to the opinions of the fair sex i should believe the choice would have fallen on wisdom or virtue or had women determined their own point of honour it is probable that wit or goodnature would have carried it against chastity  nothing recommends a man more to the female sex than courage whether it be that they are pleased to see one who is a terror to others fall like a slave at their feet or that this quality supplies their own principal defect in guarding them from insults and avenging their quarrels or that courage is a natural indication of a strong and sprightly constitution on the other side nothing makes a woman more esteemed by the opposite sex than chastity whether it be that we always prize those most who are hardest to come at or that nothing besides chastity with its collateral attendants truth fidelity and constancy gives the man a property in the person he loves and consequently endears her to him above all things  i am very much pleased with a passage in the inscription on a monument erected in westminster abbey to the late duke and dutchess of newcastle her name was margaret lucas youngest sister to the lord lucas of colchester a noble family for all the brothers were valiant and all the sisters virtuous in books of chivalry where the point of honour is strained to madness the whole story runs on chastity and courage the damsel is mounted on a white palfrey as an emblem of her innocence and to avoid scandal must have a dwarf for her page she is not to think of a man till some misfortune has brought a knighterrant to her relief the knight falls in love and did not gratitude restrain her from murdering her deliverer would die at her feet by her disdain however he must wait some years in the desart before her virgin heart can think of a surrender the knight goes off attacks every thing he meets that is bigger and stronger than himself seeks all opportunities of being knockd on the head and after seven years rambling returns to his mistress whose chastity has been attacked in the mean time by giants and tyrants and undergone as many tryals as her lovers valour  in spain where there are still great remains of this romantick humour it is a transporting favour for a lady to cast an accidental glance on her lover from a window tho it be two or three stories high as it is usual for the lover to assert his passion for his mistress in single combat with a mad bull  the great violation of the point of honour from man to man is giving the lie one may tell another he whores drinks blasphemes and it may pass unresented but to say he lies tho but in jest is an affront that nothing but blood can expiate the reason perhaps may be because no other vice implies a want of courage so much as the making of a lie and therefore telling a man he lies is touching him in the most sensible part of honour and indirectly calling him a coward i cannot omit under this head what herodotus tells us of the ancient persians that from the age of five years to twenty they instruct their sons only in three things to manage the horse to make use of the bow and to speak truth  the placing the point of honour in this false kind of courage has given occasion to the very refuse of mankind who have neither virtue nor common sense to set up for men of honour an english peer  who has not been long dead used to tell a pleasant story of a french gentleman that visited him early one morning at paris and after great professions of respect let him know that he had it in his power to oblige him which in short amounted to this that he believed he could tell his lordship the persons name who justled him as he came out from the opera but before he would proceed he begged his lordship that he would not deny him the honour of making him his second the english lord to avoid being drawn into a very foolish affair told him that he was under engagements for his two next duels to a couple of particular friends upon which the gentleman immediately withdrew hoping his lordship would not take it ill if he medled no farther in an affair from whence he himself was to receive no advantage  the beating down this false notion of honour in so vain and lively a people as those of france is deservedly looked upon as one of the most glorious parts of their present kings reign it is pity but the punishment of these mischievous notions should have in it some particular circumstances of shame and infamy that those who are slaves to them may see that instead of advancing their reputations they lead them to ignominy and dishonour  death is not sufficient to deter men who make it their glory to despise it but if every one that fought a duel were to stand in the pillory it would quickly lessen the number of these imaginary men of honour and put an end to so absurd a practice  when honour is a support to virtuous principles and runs parallel with the laws of god and our country it cannot be too much cherished and encouraged but when the dictates of honour are contrary to those of religion and equity they are the greatest depravations of human nature by giving wrong ambitions and false ideas of what is good and laudable and should therefore be exploded by all governments and driven out as the bane and plague of human society  l      footnote     percy said he had

not pleasant to him will find himself very young if not in his infancy sickness illhumour and idleness will have robbed him of a great share of that space we ordinarily call our life it is therefore the duty of every man that would be true to himself to obtain if possible a disposition to be pleased and place himself in a constant aptitude for the satisfactions of his being instead of this you hardly see a man who is not uneasy in proportion to his advancement in the arts of life an affected delicacy is the common improvement we meet with in those who pretend to be refined above others they

wherein our friends ought to rejoyce but indeed there are crowds of people who put themselves in no method of pleasing themselves or others such are those whom we usually call indolent persons indolence is methinks an intermediate state between pleasure and pain and very much unbecoming any part of our life after we are out of the nurses arms such an aversion to labour creates a constant weariness and one would think should make existence it self a burthen the indolent man descends from the dignity of his nature and makes that being which was rational merely vegetative his life consists only in the meer encrease and decay of a body which with relation to the rest of the world might as well have been uninformed as the habitation of a reasonable mind  of this kind is the life

married had all that the fire of youth and a lively manner could do towards making an agreeable woman the two people of seeming merit fell into each others arms and passion being sated and no reason or good sense in either to succeed it their life is now at a stand their meals are insipid and their time tedious their fortune has placed them above care and their loss of taste reduced them below diversion when we talk of these as instances of inexistence we do not mean that in order to live it is necessary we should always be in jovial crews or crowned with chaplets of roses as the merry fellows among the ancients are described but it is intended by considering these contraries to pleasure indolence and too much delicacy to shew that it is prudence to preserve a disposition in our selves to receive a certain delight in all we hear and see  this portable quality of good humour seasons all the parts and occurrences we meet with in such a manner that there are no moments lost but they all pass with so much satisfaction that the heaviest of loads when it is a load that of time is never felt by us varilas has this quality to the highest perfection and communicates it wherever he

but the man has that innate goodness of temper that he is welcome to every body because every man thinks he is so to him he does not seem to contribute any thing to the mirth of the company and yet upon reflection you find it all happened by his being there i thought it was whimsically said of a gentleman that if varilas had wit it would be the best wit in the world it is certain when a wellcorrected lively imagination and good breeding are added to a sweet disposition they qualify it to be one of the greatest blessings as well as pleasures of life  men would come into company with ten times the pleasure they do if they were sure of hearing nothing which should shock them as well as expected what would please them when we know every person that is spoken of is represented by one

it and a weakness to be affected with it all the illustrious persons of antiquity and indeed of every age in the world have passed through this fiery persecution there is no defence against reproach but obscurity it is a kind of concomitant to greatness as satyrs and invectives were an essential part of a roman triumph  if men of eminence are exposed to censure on one hand they are as much liable to flattery on the other if they receive reproaches which are not due to them they likewise receive praises which they do not deserve in a word the man in a high post is never regarded with an indifferent eye but always considered as a friend or an enemy for this reason persons in great stations have seldom their true characters drawn till several years after their deaths their personal friendships and enmities must cease and the parties they were engaged in be at an end before their faults or their virtues can have justice done them when writers have the least opportunities of knowing the truth they are in the best disposition to tell it  it is therefore the privilege of posterity to adjust the characters of illustrious persons and to set matters right between those antagonists who by their rivalry for greatness divided a whole age into factions we can now allow cæsar to be a great man without derogating from pompey and celebrate the virtues of cato without

will cool again in less than three hundred years in such a tract of time it is possible that the heats of the present age may be extinguished and our several classes of great men represented under their proper characters some eminent historian may then probably arise that will not write recentibus odiis as tacitus expresses it with the passions and prejudices of a contemporary author but make an impartial distribution of fame among the great men of the present age  i cannot forbear entertaining my self very often with the idea of such an imaginary historian describing the reign of anne the first and introducing it with a preface to his reader that he is now entring upon the most shining part of the english story the great rivals in fame will then be distinguished according to their respective merits and shine in their proper points of light such an  one says the historian tho variously represented by the writers of his own age appears to have been a man of more than ordinary abilities great application and uncommon integrity nor was such an one tho of an opposite party and interest inferior to him in any of these respects the several antagonists who now endeavour to depreciate one another and are celebrated or traduced by different parties will then have the same body of admirers and appear illustrious in the opinion of the whole british nation the deserving man who can now recommend himself to the esteem of but half his countrymen will then receive the approbations and applauses of a whole age  among the several persons that flourish in this glorious reign there is no question but such a future historian as the person of whom i am speaking will make mention of the men of genius and learning who have now any figure in the british nation for my own part i

words and obscure phrases of the age in which he lived we still understand enough of them to see the diversions and characters of the english nation in his time not but that we are to make allowance for the mirth and humour of the author who has doubtless strained many representations of things beyond the truth for if we interpret his words in the literal meaning we must suppose that women of the first quality used to pass away whole mornings at a puppetshow that they attested their principles by their patches that an audience would sit out an  evening to hear a dramatical performance written in a language which they did not understand that chairs and flowerpots were introduced as actors upon the british stage that a promiscuous assembly of men and women were allowed to meet at midnight in masques within the verge of the court with many improbabilities of the like nature we must therefore in these and the like cases suppose that these remote hints and allusions aimed at some certain follies which were then in vogue and which at present we have not any notion of we may guess by several passages in the speculations that there were writers who endeavoured to detract from the works of this author but as nothing of this nature is come down to us we cannot guess at any objections that could be made to his paper if we consider his style with that indulgence which we must shew to

diligently to her exercise for the space of but one half year shall be able to give her fan all the graces that can possibly enter into that little modish machine  but to the end that my readers may form to themselves a right notion of this exercise i beg leave to explain it to them in all its parts when my female regiment is drawn up in array with every one her weapon in her hand upon my giving the word to handle their fans each of them shakes her fan at me with a smile then gives her righthand woman a tap upon the shoulder then presses her lips with the extremity of her fan then lets her arms fall in an easy motion and stands in a readiness to receive the next word of command all this is done with a close fan and is generally learned in the first week  the next motion is that of unfurling the fan in which are  comprehended several little flirts and vibrations as also gradual and deliberate openings with many voluntary fallings asunder in the fan itself that are seldom learned under a months practice this part of the exercise pleases the spectators more than any other as it discovers on a sudden an infinite number of cupids garlands altars birds beasts rainbows and the like agreeable figures that display themselves to view whilst every one in the regiment holds a picture in her hand  upon my giving the word to discharge their fans they give one general crack that may be heard at a considerable distance when the wind sits fair this is one of the most difficult parts of the exercise but i have several ladies with me who at their first entrance could not give a pop loud enough to be heard at the further end of a room who can now discharge a fan in such a manner that it shall make a report like a pocketpistol i have likewise taken care in order to hinder young women from letting off their fans in wrong places or unsuitable occasions to shew upon what subject the crack of a fan may come in properly i have likewise invented a fan with which a girl of sixteen by the help of a little wind which is inclosed about one of the largest sticks can make as loud a crack as a woman of fifty with an ordinary fan  when the fans are thus discharged the word of command in course is to ground their fans this teaches a lady to quit her fan gracefully when she throws it aside in order to take up a pack of cards adjust a curl of hair replace a falling pin or apply her self to any other matter of importance this part of the exercise as it only consists in tossing a fan with an air upon a long table which stands by for that purpose may be learned in two days time as well as in a twelvemonth  when my female regiment is thus disarmed i generally let them walk about the room for some time when on a sudden like ladies that look upon their watches after a long visit they all of them hasten to their arms catch them up in a hurry and place themselves in their proper stations upon my calling out recover your fans this part of the exercise is not difficult provided a woman applies her thoughts to it  the fluttering of the fan is the last and indeed the masterpiece of the whole exercise but if a lady does not misspend her time she may make herself mistress of it in three months i generally lay aside the dogdays and the hot time of the summer for the teaching this part of the exercise for as soon as ever i pronounce flutter your fans the place is filld with so many zephyrs and gentle breezes as are very refreshing in that season of the year tho they might be dangerous to ladies of a tender constitution in any other  there is an infinite variety of motions to be made use of in the flutter of a fan there is the angry flutter the modest flutter the timorous flutter the confused flutter the merry flutter and the amorous flutter not to be tedious there is scarce any emotion in the mind which  does not produce a suitable agitation in the fan insomuch that if i only see the fan of a disciplind lady i know very well whether she laughs frowns or blushes i have seen a fan so very angry that it would have been dangerous for the absent lover who  provoked it to have come within the wind of it and at other times so very languishing that i have been glad for the ladys sake the lover was at a sufficient distance from it i need not add that a fan is either a prude or coquet according to the nature of the person who  bears it to conclude my letter i must acquaint you that i have from my own observations compiled a little treatise for the use of my scholars entitled the passions of the fan which i will communicate to you if you think it may be of use to the publick i shall have a general review on thursday next to which you shall be very welcome if you will honour it with your presence i am c  p s i teach young gentlemen the whole art of

complaisance which he thinks could be properly applied to no one living and i think could be only spoken of him and that in his absence was so extreamly offended with the excessive way of speaking civilities among us that he made a discourse against it at the club which he concluded with this remark that he had not heard one compliment made in our society since its commencement every one was pleased with his conclusion and as each knew his good will to the rest he was convinced that the many professions of kindness and service which we ordinarily meet with are not natural where the heart is well inclined but are a prostitution of speech seldom intended to mean any part of what they express never to mean all they express our reverend friend upon this topick pointed to us two or three paragraphs on this subject in the first sermon of the first volume of the late archbishops posthumous works  i do not know that i ever read any thing that pleased me more and as it is the praise of longinus that he speaks of the sublime in a style suitable to it so one may say of this author upon sincerity that he abhors any pomp of rhetorick on this occasion and treats it with a more than ordinary simplicity at once to be a preacher and an example with what command of himself does he lay before us in the language and temper of his profession a fault which by the least liberty and warmth of expression would be the most lively wit and satyr but his heart was better disposed and the good man chastised the great wit in such a manner that he was able to speak as follows  amongst too many other instances of the great corruption and degeneracy of the age wherein we live the great and general want of sincerity in conversation is none of the least the world is grown so full of dissimulation and compliment that mens words are hardly any signification of their thoughts and if any man measure his words by his heart and speak as he thinks and do not express more kindness to every man than men usually have for any man he can hardly escape the censure of want of breeding the old english plainness and sincerity that generous integrity of nature and honesty of disposition which always argues true greatness of mind and is usually accompanied with undaunted courage and resolution is in a great measure lost amongst us there hath been a long endeavour to transform us into foreign manners and fashions and to bring us to a servile imitation of none of the best of our neighbours in some of the worst of their qualities the dialect of conversation is nowadays so swelled with vanity and compliment and so surfeited as i may say of expressions of kindness and respect that if a man that lived an age or two ago should return into the world again he would really want a dictionary to help him to understand his own language and to know the true intrinsick value of the phrase in fashion and would hardly at first believe at what a low rate the highest strains and expressions of kindness imaginable do commonly pass in current payment and when he should come to understand it it would be a great while before he could bring himself with a good countenance and a good conscience to converse with men upon equal terms and in their own way  and in truth it is hard to say whether it should more provoke our contempt or our pity to hear what solemn expressions of respect and kindness will pass between men almost upon no occasion how great honour and esteem they will declare for one whom perhaps they never saw before and how entirely they are all on the sudden devoted to his service and interest for no reason how infinitely and eternally obliged to him for no benefit and how extreamly they will be concerned for him yea and afflicted too for no cause i know it is said in justification of this hollow kind of conversation that there is no harm no real deceit in compliment but the matter is well enough so long as we understand one another et verba valent ut nummi words are like money and when the current value of them is generally understood no man is cheated by them this is something if such words were any thing but being brought into the account they are meer cyphers however it is still a just matter of complaint that sincerity and plainness are out of fashion and that our language is running into a lie that men have almost quite perverted the use of speech and made words to signifie nothing that the greatest part of the conversation of mankind is little else but driving a trade of dissimulation insomuch that it would make a man heartily sick and weary of the world to see the little sincerity that is in use and practice among men  when the vice is placed in this contemptible light he argues unanswerably against it in words and thoughts so natural that any man who reads them would imagine he himself could have been the author of them  if the show of any thing be good for any thing i am sure sincerity is better for why does any man dissemble or seem to be that which he is not but because he thinks it good to have such a quality as he pretends to for to counterfeit and dissemble is to put on the appearance of some real excellency now the best way in the world to seem to be any thing is really to be what he would seem to be besides that it is many times as troublesome to make good the pretence of a good quality as to have it and if a man have it not it is ten to one but he is discovered to want it and then all his pains and labour to seem to have it is lost in another part of the same discourse he goes on to shew that all artifice must naturally tend to the disappointment of him that practises it whatsoever convenience may be thought to be in falshood and dissimulation it is soon over but the inconvenience of it is perpetual because it brings a man under an everlasting jealousie and suspicion so that he is not believed when he speaks truth nor trusted when perhaps he means honestly when a man hath once forfeited the reputation of his integrity he is set fast and nothing will then serve his turn neither truth nor falshood  r      footnote     this sermon on sincerity from john i    is the last tillotson

transgression against that rule of life called decorum or a regard to decency this would command the respect of mankind because it carries in it deference to their good opinion as humility lodged in a worthy mind is always attended with a certain homage which no haughty soul with all the arts imaginable will ever be able to purchase tully says virtue and decency are so nearly related that it is difficult to separate them from each other but in our imagination as the beauty of the body always accompanies the health of it so certainly is decency concomitant to virtue as beauty of body with an agreeable carriage pleases the eye and that pleasure consists in that we observe all the parts with a certain elegance are proportioned to each other so does decency of behaviour which appears in our lives obtain the approbation of all with whom we converse from the order consistency and moderation of our words and actions this flows from the reverence we bear towards every good man and to the world in general for to be negligent of what any one thinks of you does not only shew you arrogant but abandoned in all these considerations we are to distinguish how one virtue differs from another as it is the part of justice never to do violence it is of modesty never to commit offence in this last particular lies the whole force of what is called decency to this purpose that excellent moralist abovementioned talks of decency but this quality is more easily comprehended by an ordinary capacity than expressed with all his eloquence this decency of behaviour is generally transgressed among all orders of men nay the very women tho themselves created as it were for ornament are often very much mistaken in this ornamental part of life it would methinks be a short rule for behaviour if every young lady in her dress words and actions were only to recommend her self as a sister daughter or wife and make herself the more esteemed in one of those characters the care of themselves with regard to the families in which women are born is the best motive for their being courted to come into the alliance of other houses nothing can promote this end more than a strict preservation of decency i should be glad if a certain equestrian order of ladies some of whom one meets in an evening at every outlet of the town would take this subject into their serious consideration in order thereunto the following letter may not be wholly unworthy their perusal  mr spectator  going lately to take the air in one of the most beautiful evenings this season has produced as i was admiring the serenity of the sky the lively colours of the fields and the variety of the landskip every way around me my eyes were suddenly called off from these inanimate objects by a little party of horsemen i saw passing the road the greater part of them escaped my particular observation by reason that my whole attention was fixed on a very fair youth who rode in the midst of them and seemed to have been dressed by some description in a romance his features complexion and habit had a remarkable effeminacy and a certain languishing vanity appeared in his air his hair well curld and powderd hung to a considerable length on his shoulders and was wantonly tyd as if by the hands of his mistress in a scarlet ribbon which played like a streamer behind him he had a coat and wastecoat of blue camlet trimmd and embroidered with silver a cravat of the finest lace and wore in a smart cock a little beaver hat edged with silver and made more sprightly by a feather his horse too which was a pacer was adorned after the same airy manner and seemed to share in the vanity of the rider as i was pitying the luxury of this young person who appeared to me to have been educated only as an object of sight i perceived on my nearer approach and as i turned my eyes downward a part of the equipage i had not observed before which was a petticoat of the same with the coat and wastecoat after this discovery i looked again on the face of the fair amazon who had thus deceived me and thought those features which had before offended me by their softness were now strengthened into as improper a boldness and tho her eyes nose and mouth seemed to be formed with perfect symmetry i am not certain whether she who in appearance was a very handsome youth may not be in reality a very indifferent woman  there is an objection which naturally presents it self against these occasional perplexities and mixtures of dress which is that they seem to break in upon that propriety and distinction of appearance in which the beauty of different characters is preserved and if they should be more frequent than they are at present would look like turning our publick assemblies into a general masquerade the model of this amazonian huntinghabit for ladies was as i take it first imported from france and well enough expresses the gaiety of a people who are taught to do any thing so it be with an assurance but i cannot help thinking it sits awkwardly yet on our english modesty the petticoat is a kind of incumbrance upon it and if the amazons should think fit to go on in this plunder of our sexs ornaments they ought to add to their spoils and compleat their triumph over us by wearing the breeches  if it be natural to contract insensibly the manners of those we imitate the ladies who are pleased with assuming our dresses will do us more honour than we deserve but they will do it at their own expence why should the lovely camilla deceive us in more shapes than her own and affect to be represented in her picture with a gun and a spaniel while her elder brother the heir of a worthy family is drawn in silks like his sister the dress and air of a man are not well to be divided and those who would not be content with the latter ought never to think of assuming the former there is so large a portion of natural agreeableness among the fair sex of our island that they seem betrayed into these romantick habits without having the same occasion for them with their inventors all that needs to be desired of them is that they would be themselves that is what nature designed them and to see their mistake when they depart from this let them look upon a man who affects the softness and effeminacy of a woman to learn how their sex must appear to us when approaching to the resemblance of a man  i am sir your

will had recourse to his old topick of shewing the narrowspiritedness the pride and ignorance of pedants which he carried so far that upon my retiring to my lodgings i could not forbear throwing together such reflections as occurred to me upon that subject  a man who  has been brought up among books and is able to talk of nothing else is a very indifferent companion and what we call a pedant but methinks we should enlarge the title and give it every one that does not know how to think out of his profession and particular way of life  what is a greater pedant than a meer man of the town bar him the playhouses a catalogue of the reigning beauties and an account of a few fashionable distempers that have befallen him and you strike him dumb how many a pretty gentlemans knowledge lies all within the verge of the court he will tell you the names of the principal favourites repeat the shrewd sayings of a man of quality whisper an intreague that is not yet blown upon by common fame or if the sphere of his observations is a little larger than ordinary will perhaps enter into all the incidents turns and revolutions in a game of ombre when he has gone thus far he has shown you the whole circle of his accomplishments his parts are drained and he is disabled from any further conversation what are these but rank pedants and yet these are the men who  value themselves most on their exemption from the pedantry of colleges  i might here mention the military pedant who always talks in a camp and is storming towns making lodgments and fighting battles from one end of the year to the other every thing he speaks smells of gunpowder if you take away his artillery from him he has not a word to say for himself i might likewise mention the lawpedant that is perpetually putting cases repeating the transactions of westminsterhall wrangling with you upon the most indifferent circumstances of life and not to be convinced of the distance of a place or of the most trivial point in conversation but by dint of argument the statepedant is wrapt up in news and lost in politicks if you mention either of the kings of spain or poland he talks very notably but if you go out of the gazette you drop him in short a meer courtier a meer soldier a meer scholar a meer any thing is an insipid pedantick character and equally ridiculous  of all the species of pedants which i have mentioned  the bookpedant is much the most supportable he has at least an exercised understanding and a head which is full though confused so that a man who converses with him may often receive from him hints of things that are worth knowing and what he may possibly turn to his own advantage tho they are of little use to the owner the worst kind of pedants among learned men are such as are naturally endued with a very small share of common sense and have read a great number of books without taste or distinction  the truth of it is learning like travelling and all other methods of improvement as it finishes good sense so it makes a silly man ten thousand times more insufferable by supplying variety of matter to his impertinence and giving him an opportunity of abounding in absurdities  shallow pedants cry up one another much more than men of solid and useful learning to read the titles they give an editor or collator of a manuscript you would take him for the glory of the commonwealth of letters and the wonder of his age when perhaps upon examination you find that he has only rectifyd a greek particle or laid out a whole sentence in proper commas  they are obliged

gentlemen of the country come to see him he only shews me at a distance as i have been walking in his fields i have observed them stealing a sight of me over an hedge and have heard the knight desiring them not to let me see them for that i hated to be stared at  i am the more at ease in sir rogers family because it consists of sober and staid persons for as the knight is the best master in the world he seldom changes his servants and as he is beloved by all about him his servants never care for leaving him by this means his domesticks are all in years and grown old with their master you would take his valet de chambre for his brother his butler is greyheaded his groom is one of the gravest men that i have ever seen and his coachman has the looks of a privycounsellor you see the goodness of the master even in the old housedog and in a grey pad that is kept in the stable with great care and tenderness out of regard to his past services tho he has been useless for several years  i could not but observe with a great deal of pleasure the joy that appeared in the countenances of these ancient domesticks upon my friends arrival at his countryseat some of them could not refrain from tears at the sight of their old master every one of them pressd forward to do something for him and seemed discouraged if they were not employed at the same time the good old knight with a mixture of the father and the master of the family tempered the enquiries after his own affairs with several kind questions relating to themselves this humanity and good nature engages every body to him so that when he is pleasant upon any of them all his family are in good humour and none so much as the person whom he diverts himself with on the contrary if he coughs or betrays any infirmity of old age it is easy for a standerby to observe a secret concern in the looks of all his servants   my worthy friend has put me under the particular care of his butler who is a very prudent man and as well as the rest of his fellowservants wonderfully desirous of pleasing me because they have often heard their master talk of me as of his particular friend  my chief companion when sir roger is diverting himself in the woods or the fields is a very venerable man who is ever with sir roger and has lived at his house in the nature of a chaplain above thirty years this gentleman is a person of good sense and some learning of a very regular life and obliging conversation he heartily loves sir roger and knows that he is very much in the old knights esteem so that he lives in the family rather as a relation than a dependant  i have observed in several of my papers that my friend sir roger amidst all his good qualities is something of an humourist and that his virtues as well as imperfections are as it were tinged by a certain extravagance which makes them particularly his and distinguishes them from those of other men this cast of mind as it is generally very innocent in it self so it renders his conversation highly agreeable and more delightful than the same degree of sense and virtue would appear in their common and ordinary colours as i was walking with him last night he asked me how i liked the good man whom i have just now mentioned and without staying for my answer told me that he was afraid of being insulted with latin and greek at his own table for which reason he desired a particular friend of his at the university to find him out a clergyman rather of plain sense than much learning of a good aspect a clear voice a sociable temper and if possible a man that understood a little of backgammon my friend says sir roger found me out this gentleman who besides the endowments required  of him is they tell me a good scholar tho he does not shew it i have given him the parsonage of the parish and because i know his value have settled upon him a good annuity for life if he outlives me he shall find that he was higher in my esteem than perhaps he thinks he is he has now been with me thirty years and tho he does not know i have taken notice of it has never in all that time asked anything of me for himself tho he is every day solliciting me for something in behalf of one or other of my tenants his parishioners there has not been a lawsuit in the parish since he has livd among them if any dispute arises they apply themselves to him for the decision if they do not acquiesce in his judgment which i think never happened above once or twice at most they appeal to me at his first settling with me i made him a present of all the good sermons which  have been printed in english and only beggd of him that every sunday he would pronounce one of them in the pulpit accordingly he has digested them into such a series that they follow one another naturally and make a continued system of practical divinity as sir roger was going on in his story the gentleman we were talking of came up to us and upon the knights asking him who preached to morrow for it was saturday night told us the bishop of st asaph in the morning and dr south in the afternoon he then shewed us his list of preachers for the whole year where i saw with a great deal of pleasure archbishop tillotson bishop saunderson doctor barrow doctor calamy  with several living authors who have published discourses of practical divinity i no sooner saw this venerable man in the pulpit but i very much approved of my friends insisting upon the qualifications of a good aspect and a clear voice for i was so charmed with the gracefulness of his figure and delivery as well as with the discourses he pronounced that i think i never passed any time more to my satisfaction a sermon repeated after this manner is like the composition of a poet in the mouth of a graceful actor  i could heartily wish that more of our country clergy would follow this example and instead of wasting their spirits in laborious compositions of their own would endeavour after a handsome elocution and

the reception manner of attendance undisturbed freedom and quiet which i meet with here in the country has confirmd me in the opinion i always had that the general corruption of manners in servants is owing to the conduct of masters the aspect of every one in the family carries so much satisfaction that it appears he knows the happy lot which has befallen him in being a member of it there is one particular which i have seldom seen but at sir rogers it is usual in all other places that servants fly from the parts of the house through which their master is passing on the contrary here they industriously place themselves in his way and it is on both sides as it were understood as a visit when the servants appear without calling this proceeds from the humane and equal temper of the man of the house who also perfectly well knows how to enjoy a great estate with such œconomy as ever to be much beforehand this makes his own mind untroubled and consequently unapt to vent peevish expressions or give passionate or inconsistent orders to those about him thus respect and love go together and a certain chearfulness in performance of their duty is the particular distinction of the lower part of this family when a servant is called before his master he does not come with an expectation to hear himself rated for some trivial fault threatned to be stripped or used with any other unbecoming language which mean masters often give to worthy servants but it is often to know what road he took that he came so readily back according to order whether he passed by such a ground if the old man who rents it is in good health or whether he gave sir rogers love to him or the like  a man who preserves a respect founded on his benevolence to his dependants lives rather like a prince than a master in his family his orders are received as favours rather than duties and the distinction of approaching him is part of the reward for executing what is commanded by him  there is another circumstance in which my friend excells in his management which is the manner of rewarding his servants he has ever been of opinion that giving his cast cloaths to be worn by valets has a very ill effect upon little minds and creates a silly sense of equality between the parties in persons affected only with outward things i have heard him often pleasant on this occasion and describe a young gentleman abusing his man in that coat which a month or two before was the most pleasing distinction he was conscious of in himself he would turn his discourse still more pleasantly upon the ladies bounties of this kind and i have heard him say he knew a fine woman who distributed rewards and punishments in giving becoming or unbecoming dresses to her maids but my good friend is above these little instances of goodwill in bestowing only trifles on his servants a good servant to him is sure of having it in his choice very soon of being no servant at all as i before observed he is so good an husband and knows so thoroughly that the skill of the purse is the cardinal virtue of this life i say he knows so well that frugality is the support of generosity that he can often spare a large fine when a tenement falls and give that settlement to a good servant who has a mind to go into the world or make a stranger pay the fine to that servant for his more comfortable maintenance if he stays in his service  a man of honour and generosity considers it would be miserable to himself to have no will but that of another tho it were of the best person breathing and for that reason goes on as fast as he is able to put his servants into independent livelihoods the greatest part of sir rogers estate is tenanted by persons who have served himself or his ancestors it was to me extreamly pleasant to observe the visitants from several parts to welcome his arrival into the country and all the difference that i could take notice of between the late servants who came to see him and those who staid in the family was that these latter were looked upon as finer gentlemen and better courtiers  this manumission and placing them in a way of livelihood i look upon as only what is due to a good servant which encouragement will make his successor be as diligent as humble and as ready as he was there is something wonderful in the narrowness of those minds which can be pleased and be barren of bounty to those who please them  one might on this occasion recount the sense that great persons in all ages have had of the merit of their dependants and the heroick services which men have done their masters in the extremity of their fortunes and shewn to their undone patrons that fortune was all the difference between them but as i design this my speculation only as a  gentle admonition to thankless masters i shall not go out of the occurrences of common life but assert it as a general observation that i never saw but in sir rogers family and one or two more good servants treated as they ought to be sir rogers kindness extends to their childrens children and this very morning he sent his coachmans grandson to prentice i shall conclude this paper with an account of a picture in his gallery where there are many which will deserve my future observation  at the very upper end of this handsome structure i saw the portraiture of two young men standing in a river the one naked the other in a livery the person supported seemed half dead but still so much alive as to shew in his face exquisite joy and love towards the other i thought the fainting figure resembled my friend sir roger and looking at the butler who stood by me for an account of it he informed me that the person in the livery was a servant of sir rogers who stood on the shore while his master was swimming and observing him taken with some sudden illness and sink under water jumped in and saved him he told me sir roger took off the dress he was in as soon as he came home and by a great bounty at that time followed by his favour ever since had made him master of that pretty seat which we saw at a distance as we came to this house i rememberd indeed sir roger said there lived a very worthy gentleman to whom he was highly obliged without mentioning anything further upon my looking a little dissatisfyd at some part of the picture my attendant informed me that it was against sir rogers will and at the earnest request of the gentleman himself that he was drawn in the habit in which he had saved his master  r      footnote     a return to footnote mark  contents contents p     no  0

told him mr william wimble had caught that very morning and that he presented it with his service to him and intended to come and dine with him at the same time he delivered a letter which my friend read to me as soon as the messenger left him sir roger  i desire you to accept of a jack which is the best i have caught this season i intend to come and stay with you a week and see how the perch bite in the black river i observed with some concern the last time i saw you upon the bowlinggreen that your whip wanted a lash to it i will bring half a dozen with me that i twisted last week which i hope will serve you all the time you are in the country i have not been out of the saddle for six days last past having been at eaton with sir johns eldest son he takes to his learning hugely i am  sir your humble servant will wimble   this extraordinary letter and message that accompanied it made me very curious to know the character and quality of the gentleman who sent them which i found to be as follows will wimble is younger brother to a baronet and descended of the ancient family of the wimbles he is now between forty and fifty but being bred to no business and born to no estate he generally lives with his elder brother as superintendant of his game he hunts a pack of dogs better than any man in the country and is very famous for finding out a hare he is extreamly well versed in all the little handicrafts of an idle man he makes a mayfly to a miracle and furnishes the whole country with anglerods as he is a goodnaturd officious fellow and very much esteemd upon account of his family he is a welcome guest at every house and keeps up a good correspondence among all the gentlemen about him he carries a tuliproot in his pocket from one to another or exchanges a poppy between a couple of friends that live perhaps in the opposite sides of the county will is a particular favourite of all the young heirs whom he frequently obliges with a net that he has weaved or a settingdog that he has made himself he now and then presents a pair of garters of his own knitting to their mothers or sisters and raises a great deal of mirth among them by enquiring as often as he meets them how they wear these gentlemanlike manufactures and obliging little humours make will the darling of the country  sir roger was proceeding in the character of him when we saw him make up to us with two or three hazletwigs in his hand that he had cut in sir rogers woods as he came through them in his way to the house i was very much pleased to observe on one side the hearty and sincere welcome with which sir roger received him and on the other the secret joy which his guest discoverd at sight of the good old knight after the first salutes were over will desired sir roger to lend him one of his servants to carry a set of shuttlecocks he had with him in a little box to a lady that lived about a mile off to whom it seems he had promisd such a present for above this half year sir rogers back was no sooner turned but honest will began  to tell me of a large cockpheasant that he had sprung in one of the neighbouring woods with two or three other adventures of the same nature odd and uncommon characters are the game that i look for and most delight in for which reason i was as much pleased with the novelty of the person that talked to me as he could be for his life with the springing of a pheasant and therefore listned to him with more than ordinary attention  in the midst of his discourse the bell rung to dinner where the gentleman i have been speaking of had the pleasure of seeing the huge jack he had caught served up for the first dish in a most sumptuous manner upon our sitting down to it he gave us a long account how he had hooked it played with it foiled it and at length drew it out upon the bank with several other particulars that lasted all the first course a dish of wildfowl that came afterwards furnished conversation for the rest of the dinner which concluded with a late invention of wills for improving the quailpipe  upon withdrawing into my room after dinner i was secretly touched with compassion towards the honest gentleman that had dined with us and could not but consider with a great deal of concern how so good an heart and such busy hands were wholly employed in trifles that so much humanity should be so little beneficial to others and so much industry so little advantageous to himself the same temper of mind and application to affairs might have recommended him to the publick esteem and have raised his fortune in another station of life what good to his country or himself might not a trader or merchant have done with such useful tho ordinary qualifications  will wimbles is the case of many a younger brother of a great family who had rather see their children starve like gentlemen than thrive in a trade or profession that is beneath their quality this humour fills several parts of europe with pride and beggary it is the happiness of a trading nation like ours that the younger sons tho uncapabie of any liberal art or profession may be placed in such a way of life as may perhaps enable them to vie with the best of their family accordingly we find several citizens that were launched into the world with narrow fortunes rising by an honest industry to greater estates than those of their elder brothers it is not improbable but will was formerly tried at divinity law or physick and that finding his genius did not lie that way his parents gave him up at length to his own inventions but certainly however improper he might have been for studies of a higher nature he was perfectly well turned for the occupations of trade and commerce as i think this is a point which cannot be too much inculcated i shall

meet me among his relations the de coverleys and hoped i liked the conversation of so much good company who were as silent as myself i knew he alluded to the pictures and as he is a gentleman who does not a little value himself upon his ancient descent i expected he would give me some account of them we were now arrived at the upper end of the gallery when the knight faced towards one of the pictures and as we stood before it he entered into the matter after his blunt way of saying things as they occur to his imagination without regular introduction or care to preserve the appearance of chain of thought it is said he worth while to consider the force of dress and how the persons of one age differ from those of another merely by that only one may observe also that the general fashion of one age has been followed by one particular set of people in another and by them preserved from one generation to another thus the vast jetting coat and small bonnet which was the habit in harry the sevenths time is kept on in the yeomen of the guard not without a good and politick view because they look a foot taller and a foot and an half broader besides that the cap leaves the face expanded and consequently more terrible and fitter to stand at the entrance of palaces  this predecessor of ours you see is dressed after this manner and his cheeks would be no larger than mine were he in a hat as i am he was the last man that won a prize in the tiltyard which is now a common street before whitehall  you see the broken lance that lies there by his right foot he shivered that lance of his adversary all to pieces and bearing himself look you sir in this manner at the same time he came within the target of the gentleman who rode against him and taking him with incredible force before him on the pommel of his saddle he in that manner rid the turnament over with an air that shewed he did it rather to perform the rule of the lists than expose his enemy however it appeared he knew how to make use of a victory and with a gentle trot he marched up to a gallery where their mistress sat for they were rivals and let him down with laudable courtesy and pardonable insolence i dont know but it might be exactly where the coffeehouse is now  you are to know this my ancestor was not only of a military genius but fit also for the arts of peace for he played on the

fate against her will this homely thing in the middle had both their portions added to her own and was stolen by a neighbouring gentleman a man of stratagem and resolution for he poisoned three mastiffs to come at her and knocked down two deerstealers in carrying her off misfortunes happen in all families the theft of this romp and so much mony was no great matter to our estate but the next heir that possessed it was this soft gentleman whom you see there observe the small buttons the little boots the laces the slashes about his cloaths and above all the posture he is drawn in which to be sure was his own choosing you see he sits with one hand on a desk writing and looking as it were another way like an easy writer or a sonneteer he was one of those that had too much wit to know how to live in the world he was a man of no justice but great good manners he ruined every body that had any thing to do with him but never said a rude thing in his life the most indolent person in the world he would sign a deed that passed away half his estate with his gloves on but would not put on his hat before a lady if it were to save his country he is said to be the first that made love by squeezing the hand he left the estate with ten thousand pounds debt upon it but however by all hands i have been informed that he was every way the finest gentleman in the world that debt lay heavy on our house for one generation but it was retrieved by a gift from that honest man you see there a citizen of our name but nothing at all akin to us i know sir andrew freeport has said behind my back that this man was descended from one of the ten children of the maid of honour i shewed you above but it was never made out we winked at the thing indeed because mony was wanting at that time here i saw my friend a little embarrassed and turned my face to the next portraiture  sir roger went on with his account of the gallery in the following manner this man pointing to him i looked at i take to be the honour of our house sir humphrey de coverley he was in his dealings as punctual as a tradesman and as generous as a gentleman he would have thought himself as much undone by breaking his word as if it were to be followed by bankruptcy he served his country as knight of this shire to his dying day he found it no easy matter to maintain an integrity in his words and actions even in things that regarded the offices which were incumbent upon him in the care of his own affairs and relations of life and therefore dreaded tho he had great talents to go into employments of state where he must be exposed to the snares of ambition innocence of life and great ability were the distinguishing parts of his character the latter he had often observed had led to the destruction of the former and used frequently to lament that great and good had not the same signification he was an excellent husbandman but had resolved not to exceed such a degree of wealth all above it he bestowed in secret bounties many years after the sum he aimed at for his own use was attained yet he did not slacken his industry but to a decent old age spent the life and fortune which was superfluous to himself in the service of his friends and neighbours here we were called to dinner and sir roger ended the discourse of this gentleman by telling me as we followed the servant that this his ancestor was a brave man and narrowly escaped being killed in the civil wars for said he he was sent out of the field upon a private message the day before the battel of worcester the whim of narrowly escaping

among the ruins of an old abby there is a long walk of aged elms which are shot up so very high that when one passes under them the rooks and crows that rest upon the tops of them seem to be cawing in another region i am very much delighted with this sort of noise which i consider as a kind of natural prayer to that being who supplies the wants of his whole creation and who in the beautiful language of the psalms feedeth the young ravens that call upon him i like this retirement  the better because of an ill report it lies under of being haunted for which reason as i have been told in the family no living creature ever walks in it besides the chaplain my good friend the butler desired me with a very grave face not to venture my self in it after sunset for that one of the footmen had been almost frighted out of his wits by a spirit that appeard to him in the shape of a black horse without an head to which he added that about a month ago one of the maids coming home late that way with a pail of milk upon her head heard such a rustling among the bushes that she let it fall  i was taking a walk in this place last night between the hours of nine and ten and could not but fancy it one of the most proper scenes in the world for a ghost to appear in the ruins of the abby are scattered up and down on every side and half covered with ivy and elderbushes the harbours of several solitary birds which seldom make their appearance till the dusk of the evening the place was formerly a churchyard and has still several marks in it of graves and buryingplaces there is such an eccho among the old ruins and vaults that if you stamp but a little louder than ordinary you hear the sound repeated at the same time the walk of elms with the croaking of the ravens which from time to time are heard from the tops of them looks exceeding solemn and venerable these objects naturally raise seriousness and attention and when night heightens the awfulness of the place and pours out her supernumerary horrors upon every thing in it i do not at all wonder that weak minds fill it with spectres and apparitions  mr locke in his chapter of the association of ideas has very curious remarks to shew how by the prejudice of education one idea often introduces into the mind a whole set that bear no resemblance to one another in the nature of things among several examples of this kind he produces the following instance the ideas of goblins and sprights have really no more to do with darkness than light yet let but a foolish maid inculcate these often on the mind of a child and raise them there together possibly he shall never be able to separate them again so long as he lives but darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas and they shall be so joined that he can no more bear the one than the other   as i was walking in this solitude where the dusk of the evening conspired with so many other occasions of terrour i observed a cow grazing not far from me which an imagination that is apt to startle might easily have construed into a black horse without an head and i dare say the poor footman lost his wits upon some such trivial occasion  my friend sir roger has often told me with a great deal of mirth that at his first coming to his estate he found three parts of his house altogether useless that the best room in it had the reputation of being haunted and by that means was locked up that noises had been heard in his long gallery so that he could not get a servant to enter it after eight a clock at night that the door of one of his chambers was nailed up because there went a story in the family that a butler had formerly hangd himself in it and that his mother who lived to a great age had shut up half the rooms in the house in which either her husband a son or daughter had died the knight seeing his habitation reduced to  so small a compass and himself in a manner shut out of his own house upon the death of his mother ordered all the apartments  to be flung open and exorcised by his chaplain who lay in every room one after another and by that means dissipated the fears which had so long reigned in the family  i should not have been thus particular upon these ridiculous horrours did i not find them so very much prevail in all parts of the country at the same time i think a person who is thus terrifyd with the imagination of ghosts and spectres much more reasonable than one who contrary to the reports of all historians sacred and prophane ancient and modern and to the traditions of all nations thinks the appearance of spirits fabulous and groundless could not i give myself up to this general testimony of mankind i should to the relations of particular persons who are now living and whom i cannot distrust in other matters of fact i might here add that not only the historians to whom we may join the poets but likewise the philosophers of antiquity have favoured this opinion lucretius himself though by the course of his philosophy he was obliged to maintain that the soul did not exist separate from the body makes no doubt of the reality of apparitions and that men have often appeared after their death this i think very remarkable he was so pressed with the matter of fact which he could not have the confidence to deny that he was forced to account for it by one of the most absurd unphilosophical notions that was ever started he tells us that the surfaces of all bodies are perpetually flying off from their respective bodies one after another and that these surfaces or thin cases that included each other whilst they were joined in the body like the coats of an onion are sometimes seen entire when they are separated from it by which means we often behold the shapes and shadows of persons who are either dead or absent   i shall dismiss this paper with a story out of josephus not so much for the sake of the story it self as for the moral reflections with which the author concludes it and which i shall here set down in his own words  glaphyra the daughter of king archelaus after the death of her two first husbands being married to a third who was brother to her first husband and so passionately in love with her that he turned off his former wife to make room for this marriage had a very odd kind of dream she fancied that she saw her first husband coming towards her and that she embraced him with great tenderness when in the midst of the pleasure which she expressed at the sight of him he reproached her after the following manner glaphyra says he thou hast made good the old saying that women are not to be trusted was not i the husband of thy virginity have i not children by thee how couldst thou forget our loves so far as to enter into a second marriage and after that into a third nay to take for thy husband a man who has so shamelessly crept into the bed of his brother however for the sake of our passed loves i shall free thee from thy present reproach and make thee mine for ever glaphyra told this dream to several women of her acquaintance and died soon after  i thought this story might not be impertinent in this place wherein i speak of those kings besides that the example deserves to be taken notice of as it contains a most certain proof of the immortality of the soul and of divine providence if any man thinks these facts incredible let him enjoy his own opinion to himself but let him not endeavour to disturb the belief of others who by instances of this nature are excited to the study of virtue l      footnote

led me insensibly into a subject upon which i always meditate with great delight i mean the immortality of the soul i was yesterday walking alone in one of my friends woods and lost my self in it very agreeably as i was running over in my mind the several arguments that establish this great point which is the basis of morality and the source of all the pleasing hopes and secret joys that can arise in the heart of a reasonable creature i considered those several proofs drawn    from the nature of the soul it self and particularly its immateriality which tho not absolutely necessary to the eternity of its duration has i think been evinced to almost a demonstration    from its passions and sentiments as particularly from its love of existence its horrour of annihilation and its hopes of immortality with that secret satisfaction which it finds in the practice of virtue and that uneasiness which follows in it upon the commission of vice    from the nature of the supreme being whose justice goodness wisdom and veracity are all concerned in this great point but among these and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the soul there is one drawn from the perpetual progress of the soul to its perfection without a possibility of ever arriving at it which is a hint that i do not remember to have seen opened and improved by others who have written on this subject tho it seems to me to carry a great weight with it how can it enter into the thoughts of man that the soul which is capable of such immense perfections and of receiving new improvements to all eternity shall fall away into nothing almost as soon as it is created are such abilities made for no purpose a brute arrives at a point of perfection that he can never pass in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of and were he to live ten thousand more would be the same thing he is at present were a human soul thus at a stand in her accomplishments were her faculties to be full blown and incapable of further enlargements i could imagine it might fall away insensibly and drop at once into a state of annihilation but can we believe a thinking being that is in a perpetual progress of improvements and travelling on from perfection to perfection after having just looked abroad into the works of its creator and made a few discoveries of his infinite goodness wisdom and power must perish at her first setting out and in the very beginning of her enquiries  a man considered in his present state seems only sent into the world to propagate his kind he provides  himself with a successor and immediately quits his post to make room for him  hares hæredem alterius velut unda supervenit undam he does not seem born to enjoy life but to deliver it down to others this is not surprising to consider in animals which are formed for our use and can finish their business in a short life the silkworm after having spun her task lays her eggs and dies but a man can never have taken in his full measure of knowledge has not time to subdue his passions establish his soul in virtue and come up to the perfection of his nature before he is hurried off the stage would an infinitely wise being make such glorious creatures for so mean a purpose can he delight in the production of such abortive intelligences such shortlived reasonable beings would he give us talents that are not to be exerted capacities that are never to be gratified how can we find that wisdom which shines through all his works in the formation of man without looking on this world as only a nursery for the next and believing that the several generations of rational creatures which rise up and disappear in such quick successions are only to receive their first rudiments of existence here and afterwards to be transplanted into a more friendly climate where they may spread and flourish to all eternity  there is not in my opinion a more pleasing and triumphant consideration in religion than this of the perpetual progress which the soul makes towards the perfection of its nature without ever arriving at a period in it to look upon the soul as going on from strength to strength to consider that she is to shine for ever with new accessions of glory and brighten to all eternity that she will be still adding virtue to virtue and knowledge to knowledge carries in it something wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is natural to the mind of man nay it must be a prospect pleasing to god himself to see his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes and drawing nearer to him by greater degrees of resemblance  methinks this single consideration of the progress of a finite spirit to perfection will be sufficient to extinguish all envy in inferior natures and all contempt in superior that cherubim which now appears as a god to a human soul knows very well that the period will come about in eternity when the human soul shall be as perfect as he himself now is nay when she shall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as she now falls short of it it is true the higher nature still advances and by that means preserves his distance and superiority in the scale of being but he knows how high soever the station is of which he stands possessed at present the inferior nature will at length mount up to it and shine forth in the same degree of glory  with what astonishment and veneration may we look into our own souls where there are such hidden stores of virtue and knowledge such inexhausted sources of perfection we know not yet what we shall be nor will it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive the glory that will be always in reserve for him the soul considered with its creator is like one of those mathematical lines that may draw nearer to another for all eternity without a possibility of touching it  and can there be a thought so transporting as to consider ourselves in these perpetual approaches to him who is not only the standard of perfection but of happiness  l      footnote     and provide return to footnote mark   footnote     the asymptotes of the hyperbola return  contents contents p     no     monday july        addison      i am always very well pleased with a country sunday and think if keeping holy the seventh day were  only a human institution it would be the best method that could have been thought of for the polishing and civilizing of mankind it is certain the countrypeople would soon degenerate into a kind of savages and barbarians were there not such frequent returns of a stated time in which the whole village meet together with their best faces and in their cleanliest habits  to converse with one another upon indifferent subjects hear their duties explained to them and join together in adoration of the supreme being sunday clears away the rust of the whole week not only as it refreshes in their minds the notions of religion but as it puts both the sexes upon appearing in their most agreeable forms and exerting all such qualities as are apt to give them a figure in the eye of the village a countryfellow distinguishes himself as much in the churchyard as a citizen does upon the change the whole parishpoliticks being generally discussed in that place either after sermon or before the bell rings  my friend sir roger being a good churchman has beautified the inside of his church with several texts of his own chusing he has likewise given a handsome pulpitcloth and railed in the communiontable at his own expence he has often told me that at his coming to his estate he found his parishioners  very irregular and that in order to make them kneel and join in the responses he gave every one of them a hassock and a commonprayer book and at the same time employed an itinerant singingmaster who goes about the country for that purpose to instruct them rightly in the tunes of the psalms upon which they now very much value themselves and indeed outdo most of the country churches that i have ever heard  as sir roger is landlord to the whole congregation he keeps them in very good order and will suffer no body to sleep in it besides himself for if by chance he has been surprized into a short nap at sermon upon recovering out of it he stands up and looks about him and if he sees any body else nodding either wakes them himself or sends his servant to them several other of the old knights particularities break out upon these occasions sometimes he will be lengthening out a verse in the singingpsalms half a minute after the rest of the congregation have done with it sometimes when he is pleased with the matter of his devotion he pronounces amen three or four times to the same prayer and sometimes stands up when every body else is upon their knees to count the congregation or see if any of his tenants are missing  i was yesterday very much surprised to hear my old friend in the midst of the service calling out to one john matthews to mind what he was about and not disturb the congregation this john matthews it seems is remarkable for being an idle fellow and at that time was kicking his heels for his diversion this authority of the knight though exerted in that odd manner which accompanies him in all circumstances of life has a very good effect upon the parish who are not polite enough to see any thing ridiculous in his behaviour besides that the general good sense and worthiness of his character makes his friends observe these little singularities as foils that rather set off than blemish his good qualities  as soon as the sermon is finished no body presumes to stir till sir roger is gone out of the church the knight walks down from his seat in the chancel between a double row of his tenants that stand bowing to him on each side and every now and then enquires how such an ones wife or mother or son or father do whom he does not see at church which is understood as a secret reprimand to the person that is absent  the chaplain has often told me that upon a catechisingday when sir roger has been pleased with a boy that answers well he has ordered a bible to be given him next day for his encouragement and sometimes accompanies it with a flitch of bacon to his mother sir roger has likewise added five pounds a year to the clerks place and that he may encourage the young fellows to make themselves perfect in the churchservice has promised upon the death of the present incumbent who is very old to bestow it according to merit  the fair understanding between sir roger and his chaplain and their mutual concurrence in doing good is the more remarkable because the very next village is famous for the differences and contentions that rise between the parson and the squire who live in a perpetual state of war the parson is always preaching at the squire and the squire to be revenged on the parson never comes to church the squire has made all his tenants atheists and tithestealers while the parson instructs them every sunday in the dignity of his order and insinuates to them in almost every sermon that he is a better man than his patron in short matters are come to such an extremity that the squire has not said his prayers either in publick or private this half year and that the parson threatens him if he does not mend his manners to pray for him in the face of the whole congregation  feuds of this nature though too frequent in the country are very fatal to the ordinary people who are so used to be dazled with riches that they pay as much deference to the understanding of a man of

harent infixi pectore vultus  virg   in my first description of the company in which i pass most of my time it may be remembered that i mentioned a great affliction which my friend sir roger had met with in his youth which was no less than a disappointment in love it happened this evening that we fell into a very pleasing walk at a distance from his house as soon as we came into it it is quoth the good old man looking round him with a smile very hard that any part of my land should be settled upon one who has used me so ill as the perverse widow  did and yet i am sure i could not see a sprig of any bough of this whole walk of trees but i should reflect upon her and her severity she has certainly the finest hand of any woman in the world you are to know this was the place wherein i used to muse upon her and by that custom i can never come into it but the same tender sentiments revive in my mind as if i had actually walked with that beautiful creature under these shades i have been fool enough to carve her name on the bark of several of these trees so unhappy is the condition of men in love to attempt the removing of their passion by the methods which serve only to imprint it deeper she has certainly the finest hand of any woman in the world here followed a profound silence and i was not displeased to observe my friend falling so naturally into a discourse which i had ever before taken notice he industriously avoided after a very long pause he entered upon an account of this great circumstance in his life with an air which i thought raised my idea of him above what i had ever had before and gave me the picture of that chearful mind of his before it received that stroke which has ever since affected his words and actions but he went on as follows i came to my estate in my twenty second year and resolved to follow the steps of the most worthy of my ancestors who have inhabited this spot of earth before me in all the methods of hospitality and good neighbourhood for the sake of my fame and in country sports and recreations for the sake of my health in my twenty third year i was obliged to serve as sheriff of the county and in my servants officers and whole equipage indulged the pleasure of a young man who did not think ill of his own person in taking that publick occasion of shewing my figure and behaviour to advantage you may easily imagine to yourself what appearance i made who am pretty tall rid  well and was very well dressed at the head of a whole county with musick before me a feather in my hat and my horse well bitted i can assure you i was not a little pleased with the kind looks and glances i had from all the balconies and windows as i rode to the hall where the assizes were held but when i came there a beautiful creature in a widows habit sat in court to hear the event of a cause concerning her dower this commanding creature who was born for destruction of all who behold her put on such a resignation in her countenance and bore the whispers of all around the court with such a pretty uneasiness i warrant you and then recovered her self from one eye to another till she was perfectly confused by meeting something so wistful in all she encountered that at last with a murrain to her she cast her bewitching eye upon me i no sooner met it but i bowed like a great surprized booby and knowing her cause to be the first which came on i cried like a captivated calf as i was make way for the defendants witnesses this sudden partiality made all the county immediately see the sheriff also was become a slave to the fine widow during the time her cause was upon tryal she behaved herself i warrant you with such a deep attention to her business took opportunities to have little billets handed to her council then would be in such a pretty confusion occasioned you must know by acting before so much company that not only i but the whole court was prejudiced in her favour and all that the next heir to her husband had to urge was thought so groundless and frivolous that when it came to her council to reply there was not half so much said as every one besides in the court thought he could have urged to her advantage you must understand sir this perverse woman is one of those unaccountable creatures that secretly rejoice in the admiration of men but indulge themselves in no further consequences hence it is that she has ever had a train of admirers and she removes from her slaves in town to those in the country according to the seasons of the year she is a reading lady and far gone in the pleasures of friendship she is always accompanied by a confident who is witness to her daily protestations against our sex and consequently a bar to her first steps towards love upon the strength of her own maxims and declarations  however i must needs say this accomplished mistress of mine has distinguished me above the rest and has been known to declare sir roger de coverley was the tamest and most human of all the brutes in the country i was told she said so by one who thought he rallied me but upon the strength of this slender encouragement of being thought least detestable i made new liveries new paired my coachhorses sent them all to town to be bitted and taught to throw their legs well and move all together before i pretended to cross the country and wait upon her as soon as i thought my retinue suitable to the character of my fortune and youth i set out from hence to make my addresses the particular skill of this lady has ever been to inflame your wishes and yet command respect to make her mistress of this art she has a greater share of knowledge wit and good sense than is usual even among men of merit then she is beautiful beyond the race of women if you wont let her go on with a certain artifice with her eyes and the skill of beauty she will arm her self with her real charms and strike you with admiration instead of desire it is certain that if you were to behold the whole woman there is that dignity in her aspect that composure in her motion that complacency in her manner that if her form makes you hope her merit makes you fear but then again she is such a desperate scholar that no countrygentleman can approach her without being a jest as i was going to tell you when i came to her house i was admitted to her presence with great civility at the same time she placed her self to be first seen by me in such an attitude as i think you call the posture of a picture that she discovered new charms and i at last came towards her with such an awe as made me speechless this she no sooner observed but she made her advantage of it and began a discourse to me concerning love and honour as they both are followed by pretenders and the real votaries to them when she had discussed these points in a discourse which i verily believe was as learned as the best philosopher in europe could possibly make she asked me whether she was so happy as to fall in with my sentiments on these important particulars her confident sat by her and upon my being in the last confusion and silence this malicious aid of hers turning to her says i am very glad to observe sir roger pauses upon this subject and seems resolved to deliver all his sentiments upon the matter when he pleases to speak they both kept their countenances and after i had sat half an hour meditating how to behave before such profound casuists i rose up and took my leave chance has since that time thrown me very often in her way and she as often has directed a discourse to me which i do not understand this barbarity has kept me ever at a distance from the most beautiful object my eyes ever beheld it is thus also she deals with all mankind and you must make love to her as you would conquer the sphinx by posing her but were she like other women and that there were any talking to her how constant must the pleasure of that man be who could converse with a creature — but after all you may be sure her heart is fixed on some one or other and yet i have been credibly informd but who can believe half that is said after she had done speaking to me she put her hand to her bosom and adjusted her tucker then she cast her eyes a little down upon my beholding her too earnestly they say she sings excellently her voice in her ordinary speech has something in it inexpressibly sweet you must know i dined with her at a publick table the day after i first saw her and she helped me to some tansy in the eye of all the gentlemen in the country she has certainly the finest hand of any woman in the world i can assure you sir were you to behold her you would be in the same condition for as her speech is musick her form is angelick but i find i grow irregular while i am talking of her but indeed it would be stupidity to be unconcerned at such perfection oh the excellent creature she is as inimitable to all women as she is inaccessible to all men i found my friend begin to rave and insensibly led him towards the house that we might be joined by some other company and am convinced that the widow is the secret cause of all that inconsistency which appears in some parts of my

there is a pretending behaviour in both cases which instead of making men esteemed renders them both miserable and contemptible we had yesterday at sir rogers a set of country gentlemen who dined with him and after dinner the glass was taken by those who pleased pretty plentifully among others i observed a person of a tolerable good aspect who seemed to be more greedy of liquor than any of the company and yet methought he did not taste it with delight as he grew warm he was suspicious of every thing that was said and as he advanced towards being fudled his humour grew worse at the same time his bitterness seemd to be rather an inward dissatisfaction in his own mind than any dislike he had taken at the company upon hearing his name i knew him to be a gentle man of a considerable fortune in this county but greatly in debt what gives the unhappy man this peevishness of spirit is that his estate is dipped and is eating out with usury and yet he has not the heart to sell any part of it his proud stomach at the cost of restless nights constant inquietudes danger of affronts and a thousand nameless inconveniences preserves this canker in his fortune rather than it shall be said he is a man of fewer hundreds a year than he has been commonly reputed thus he endures the torment of poverty to avoid the name of being less rich if you go to his house you see great plenty but served in a manner that shews it is all unnatural and that the masters mind is not at home there is a certain waste and carelessness in the air of every thing and the whole appears but a covered indigence a magnificent poverty that neatness and chearfulness which attends the table of him who lives within compass is wanting and exchanged for a libertine way of service in all about him  this gentlemans conduct tho a very common way of management is as ridiculous as that officers would be who had but few men under his command and should take the charge of an extent of country rather than of a small pass to pay for personate and keep in a mans hands a greater estate than he really has is of all others the most unpardonable vanity and must in the end reduce the man who is guilty of it to dishonour yet if we look round us in any county of great britain we shall see many in this fatal error if that may be called by so soft a name which proceeds from a false shame of appearing what they really are when the contrary behaviour would in a short time advance them to the condition which they pretend to  laertes has fifteen hundred pounds a year which is mortgaged for six thousand pounds but it is impossible to convince him that if he sold as much as would pay off that debt he would save four shillings in the pound  which he gives for the vanity of being the reputed master of it yet  if laertes did this he would perhaps be easier in his own fortune but then irus a fellow of yesterday who has but twelve hundred a year would be his equal rather than this shall be laertes goes on to bring wellborn beggars into the world and every twelvemonth charges his estate with at least one years rent more by the birth of a child  laertes and irus are neighbours whose way of living are an abomination to each other irus is moved by the fear of poverty and laertes by the shame of it though the motive of action is of so near affinity in both and may be resolved into this that to each of them poverty is the greatest of all evils yet are their manners very widely different shame of poverty makes laertes launch into unnecessary equipage vain expense and lavish entertainments fear of poverty makes irus allow himself only plain necessaries appear without a servant sell his own corn attend his labourers and be himself a labourer shame of poverty makes laertes go every day a step nearer to it and fear of poverty stirs up irus to make every day some further progress from it  these different motives produce the excesses of which men are guilty of in the negligence of and provision for themselves usury stockjobbing extortion and oppression have their seed in the dread of want and vanity riot and prodigality from the shame of it but both these excesses are infinitely below the pursuit of a reasonable creature after we have taken care to command so much as is necessary for maintaining our selves in the order of men suitable to our character the care of superfluities is a vice no less extravagant than the neglect of necessaries would have been before  certain it is that they are both out of nature when she is followed with reason and good sense it is from this reflection that i always read mr cowley with the greatest pleasure his magnanimity is as much above that of other considerable men as his understanding and it is a true distinguishing spirit in the elegant author who published his works  to dwell so much upon the temper of his mind and the moderation of his desires by this means he has renderd his friend as amiable as famous that state of life which bears the face of poverty with mr cowleys great vulgar is admirably described and it is no small satisfaction to those of the same turn of desire that he produces the authority of the wisest men of the best age of the world to strengthen his opinion of the ordinary pursuits of mankind  it would methinks be no ill maxim of life if according to that ancestor of sir roger whom i lately mentioned every man would point to himself what sum he would resolve not to exceed he might by this means cheat himself into a tranquility on this side of that expectation or convert what he should get above it to nobler uses than his own pleasures or necessities this temper of mind would exempt a man from an ignorant envy of restless men above him and a more inexcusable contempt of happy men below him this would be sailing by some compass living with some design but to be eternally bewildered in prospects of future gain and putting on unnecessary armour against improbable blows of fortune is a mechanick being which has not good sense for its direction but is carried on by a sort of acquired instinct towards things below our consideration and unworthy our esteem it is possible that the tranquility i now enjoy at sir rogers may have created in me this way of thinking which is so abstracted from the common relish of the world but as i am now in a pleasing arbour surrounded with a beautiful landskip i find no inclination so strong as to continue in these mansions so remote from the ostentatious scenes of life and am at this present writing philosopher enough to conclude

sit mens sana in corpore sano  juv   bodily labour is of two kinds either that which a man submits to for his livelihood or that which he undergoes for his pleasure the latter of them generally changes the name of labour for that of exercise but differs only from ordinary labour as it rises from another motive  a country life abounds in both these kinds of labour and for that reason gives a man a greater stock of health and consequently a more perfect enjoyment of himself than any other way of life i consider the body as a system of tubes and glands or to use a more rustick phrase a bundle of pipes and strainers fitted to one another after so wonderful a manner as to make a proper engine for the soul to work with this description does not only comprehend the bowels bones tendons veins nerves and arteries but every muscle and every ligature which is a composition of fibres that are so many imperceptible tubes or pipes interwoven on all sides with invisible glands or strainers  this general idea of a human body without considering it in its niceties of anatomy lets us see how absolutely necessary labour is for the right preservation of it there must be frequent motions and agitations to mix digest and separate the juices contained in it as well as to clear and cleanse that infinitude of pipes and strainers of which it is composed and to give their solid parts a more firm and lasting tone labour or exercise ferments the humours casts them into their proper channels throws off redundancies and helps nature in those secret distributions without which the body cannot subsist in its vigour nor the soul act with chearfulness  i might here mention the effects which this has upon all the faculties of the mind by keeping the understanding clear the imagination untroubled and refining those spirits that are necessary for the proper exertion of our intellectual faculties during the present laws of union between soul and body it is to a neglect in this particular that we must ascribe the spleen which is so frequent in men of studious and sedentary tempers as well as the vapours to which those of the other sex are so often subject  had not exercise been absolutely necessary for our wellbeing nature would not have made the body so proper for it by giving such an activity to the limbs and such a pliancy to every part as necessarily produce those compressions extentions contortions dilatations and all other kinds of motions  that are necessary for the preservation of such a system of tubes and glands as has been before mentioned and that we might not want inducements to engage us in such an exercise of the body as is proper for its welfare it is so ordered that nothing valuable can be procured without it not to mention riches and honour even food and raiment are not to be come at without the toil of the hands and sweat of the brows providence furnishes materials but expects that we should work them up our selves the earth must be laboured before it gives its encrease and when it is forced into its several products how many hands must they pass through before they are fit for use manufactures trade and agriculture naturally employ more than nineteen parts of the species in twenty and as for those who are not obliged to labour by the condition in which they are born they are more miserable than the rest of mankind unless they indulge themselves in that voluntary labour which goes by the name of exercise  my friend sir roger has been an indefatigable man in business of this kind and has hung several parts of his house with the trophies of his former labours the walls of his great hall are covered with the horns of several kinds of deer that he has killed in the chace which he thinks the most valuable furniture of his house as they afford him frequent topicks of discourse and shew that he has not been idle at the lower end of the hall is a large otters skin stuffed with hay which his mother ordered to be hung up in that manner and the knight looks upon with great satisfaction because it seems he was but nine years old when his dog killed him a little room adjoining to the hall is a kind of arsenal filled with guns of several sizes and inventions with which the knight has made great havock in the woods and destroyed many thousands of pheasants partridges and woodcocks his stable doors are patched with noses that belonged to foxes of the knights own hunting down sir roger shewed me one of them that for distinction sake has a brass nail struck through it which cost him about fifteen hours riding carried him through half a dozen counties killed him a brace of geldings and lost above half his dogs this the knight looks upon as one of the greatest exploits of his life the perverse widow whom i have given some account of was the death of several foxes for sir roger has told me that in the course of his amours he patched the western door of his stable whenever the widow was cruel the foxes were sure to pay for it in proportion as his passion for the widow abated and old age came on he left off foxhunting but a hare is not yet safe that sits within ten miles of his house  there is no kind of exercise which i would so recommend to my readers of both sexes as this of riding as there is none which so much conduces to health and is every way accommodated to the body according to the idea which i have given of it doctor sydenham is very lavish in its praises and if the english reader will see the mechanical effects of it describd at length he may find them in a book published not many years since under the title of medicina gymnastica  for my own part when i am in town for want of these opportunities i exercise myself an hour every morning upon a dumb bell that is placed in a corner of my room and pleases me the more because it does every thing i require of it in the most profound silence my landlady and her daughters are so well acquainted with my hours of exercise that they never come into my room to disturb me whilst i am ringing  when i was some years younger than i am at present i used to employ myself in a more laborious diversion which i learned from a latin treatise of exercises that is written with great erudition  it is there called the skiomachia or the fighting with a mans own shadow and consists in the brandishing of two short sticks grasped in each hand and loaden with plugs of lead at either end this opens the chest exercises the limbs and gives a man all the pleasure of boxing without the blows i could wish that several learned men would lay out that time which they employ in controversies and disputes about nothing in this method of fighting with their own shadows it might conduce very much to evaporate the spleen which makes them uneasy to the publick as well as to themselves  to conclude as i am a compound of soul and body i consider myself as obliged to a double scheme of duties and i think i have not fulfilled the business of the

searched into human nature observe that nothing so much shews the nobleness of the soul as that its felicity consists in action every man has such an active principle in him that he will find out something to employ himself upon in whatever place or state of life he is posted i have heard of a gentleman who was under close confinement in the bastile seven years during which time he amused himself in scattering a few small pins about his chamber gathering them up again and placing them in different figures on the arm of a great chair he often told his friends afterwards that unless he had found out this piece of exercise he verily believed he should have lost his senses  after what has been said i need not inform my readers that sir roger with whose character i hope they are at present pretty well acquainted has in his youth gone through the whole course of those rural diversions which the country abounds in and which seem to be extreamly well suited to that laborious industry a man may observe here in a far greater degree than in towns and cities i have before hinted at some of my friends exploits he has in his youthful days taken forty coveys of partridges in a season and tired many a salmon with a line consisting but of a single hair the constant thanks and good wishes of the neighbourhood always attended him on account of his remarkable enmity towards foxes having destroyed more of those vermin in one year than it was thought the whole country could have produced indeed the knight does not scruple to own among his most intimate friends that in order to establish his reputation this way he has secretly sent for great numbers of them out of other counties which he used to turn loose about the country by night that he might the better signalize himself in their destruction the next day his huntinghorses were the finest and best managed in all these parts his tenants are still full of the praises of a grey stonehorse that unhappily staked himself several years since and was buried with great solemnity in the orchard  sir roger being at present too old for foxhunting to keep himself in action has disposed of his beagles and got a pack of stophounds what these want in speed he endeavours to make amends for by the deepness of their mouths and the variety of their notes which are suited in such manner to each other that the whole cry makes up a compleat consort  he is so nice in this particular that a gentleman having made him a present of a very fine hound the other day the knight returned it by the servant with a great many expressions of civility but desired him to tell his master that the dog he had sent was indeed a most excellent base but that at present he only wanted a countertenor could i believe my friend had ever read shakespear i should certainly conclude he had taken the hint from theseus in the midsummer nights dream  my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flud so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crookkneed and dewlapd like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but matchd in mouths like bells each under each a cry more tuneable was never hallowed to nor cheard with horn sir roger is so keen at this sport that he has been out almost every day since i came down and upon the chaplains offering to lend me his easy pad i was prevailed on yesterday morning to make one of the company i was extremely pleased as we rid along to observe the general benevolence of all the neighbourhood towards my friend the farmers sons thought themselves happy if they could open a gate for the good old knight as he passed by which he generally requited with a nod or a smile and a kind enquiry after their fathers and uncles  after we had rid about a mile from home we came upon a large heath and the sportsmen began to beat they had done so for some time when as i was at a little distance from the rest of the company i saw a hare pop out from a small furzebrake almost under my horses feet i marked the way she took which i endeavoured to make the company sensible of by extending my arm but to no purpose till sir roger who knows that none of my extraordinary motions are insignificant rode up to me and asked me if puss was gone that way upon my answering yes he immediately called in the dogs and put them upon the scent as they were going off i heard one of the countryfellows muttering to his companion that twas a wonder they had not lost all their sport for want of the silent gentlemans crying stole away  this with my aversion to leaping hedges made me withdraw to a rising ground from whence i could have the picture of the whole chace without the fatigue of keeping in with the hounds the hare immediately threw them above a mile behind her but i was pleased to find that instead of running straight forwards or in hunters language flying the country as i was afraid she might have done she wheeld about and described a sort of circle round the hill where i had taken my station in such manner as gave me a very distinct view of the sport i could see her first pass by and the dogs some time afterwards unravelling the whole track she had made and following her thro all her doubles i was at the same time delighted in observing that deference which the rest of the pack paid to each particular hound according to the character he had acquired amongst them if they were at fault and an old hound of reputation opened but once he was immediately followed by the whole cry while a raw dog or one who was a noted liar might have yelped his heart out without being taken notice of  the hare now after having squatted two or three times and been put up again as often came still nearer to the place where she was at first started the dogs pursued her and these were followed by the jolly knight who rode upon a white gelding encompassed by his tenants and servants and chearing his hounds with all the gaiety of five and twenty one of the sportsmen rode up to me and told me that he was sure the chace was almost at an end because the old dogs which had hitherto lain behind now headed the pack the fellow was in the right our hare took a large field just under us followed by the full cry in view i must confess the brightness of the weather the chearfulness of everything around me the chiding of the hounds which was returned upon us in a double eccho from two neighbouring hills with the hallowing of the sportsmen and the sounding of the horn lifted my spirits into a most lively pleasure which i freely indulged because i was sure it was innocent if i was under any concern it was on the account of the poor hare that was now quite spent and almost within the reach of her enemies when the huntsman getting forward threw down his pole before the dogs they were now within eight yards of that game which they had been pursuing for almost as many hours yet on the signal beforementioned they all made a sudden stand and tho they continued opening as much as before durst not once attempt to pass beyond the pole at the same time sir roger rode forward and alighting took up the hare in his arms which he soon delivered up to one of his servants with an order if she could be kept alive to let her go in his great orchard where it seems he has several of these prisoners of war who live together in a very comfortable captivity i was highly pleased to see the discipline of the pack and the goodnature of the knight who could not find in his heart to murther a creature that had given him so much diversion  as we were returning home i remembred that monsieur paschal in his most excellent discourse on the misery of man tells us that all our endeavours after greatness proceed from nothing but a desire of being surrounded by a multitude of persons and affairs that may hinder us from looking into our selves which is a view we cannot bear he afterwards goes on to shew that our love of sports comes from the same reason and is particularly severe upon hunting what says he unless it be to drown thought can make men throw away so much time and pains upon a silly animal which they might buy cheaper in the market the foregoing reflection is certainly just when a man suffers his whole mind to be drawn into his sports and altogether loses himself in the woods but does not affect those who propose a far more laudable end from this exercise i mean the preservation of health and keeping all the organs of the soul in a condition to execute her orders had that incomparable person whom i last quoted been a little more indulgent to himself in this point the world might probably have enjoyed him much longer whereas thro too great an application to his studies in his youth he contracted that ill habit of body which after a tedious sickness carried him oft in the fortieth year of his age  and the whole history we have of his life till that time is but one continued account of the behaviour of a noble soul struggling under innumerable pains and distempers  for my own part i intend to hunt twice a week during my stay with sir roger and shall prescribe the moderate use of this exercise to all my country friends as

such an intercourse and commerce with evil spirits as that which we express by the name of witchcraft but when i consider that the ignorant and credulous parts of the world abound most in these relations and that the persons among us who are supposed to engage in such an infernal commerce are people of a weak understanding and a crazed imagination and at the same time reflect upon the many impostures and delusions of this nature that have been detected in all ages i endeavour to suspend my belief till i hear more certain accounts than any which have yet come to my knowledge in short when i consider the question whether there are such persons in the world as those we call witches my mind is divided between the two opposite opinions or rather to speak my thoughts freely i believe in general that there is and has been such a thing as witchcraft but at the same time can give no credit to any particular instance of it  i am engaged in this speculation by some occurrences that i met with yesterday which i shall give my reader an account of at large as i was walking with my friend sir roger by the side of one of his woods an old woman applied herself to me for my charity her dress and figure put me in mind of the following description in otway  in a close lane as i pursued my journey i spyd a wrinkled hag with age grown double picking dry sticks and mumbling to her self her eyes with scalding rheum were galld and red cold palsy shook her head her hands seemd witherd and on her crooked shoulders had she wrapd the tatterd remnants of an old striped hanging which served to keep her carcase from the cold so there was nothing of a piece about her her lower weeds were all oer coarsly patchd with diffrentcolourd rags black red white yellow and seemd to speak variety of wretchedness  as i was musing on this description and comparing it with the object before me the knight told me  that this very old woman had the reputation of a witch all over the country that her lips were observed to be always in motion and that there was not a switch about her house which her neighbours did not believe had carried her several hundreds of miles if she chanced to stumble they always found sticks or straws that lay in the figure of a cross before her if she made any mistake at church and cryed amen in a wrong place they never failed to conclude that she was saying her prayers backwards there was not a maid in the parish that would take a pin of her though she would offer a bag of mony with it she goes by the name of moll white and has made the country ring with several imaginary exploits which are palmed upon her if the dairy maid does not make her butter come so soon as she should have it moll white is at the bottom of the churn if a horse sweats in the stable moll white has been upon his back if a hare makes an unexpected escape from the hounds the huntsman curses moll white nay says sir roger i have known the master of the pack upon such an occasion send one of his servants to see if moll white had been out that morning  this account raised my curiosity so far that i begged my friend sir roger to go with me into her hovel which stood in a solitary corner under the side of the wood upon our first entering sir roger winked to me and pointed at something that stood behind the door which upon looking that way i found to be an old broomstaff at the same time he whispered me in the ear to take notice of a tabby cat that sat in the chimneycorner which as the old knight told me lay under as bad a report as moll white her self for besides that moll is said often to accompany her in the same shape the cat is reported to have spoken twice or thrice in her life and to have played several pranks above the capacity of an ordinary cat  i was secretly concerned to see human nature in so much wretchedness and disgrace but at the same time could not forbear smiling to hear sir roger who is a little puzzled about the old woman advising her as a justice of peace to avoid all communication with the devil and never to hurt any of her neighbours cattle we concluded our visit with a bounty which was very acceptable  in our return home sir roger told me that old moll had been often brought before him for making children spit pins and giving maids the nightmare and that the country people would be tossing her into a pond and trying experiments with her every day if it was not for him and his chaplain  i have since found upon enquiry that sir roger was several times staggered with the reports that had been brought him concerning this old woman and would frequently have bound her over to the county sessions had not his chaplain with much ado perswaded him to the contrary   i have been the more particular in this account because i hear there is scarce a village in england that has not a moll white in it when an old woman begins to doat and grow chargeable to a parish she is generally turned into a witch and fills the whole country with extravagant fancies imaginary distempers and terrifying dreams in the mean time the poor wretch that is the innocent occasion of so many evils begins to be frighted at her self and sometimes confesses secret commerce and familiarities that her imagination forms in a delirious old age this frequently cuts off charity from the greatest objects of compassion and inspires people with a malevolence towards those poor decrepid parts of our species in whom human nature is defaced by infirmity and dotage  l      footnote     ottway which i could not forbear repeating on this occasion return to footnote mark   footnote     orphan act ii chamont to monimia return   footnote     the knight told me upon hearing the description return   footnote    when this essay was written charges were being laid against one old woman jane wenham of walkerne a little village north of hertford which led to her trial for witchcraft at assizes held in the following year      when she was found guilty and became memorable as the last person who in this country was condemned to capital punishment for that impossible offence the judge got first a reprieve and then a pardon the lawyers had refused to draw up any indictment against the poor old creature except in mockery for conversing familiarly with the devil in form of a cat but of that offence she was found guilty upon the testimony of sixteen witnesses three of whom were clergymen one witness anne thorne testified that every night the pins went from her pincushion into her mouth others gave evidence that they had seen pins come jumping through the air into anne thornes mouth two swore that they had heard the prisoner in the shape of a cat converse with the devil he being also in form of a cat anne thorne swore that she was tormented exceedingly with cats and that all the cats had the face and voice of the witch the vicar of ardeley had tested the poor ignorant creature with the lords prayer and finding that she could not repeat it had terrified her with his moral tortures into some sort of confession such things then were said and done and such credulity was abetted even by educated men at the time when this essay was written upon charges like those ridiculed in the text a woman actually was a few months later not only committed by justices with a less judicious spiritual counsellor than sir rogers

is surrounded with so many pleasing walks which are struck out of a wood in the midst of which the house stands that one can hardly ever be weary of rambling from one labyrinth of delight to another to one used to live in a city the charms of the country are so exquisite that the mind is lost in a certain transport which raises us above ordinary life and is yet not strong enough to be inconsistent with tranquility this state of mind was i in ravished with the murmur of waters the whisper of breezes the singing of birds and whether i looked up to the heavens down on the earth or turned to the prospects around me still struck with new sense of pleasure when i found by the voice of my friend who walked by me that we had insensibly stroled into the grove sacred to the widow this woman says he is of all others the most unintelligible she either designs to marry or she does not what is the most perplexing of all is that she doth not either say to her lovers she has any resolution against that condition of life in general or that she banishes them but conscious of her own merit she permits their addresses without fear of any ill consequence or want of respect from their rage or despair she has that in her aspect against which it is impossible to offend a man whose thoughts are constantly bent upon so agreeable an object must be excused if the ordinary occurrences in conversation are below his attention i call her indeed perverse but alas why do i call her so because her superior merit is such that i cannot approach her without awe that my heart is checked by too much esteem i am angry that her charms are not more accessible that i am more inclined to worship than salute her how often have i wished her unhappy that i might have an opportunity of serving her and how often troubled in that very imagination at giving her the pain of being obliged well i have led a miserable life in secret upon her account but fancy she would have condescended to have some regard for me if it had not been for that watchful animal her confident  of all persons under the sun continued he calling me by my name be sure to set a mark upon confidents they are of all people the most impertinent what is most pleasant to observe in them is that they assume to themselves the merit of the persons whom they have in their custody orestilla is a great fortune and in wonderful danger of surprizes therefore full of suspicions of the least indifferent thing particularly careful of new acquaintance and of growing too familiar with the old themista her favouritewoman is every whit as careful of whom she speaks to and what she says let the ward be a beauty her confident shall treat you with an air of distance let her be a fortune and she assumes the suspicious behaviour of her friend and patroness thus it is that very many of our unmarried women of distinction are to all intents and purposes married except the consideration of different sexes they are directly under the conduct of their whisperer and think they are in a state of freedom while they can prate with one of these attendants of all men in general and still avoid the man they most like

the sound till we came to a close thicket on the other side of which we saw a young woman sitting as it were in a personated sullenness just over a transparent fountain opposite to her stood mr william sir rogers master of the game the knight whispered me hist these are lovers the huntsman looking earnestly at the shadow of the young maiden in the stream oh thou dear picture if thou couldst remain there in the absence of that fair creature whom you represent in the water how willingly could i stand here satisfied for ever without troubling my dear betty herself with any mention of her unfortunate william whom she is angry with but alas when she pleases to be gone thou wilt also vanish — yet let me talk to thee while thou dost stay tell my dearest betty thou dost not more depend upon her than does her william her absence will make away with me as well as thee if she offers to remove thee ill jump into these waves to lay hold on thee her self her own dear person i must never embrace again — still do you hear me without one smile — it is too much to bear —  he had no sooner spoke these words but he made an offer of throwing himself into the water at which his mistress started up and at the next instant he jumped across the fountain and met her in an embrace she half recovering from her fright said in the most charming voice imaginable and with a tone of complaint i thought how well you would drown yourself no no you wont drown yourself till you have taken your leave of susan holliday the huntsman with a tenderness that spoke the most passionate love and with his

putavi stultus ego huic nostræ similem   virg   the first and most obvious reflections which arise in a man who changes the city for the country are upon the different manners of the people whom he meets with in those two different scenes of life by manners i do not mean morals but behaviour and good breeding as they shew themselves in the town and in the country  and here in the first place i must observe a very great revolution that has happend in this article of good breeding several obliging deferences condescensions and submissions with many outward forms and ceremonies that accompany them were first of all brought up among the politer part of mankind who lived in courts and cities and distinguished themselves from the rustick part of the species who on all occasions acted bluntly and naturally by such a mutual complaisance and intercourse of civilities these forms of conversation by degrees multiplied and grew troublesome the modish world found too great a constraint in them and have therefore thrown most of them aside conversation like the romish religion was so encumbered with show and ceremony that it stood in need of a reformation to retrench its superfluities and restore it to its natural good sense and beauty at present therefore an unconstrained carriage and a certain openness of behaviour are the height of good breeding the fashionable world is grown free and easie our manners sit more loose upon us nothing is so modish as an agreeable negligence in a word good breeding shews it self most where to an ordinary eye it appears the least  if after this we look on the people of mode in the country we find in them the manners of the last age they have no sooner fetched themselves up to the fashion of the polite world but the town has dropped them and are nearer to the first state of nature than to those refinements which formerly reignd in the court and still prevail in the country one may now know a man that never conversed in the world by his excess of good breeding a polite country squire shall make you as many bows in half an hour as would serve a courtier for a week there is infinitely more to do about place and precedency in a meeting of justices wives than in an assembly of dutchesses  this rural politeness is very troublesome to a man of my temper who generally take the chair that is next me and walk first or last in the front or in the rear as chance directs i have known my friend sir rogers dinner almost cold before the company could adjust the ceremonial and be prevailed upon to sit down and have heartily pitied my old friend when i have seen him forced to pick and cull his guests as they sat at the several parts of his table that he might drink their healths according to their respective ranks and qualities honest will wimble who i should have thought had been altogether uninfected with ceremony gives me abundance of trouble in this particular though he has been fishing all the morning he will not help himself at dinner till i am served when we are going out of the hall he runs behind me and last night as we were walking in the fields stopped short at a stile till i came up to it and upon my making signs to him to get over told me with a serious smile that sure i believed they had no manners in the country  there has happened another revolution in the point of good breeding which relates to the conversation among men of mode and which i cannot but look upon as very extraordinary it was certainly one of the first distinctions of a wellbred man to express every thing that had the most remote appearance of being obscene in modest terms and distant phrases whilst the clown who had no such delicacy of conception and expression clothed his ideas in those plain homely terms that are the most obvious and natural this kind of good manners was perhaps carried to an excess so as to make conversation too stiff formal and precise for which reason as hypocrisy in one age is generally succeeded by atheism in another conversation is in a great measure relapsed into the first extream so that at present several of our men of the town and particularly those who have been polished in france make use of the most coarse uncivilized words in our language and utter themselves often in such a manner as a clown would blush to hear  this infamous piece of good breeding which reigns among the coxcombs of the town has not yet made its way into the country and as it is impossible for such an irrational way of conversation to last long among a people that make any profession of religion or show of modesty if the country gentlemen get into it they will certainly be left in the lurch their goodbreeding will come too late to them and they will be thought a parcel of lewd clowns while they fancy themselves talking together like men of wit and pleasure  as the two points of good breeding which i have hitherto insisted upon regard behaviour and conversation there is a third which turns upon dress in this too the country are very much behindhand the rural beaus are not yet got out of the fashion that took place at the time of the revolution but ride about the country in red coats and laced hats while the women in many parts are still trying to outvie one another in the height of their headdresses  but a friend of mine who is now upon the western circuit having promised to give me an account of the several modes and fashions that prevail in the different parts of the nation through which he passes i shall defer the enlarging upon this last topick till i have received a letter from him which i expect every post  l  contents contents p     no   0 wednesday july         addison    equidem credo quia sit divinitus illis ingenium   virg   my friend sir roger is very often merry with me upon my passing so much of my time among his poultry he has caught me twice or thrice looking after a birds nest and several times sitting an hour or two together near an hen and chickens he tells me he believes i am personally acquainted with every fowl about his house calls such a particular cock my favourite and frequently complains that his ducks and geese have more of my company than himself  i must confess i am infinitely delighted with those speculations of nature which are to be made in a countrylife and as my reading has very much lain among books of natural history i cannot forbear recollecting upon this occasion the several remarks which i have met with in authors and comparing them with what falls under my own observation the arguments for providence drawn from the natural history of animals being in my opinion demonstrative  the make of every kind of animal is different from that of every other kind and yet there is not the least turn in the muscles or twist in the fibres of any one which does not render them more proper for that particular animals way of life than any other cast or texture of them would have been  the most violent appetites in all creatures are lust and hunger the first is a perpetual call upon them to propagate their kind the latter to preserve themselves  it is astonishing to consider the different degrees of care that descend from the parent to the young so far as is absolutely necessary for the leaving a posterity some creatures cast their eggs as chance directs them and think of them no farther as insects and several kinds of fish others of a nicer frame find out proper beds to deposite  them in and there leave them as the serpent the crocodile and ostrich others hatch their eggs and tend the birth till it is able to shift for it self  what can we call the principle which directs every different kind of bird to observe a particular plan in the structure of its nest and directs all of the same species to work after the same model it cannot be imitation for though you hatch a crow under a hen and never let it see any of the works of its own kind the nest it makes shall be the same to the laying of a stick with all the other nests of the same species it cannot be reason for were animals indued with it to as great a degree as man their buildings would be as different as ours according to the different conveniences that they would propose to themselves  is it not remarkable that the same temper of weather which raises this genial warmth in animals should cover the trees with leaves and the fields with grass for their security and concealment and produce such infinite swarms of insects for the support and sustenance of their respective broods  is it not wonderful that the love of the parent should be so violent while it lasts and that it should last no longer than is necessary for the preservation of the young  the violence of this natural love is exemplifyd by a very barbarous experiment which i shall quote at length as i find it in an excellent author and hope my readers will pardon the mentioning such an instance of cruelty because there is nothing can so effectually shew the strength of that principle in animals of which i am here speaking a person who was well skilled in dissection opened a bitch and as she lay in the most exquisite tortures offered her one of her young puppies which she immediately fell a licking and for the time seemed insensible of her own pain on the removal she kept her eye fixt on it and began a wailing sort of cry which seemed rather to proceed from the loss of her young one than the sense of her own torments  but notwithstanding this natural love in brutes is much more violent and intense than in rational creatures providence has taken care that it should be no longer troublesome to the parent than it is useful to the young for so soon as the wants of the latter cease the mother withdraws her fondness and leaves them to provide for themselves and what is a very remarkable circumstance in this part of instinct we find that the love of the parent may be lengthened out beyond its usual time if the preservation of the species requires it as we may see in birds that drive away their young as soon as they are able to get their livelihood but continue to feed them if they are tied to the nest or confined within a cage or by any other means appear to be out of a condition of supplying their own necessities  this natural love is not observed in animals to ascend from the young to the parent which is not at all necessary for the continuance of the species nor indeed in reasonable creatures does it rise in any proportion as it spreads it self downwards for in all family affection we find protection granted and favours bestowed are greater motives to love and tenderness than safety benefits or life received  one would wonder to hear sceptical men disputing for the reason of animals and telling us it is only our pride and prejudices that will not allow them the use of that faculty  reason shews it self in all occurrences of life whereas the brute makes no discovery of such a talent but in what immediately regards his own preservation or the continuance of his species animals in their generation are wiser than the sons of men but their wisdom is confined to a few particulars and lies in a very narrow compass take a brute out of his instinct and you find him wholly deprived of understanding to use an instance that comes often under observation  with what caution does the hen provide herself a nest in places unfrequented and free from noise and disturbance when she has laid her eggs in such a manner that she can cover them what care does she take in turning them frequently that all parts may partake of the vital warmth when she leaves them to provide for her necessary sustenance how punctually does she return before they have time to cool and become incapable of producing an animal in the summer you see her giving her self greater freedoms and quitting her care for above two hours together but in winter when the rigour of the season would chill the principles of life and destroy the young one she grows more assiduous in her attendance and stays away but half the time when the birth approaches with how much nicety and attention does she help the chick to break its prison not to take notice of her covering it from the injuries of the weather providing it proper nourishment and teaching it to help it self nor to mention her forsaking the nest if after the usual time of reckoning the young one does not make its appearance a chymical operation could not be followed with greater art or diligence than is seen in the hatching of a chick tho there are many other birds that shew an infinitely greater sagacity in all the forementioned particulars  but at the same time the hen that has all this seeming ingenuity which is indeed absolutely necessary for the propagation of the species considered in other respects is without the least glimmerings of thought or common sense she mistakes a piece of chalk for an egg and sits upon it in the same manner she is insensible of any increase or diminution in the number of those she lays she does not distinguish between her own and those of another species and when the birth appears of never so different a bird will cherish it for her own in all these circumstances which do not carry an immediate regard to the subsistence of her self or her species she is a very ideot  there is not in my opinion any thing more mysterious in nature than this instinct in animals which thus rises above reason and falls infinitely short of it it cannot be accounted for by any properties in matter and at the same time works after so odd a manner that one cannot think it the faculty of an intellectual being for my own part i look upon it as upon the principle of gravitation in bodies which is not to be explained by any known qualities inherent in the bodies themselves nor from any laws of mechanism but according to the best notions of the greatest philosophers is an immediate impression from the first mover and the divine energy acting in the creatures  l      footnote     depose return to footnote mark  contents contents p     no     thursday july         addison    jovis omnia plena  virg   as i was walking this morning in the great yard that belongs to my friends country house i was wonderfully pleased to see the different workings of instinct in a hen followed by a brood of ducks the young upon the sight of a pond immediately ran into it while the stepmother with all imaginable anxiety hovered about the borders of it to call them out of an element that appeared to her so dangerous and destructive as the different principle which acted in these different animals cannot be termed reason so when we call it instinct we mean something we have no knowledge of to me as i hinted in my last paper it seems the immediate direction of providence and such an operation of the supreme being as that which determines all the portions of matter to their proper centres a modern philosopher quoted by monsieur bayle  in his learned dissertation on the souls of brutes delivers the same opinion tho in a bolder form of words where he says deus est anima brutorum god himself is the soul of brutes who can tell what to call that seeming sagacity in animals which directs them to such food as is proper for them and makes them naturally avoid whatever is noxious or unwholesome tully has observed that a lamb no sooner falls from its mother but immediately and of his own accord applies itself to the teat dampier in his travels  tells us that when seamen are thrown upon any of the unknown coasts of america they never venture upon the fruit of any tree how tempting soever it may appear unless they observe that it is marked with the pecking of birds but fall on without any fear or apprehension where the birds have been before them  but notwithstanding animals have nothing like the use of reason we find in them all the lower parts of our nature the passions and senses in their greatest strength and perfection and here it is worth our observation that all beasts and birds of prey are wonderfully subject to anger malice revenge and all the other violent passions that may animate them in search of their proper food as those that are incapable of defending themselves or annoying others or whose safety lies chiefly in their flight are suspicious fearful and apprehensive of every thing they see or hear whilst others that are of assistance and use to man have their natures softened with something mild and tractable and by that means are qualified for a domestick life in this case the passions generally correspond with the make of the body we do not find the fury of a lion in so weak and defenceless an animal as a lamb nor the meekness of a lamb in a creature so armed for battel and assault as the lion in the same manner we find that particular animals have a more or less exquisite sharpness and sagacity in those particular senses which most turn to their advantage and in which their safety and welfare is the most concerned  nor must we here omit that great variety of arms with which nature has differently fortified the bodies of several kind of animals such as claws hoofs and horns teeth and tusks a tail a sting a trunk or a proboscis it is likewise observed by naturalists that it must be some hidden principle distinct from what we call reason which instructs animals in the use of these their arms and teaches them to manage them to the best advantage because they naturally defend themselves with that part in which their strength lies before the weapon be formed in it as is remarkable in lambs which tho they are bred within doors and never saw the actions of their own species push at those who approach them with their foreheads before the first budding of a horn appears  i shall add to these general observations an instance which mr lock has given us of providence even in the imperfections of a creature which seems the meanest and most despicable in the whole animal world we may says he from the make of an oyster or cockle conclude that it has not so many nor so quick senses as a man or several other animals nor if it had would it in that state and incapacity of transferring it self from one place to another be bettered by them what good would sight and hearing do to a creature that cannot move it self to or from the object wherein at a distance it perceives good or evil and would not quickness of sensation be an inconvenience to an animal that must be still where chance has once placed it and there receive the afflux of colder or warmer clean or foul water as it happens to come to it   i shall add to this instance out of mr lock another out of the learned dr moor  who cites it from cardan in relation to another animal which providence has left defective but at the same time has shewn its wisdom in the formation of that organ in which it seems chiefly to have failed what is more obvious and ordinary than a mole and yet what more palpable argument of providence than she the members of her body are so exactly fitted to her nature and manner of life for her dwelling being under ground where nothing is to be seen nature has so obscurely fitted her with eyes that naturalists can hardly agree whether she have any sight at all or no but for amends what she is capable of for her defence and warning of danger she has very eminently conferred upon her for she is exceeding quick of hearing and then her short tail and short legs but broad forefeet armed with sharp claws we see by the event to what purpose they are she so swiftly working her self under ground and making her way so fast in the earth as they that behold it cannot but admire it her legs therefore are short that she need dig no more than will serve the mere thickness of her body and her forefeet are broad that she may scoop away much earth at a time and little or no tail she has because she courses it not on the ground like the rat or mouse of whose kindred she is but lives under the earth and is fain to dig her self a dwelling there and she making her way through so thick an element which will not yield easily as the air or the wafer it had been dangerous to have drawn so long a train behind her for her enemy might fall upon her rear and fetch her out before she had compleated or got full possession of her works  i cannot forbear mentioning mr boyles remark upon this last creature who i remember somewhere in his works observes  that though the mole be not totally blind as it is commonly thought she has not sight enough to distinguish particular objects her eye is said to have but one humour in it which is supposed to give her the idea of light but of nothing else and is so formed that this idea is probably painful to the animal whenever she comes up into broad day she might be in danger of being taken unless she were thus affected by a light striking upon her eye and immediately warning her to bury herself in her proper element more sight would be useless to her as none at all might be fatal  i have only instanced such animals as seem the most imperfect works of nature and if providence shews it self even in the blemishes of these creatures how much more does it discover it self in the several endowments which it has variously bestowed upon such creatures as are more or less finished and

together from books and observations if the several writers among them took each his particular species and gave us a distinct account of its original birth and education its policies hostilities and alliances with the frame and texture of its inward and outward parts and particularly those that distinguish it from all other animals with their peculiar aptitudes for the state of being in which providence has placed them it would be one of the best services their studies could do mankind and not a little redound to the glory of the allwise contriver  it is true such a natural history after all the disquisitions of the learned would be infinitely short and defective seas and desarts hide millions of animals from our observation innumerable artifices and stratagems are acted in the howling wilderness and in the great deep that can never come to our knowledge besides that there are infinitely more species of creatures which are not to be seen without nor indeed with the help of the finest glasses than of such as are bulky enough for the naked eye to take hold of however from the consideration of such animals as lie within the compass of our knowledge we might easily form a conclusion of the rest that the same variety of wisdom and goodness runs through the whole creation and puts every creature in a condition to provide for its safety and subsistence in its proper

man is more sure of his conduct when the verdict which he passes upon his own behaviour is thus warranted and confirmed by the opinion of all that know him  my worthy friend sir roger is one of those who is not only at peace within himself but beloved and esteemed by all about him he receives a suitable tribute for his universal benevolence to mankind in the returns of affection and goodwill which are paid him by every one that lives within his neighbourhood i lately met with two or three odd instances of that general respect which is shown to the good old knight he would needs carry will wimble and myself with him to the countyassizes as we were upon the road will wimble joined a couple of plain men who rid before us and conversed with them for some time during which my friend sir roger acquainted me with their characters  the first of them says he that has a spaniel by his side is a yeoman of about an hundred pounds a year an honest man he is just within the gameact and qualified to kill an hare or a pheasant he knocks down a dinner with his gun twice or thrice a week and by that means lives much cheaper than those who have not so good an estate as himself he would be a good neighbour if he did not destroy so many partridges in short he is a very sensible man shoots flying and has been several times foreman of the pettyjury  the other that rides along with him is tom touchy a fellow famous for taking the law of every body there is not one in the town where he lives that he has not sued at a quartersessions the rogue had once the impudence to go to law with the widow his head is full of costs damages and ejectments he plagued a couple of honest gentlemen so long for a trespass in breaking one of his hedges till he was forced to sell the ground it enclosed to defray the charges of the prosecution his father left him fourscore pounds a year but he has cast and been cast so often that he is not now worth thirty i suppose he is going upon the old business of the willowtree  as sir roger was giving me this account of tom touchy will wimble and his two companions stopped short till we came up to them after having paid their respects to sir roger will told him that mr touchy and he must appeal to him upon a dispute that arose between them will it seems had been giving his fellowtraveller an account of his angling one day in such a hole when tom touchy instead of hearing out his story told him that mr such an one if he pleased might take the law of him for fishing in that part of the river my friend sir roger heard them both upon a round trot and after having paused some time told them with the air of a man who would not give his judgment rashly that much might be said on both sides they were neither of them dissatisfied with the knights determination because neither of them found himself in the wrong by it upon which we made the best of our way to the assizes  the court was sat before sir roger came but notwithstanding all the justices had taken their places upon the bench they made room for the old knight at the head of them who for his reputation in the country took occasion to whisper in the judges ear that he was glad his lordship had met with so much good weather in his circuit i was listening to the proceeding of the court with much attention and infinitely pleased with that great appearance and solemnity which so properly accompanies such a publick administration of our laws when after about an hours sitting i observed to my great surprize in the midst of a trial that my friend sir roger was getting up to speak i was in some pain for him till i found he had acquitted himself of two or three sentences with a look of much business and great intrepidity  upon his first rising the court was hushed and a general whisper ran among the country people that sir roger was up the speech he made was so little to the purpose that i shall not trouble my readers with an account of it and i believe was not so much designed by the knight himself to inform the court as to give him a figure in my eye and keep up his credit in the country  i was highly delighted when the court rose to see the gentlemen of the country gathering about my old friend and striving who should compliment him most at the same time that the ordinary people gazed upon him at a distance not a little admiring his courage that was not afraid to speak to the judge  in our return home we met with a very odd accident which i cannot forbear relating because it shews how desirous all who know sir roger are of giving him marks of their esteem when we were arrived upon the verge of his estate we stopped at a little inn to rest our selves and our horses the man of the house had it seems been formerly a servant in the knights family and to do honour to his old master had some time since unknown to sir roger put him up in a signpost before the door so that the knights head had hung out upon the road about a week before he himself knew any thing of the matter as soon as sir roger was acquainted with it finding that his servants indiscretion proceeded wholly from affection and goodwill he only told him that he had made him too high a compliment and when the fellow seemed to think that could hardly be added with a more decisive look that it was too great an honour for any man under a duke but told him at the same time that it might be altered with a very few touches and that he himself would be at the charge of it accordingly they got a painter by the knights directions to add a pair of whiskers to the face and by a little aggravation to the features to change it into the saracens head i should not have known this story had not the innkeeper upon sir rogers alighting told him in my hearing that his honours head was brought back last night with the alterations that he had ordered to be made in it upon this my friend with his usual chearfulness related the particulars abovementioned and ordered the head to be brought into the room i could not forbear discovering greater expressions of mirth than ordinary upon the appearance of this monstrous face under which notwithstanding it was made to frown and stare in a most extraordinary manner i could still discover a distant resemblance of my old friend sir roger upon seeing me laugh desired me to tell him truly if i thought it possible for people to know him in that disguise i at first kept my usual silence but upon the knights conjuring me to tell him whether it was not still more like himself than a saracen i composed my countenance in the best manner i could and replied that much might be said on both sides  these several adventures with the knights behaviour in them gave me as pleasant a day as ever i met with in any of my

as i was yesterday taking the air with my friend sir roger we were met by a freshcoloured ruddy young man who rid by us full speed with a couple of servants behind him upon my enquiry who he was sir roger told me that he was a young gentleman of a considerable estate who had been educated by a tender mother that lives not many miles from the place where we were she is a very good lady says my friend but took so much care of her sons health that she has made him good for nothing she quickly found that reading was bad for his eyes and that writing made his head ache he was let loose among the woods as soon as he was able to ride on horseback or to carry a gun upon his shoulder to be brief i found by my friends account of him that he had got a great stock of health but nothing else and that if it were a mans business only to live there would not be a more accomplished young fellow in the whole country  the truth of it is since my residing in these parts i have seen and heard innumerable instances of young heirs and elder brothers who either from their own reflecting upon the estates they are born to and therefore thinking all other accomplishments unnecessary or from hearing these notions frequently inculcated to them by the flattery of their servants and domesticks or from the same foolish thought prevailing in those who have the care of their education are of no manner of use but to keep up their families and transmit their lands and houses in a line to posterity  this makes me often think on a story i have heard of two friends which i shall give my reader at large under feigned names the moral of it may i hope be useful though there are some circumstances which make it rather appear like a novel than a true story  eudoxus and leontine began the world with small estates they were both of them men of good sense and great virtue they prosecuted their studies together in their earlier years and entered into such a friendship as lasted to the end of their lives eudoxus at his first setting out in the world threw himself into a court where by his natural endowments and his acquired abilities he made his way from one post to another till at length he had raised a very considerable fortune leontine on the contrary sought all opportunities of improving his mind by study conversation and travel he was not only acquainted with all the sciences but with the most eminent professors of them throughout europe he knew perfectly well the interests of its princes with the customs and fashions of their courts and could scarce meet with the name of an extraordinary person in the gazette whom he had not either talked to or seen in short he had so well mixt and digested his knowledge of men and books that he made one of the most accomplished persons of his age during the whole course of his studies and travels he kept up a punctual correspondence with eudoxus who often made himself acceptable to the principal men about court by the intelligence which he received from leontine when they were both turnd of forty an age in which according to mr cowley there is no dallying with life  they determined pursuant to the resolution they had taken in the beginning of their lives to retire and pass the remainder of their days in the country in order to this they both of them married much about the same time leontine with his own and his wifes fortune bought a farm of three hundred a year which lay within the neighbourhood of his friend eudoxus who had purchased an estate of as many thousands they were both of them fathers about the same time eudoxus having a son born to him and leontine a daughter but to the unspeakable grief of the latter his young wife in whom all his happiness was wrapt up died in a few days after the birth of her daughter his affliction would have been insupportable had not he been comforted by the daily visits and conversations of his friend as they were one day talking together with their usual intimacy leontine considering how incapable he was of giving his daughter a proper education in his own house and eudoxus reflecting on the ordinary behaviour of a son who knows himself to be the heir of a great estate they both agreed upon an exchange of children namely that the boy should be bred up with leontine as his son and that the girl should live with eudoxus as his daughter till they were each of them arrived at years of discretion the wife of eudoxus knowing that her son could not be so advantageously brought up as under the care of leontine and considering at the same time that he would be perpetually under her own eye was by degrees prevailed upon to fall in with the project she therefore took leonilla for that was the name of the girl and educated her as her own daughter the two friends on each side had wrought themselves to such an habitual tenderness for the children who were under their direction that each of them had the real passion of a father where the title was but imaginary florio the name of the young heir that lived with leontine though he had all the duty and affection imaginable for his supposed parent was taught to rejoice at the sight of eudoxus who visited his friend very frequently and was dictated by his natural affection as well as by the rules of prudence to make himself esteemed and beloved by florio the boy was now old enough to know his supposed fathers circumstances and that therefore he was to make his way in the world by his own industry this consideration grew stronger in him every day and produced so good an effect that he applied himself with more than ordinary attention to the pursuit of every thing which leontine recommended to him his natural abilities which were very good assisted by the directions of so excellent a counsellor enabled him to make a quicker progress than ordinary through all the parts of his education before he was twenty years of age having finished his studies and exercises with great applause he was removed from the university to the inns of court where there are very few that make themselves considerable proficients in the studies of the place who know they shall arrive at great estates without them this was not florios case he found that three hundred a year was but a poor estate for leontine and himself to live upon so that he studied without intermission till he gained a very good insight into the constitution and laws of his country  i should have told my reader that whilst florio lived at the house of his fosterfather he was always an acceptable guest in the family of eudoxus where he became acquainted with leonilla from her infancy his acquaintance with her by degrees grew into love which in a mind trained up in all the sentiments of honour and virtue became a very uneasy passion he despaired of gaining an heiress of so great a fortune and would rather have died than attempted it by any indirect methods leonilla who was a woman of the greatest beauty joined with the greatest modesty entertained at the same time a secret passion for florio but conducted her self with so much prudence that she never gave him the least intimation of it florio was now engaged in all those arts and improvements that are proper to raise a mans private fortune and give him a figure in his country but secretly tormented with that passion which burns with the greatest fury in a virtuous and noble heart when he received a sudden summons from leontine to repair to him into the country the next day for it seems eudoxus was so filled with the report of his sons reputation that he could no longer withhold making himself known to him the morning after his arrival at the house of his supposed father leontine told him that eudoxus had something of great importance to communicate to him upon which the good man embraced him and wept florio was no sooner arrived at the great house that stood in his neighbourhood but eudoxus took him by the hand after the first salutes were over and conducted him into his closet he there opened to him the whole secret of his parentage and education concluding after this manner i have no other way left of acknowledging my gratitude to leontine than by marrying you to his daughter he shall not lose the pleasure of being your father by the discovery i have made to you leonilla too shall be still my daughter her filial piety though misplaced has been so exemplary that it deserves the greatest reward i can confer upon it you shall have the pleasure of seeing a great estate fall to you which you would have lost the relish of had you known your self born to it continue only to deserve it in the same manner you did before you were possessed of it i have left your mother in the next room her heart yearns towards you she is making the same discoveries to leonilla which i have made to your self florio was so overwhelmed with this profusion of happiness that he was not able to make a reply but threw himself down at his fathers feet and amidst a flood of tears kissed and embraced his knees asking his blessing and expressing in dumb show those sentiments of love duty and gratitude that were too big for utterance to conclude the happy pair were married and half eudoxuss estate settled upon them leontine and eudoxus passed the remainder of their lives together and received in the dutiful and affectionate behaviour of florio and leonilla the just recompence as well as the natural effects of that care which they had bestowed upon them in their education  l      footnote     essay on the

his works in a volume has an infinite advantage over one who communicates his writings to the world in loose tracts and single pieces we do not expect to meet with any thing in a bulky volume till after some heavy preamble and several words of course to prepare the reader for what follows nay authors have established it as a kind of rule that a man ought to be dull sometimes as the most severe reader makes allowances for many rests and noddingplaces in a voluminous writer this gave occasion to the famous greek proverb which i have chosen for my motto that a great book is a great evil  on the contrary those who publish their thoughts in distinct sheets and as it were by piecemeal have none of these advantages we must immediately fall into our subject and treat every part of it in a lively manner or our papers are thrown by as dull and insipid our matter must lie close together and either be wholly new in itself or in the turn it receives from our expressions were the books of our best authors thus to be retailed to the publick and every page submitted to the taste of forty or fifty thousand readers i am afraid we should complain of many flat expressions trivial observations beaten topicks and common thoughts which go off very well in the lump at the same time notwithstanding some papers may be made up of broken hints and irregular sketches it is often expected that every sheet should be a kind of treatise and make out in thought what it wants in bulk that a point of humour should be worked up in all its parts and a subject touched upon in its most essential articles without the repetitions tautologies and enlargements that are indulged to longer labours the ordinary writers of morality prescribe to their readers after the galenick way their medicines are made up in large quantities an essaywriter must practise in the chymical method and give the virtue of a full draught in a few drops were all books reduced thus to their quintessence many a bulky author would make his appearance in a pennypaper there would be scarce such a thing in nature as a folio the works of an age would be contained on a few shelves not to mention millions of volumes that would be utterly annihilated  i cannot think that the difficulty of furnishing out separate papers of this nature has hindered authors from communicating their thoughts to the world after such a manner though i must confess i am amazed that the press should be only made use of in this way by newswriters and the zealots of parties as if it were not more advantageous to mankind to be instructed in wisdom and virtue than in politicks and to be made good fathers husbands and sons than counsellors and statesmen had the philosophers and great men of antiquity who took so much pains in order to instruct mankind and leave the world wiser and better than they found it had they i say been possessed of the art of printing there is no question but they would have made such an advantage of it in dealing out their lectures to the publick our common prints would be of great use were they thus calculated to diffuse good sense through the bulk of a people to clear up their understandings animate their minds with virtue dissipate the sorrows of a heavy heart or unbend the mind from its more severe employments with innocent amusements when knowledge instead of being bound up in books and kept in libraries and retirements is thus obtruded upon the publick when it is canvassed in every assembly and exposed upon every table i cannot forbear reflecting upon that passage in the proverbs wisdom crieth without she uttereth her voice in the streets she crieth in the chief place of concourse in the openings of the gates in the city she uttereth her words saying how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge  the many letters which come to me from persons of the best sense in both sexes for i may pronounce their characters from their way of writing do not at a little encourage me in the prosecution of this my undertaking besides that my bookseller tells me the demand for these my papers increases daily it is at his instance that i shall continue my rural speculations to the end of this month several having made up separate sets of them as they have done before of those relating to wit to operas to points of morality or subjects of humour  i am not at all mortified when sometimes i see my works thrown aside by men of no taste nor learning there is a kind of heaviness and ignorance that hangs upon the minds of ordinary men which is too thick for knowledge to break through their souls are not to be enlightened  nox atra cava circumvolat umbra to these i must apply the fable of the mole that after having consulted many oculists for the bettering of his sight was at last provided with a good pair of spectacles but upon his endeavouring to make use of them his mother told him very prudently that spectacles though they might help the eye of a man could be of no use to a mole it is not therefore for the benefit of moles that i publish these my daily essays  but besides such as are moles through ignorance there are others who are moles through envy as it is said in the latin proverb that one man is a wolf to another  so generally speaking one author is a mole to another author it is impossible for them to discover beauties in one anothers works they have eyes only for spots and blemishes they can indeed see the light as it is said of the animals which are their namesakes but the idea of it is painful to them they immediately shut their eyes upon it and withdraw themselves into a wilful obscurity i have already caught two or three of these dark undermining vermin and intend to make a string of them in order to hang them up in one of my papers as an example to all such voluntary moles  c      footnote     proverbs i  0   return to footnote

viscera vertite vires  vir   my worthy friend sir roger when we are talking of the malice of parties very frequently tells us an accident that happened to him when he was a schoolboy which was at a time when the feuds ran high between the roundheads and cavaliers this worthy knight being then but a stripling had occasion to enquire which was the way to st annes lane upon which the person whom he spoke to instead of answering his question calld him a young popish cur and asked him who had made anne a saint the boy being in some confusion enquired of the next he met which was the way to annes lane but was calld a prickeared cur for his pains and instead of being shewn the way was told that she had been a saint before he was born and would be one after he was hanged upon this says sir roger i did not think fit to repeat the former question but going into every lane of the neighbourhood asked what they called the name of that lane by which ingenious artifice he found out the place he enquired after without giving offence to any party sir roger generally closes this narrative with reflections on the mischief that parties do in the country how they spoil good neighbourhood and make honest gentlemen hate one another besides that they manifestly tend to the prejudice of the landtax and the destruction of the game  there cannot a greater judgment befal a country than such a dreadful spirit of division as rends a government into two distinct people and makes them greater strangers and more averse to one another than if they were actually two different nations the effects of such a division are pernicious to the last degree not only with regard to those advantages which they give the common enemy but to those private evils which they produce in the heart of almost every particular person this influence is very fatal both to mens morals and their understandings it sinks the virtue of a nation and not only so but destroys even common sense  a furious party spirit when it rages in its full violence exerts it self in civil war and bloodshed and when it is under its greatest restraints naturally breaks out in falshood detraction calumny and a partial administration of justice in a word it fills a nation with spleen and rancour and extinguishes all the seeds of goodnature compassion and humanity  plutarch says very finely that a man should not allow himself to hate even his enemies because says he if you indulge this passion in some occasions it will rise of it self in others if you hate your enemies you will contract such a vicious habit of mind as by degrees will break out upon those who are your friends or those who are indifferent to you  i might here observe how admirably this precept of morality which derives the malignity of hatred from the passion it self and not from its object answers to that great rule which was dictated to the world about an hundred years before this philosopher wrote  but instead of that i shall only take notice with a real grief of heart that the minds of many good men among us appear sowered with partyprinciples and alienated from one another in such a manner as seems to me altogether inconsistent with the dictates either of reason or religion zeal for a publick cause is apt to breed passions in the hearts of virtuous persons to which the regard of their own private interest would never have betrayed them  if this partyspirit has so ill an effect on our morals it has likewise a very great one upon our judgments we often hear a poor insipid paper or pamphlet cried up and sometimes a noble piece depreciated by those who are of a different principle from the author one who is actuated by this spirit is almost under an incapacity of discerning either real blemishes or beauties a man of merit in a different principle is like an object seen in two different mediums that appears crooked or broken however streight and entire it may be in it self for this reason there is scarce a person of any figure in england who does not go by two contrary characters  as opposite to one another as light and darkness knowledge and learning suffer in a  particular manner from this strange prejudice which at present prevails amongst all ranks and degrees in the british nation as men formerly became eminent in learned societies by their parts and acquisitions they now distinguish themselves by the warmth and violence with which they espouse their respective parties books are valued upon the like considerations an abusive scurrilous style passes for satyr and a dull scheme of party notions is called fine writing  there is one piece of sophistry practised by both sides and that is the taking any scandalous story that has been ever whispered or invented of a private man for a known undoubted truth and raising suitable speculations upon it calumnies that have been never proved or have been often refuted are the ordinary postulatums of these infamous scriblers upon which they proceed as upon first principles granted by all men though in their hearts they know they are false or at best very doubtful when they have laid these foundations of scurrility it is no wonder that their superstructure is every way answerable to them if this shameless practice of the present age endures much longer praise and reproach will cease to be motives of action in good men  there are certain periods of time in all governments when this inhuman spirit prevails italy was long torn in pieces by the guelfes and gibellines and france by those who were for and against the league but it is very unhappy for a man to be born in such a stormy and tempestuous season it is the restless ambition of artful men that thus breaks a people into factions and draws several wellmeaning persons  to their interest by a specious concern for their country how many honest minds are filled with uncharitable and barbarous notions out of their zeal for the publick good what cruelties and outrages would they not commit against men of an adverse party whom they would honour and esteem if instead of considering them as they are represented they knew them as they are thus are persons of the greatest probity seduced into shameful errors and prejudices and made bad men even by that noblest of principles the love of their country i cannot here forbear mentioning the famous spanish proverb if there were neither fools nor knaves in the world all people would be of one mind  for my own part i could heartily wish that all honest men would enter into an association for the support of one another against the endeavours of those whom they ought to look upon as their common enemies whatsoever side they may belong to were there such an honest body of neutral  forces we should never see the worst of men in great figures of life because they are useful to a party nor the best unregarded because they are above practising those methods which would be grateful to their faction we should then single every criminal out of the herd and hunt him down however formidable and overgrown he might appear on the contrary we should shelter distressed innocence and defend virtue however beset with contempt or ridicule envy or defamation in short we should not any longer regard our fellow subjects as whigs or tories but should make the man of merit our friend and the villain our enemy  c

a combination of honest men who without any regard to places would endeavour to extirpate all such furious zealots as would sacrifice one half of their country to the passion and interest of the other as also such infamous hypocrites that are for promoting their own advantage under colour of the publick good with all the profligate immoral retainers to each side that have nothing to recommend them but an implicit submission to their leaders we should soon see that furious partyspirit extinguished which may in time expose us to the derision and contempt of all the nations about us  a member of this society that would thus carefully employ himself in making room for merit by throwing down the worthless and depraved part of mankind from those conspicuous stations of life to which they have been sometimes advanced and all this without any regard to his private interest would be no small benefactor to his country  i remember to have read in diodorus siculus  an account of a very active little animal which i think he calls the ichneumon that makes it the whole business of his life to break the eggs of the crocodile which he is always in search after this instinct is the more remarkable because the ichneumon never feeds upon the eggs he has broken nor in any other way finds his account in them were it not for the incessant labours of this industrious animal ægypt says the historian would be overrun with crocodiles for the ægyptians are so far from destroying those pernicious creatures that they worship them as gods  if we look into the behaviour of ordinary partizans we shall find them far from resembling this disinterested animal and rather acting after the example of the wild tartars who are ambitious of destroying a man of the most extraordinary parts and accomplishments as thinking that upon his decease the same talents whatever post they qualified him for enter of course into his destroyer  as in the whole train of my speculations i have endeavoured as much as i am able to extinguish that pernicious spirit of passion and prejudice which rages with the same violence in all parties i am still the more desirous of doing some good in this particular because i observe that the spirit of party reigns more in the country than in the town it here contracts a kind of brutality and rustick fierceness to which men of a politer conversation are wholly strangers it extends it self even to the return of the bow and the hat and at the same time that the heads of parties preserve toward one another an outward shew of goodbreeding and keep up a perpetual intercourse of civilities their tools that are dispersed in these outlying parts will not so much as mingle together at a cockmatch this humour fills the country with several periodical meetings of whig jockies and tory foxhunters not to mention the innumerable curses frowns and whispers it produces at a quartersessions  i do not know whether i have observed in any of my former papers that my friends sir roger de coverley and sir andrew freeport are of different principles the first of them inclined to the landed and the other to the monyed interest this humour is so

than in town which as he has told me in my ear is absolutely necessary for the keeping up his interest in all our journey from london to his house we did not so much as bait at a whig inn or if by chance the coachman stopped at a wrong place one of sir rogers servants would ride up to his master full speed and whisper to him that the master of the house was against such an one in the last election this often betrayd us into hard beds and bad chear for we were not so inquisitive about the inn as the innkeeper and provided our landlords principles were sound did not take any notice of the staleness of his provisions this i found still the more inconvenient because the better the host was the worse generally were his accommodations the fellow knowing very well that those who were his friends would take up with coarse diet and an hard lodging for these reasons all the while i was upon the road i dreaded entering into an house of any one that sir roger had applauded for an honest man  since my stay at sir rogers in the country i daily find more instances of this narrow partyhumour being upon a bowlinggreen at a neighbouring markettown the other day for that is the place where the gentlemen of one side meet once a week i observed a stranger among them of a better presence and genteeler behaviour than ordinary but was much surprised that notwithstanding he was a very fair bettor no body would take him up but upon enquiry i found that he was one who had given a disagreeable vote in a former parliament for which reason there was not a man upon that bowlinggreen who would have so much correspondence with him as to win his money of him  among other instances of this nature i must not omit one which concerns  my self will wimble was the other day relating several strange stories that he had picked up no body knows where of a certain great man and upon my staring at him as one that was surprised to hear such things in the country which  had never been so much as whispered in the town will stopped short in the thread of his discourse and after dinner asked my friend sir roger in his ear if he was sure that i was not a fanatick  it gives me a serious concern to see such a spirit of dissention in the country not only as it destroys virtue and common sense and renders us in a manner barbarians towards one another but as it perpetuates our animosities widens our breaches and transmits our present passions and prejudices to our posterity for my own part i am sometimes afraid that i discover the seeds of a civil war in these our divisions and therefore

sit about a pot of coffee and hear the old knight read dyers letter which he does with his spectacles upon his nose and in an audible voice smiling very often at those little strokes of satyr which are so frequent in the writings of that author i afterwards communicate to the knight such packets as i receive under the quality of spectator the following letter chancing to please him more than ordinary i shall publish it at his request mr spectator  you have diverted the town almost a whole month at the expence of the country it is now high time that you should give the country their revenge since your withdrawing from this place the fair sex are run into great extravagancies their petticoats which began to heave and swell before you left us are now blown up into a most enormous concave and rise every day more and more in short sir since our women know themselves to be out of the eye of the spectator they will be kept within no compass you praised them a little too soon for the modesty of their headdresses for as the humour of a sick person is often driven out of one limb into another their superfluity of ornaments instead of being entirely banished seems only fallen from their heads upon their lower parts what they have lost in height they make up in breadth and contrary to all rules of architecture widen the foundations at the same time that they shorten the superstructure were they like spanish jennets to impregnate by the wind they could not have thought on a more proper invention but as we do not yet hear any particular use in this petticoat or that it contains any thing more than what was supposed to be in those of scantier make we are wonderfully at a loss about it  the women give out in defence of these wide bottoms that they are airy and very proper for the season but this i look upon to be only a pretence and a piece of art for it is well known we have not had a more moderate summer these many years so that it is certain the heat they complain of cannot be in the weather besides i would fain ask these tender constitutioned ladies why they should require more cooling than their mothers before them  i find several speculative persons are of opinion that our sex has of late years been very sawcy and that the hoop petticoat is made use of to keep us at a distance it is most certain that a womans honour cannot be better entrenched than after this manner in circle within circle amidst such a variety of outworks and lines of circumvallation a female who is thus invested in whalebone is sufficiently secured against the approaches of an illbred fellow who might as well think of sir george ethereges way of making love in a tub  as in the midst of so many hoops  among these various conjectures there are men of superstitious tempers who look upon the hoop petticoat as a kind of prodigy some will have it that it portends the downfal of the french king and observe that the farthingale appeared in england a little before the ruin of the spanish monarchy others are of opinion that it foretels battle and bloodshed and believe it of the same prognostication as the tail of a blazing star for my part i am apt to think it is a sign that multitudes are coming into the world rather than going out of it  the first time i saw a lady dressed in one of these petticoats i could not forbear blaming her in my own thoughts for walking abroad when she was so near her time but soon recovered myself out of my error when i found all the modish part of the sex as far gone as her self it is generally thought some crafty women have thus betrayed their companions into hoops that they might make them accessory to their own concealments and by that means escape the censure of the world as wary generals have sometimes dressed two or three dozen of their friends in their own habit that they might not draw upon themselves any particular attacks of the enemy the strutting petticoat smooths all distinctions levels the mother with the daughter and sets maids and matrons wives and widows upon the same bottom in the mean while i cannot but be troubled to see so many wellshaped innocent virgins bloated up and waddling up and down like bigbellied women  should this fashion get among the ordinary people our publick ways would be so crowded that we should want streetroom several congregations of the best fashion find themselves already very much streightened and if the mode encrease i wish it may not drive many ordinary women into meetings and conventicles should our sex at the same time take it into their heads to wear trunk breeches as who knows what their indignation at this female treatment may drive them to a man and his wife would fill a whole pew  you know sir it is recorded of alexander the great  that in his indian expedition he buried several suits of armour which by his direction were made much too big for any of his soldiers in order to give posterity an extraordinary idea of him and make them believe he had commanded an army of giants i am persuaded that if one of the present petticoats happen to be hung up in any repository of curiosities it will lead into the same error the generations that lie some removes from us unless we can believe our posterity will think so disrespectfully of their great grandmothers that they made themselves monstrous to appear amiable  when i survey this newfashioned rotonda in all its parts i cannot but think of the old philosopher who after having entered into an egyptian temple and looked about for the idol of the place at length discovered a little black monkey enshrined in the midst of it upon which he could not forbear crying out to the great scandal of the worshippers what a magnificent palace is here for such a ridiculous inhabitant  though you have taken a resolution in one of your papers to avoid descending to particularities of dress i believe you will not think it below you on so extraordinary an occasion to unhoop the fair sex and cure this fashionable tympany that is got among them i am apt to think the petticoat will shrink of its own accord at your first coming to town at least a touch of your pen will make it contract it self like the sensitive plant and by that means oblige several who are either terrified or astonished at this portentous novelty and among the rest  your humble servant c  c

women in their nature are much more gay and joyous than men whether it be that their blood is more refined their fibres more delicate and their animal spirits more light and volatile or whether as some have imagined there may not be a kind of sex in the very soul i shall not pretend to determine as vivacity is the gift of women gravity is that of men they should each of them therefore keep a watch upon the particular biass which nature has fixed in their mind that it may not draw too much and lead them out of the paths of reason this will certainly happen if the one in every word and action affects the character of being rigid and severe and the other of being brisk and airy men should beware of being captivated by a kind of savage philosophy women by a thoughtless gallantry where these precautions are not observed the man often degenerates into a cynick the woman into a coquet the man grows sullen and morose the woman impertinent and fantastical  by what i have said we may conclude men and women were made as counterparts to one another that the pains and anxieties of the husband might be relieved by the sprightliness and good humour of the wife when these are rightly tempered care and chearfulness go hand in hand and the family like a ship that is duly trimmed wants neither sail nor ballast  natural historians observe for whilst i am in the country i must fetch my allusions from thence that only the male birds have voices that their songs begin a little before breedingtime and end a little after that whilst the hen is covering her eggs the male generally takes his stand upon a neighbouring bough within her hearing and by that means amuses and diverts her with his songs during the whole time of her sitting  this contract among birds lasts no longer than till a brood of young ones arises from it so that in the featherd kind the cares and fatigues of the married state if i may so call it lie principally upon the female on the contrary as in our species the man and the woman are joined together for life and the main burden rests upon the former nature has given all the little arts of soothing and blandishment to the female that she may chear and animate her companion in a constant and assiduous application to the making a provision for his family and the educating of their common children this however is not to be taken so strictly as if the same duties were not often reciprocal and incumbent on both parties but only to set forth what seems to have been the general intention of nature in the different inclinations and endowments which are bestowed on the different sexes  but whatever was the reason that man and woman were made with this variety of temper if we observe the conduct of the fair sex we find that they choose rather to associate themselves with a person who resembles them in that light and volatile humour which is natural to them than to such as are qualified to moderate and counterballance it it has been an old complaint that the coxcomb carries it with them before the man of sense when we see a fellow loud and talkative full of insipid life and laughter we may venture to pronounce him a female favourite noise and flutter are such accomplishments as they cannot withstand to be short the passion of an ordinary woman for a man is nothing else but selflove diverted upon another object she would have the lover a woman in every thing but the sex i do not know a finer piece of satyr on this part of womankind than those lines of mrdryden our thoughtless sex is caught by outward form and empty noise and loves it self in man this is a source of infinite calamities to the sex as it frequently joins them to men who in their own thoughts are as fine creatures as themselves or if they chance to be goodhumoured serve only to dissipate their fortunes inflame their follies and aggravate their indiscretions  the same female levity is no less fatal to them after mariage than before it represents to their imaginations the faithful prudent husband as an honest tractable and domestick animal and turns their thoughts upon the fine gay gentleman that laughs sings and dresses so much more agreeably  as this irregular vivacity of temper leads astray the hearts of ordinary women in the choice of their lovers and the treatment of their husbands it operates with the same pernicious influence towards their children who are taught to accomplish themselves in all those sublime perfections that appear captivating in the eye of their mother she admires in her son what she loved in her gallant and by that means contributes all she can to perpetuate herself in a worthless progeny  the younger faustina was a lively instance of this sort of women notwithstanding she was married to marcus aurelius one of the greatest wisest and best of the roman emperors she thought a common gladiator much the prettier gentleman and had taken such care to accomplish her son commodus according to her own notions of a fine man that when he ascended the throne of his father he became the most foolish and abandoned tyrant that was ever placed at the head of the roman empire signalizing himself in nothing but the fighting of prizes and knocking out mens brains as he had no taste of true glory we see him in several medals and statues which  are still extant of him equipped like an hercules with a club and a lions skin  i have been led into this speculation by the characters i have heard of a country gentleman and his lady who do not live many miles from sir roger the wife is an old coquet that is always hankering after the diversions of the town the husband a morose rustick that frowns and frets at the name of it the wife is overrun with affectation the husband sunk into brutality the lady cannot bear the noise of the larks and nightingales hates your tedious summer days and is sick at the sight of shady woods and purling streams the husband wonders how any one can be pleased with the fooleries of plays and operas and rails from morning to night at essenced fops and tawdry courtiers the children are educated in these different notions of their parents the sons follow the father about his grounds while the daughters read volumes of loveletters and romances to their mother by this means it comes to pass that the girls look upon their father as a clown and the boys think their mother no better than she should be  how different are the lives of aristus and aspasia the innocent vivacity of the one is tempered and composed by the chearful gravity of the other the wife grows wise by the discourses of the husband and the husband goodhumourd by the conversations of the wife aristus would not be so amiable were it not for his aspasia nor aspasia so much esteemed  were it not

will make a very odd figure and perhaps look monstrous in the eyes of posterity for this reason they often represent an illustrious person in a roman habit or in some other dress that never varies i could wish for the sake of my country friends that there was such a kind of everlasting drapery to be made use of by all who live at a certain distance from the town and that they would agree upon such fashions as should never be liable to changes and innovations for want of this standing dress a man who  takes a journey into the country is as much surprised as one who  walks in a gallery of old family pictures and finds as great a variety of garbs and habits in the persons he converses with did they keep to one constant dress they would sometimes be in the fashion which they never are as matters are managed at present if instead of running after the mode they would continue fixed in one certain habit the mode would some time or other overtake them as a clock that stands still is sure

never find him but if you plant your self at the corner of any one street ill engage it will not be long before you see him  i have already touched upon this subject in a speculation which  shews how cruelly the country are led astray in following the town and equipped in a ridiculous habit when they fancy themselves in the height of the mode since that speculation i have received a letter which i there hinted at from a gentleman who is now in the western circuit mr spectator  being a lawyer of the middletemple a  cornishman by birth i generally ride the western circuit for my health and as i am not interrupted with clients have leisure to make many observations that escape the notice of my fellowtravellers  one of the most fashionable women i met with in all the circuit was my landlady at stains where i chanced to be on a holiday her commode was not half a foot high and her petticoat within some yards of a modish circumference in the same place i observed a young fellow with a tolerable periwig had it not been covered with a hat that was shaped in the ramillie cock  as i proceeded in my journey i observed the petticoat grew scantier and scantier and about threescore miles from london was so very unfashionable that a woman might walk in it without any manner of inconvenience  not far from salisbury i took notice of a justice of peaces lady who  was at least ten years behindhand in her dress but at the same time as fine as hands could make her she was flounced and furbelowed from head to foot every ribbon was wrinkled and every part of her garments in curl so that she looked like one of those animals which in the country we call a friezeland hen  not many miles beyond this place i was informed that one of the last years little muffs had by some means or other straggled into those parts and that all women of fashion were cutting their old muffs in two or retrenching them according to the little model which  was got among them i cannot believe the report they have there that it was sent down frankd by a parliamentman in a little packet but probably by next winter this fashion will be at the height in the country when it is quite out at london  the greatest beau at our next country sessions was dressed in a most monstrous flaxen periwig that was made in king williams reign the wearer of it goes it seems in his own hair when he is at home and lets his wig lie in buckle for a whole half year that he may put it on upon occasions to meet the judges in it  i must not here omit an adventure which  happened to us in a country church upon the frontiers of cornwall as we were in the midst of the service a lady who is the chief woman of the place and had passed the winter at london with her husband entered the congregation in a little headdress and a hoopd petticoat the people who were wonderfully startled at such a sight all of them rose up some stared at the prodigious bottom and some at the little top of this strange dress in the mean time the lady of the manor filled the area  of the church and walked up to her pew with an unspeakable satisfaction amidst the whispers conjectures and astonishments of the whole congregation  upon our way from hence we saw a young fellow riding towards us full gallop with a bob wig and a black silken bag tied to it he stopt short at the coach to ask us how far the judges were behind us his stay was so very short that we had only time to observe his new silk waistcoat which  was unbuttond in several places to let us see that he had a clean shirt on which was ruffled down to his middle  from this place during our progress through the most western parts of the kingdom we fancied ourselves in king charles the seconds reign the people having made very little variations in their dress since that time the smartest of the country squires appear still in the monmouthcock  and when they go a wooing whether they have any post in the militia or not they generally put on a red coat we were indeed very much surprized at the place we lay at last night to meet with a gentleman that had accoutered himself in a nightcap wig a coat with long pockets and slit sleeves and a pair of shoes with high scollop tops but we soon found by his conversation that he was a person who laughed at the ignorance and rusticity of the country people and was resolved to live and die in the mode  sir if you think this account of my travels may be of any advantage to the publick i will next year trouble you with such occurrences as i shall meet with in other parts of england for i am informed

justice of the peace upon such a band of lawless vagrants but not having his clerk with him who is a necessary counsellor on these occasions and fearing that his poultry might fare the worse for it he let the thought drop but at the same time gave me a particular account of the mischiefs they do in the country in stealing peoples goods and spoiling their servants if a stray piece of linnen hangs upon an hedge says sir roger they are sure to have it if the hog loses his way in the fields it is ten to one but he becomes their prey our geese cannot live in peace for them if a man prosecutes them with severity his henroost is sure to pay for it they generally straggle into these parts about this time of the year and set the heads of our servantmaids so agog for husbands that we do not expect to have any business done as it should be whilst they are in the country i have an honest dairymaid who  crosses their hands with a piece of silver every summer and never fails being promised the handsomest young fellow in the parish for her pains your friend the butler has been fool enough to be seduced by them and though he is sure to lose a knife a fork or a spoon every time his fortune is told him generally shuts himself up in the pantry with an old gypsie for above half an hour once in a twelvemonth sweethearts are the things they live upon which they bestow very plentifully upon all those that apply themselves to them you see now and then some handsome young jades among them the sluts have very often white teeth and black eyes sir roger observing that i listned with great attention to his account of a people who were so entirely new to me told me that if i would they should tell us our fortunes as i was very well pleased with the knights proposal we rid up and communicated our hands to them a cassandra of the crew after having examined my lines very diligently told me that i loved a pretty maid in a corner that i was a good womans man with some other particulars which i do not think proper to relate my friend sir roger alighted from his horse and exposing his palm to two or three that stood by him they crumpled it into all shapes and diligently scanned every wrinkle that could be made in it when one of them who  was older and more sunburnt than the rest told him that he had a widow in his line of life upon which the knight cried go go you are an idle baggage and at the same time smiled upon me the gypsie finding he was not displeased in his heart told him after a farther enquiry into his hand that his truelove was constant and that she should dream of him tonight my old friend cried pish and bid her go on the gypsie told him that he was a batchelour but would not be so long and that he was dearer to some body than he thought the knight still repeated she was an idle baggage and bid her go on ah master says the gypsie that roguish leer of yours makes a pretty womans heart ake you hant that simper about the mouth for nothing — the uncouth gibberish with which all this was uttered like the darkness of an oracle made us the more attentive to it to be short the knight left the money with her that he had crossed her hand with and got up again on his horse  as we were riding away sir roger told me that he knew several sensible people who believed these gypsies now and then foretold very strange things and for half an hour together appeared more jocund than ordinary in the height of his goodhumour meeting a common beggar upon the road who was no conjurer as he went to relieve him he found his pocket was picked that being a kind of palmistry at which this race of vermin are very dextrous  i might here entertain my reader with historical remarks on this idle profligate people who  infest all the countries of europe and live in the midst of governments in a kind of commonwealth by themselves but instead of entering into observations of this nature i shall fill the remaining part of my paper with a story which  is still fresh in holland and was printed in one of our monthly accounts about twenty years ago as the trekschuyt or hackneyboat which carries passengers from leyden to amsterdam was putting off a boy running along the side  of the canal desired to be taken in which the master of the boat refused because the lad had not quite money enough to pay the usual fare an eminent merchant being pleased with the looks of the boy and secretly touched with compassion towards him paid the money for him  and ordered him to be taken on board upon talking with him afterwards he found that he could speak readily in three or four languages and learned upon farther examination that he had been stoln away when he was a child by a gypsie and had rambled ever since with a gang of those strollers up and down several parts of europe it happened that the merchant whose heart seems to have inclined towards the boy by a secret kind of instinct had himself lost a child some years before the parents after a long search for him gave him for drowned in one of the canals with which that country abounds and the mother was so afflicted at the loss of a fine boy who was her only son that she died for grief of it upon laying together all particulars and examining the several moles and marks by which the mother used to describe the child when  he was first missing the boy proved to be the son of the merchant whose heart had so unaccountably melted at the sight of him the lad was very well pleased to find a father who  was so rich and likely to leave him a good estate the father on the other hand was not a little delighted to see a son return to him whom he had given for lost with such a strength of constitution sharpness of understanding and skill in languages here the printed story leaves off but if i may give credit to reports our linguist having received such extraordinary rudiments towards a good education was afterwards trained up in every thing that becomes a gentleman wearing off by little and little all the vicious habits and practises that he had been used to in the course of his peregrinations nay it is said that he has since been employed in foreign courts upon national

country sports to preserve the game in his own grounds and divert himself upon those that belong to his neighbour my friend sir roger generally goes two or three miles from his house and gets into the frontiers of his estate before he beats about in search of a  hare or partridge on purpose to spare his own fields where he is always sure of finding diversion when the worst comes to the worst by this means the breed about his house has time to encrease and multiply besides that the sport is the more agreeable where the game is the harder to come at and where it does not lie so thick as to produce any perplexity or confusion in the pursuit for these reasons the country gentleman like the fox seldom preys near his own home  in the same manner i have made a months excursion out of the town which is the great field of game for sportsmen of my species to try my fortune in the country where i have started several subjects and hunted them down with some pleasure to my self and i hope to others i am here forced to use a great deal of diligence before i can spring any thing to my mind whereas in town whilst i am following one character it is ten to one but i am crossed in my way by another and put up such a variety of odd creatures in both sexes that they foil the scent of one another and puzzle the chace my greatest difficulty in the country is to find sport and in town to chuse it in the mean time as i have given a whole months rest to the cities of london and westminster i promise my self abundance of new game upon my return thither  it is indeed high time for me to leave the country since i find the whole neighbourhood begin to grow very inquisitive after my name and character my love of solitude taciturnity and particular way of life having raised a great curiosity in all these parts  the notions which have been framed of me are various some look upon me as very proud some as very modest and some as very melancholy will wimble as my friend the butler tells me observing me very much alone and extreamly silent when i am in company is afraid i have killed a man the country people seem to suspect me for a conjurer and some of them hearing of the visit which i made to moll white will needs have it that sir roger has brought down a cunning man with him to cure the old woman and free the country from her charms so that the character which i go under in part of the neighbourhood is what they here call a white witch  a justice of peace who lives about five miles off and is not of sir rogers party has it seems said twice or thrice at his table that he wishes sir roger does not harbour a jesuit in his house and that he thinks the gentlemen of the country would do very well to make me give some account of my self  on the other side some of sir rogers friends are afraid the old knight is imposd upon by a designing fellow and as they have heard that he converses very promiscuously when he is in town do not know but he has brought down with him some discarded whig that is sullen and says nothing because he is out of place  such is the variety of opinions which  are here entertained of me so that i pass among some for a disaffected person and among others for a popish priest among some for a wizard and among others for a murderer and all this for no other reason that i can imagine but because i do not hoot and hollow and make a noise it is true my friend sir roger tells them that it is my way and that i am only a philosopher but this  will not satisfy them they think there is more in me than he discovers and that i do not hold my tongue for nothing  for these and other reasons i shall set out for london to morrow having found by experience that the country is not a place for a person of my temper who does not love jollity and what they call goodneighbourhood a man that is out of humour when an unexpected guest breaks in upon him and does not care for sacrificing an afternoon to every chancecomer that will be the master of his own time and the pursuer of his own inclinations makes but a very unsociable figure in this kind of life i shall therefore retire into the town if i may make use of that phrase and get into the crowd again as fast as i can in order to be alone i can there raise what speculations i please upon others without being observed my self and at the same time enjoy all the advantages of company with all the privileges of solitude in the mean while to finish the month and conclude these my rural speculations i shall here insert a letter from my friend will honeycomb who has not lived a month for

the mean time the drummer the captains equipage was very loud that none of the captains things should be placed so as to be spoiled upon which his cloakebag was fixed in the seat of the coach and the captain himself according to a frequent tho invidious behaviour of military men ordered his man to look sharp that none but one of the ladies should have the place he had taken fronting to the coachbox  we were in some little time fixed in our seats and sat with that dislike which people not too goodnatured usually conceive of each other at first sight the coach jumbled us insensibly into some sort of familiarity and we had not moved above two miles when the widow asked the captain what success he had in his recruiting the officer with a frankness he believed very graceful told her that indeed he had but very little luck and had suffered much by desertion therefore should be glad to end his warfare in the service of her or her fair daughter in a word continued he i am a soldier and to be plain is my character you see me madam young sound and impudent take me your self widow or give me to her i will be wholly at your disposal i am a soldier of fortune ha this was followed by a vain laugh of his own and a deep silence of all the rest of the company i had nothing left for it but to fall fast asleep which i did with all speed come said he resolve upon it we will make a wedding at the next town we will wake this pleasant companion who is fallen asleep to be the brideman and giving the quaker a clap on the knee he concluded this sly saint who ill warrant understands whats what as well as you or i widow shall give the bride as father the quaker who happened to be a man of smartness answered friend i take it in good part that thou hast given me the authority of a father over this comely and virtuous child and i must assure thee that if i have the giving her i shall not bestow her on thee thy mirth friend savoureth of folly thou art a person of a light mind thy

thee to carry us to the great city we cannot go any other way this worthy mother must hear thee if thou wilt needs utter thy follies we cannot help it friend i say if thou wilt we must hear thee but if thou wert a man of understanding thou wouldst not take advantage of thy courageous countenance to abash us children of peace thou art thou sayest a soldier give quarter to us who cannot resist thee

should have been a little impertinent if thou hadst not reprimanded me come thou art i see a smoaky old fellow and ill be very orderly the ensuing part of the journey i was going  to give my self airs

each other for the future and assumed their different provinces in the conduct of the company our reckonings apartments and accommodation fell under ephraim and the captain looked to all disputes on the road as the good behaviour of our coachman and the right we had of taking place as going to london of all vehicles coming from thence the occurrences we met with were ordinary and very little happened which could entertain by the relation of them but when i considerd the company we were in i took it for no small good fortune that the whole journey was not spent in impertinences which to one part of us might be an entertainment to the other a suffering  what therefore ephraim said when we were almost arrivd at london had to me an air not only of good understanding but good breeding upon the young ladys expressing her satisfaction in the journey and declaring how delightful it had been to her ephraim declared himself as follows there is no ordinary part of humane life which expresseth so much a good mind and a right inward man as his behaviour upon meeting with strangers especially such as may seem the most unsuitable companions to him such a man when he falleth in the way with persons of simplicity and innocence however knowing he may be in the ways of men will not vaunt himself thereof but will the rather hide his superiority to them that he may not be painful unto them  my good friend continued he turning to the officer thee and i are to part by and by and peradventure we may never meet again but be advised by a plain man modes and apparel are but trifles to the real man therefore do not think such a man as thy self terrible for thy garb nor such a one as me contemptible for mine  when two such as thee and i meet with affections as we ought to have towards each other thou shouldst rejoice to see my peaceable demeanour and i should be glad to see thy strength and ability to protect me in it      footnote     the man who would not fight received

august        addison   est brevitate opus ut currat sententia   hor   i have somewhere read of an eminent person who used in his private offices of devotion to give thanks to heaven that he was born a frenchman for my own part i look upon it as a peculiar blessing that i was born an englishman among many other reasons i think my self very happy in my country as the language of it is wonderfully adapted to a man who  is sparing of his words and an enemy to loquacity  as i have frequently reflected on my good fortune in this particular i shall communicate to the publick my speculations upon the english tongue not doubting but they will be acceptable to all my curious readers  the english delight in silence more than any other european nation if the remarks which are made on us by foreigners are true our discourse is not kept up in conversation but falls into more pauses and intervals than in our neighbouring countries as it is observed that the matter of our writings is thrown much closer together and lies in a narrower compass than is usual in the works of foreign authors for to favour our natural taciturnity when we are obliged to utter our thoughts we do it in the shortest way we are able and give as quick a birth to our conception as possible  this humour shows itself in several remarks that we may make upon the english language as first of all by its abounding in monosyllables which gives us an opportunity of delivering our thoughts in few sounds this indeed takes off from the elegance of our tongue but at the same time expresses our ideas in the readiest manner and consequently answers the first design of speech better than the multitude of syllables which make the words of other languages more tunable and sonorous the sounds of our english words are commonly like those of string musick short and transient which  rise and perish upon a single touch those of other languages are like the notes of wind instruments sweet and swelling and lengthend out into variety of modulation  in the next place we may observe that where the words are not monosyllables we often make them so as much as lies in our power by our rapidity of pronounciation as it generally happens in most of our long words which are derived from the latin where we contract the length of the syllables that give them a grave and solemn air in their own language to make them more proper for dispatch and more conformable to the genius of our tongue this we may find in a multitude of words as liberty conspiracy theatre orator c  the same natural aversion to loquacity has of late years made a very considerable alteration in our language by closing in one syllable the termination of our præterperfect tense as in the words drownd walk d arrivd for drowned walked arrived which has very much disfigured the tongue and turned a tenth part of our smoothest words into so many clusters of consonants this is the more remarkable because the want of vowels in our language has been the general complaint of our politest authors who nevertheless are the men that have made these retrenchments and consequently very much increased our former scarcity  this reflection on the words that end in ed i have heard in conversation from one of the greatest geniuss this age has produced  i think we may add to the foregoing observation the change which has happened in our language by the abbreviation of several words that are terminated in eth by substituting an s in the room of the last syllable as in drowns walks arrives and innumerable other words which in the pronunciation of our forefathers were drowneth walketh arriveth this has wonderfully multiplied a letter which was before too frequent in the english tongue and added to that hissing in our language which is taken so much notice of by foreigners but at the same time humours our taciturnity and eases us of many superfluous syllables  i might here observe that the same single letter on many occasions does the office of a whole word and represents the his and her of our forefathers there is no doubt but the ear of a foreigner which is the best judge in this case would very much disapprove of such innovations which indeed we do our selves in some measure by retaining the old termination in writing and in all the solemn offices of our religion  as in the instances i have given we have epitomized many of our particular words to the detriment of our tongue so on other occasions we have drawn two words into one which has likewise very much untuned our language and clogged it with consonants as maynt cant shdnt wont and the like for may not can not shall not will not c  it is perhaps this humour of speaking no more than we needs must which has so miserably curtailed some of our words that in familiar writings and conversations they often lose all but their first syllables as in mob rep pos incog and the like and as all ridiculous words make their first entry into a language by familiar phrases i dare not answer for these that they will not in time be looked upon as a part of our tongue we see some of our poets have been so indiscreet as to imitate hudibrass doggrel expressions in their serious compositions by throwing out the signs of our substantives which are essential to the english language nay this humour of shortning our language had once run so far that some of our celebrated authors among whom we may reckon sir roger e estrange in particular began to prune their words of all superfluous letters as they termed them in order to adjust the spelling to the pronunciation which would have confounded all our etymologies and have quite destroyed our tongue  we may here likewise observe that our proper names when familiarized in english generally dwindle to monosyllables whereas in other modern languages they receive a softer turn on this occasion by the addition of a new syllable nick in italian is nicolini jack in french janot and so of the rest  there is another particular in our language which is a great instance of our frugality of words and that is the suppressing of several particles which must be produced in other tongues to make a sentence intelligible this often perplexes the best writers when they find the relatives whom which or they at their mercy whether they may have admission or not and will never be decided till we have something like an academy that by the best authorities and rules drawn from the analogy of languages shall settle all controversies between grammar and idiom  i have only considered our language as it shows the genius and natural temper of the english which is modest thoughtful and sincere and which perhaps may recommend the people though it has spoiled the tongue we might perhaps carry the same thought into other languages and deduce a greater part of what is peculiar to them from the genius of the people who speak them it is certain the light talkative humour of the french has not a little infected their tongue which might be shown by many instances as the genius of the italians which is so much addicted to musick and ceremony has moulded all their words and phrases to those particular uses the stateliness and gravity of the spaniards shews itself to perfection in the solemnity of their language and the blunt honest humour of the germans sounds better in the roughness of the high dutch than it would in a politer tongue  c      footnote     that return to footnote mark   footnote     that return   footnote     swift return  contents contents p     no

their discourses had upon me but to add to my misfortune by new thoughts and ideas and making me more ready in my language and capable of sometimes mixing seeming truths with my improbabilities with

adventures appears in an instant before me that i cannot help uttering them tho to my immediate confusion i cannot but know i am liable to be detected by the first man i meet  upon occasion of the mention of the battel of pultowa i could not forbear giving an account of a kinsman of mine a young merchant who was bred at mosco that had too much metal to attend books of entries and accounts when there was so active a scene in the country where he resided and followed the czar as a volunteer this warm youth born at the instant the thing was spoke of was the man who unhorsed the swedish general he was the occasion that the muscovites kept their fire in so soldierlike a manner and brought up those troops which were covered from the enemy at the beginning of the day besides this he had at last the good fortune to be the man who took count piper  with all this fire i knew my cousin to be the civilest creature in the world he never made any impertinent show of his valour and then he had an excellent genius for the world in every other kind i had letters from him here i felt in my pockets that exactly spoke the czars character which i knew perfectly  well and i could not forbear concluding that i lay with his imperial majesty twice or thrice a week all the while he lodged at deptford  what is worse than all this it is impossible to speak to me but you give me some occasion of coming out with one lie or other that has neither wit humour prospect of interest or any other motive that i can think of in nature the other day when one was commending an eminent and learned divine what occasion in the world had i to say methinks he would look more venerable if he were not so fair a man i remember the company smiled i have seen the gentleman since and he is coalblack i have intimations every day in my life that no body believes me yet i am never the better i was saying something the other day to an old friend at wills coffeehouse and he made me no manner of answer but told me that an acquaintance of tully the orator having two or three times together said to him without receiving any answer that upon his honour he was but that very month forty years of age tully answerd surely you think me the most incredulous man in the world if i dont believe what you have told me every day this ten years the mischief of it is i find myself wonderfully inclind to have been present at every occurrence that is spoken of before me this has led me into many inconveniencies but indeed they have been the fewer because i am no illnaturd man and never speak things to any mans disadvantage i never directly defame but i do what is as bad in the consequence for i have often made a man say such and such a lively expression who was born a mere elder brother when one has said in my hearing such a one is no wiser than he should be i immediately have replyd now faith i cant see that he said a very good thing to my lord such a one upon such an occasion and the like such an honest dolt as this has been watchd in every expression he uttered upon my recommendation of him and consequently been subject to the more ridicule i once endeavoured to cure my self of this impertinent quality and resolved to hold my tongue for seven days together i did so but then i had so many winks and unnecessary distortions of my face upon what any body else said that i found i only forbore the expression and that i still lied in my heart to every man i met with you are to know one thing which i believe youll say is a pity considering the use i should have made of it i never

says no she will not have it then i go back and her woman comes up to her and by this time she will have that and two or three things more in an instant the woman and i run to each other i am loaded and delivering the things to her when my lady says she wants none of all these things and we are the dullest creatures in the world and she the unhappiest woman living for she shant be dressd in any time thus we stand not knowing what to do when our good lady with all the patience in the world tells us as plain as she can speak that she will have temper because we have no manner of understanding and begins again to dress and see if we can find out of our selves what we are to do when she is dressed she goes to dinner and after she has disliked every thing there she calls for the coach then commands it in again and then she will not go out at all and then will go too and orders the chariot now good mr specter i desire you would in the behalf of all who serve froward ladies give out in your paper that nothing can be done without allowing time for it and that one cannot be back again with what one was sent for if one is called back before one can go a step for that they want and if

a pleasanter tyrant than either of the above represented a fat fellow was puffing on in his open waistcoat a boy of fourteen in a livery carrying after him his cloak upper coat hat wig and sword the poor lad was ready to sink with the weight and could not keep up with his master who turned back every half furlong and wondered what made the lazy young dog lag behind  there is something very unaccountable that people cannot put themselves in the condition of the persons below them when they consider the commands they give but there is nothing more common than to see a fellow who if he were reduced to it would not be hired by any man living lament that he is troubled with the most worthless dogs in nature  it would perhaps be running too far out of common life to urge that he who is not master of himself and his own passions cannot be a proper master of another æquanimity in a mans own words and actions will easily diffuse it self through his whole family pamphilio has the happiest household of any man i know and that proceeds from the humane regard he has to them in their private persons as well as in respect that they are his servants if there be any occasion wherein they may in themselves be supposed to be unfit to attend their masters concerns by reason of an attention to their own he is so good as to place himself in their condition i thought it very becoming

they had not had men he asserted also it seems that a minister at home no more than a commander abroad could do any thing without other men were his instruments and assistants on this occasion he

to be in company with the other day upon some occasion that he was pleased to take said he remembered a very pretty repartee made by a very witty man in king charless time upon the like occasion i remember said he upon entring into the tale much about the time of oatess plot that a cousingerman of mine and i were at the bear in holborn no i am out it was at the cross keys but jack thompson was there for he was very great with the gentleman who made the answer but i am sure it was spoken some where thereabouts for we drank a bottle in that neighbourhood every evening but no matter for all that the thing is the same but   he was going on to settle the geography of the jest when i left the room wondering at this odd turn of head which can play away its words with uttering nothing to the purpose still observing its own impertinencies and yet proceeding in them i do not question but he informed the rest of his audience who had more patience than i of the birth and parentage as well as the collateral alliances of his family who made the repartee and of him who provoked him to it  it is no small misfortune to any who have a just value for their time when this quality of being so very circumstantial and careful to be exact happens to shew it self in a man whose quality obliges them to attend his proofs that it is now day and the like but this is augmented when the same genius gets

sovereigns have it by impressions received from education only it creates an ambitious rather than a noble mind where it is the natural bent of the princes inclination it prompts him to the pursuit of things truly glorious the two greatest men now in europe according to the common acceptation of the word great are lewis king of france and peter emperor of russia as it is certain that all fame does not arise from the practice of virtue it is methinks no unpleasing amusement to examine the glory of these potentates and distinguish that which is empty perishing and frivolous from what is solid lasting and important lewis of france had his infancy attended by crafty and worldly men who made extent of territory the most glorious instance  of power and mistook the spreading of fame for the acquisition of honour the young monarchs heart was by such conversation easily deluded into a fondness for vainglory and upon these unjust principles to form or fall in with suitable projects of invasion rapine murder and all the guilts that attend war when it is unjust at the same time this tyranny was laid sciences and arts were encouraged in the most generous manner as if men of higher faculties were to be bribed to permit the massacre of the rest of the world every superstructure which the court of france built upon their first designs which were in themselves vicious was suitable to its false foundation the ostentation of riches the vanity of equipage shame of poverty and ignorance of modesty were the common arts of life the generous love of one woman was changed into gallantry for all the sex and friendships among men turned into commerces of interest or mere professions while these were the rules of life perjuries in the prince and a general corruption of manners in the subject were the snares in which france has entangled all her neighbours with such false colours have the eyes of lewis been enchanted from the debauchery of his early youth to the superstition of his present old age hence it is that he has the patience to have statues erected to his prowess his valour his fortitude and in the softnesses and luxury of a court to be applauded for magnanimity and enterprize in military atchievements  peter alexiwitz of russia when he came to years of manhood though he found himself emperor of a vast and numerous people master of an endless territory absolute commander of the lives and fortunes of his subjects in the midst of this unbounded power and greatness turned his thoughts upon himself and people with sorrow sordid ignorance and a brute manner of life this generous prince beheld and contemned from the light of his own genius his judgment suggested this to him and his courage prompted him to amend it in order to this he did not send to the nation from whence the rest of the world has borrowed its politeness but himself left his diadem to learn the true way to glory and honour and application to useful arts wherein to employ the laborious the simple the honest part of his people mechanick employments and operations were very justly the first objects of his favour and observation with this glorious intention he travelled into foreign nations in an obscure manner above receiving little honours where he sojourned but prying into what was of more consequence their arts of peace and of war by this means has this great prince laid the foundation of a great and lasting fame by personal labour personal knowledge personal valour it would be injury to any of antiquity to name them with him who but himself ever left a throne to learn to sit in it with more grace who ever thought himself mean in absolute power till he had learned to use it  if we consider this wonderful person it is perplexity to know where to begin his encomium others may in a metaphorical or philosophick sense be said to command themselves but this emperor is also literally under his own command how generous and how good was his entring his own name as a private man in the army he raised that none in it might expect to outrun the steps with which he himself advanced by such measures this godlike prince learned to conquer learned to use his conquests how terrible has he appeared in battel how gentle in victory shall then the base arts of the frenchman be held polite and the honest labours of the russian barbarous no barbarity is the ignorance of true honour or placing any thing instead of it the unjust prince is ignoble and barbarous the good prince only renowned and glorious  tho men may impose upon themselves what they please by their corrupt imaginations truth will ever keep its station and as glory is nothing else but the shadow of virtue it will certainly disappear at the departure of virtue but how carefully ought the true notions of it to be preserved and how industrious should we be to encourage any impulses towards it the westminster schoolboy that said the other day he could not sleep or play for the colours in the hall  ought to be free from receiving a blow for ever  but let us consider what is truly glorious according to the author i have to day quoted in the front of my paper  the perfection of glory says tully  consists in these three particulars that the people love us that they have confidence in us that being affected with a certain admiration towards us they think we deserve honour  this was spoken of greatness in a commonwealth but if one were to form a notion of consummate glory under our constitution one must add to the abovementioned felicities a certain necessary inexistence and disrelish of all the rest without the princes favour  he should methinks have riches power honour command glory but riches power honour command and glory should have no charms but as accompanied with the affection of his prince he should methinks be popular because a favourite and a favourite because popular  were it not to make the character too imaginary i would give him sovereignty over some foreign territory and make him esteem that an empty addition without the kind regards of his own prince  one may merely have an idea of a man thus composed and circumstantiated and if he were so made for power without an incapacity of giving jealousy he would be also glorious without possibility of receiving disgrace this humility and this importance must make his glory immortal  these thoughts are apt to draw me beyond the usual length of this paper but if i could suppose such rhapsodies coud outlive the common fate of ordinary things i would say these sketches and faint images of glory

wit and i could wish you would take some other opportunity to express further the corrupt taste the age is run into which i am chiefly apt to attribute to the prevalency of a few popular authors whose merit in some respects has given a sanction to their faults in others  thus the imitators of milton seem to place all the excellency of that sort of writing either in the uncouth or antique words or something else which was highly vicious tho pardonable in that great man  the admirers of what we call point or turn look upon it as the particular happiness to which cowley ovid and others owe their reputation and therefore imitate them only in such instances what is just proper and natural does not seem to be the question with them but by what means a quaint antithesis may be brought about how one word may be made to look two ways and what will be the consequence of a forced allusion  now tho such authors appear to me to resemble those who make themselves fine instead of being well dressed or graceful yet the mischief is that these beauties in them which i call blemishes are thought to proceed from luxuriance of fancy and overflowing of good sense in one word they have the character of being too witty but if you would acquaint the world they are not witty at all you would among many others oblige  sir  your most benevolent reader  r d     sir  i am a young woman and reckoned pretty

only stirs up and awakens this i could not attribute more to any thing than to the humour of putting company upon others which men do not like themselves pray sir declare in your papers that he who is

others of my acquaintance who are as little pleased with the ordinary manner of spending ones time as my self and if a fervent desire after knowledge and a great sense of our present ignorance may be thought a good presage and earnest of improvement you may look upon your time you shall bestow in answering this request not thrown away to no purpose and i cant but add that unless you have a particular and more than ordinary regard for eleonora i have a better title to your favour than she since i do not content myself with teatable reading of your papers but it is my entertainment very

i have several applications from the lower part of the players to admit suffering to pass for acting they in very obliging terms desire me to let a fall on the ground a stumble or a good slap on the back be reckoned a jest these gambols i shall tolerate for a season because i hope the evil cannot continue longer than till the people of condition and taste return to town the method some time ago was to entertain that part of the audience who have no faculty above eyesight with ropedancers and tumblers which was a way discreet enough because it prevented confusion and distinguished such as could show all the postures which the body is capable of from those who were to represent all the passions to which the mind is subject but tho this was prudently settled corporeal and intellectual actors ought to be kept at a still wider distance than to appear on the same stage at all for which reason i must propose some methods for the improvement of the beargarden by dismissing all bodily actors to that quarter  in cases of greater moment where men appear in publick the consequence and importance of the thing can bear them out and tho a pleader or preacher is hoarse or awkward the weight of the matter commands respect and attention but in theatrical speaking if the performer is not exactly proper and graceful he is utterly ridiculous in cases where there is little else expected but the pleasure of the ears and eyes the least diminution of that pleasure is the highest offence in acting barely to perform the part is not commendable but to be the least out is contemptible to avoid these difficulties and delicacies i am informed that while i was out of town the actors have flown in the air and played such pranks and run such hazards that none but the servants of the fireoffice tilers and masons could have been able to perform the like the author of the following letter it seems has been of the audience at one of these entertainments and has accordingly complained to me upon it but i think he has been to the utmost degree severe against what is exceptionable in the play he mentions without dwelling so much as he might have done on the authors most excellent talent of humour the pleasant pictures he has drawn of life should have been more kindly mentioned at the same time that he banishes his witches who are too dull devils to be attacked with so much warmth mr spectator  upon a report that moll white had followed you to town and was to act a part in the lancashirewitches i went last week to see that play  it was my fortune to sit next to a country justice of the peace a neighbour as he said of sir rogers who pretended to shew her to us in one of the dances there was witchcraft enough in the entertainment almost to incline me to believe him ben johnson was almost lamed young bullock narrowly saved his neck the audience was astonished and an old acquaintance of mine a person of worth whom i would have bowed to in the pit at two yards distance did not know me  if you were what the country people reported you a white witch i could have wished you had been there to have exorcised that rabble of broomsticks with which we were haunted for above three hours i could have allowed them to set clod in the tree to have scared the sportsmen plagued the justice and employed honest teague with his holy water this was the proper use of them in comedy if the author had stopped here but i cannot conceive what relation the sacrifice of the black lamb and the ceremonies of their worship to the devil have to the business of mirth and humour  the gentleman who writ this play and has drawn some characters in it very justly appears to have been misled in his witchcraft by an unwary following the inimitable shakespear the incantations in mackbeth have a solemnity admirably adapted to the occasion of that tragedy and fill the mind with a suitable horror besides that the witches are a part of the story it self as we find it very particularly related in hector bœtius from whom he seems to have taken it this therefore is a proper machine where the business is dark horrid and bloody but is extremely foreign from the affair of comedy subjects of this kind which are in themselves disagreeable can at no time become entertaining but by passing through an imagination like shakespears to form them for which reason mr dryden would not allow even beaumont and fletcher capable of imitating him but shakespears magick coud not copyd be within that circle none durst walk but he  i should not however have troubled you with these remarks if there were not something else in this comedy which wants to be exorcised more than the witches i mean the freedom of some passages which i should have overlookd if i had not observed that those jests can raise the loudest mirth though they are painful to right sense and an outrage upon modesty  we must attribute such liberties to the taste of that age but indeed by such representations a poet sacrifices the best part of his audience to the worst and as one would think neglects the boxes to write to the orangewenches  i must not conclude till i have taken notice of the moral with which this comedy ends the two young ladies having given a notable example of outwitting those who had a right in the disposal of them and marrying without consent of parents one of the injurd parties who is easily reconciled winds up all with this remark  design whateer we will there is a fate which overrules us still we are to suppose that the gallants are men of merit but if they had been rakes the excuse might have servd as well hans carvels wife  was of the same principle but has expressd it with a delicacy which shews she is not serious in her excuse but in a sort of humorous philosophy turns off the thought of her guilt and says that if weak women go astray their stars are more in fault than they this no doubt is a full reparation and dismisses the audience with very edifying impressions  these things fall under a province you have partly pursued already and therefore demand your animadversion for the regulating so noble an entertainment as that of the stage it were to be wished that all who write for it hereafter would raise their genius by the ambition of pleasing people of the best understanding and leave others who shew nothing of the human species but risibility to seek their

themselves he should not take it ill if a servant is ordered to present him with a porringer of cawdle or possetdrink by way of admonition that he go home to bed that part of life which we ordinarily understand by the word conversation is an indulgence to the sociable part of our make and should incline us to bring our proportion of good will or good humour among the friends we meet with and not to trouble them with relations which must of necessity oblige them to a real or feigned affliction cares distresses diseases uneasinesses and dislikes of our own are by no means to be obtruded upon our friends if we would consider how little of this vicissitude of motion and rest which we call life is spent with satisfaction we should be more tender of our friends than to bring them little sorrows which do not belong to them there is no real life but chearful life therefore valetudinarians should be sworn before they enter into company not to say a word of themselves till the meeting breaks up it is not here pretended that we should be always sitting  with chaplets of flowers round our heads or be crowned with roses in order to make our entertainment agreeable to us but if as it is usually observed they who resolve to be merry seldom are so it will be much more unlikely for us to be wellpleased if they are admitted who are always complaining they are sad whatever we do we should keep up the chearfulness of our spirits and never let them sink below an inclination at least to be wellpleased the way to this is to keep our bodies in exercise our minds at ease that insipid state wherein neither are in vigour is not to be accounted any part of our portion of being when we are in the satisfaction of some innocent pleasure or pursuit of some laudable design we are in the possession of life of human life fortune will give us disappointments enough and nature is attended with infirmities enough without our adding to the unhappy side of our account by our spleen or ill

vanity and affectation and follow nature is not to be broken because it has no points to contend for to be anxious for nothing but what nature demands as necessary if it is not the way to an estate is the way to what men aim at by getting an estate this temper will preserve health in the body as well as tranquility in the mind cottilus sees the world in a hurry with the same scorn that a sober person sees a man drunk had he been contented with what he ought to have been how could says he such a one have met with such a disappointment if another had valued his mistress for what he ought to have lovd her he had not been in her power if her virtue had had a part of his passion her levity had been his cure she could not then have been false and amiable at the same time  since we cannot promise ourselves constant health let us endeavour at such a temper as may be our best support in the decay of it uranius has arrived at that composure of soul and wrought himself up to such a neglect of every thing with which the generality of mankind is enchanted that nothing but acute pains can give him disturbance and against those too he will tell his intimate friends he has a secret which gives him present ease uranius is so thoroughly perswaded of another life and endeavours so sincerely to secure an interest in it that he looks upon pain but as a quickening of his pace to an home where he shall be better provided for than in his present apartment instead of the melancholy views which others are apt to give themselves he will tell you that he has forgot he is mortal nor will he think of himself as such he thinks at the time of his birth he entered into an eternal being and the short article of death he will not allow an interruption of life since that moment is not of half the duration as is his ordinary sleep thus is his being one uniform and consistent series of chearful diversions and moderate cares without fear or hope of futurity health to him is more than pleasure to another man and sickness less affecting to him than indisposition is to others  i must confess if one does not regard life after this manner none but ideots can pass it away with any tolerable patience take a fine lady who is of a delicate frame and you may observe from the hour she rises a certain weariness of all that passes about her i know more than one who is much too nice to be quite alive they are sick of such strange frightful people that they meet one is so awkward and another so disagreeable that it looks like a penance to breathe the same air with them you see this is so very true that a great part of ceremony and goodbreeding among ladies turns upon their uneasiness and ill undertake if the howdye servants of our women were to make a weekly bill of sickness as the parish clerks do of mortality you would not find in an account of seven days one in thirty that was not downright sick or indisposed or but a very little better than she was and so forth  it is certain that to enjoy life and health as a constant feast we should not think pleasure necessary but if possible to arrive at an equality of mind it is as mean to be overjoyed upon occasions of goodfortune as to be dejected in circumstances of distress laughter in one condition is as unmanly as weeping in the other we should not form our minds to expect transport on every occasion but know how to make it enjoyment to be out of pain ambition envy vagrant desire or impertinent mirth will take up our minds without we can possess our selves in that sobriety of heart which is above all pleasures and can be felt much better than described but the ready way i believe to the right enjoyment of life is by a prospect towards another to have but a very mean opinion of it a great author of our time has set this in an excellent light when with a philosophick pity of human life he spoke of it in his theory of the earth  in the following manner for what is this life but a circulation of little mean actions we lie down and rise again dress and undress feed and wax hungry work or play and are weary and then we lie down again and the circle returns we spend the day in trifles and when the night comes we throw our selves into the bed of folly amongst dreams and broken thoughts and wild imaginations our reason lies asleep by us and we are for the time as arrant brutes as those that sleep in the stalls or in the field are not the capacities of man higher than these and ought not his ambition and expectations to be greater let us be adventurers for another world tis at least a fair and noble chance and there is nothing in this worth our thoughts or our passions if we should be disappointed we are still no worse than the rest of our fellowmortals and if we succeed in our expectations we are

formarum spectator siem  ter   beauty has been the delight and torment of the world ever since it began the philosophers have felt its influence so sensibly that almost every one of them has left us some saying or other which has intimated that he too well knew the power of it one  has told us that a graceful person is a more powerful recommendation than the best letter that can be writ in your favour another  desires the possessor of it to consider it as a meer gift of nature and not any perfection of his own a third  calls it a short livd tyranny a fourth  a silent fraud because it imposes upon us without the help of language but i think carneades spoke as much like a philosopher as any of them tho more like a lover when he calld it royalty without force it is not indeed to be denied that there is something irresistible in a beauteous form the most severe will not pretend that they do not feel an immediate prepossession in favour of the handsome no one denies them the privilege of being first heard and being regarded before others in matters of ordinary consideration at the same time the handsome should consider that it is a possession as it were foreign to them no one can give it himself or preserve it when they have it yet so it is that people can bear any quality in the world better than beauty it is the consolation of all who are naturally too much affected with the force of it that a little attention if a man can attend with judgment will cure them handsome people usually are so fantastically pleasd with themselves that if they do not kill at first sight as the phrase is a second interview disarms them of all their power but i shall make this paper rather a warningpiece to give notice where the danger is than to propose instructions how to avoid it when you

with the arts of goodbreeding without leaving nature she has not lost the native simplicity of her aspect to substitute that patience of being stared at which is the usual triumph and distinction of a town lady in publick assemblies you meet her careless eye diverting itself with the objects around her insensible that she her self is one of the brightest in the place  dulcissa is quite of another make she is almost a beauty by nature but more than one by art if it were possible for her to let her fan or any limb about her rest she would do some part of the execution she meditates but tho she designs her self a prey she will not stay to be taken no painter can give you words for the different aspects of dulcissa in half a moment whereever she appears so little does she accomplish what she takes so much pains for to be gay and careless  merab is attended with all the charms of woman and accomplishments of man it is not to be doubted but she has a great deal of wit if she were not such a beauty and she would have more beauty had she not so much wit affectation prevents her excellencies from walking together if she has a mind to speak such a thing it must be done with such an air of her body and if she has an inclination to look very careless there is such a smart thing to be said at the same time that the design of being admired destroys it self thus the unhappy merab tho a wit and beauty is allowed to be neither because she will always be both  albacinda has the skill as well as power of pleasing her form is majestick but her aspect humble all good men should beware of the destroyer she will speak to you like your sister till she has you sure but is the most vexatious of tyrants when you are so her familiarity of behaviour her indifferent questions and general conversation make the silly part of her votaries full of hopes while the wise fly from her power she well knows she is too beautiful and too witty to be indifferent to any who converse with her and therefore knows she does not lessen herself by familiarity but gains occasions of admiration by seeming ignorance of her perfections  eudosia adds to the height of her stature a nobility of spirit which still distinguishes her above the rest of her sex beauty in others is lovely in others agreeable in others attractive but in eudosia it is commanding love towards eudosia is a sentiment like the love of glory the lovers of other women are softened into fondness the admirers of eudosia exalted into ambition  eucratia presents her self to the imagination with a more kindly pleasure and as she is woman her praise is wholly feminine if we were to form an image of dignity in a man we should give him wisdom and valour as being essential to the character of manhood in like manner if you describe a right woman in a laudable sense she should have gentle softness tender fear and all those parts of life which distinguish her from the other sex with some subordination to it but such an inferiority that makes her still more lovely eucratia is that creature she is all over woman kindness is all her art and beauty all her arms her look her voice her gesture and whole behaviour is truly feminine a goodness mixed with fear gives a tincture to all her behaviour it would be savage to offend her and cruelty to use art to gain her others are beautiful but eucratia  thou art beauty  omnamante is made for deceit she has an aspect as innocent as the famed lucrece but a mind as wild as the more famed cleopatra her face speaks a vestal but her heart a messalina who that beheld

entertainment we meet with in the philosophick parts of ciceros writings truth and good sense have there so charming a dress that they could hardly be more agreeably represented with the addition of poetical fiction and the power of numbers this ancient author and a modern one had fallen into my hands within these few days and the impressions they have left upon me have at the present quite spoiled me for a merry fellow the modern is that admirable writer the author of the theory of the earth the subjects with which i have lately been entertained in them both bear a near affinity they are upon enquiries into hereafter and the thoughts of the latter seem to me to be raised above those of the former in proportion to his advantages of scripture and revelation if i had a mind to it i could not at present talk of any thing else therefore i shall translate a passage in the one and transcribe a paragraph out of the other for the speculation of this day cicero tells us  that plato reports socrates upon receiving his sentence to have spoken to his judges in the following manner i have great hopes oh my judges that it is infinitely to my advantage that i am sent to death for it is of necessity that one of these two things must be the consequence death must take away all these senses or convey me to another life if all sense is to be taken away and death is no more than that profound sleep without dreams in which we are sometimes buried oh heavens how desirable is it to die how many days do we know in life preferable to such a state but if it be true that death is but a passage to places which they who lived before us do now inhabit how much still happier is it to go from those who call themselves judges to appear before those that really are such before minos rhadamanthus æacus and triptolemus and to meet men who have lived with justice and truth is this do you think no happy journey do you think it nothing to speak with orpheus musceus homer and hesiod i would indeed suffer many deaths to enjoy these things with what particular delight should i talk to palamedes ajax and others who like me have suffered by the iniquity of their judges i should examine the wisdom of that great prince who carried such mighty forces against troy and argue with ulysses and sisyphus upon difficult points as i have in conversation here without being in danger of being condemned but let not those among you who have pronounced me an innocent man be afraid of death no harm can arrive at a good man whether dead or living his affairs are always under the direction of the gods nor will i believe the fate which is allotted to me myself this day to have arrived by chance nor have i ought to say either against my judges or accusers but that they thought they did me an injury  but i detain you too long it is time that i retire to death and you to your affairs of life which of us has the better is known to the gods but to no mortal man the divine socrates is here represented in a figure worthy his great wisdom and philosophy worthy the greatest mere man that ever breathed but the modern discourse is written upon a subject no less than the dissolution of nature it self oh how glorious is the old age of that great man who has spent his time in such contemplations as has made this being what only it should be an education for heaven he has according to the lights of reason and revelation which seemed to him clearest traced the steps of omnipotence he has with a celestial ambition as far as it is consistent with humility and devotion examined the ways of providence from the creation to the dissolution of the visible world how pleasing must have been the speculation to observe nature and providence move together the physical and moral world march the same pace to observe paradise and eternal spring the seat of innocence troubled seasons and angry skies the portion of wickedness and vice when this admirable author has reviewed all that has past or is to come which relates to the habitable world and run through the whole fate of it how could a guardian angel that had attended it through all its courses or changes speak more emphatically at the end of his charge than does our author when he makes as it were a funeral oration over this globe looking to the point where it once stood  let us only if you please to take leave of this subject reflect upon this occasion on the vanity and transient glory of this habitable world how by the force of one element breaking loose upon the rest all the vanities of nature all the works of art all the labours of men are reduced to nothing all that we admired and adored before as great and magnificent is obliterated or vanished and another form and face of things plain simple and every where the

consideration some particulars on that subject and what more worthy your observation than this a thing so publick and of so high consequence it is indeed wonderful that the frequent exercise of it should not make the performers of that duty more expert in it this inability as i conceive proceeds from the little care that is taken of their reading while boys and at school where when they are got into latin they are looked upon as above english the reading of which is wholly neglected or at least read to very little purpose without any due observations made to them of the proper accent and manner of reading by this means they have acquired such ill habits as wont easily be removed the only way that i know of to remedy this is to propose some person of great ability that way as a pattern for them example being most effectual to convince the learned as well as instruct the ignorant  you must know sir ive been a constant frequenter of the service of the church of england for above these four years last past and till sunday was sevennight never discovered to so great a degree the excellency of the commonprayer when being at st jamess garlickhill church i heard the service read so distinctly so emphatically and so fervently that it was next to an impossibility to be unattentive my eyes and my thoughts could not wander as usual but were confind to my prayers i then considered i addressed my self to the almighty and not to a beautiful face and when i reflected on my former performances of that duty i found i had run it over as a matter of form in comparison to the manner in which i then discharged it my mind was really affected and fervent wishes accompanied my words the confession was read with such a resigned humility the absolution with such a comfortable authority the thanksgivings with such a religious joy as made me feel those affections of the mind in a manner i never did before to remedy therefore the grievance above complained of i humbly propose that this excellent reader  upon the next and every annual assembly of the clergy of sioncollege and all other conventions should read prayers before them for then those that are afraid of stretching their mouths and spoiling their soft voice will learn to read with clearness loudness and strength others that affect a rakish negligent air by folding their arms and lolling on their book will be taught a decent behaviour and comely erection of body those that read so fast as if impatient of their work may learn to speak deliberately there is another sort of persons whom i call pindarick readers as being confined to no set measure these pronounce five or six words with great deliberation and the five or six subsequent ones with as great celerity the first part of a sentence with a very exalted voice and the latter part with a submissive one sometimes again with one sort of a tone and immediately after with a very different one these gentlemen will learn of my admired reader an evenness of voice and delivery and all who are innocent of these affectations but read with such an indifferency as if they did not understand the language may then be informed of the art of reading movingly and fervently how to place the emphasis and give the proper accent to each word and how to vary the voice according to the nature of the sentence there is certainly a very great difference between the reading a prayer and a gazette which i beg of you to inform a set of readers who affect forsooth a certain gentlemanlike familiarity of tone and mend the language as they go on crying instead of pardoneth and absolveth pardons and absolves these are often pretty classical scholars and would think it an unpardonable sin to read virgil or martial with so little taste as they do divine service  this indifferency seems to me to arise from the endeavour of avoiding the imputation of cant and the false notion of it it will be proper therefore to trace the original and signification of this word cant is by some people derived from one andrew cant who they say was a presbyterian minister in some illiterate part of scotland who by exercise and use had obtained the faculty alias gift of talking in the pulpit in such a dialect that its said he was understood by none but his own congregation and not by all of them since mas cants time it has been understood in a larger sense and signifies all sudden exclamations whinings unusual tones and in fine all praying and preaching like the unlearned of the presbyterians but i hope a proper elevation of voice a due emphasis and accent are not to come within this description so that our readers may still be as unlike the presbyterians as they please the dissenters i mean such as i have heard do indeed elevate their voices but it is with sudden jumps from the lower to the higher part of them and that with so little sense or skill that their elevation and cadence is bawling and muttering they make use of an emphasis but so improperly that it is often placed on some very insignificant particle as upon if or and now if these improprieties have so great an effect on the people as we see they have how great an influence would the service of our church containing the best prayers that ever were composed and that in terms most affecting most humble and most expressive of our wants and dependance on the object of our worship disposd in most proper order and void of all confusion what influence i say would these prayers have were they delivered with a due emphasis and apposite rising and variation of voice the sentence concluded with a gentle cadence and in a word with such an accent and turn of speech as is peculiar to prayer  as the matter of worship is now managed in dissenting congregations you find insignificant words and phrases raised by a lively vehemence in our own churches the most exalted sense depreciated by a dispassionate indolence i remember to have heard dr s — e  say in his pulpit of the commonprayer that at least it was as perfect as any thing of human institution if the gentlemen who err in this kind would please to recollect the many pleasantries they have read upon those who recite good things with an ill grace they would go on to think that what in that case is only ridiculous in themselves is impious but leaving this to their own reflections i shall conclude this trouble with what cæsar said

lately complained of and i published an account of are so far from being amended that new evils arise every day to interrupt their conversation in contempt of my reproofs my friend who writes from the coffeehouse near the temple informs me that the gentleman who constantly sings a voluntary in spite of the whole company was more musical than ordinary after reading my paper and has not been contented with that but has danced up to the glass in the middle of the room and practised minuetsteps to his own humming the incorrigible creature has gone still further and in the open coffeehouse with one hand extended as leading a lady in it he has danced both french and countrydances and admonished his supposed partner by smiles and nods to hold up her head and fall back according to the respective facings and evolutions of the dance before this gentleman began this his exercise he was pleased to clear his throat by coughing and spitting a full half hour and as soon as he struck up he appealed to an attorneys clerk in the room whether he hit as he ought since you from death have saved me and then asked the young fellow pointing to a chancerybill under his arm whether that was an operascore he carried or not without staying for an answer he fell into the exercise abovementioned and practised his airs to the full house who were turned upon him without the least shame or repentance for his former transgressions  i am to the last degree at a loss what to do with this young fellow except i declare him an outlaw and pronounce it penal for any one to speak to him in the said house which he frequents and direct that he be obliged to drink his tea and coffee without sugar and not receive from any person whatsoever any thing above mere necessaries  as we in england are a sober people and generally inclined rather to a certain bashfulness of behaviour in publick it is amazing whence some fellows come whom one meets with in this town they do not at all seem to be the growth of our island the pert the talkative all such as have no sense of the observations of others are certainly of foreign extraction as for my part i am as much surprised when i see a talkative englishman as i should be to see the indian pine growing on one of our quickset hedges where these creatures get sun enough to make them such lively animals and dull men is above my philosophy  there are another kind of impertinents which a man is perplexed with in mixed company and those are your loud speakers these treat mankind as if we were all deaf they do not express but declare themselves many of these are guilty of this outrage out of vanity because they think all they say is well or that they have their own persons in such veneration that they believe nothing which concerns them can be insignificant to any body else for these peoples sake i have often lamented that we cannot close our ears with as much ease as we can our eyes it is very uneasy that we must necessarily be under persecution next to these bawlers is a troublesome creature who comes with the air of your friend and your intimate and that is your whisperer there is one of them at a coffeehouse which i my self frequent who observing me to be a man pretty well made for secrets gets by me and with a whisper tells me things which all the town knows it is no very hard matter to guess at the source of this impertinence which is nothing else but a method or mechanick art of being wise you never see any frequent in it whom you can suppose to have anything in the world to do these persons are worse than bawlers as much as a secret enemy is more dangerous than a declared one i wish this my coffeehouse friend would take this for an intimation that i have not heard one word he has told me for these several years whereas he now thinks me the most trusty repository of his secrets the whisperers have a pleasant way of ending the close conversation with saying aloud do not you think so then whisper again and then aloud but you know that person then whisper again the thing would be well enough if they whisperd to keep the folly of what they say among friends but alas they do it to preserve the importance of their thoughts i am sure i could name you more than one person whom no man living ever heard talk upon any subject in nature or ever saw in his whole life with a book in his hand that i know not how can whisper something like knowledge of what has and does pass in the world which you would think he learned from some familiar spirit that did not think him worthy to receive the whole story but in truth whisperers deal only in half accounts of what they entertain you with a great help to their discourse is that the town says and people begin to talk very freely and they had it from persons too considerable to be named what they will tell you when things are riper my friend has winked upon me any day since i came to town last and has communicated to me as a secret that he designed in a very short time to tell me a secret but i shall know what he means he now assures me in less than a fortnights time  but i must not omit the dearer part of mankind i mean the ladies to take up a whole paper upon grievances which concern the men only but shall humbly propose that we change fools for an experiment only a certain set of ladies complain they are frequently perplexed with a visitant who affects to be wiser than they are which character he hopes to preserve by an obstinate gravity and great guard against discovering his opinion upon any occasion whatsoever a painful silence has hitherto gained him no further advantage than that as he might if he had behaved himself with freedom been excepted against but as to this and that particular he now offends in the whole to relieve these ladies my good friends and correspondents i shall exchange my dancing outlaw for their dumb visitant and assign the silent gentleman all the haunts of the dancer in order to

of a country gentleman who has left me entire mistress of a large fortune which he agreed to as an equivalent for the difference in our years in these circumstances it is not extraordinary to have a crowd of admirers which i have abridged in my own thoughts and reduced to a couple of candidates only both young and neither of them disagreeable in their persons according to the common way of computing in one the estate more than deserves my fortune and in the other my fortune more than deserves the estate when i consider the first i own i am so far a woman i cannot avoid being delighted with the thoughts of living great but then he seems to receive such a degree of courage from the knowledge of what he has he looks as if he was going to confer an obligation on me and the readiness he accosts me with makes me jealous i am only hearing a repetition of the same things he has said to a hundred women before when i consider the other i see myself approached with so much modesty and respect and such a doubt of himself as betrays methinks an affection within and a belief at the same time that he himself would be the only gainer by my consent what an unexceptionable husband could i make out of both but since thats impossible i beg to be concluded by your opinion it is absolutely in your power to dispose of  your most obedient servant sylvia     madam  you do me great honour in your application to me on this important occasion i shall therefore talk to you with the tenderness of a father in gratitude for your giving me the authority of one you do not seem to make any great distinction between these gentlemen as to their persons the whole question lies upon their circumstances and behaviour if the one is less respectful because he is rich and the other more obsequious because he is not so they are in that point moved by the same principle the consideration of fortune and you must place them in each others circumstances before you can judge of their inclination to avoid confusion in discussing this point i will call the richer man strephon and the other florio if you believe florio with strephons estate would behave himself as he does now florio is certainly your man but if you think strephon were he in florios condition would be as obsequious as florio is now you ought for your own sake to choose strephon for where the men are equal there is no doubt riches ought to be a reason for preference after this manner my dear child i would have you abstract them from their circumstances for you are to take it for granted that he who is very humble only because he is poor is the very same man in nature with him who is haughty because he is rich  when you have gone thus far as to consider the figure they make towards you you will please my dear next to consider the appearance you make towards them if they are men of discerning they can observe the motives of your heart and florio can see when he is disregarded only upon your account of fortune which makes you to him a mercenary creature and you are still the same thing to strephon in taking him for his wealth only you are therefore to consider whether you had rather oblige than receive an obligation  the marriagelife is always an insipid a vexatious or an happy condition the first is when two people of no genius or taste for themselves meet together upon such a settlement as has been thought reasonable by parents and conveyancers from an exact valuation of the land and cash of both parties in this case the young ladys person is no more regarded than the house and improvements in purchase of an estate but she goes with her fortune rather than her fortune with her these make up the crowd or vulgar of the rich and fill up the lumber of human race without beneficence towards those below them or respect towards those above them and lead a despicable independent and useless life without sense of the laws of kindness goodnature mutual offices and the elegant satisfactions which flow from reason and virtue  the vexatious life arises from a conjunction of two people of quick taste and resentment put together for reasons well known to their friends in which especial care is taken to avoid what they think the chief of evils poverty and insure to them riches with every evil besides these good people live in a constant constraint before company and too great familiarity alone when they are within observation they fret at each others carriage and behaviour when alone they revile each others person and conduct in company they are in a purgatory when only together in an hell  the happy marriage is where two persons meet and voluntarily make choice of each other without principally regarding or neglecting the circumstances of fortune or beauty these may still love in spite of adversity or sickness the former we may in some measure defend our selves from the other is the portion of our very make when you have a true notion of this sort of passion your humour of living great will vanish out of your imagination and you will find love has nothing to do with state solitude with the person beloved has a pleasure even in a womans mind beyond show or pomp you are therefore to consider which of your lovers will like you best undressed which will bear with you most when out of humour and your way to this is to ask your self which of them you value most for his own sake and by that judge which gives the greater instances of his valuing you for your self only  after you have expressed some sense of the humble approach of florio and a little disdain at strephons assurance in his address you cry out what an unexceptionable husband could i make out of both it would therefore methinks be a good way to determine your self take him in whom what you like is not transferable to another for if you choose otherwise there is no hopes your husband will ever have what you liked in his rival but intrinsick qualities in one man may very probably purchase every thing that is adventitious in another  in plainer terms he whom you take for his personal perfections will sooner arrive at the gifts of fortune than he whom you take for the sake of his fortune attain to personal perfections if strephon is not as accomplished and agreeable as florio marriage to you will never make him so but marriage to you may make florio as rich as strephon therefore to make a sure purchase employ fortune upon certainties but do not sacrifice certainties to fortune  i am your most obedient humble servant      footnote     any other return to footnote mark  contents

into the country i heard the hawkers with great vehemence crying about a paper entitled the ninety nine plagues of an empty purse i had indeed some time before observed that the orators of grubstreet had dealt very much in plagues they have already published in the same month the plagues of matrimony the plagues of a single life the nineteen plagues of a chambermaid the plagues of a coachman the plagues of a footman and the plague of plagues the success these several plagues met with probably gave occasion to the abovementioned poem on an empty purse however that be the same noise so frequently repeated under my window drew me insensibly to think on some of those inconveniences and mortifications which usually attend on poverty and in short gave birth to the present speculation for after my fancy had run over the most obvious and common calamities which men of mean fortunes are liable to it descended to those little insults and contempts which though they may seem to dwindle into nothing when a man offers to describe them are perhaps in themselves more cutting and insupportable than the former juvenal with a great deal of humour and reason tells us that nothing bore harder upon a poor man in his time than the continual ridicule which his habit and dress afforded to the beaus of rome quid quod materiam præbet causasque jocorum omnibus hic idem si fœda et scissa lacerna si toga sordidula est et rupta calceus alter pelle patet vel si consuto vulnere crassum atque recens linam ostendit non una cicatrix  juv sat     add that the rich have still a gibe in store

want is the scorn of every wealthy fool and wit in rags is turnd to ridicule  dryd it must be confessd that few things make a man appear more despicable or more prejudice his hearers against what he is going to offer than an awkward or pitiful dress insomuch that i fancy had tully himself pronounced one of his orations with a blanket about his shoulders more people would have laughed at his dress than have admired his eloquence this last reflection made me wonder at a set of men who without being subjected to it by the unkindness of their fortunes are contented to draw upon themselves the ridicule of the world in this particular i mean such as take it into their heads that the first regular step to be a wit is to commence a sloven it is certain nothing has so much debased that which must have been otherwise so great a character and i know not how to account for it unless it may possibly be in complaisance to those narrow minds who can have no notion of the same persons possessing different accomplishments or that it is a sort of sacrifice which some men are contented to make to calumny by allowing it to fasten on one part of their character while they are endeavouring to establish another yet however unaccountable this foolish custom is i am afraid it could plead a long prescription and probably gave too much occasion for the vulgar definition still remaining among us of an heathen philosopher  i have seen the speech of a terræfilius spoken in king charles iis reign in which he describes two very eminent men who were perhaps the greatest scholars of their age and after having mentioned the entire friendship between them concludes that they had but one mind one purse one chamber and one hat the men of business were also infected with a sort of singularity little better than this i have heard my father say that a broadbrimmd hat short hair and unfolded hankerchief were in his time absolutely necessary to denote a notable man and that he had known two or three who aspired to the character of very notable wear shoestrings with great success  to the honour of our present age it must be allowed that some of our greatest geniuss for wit and business have almost entirely broke the neck of these absurdities  victor after having dispatched the most important affairs of the commonwealth has appeared at an assembly where all the ladies have declared him the genteelest man in the company and in atticus though every way one of the greatest geniuss the age has produced one sees nothing particular in his dress or carriage to denote his pretensions to wit and learning so that at present a man may venture to cock up his hat and wear a fashionable wig without being taken for a rake or a fool  the medium between a fop and a sloven is what a man of sense would endeavour to keep yet i remember mr osbourn advises his son  to appear in his habit rather above than below his fortune and tells him that he will find an handsom suit of cloathes always procures some additional respect i have indeed myself observed that my banker bows lowest to me when i wear my fullbottomd wig and writes me mr or esq accordingly as he sees me dressed  i shall conclude this paper with an adventure which i was myself an eyewitness of very lately  i happened the other day to call in at a celebrated coffeehouse near the temple i had not been there long when there came in an elderly man very meanly dressed and sat down by me he had a threadbare loose coat on which it was plain he wore to keep himself warm and not to favour his under suit which seemed to have been at least its contemporary his short wig and hat were both answerable to the rest of his apparel he was no sooner seated than he called for a dish of tea but as several gentlemen in the room wanted other things the boys of the house did not think themselves at leisure to mind him i could observe the old fellow was very uneasy at the affront and at his being obliged to repeat his commands several times to no purpose till at last one of the lads  presented him with some stale tea in a broken dish accompanied with a plate of brown sugar which so raised his indignation that after several obliging appellations of dog and rascal he asked him aloud before the whole company why he must be used with less respect than that fop there pointing to a welldressed young gentleman who was drinking tea at the opposite table the boy of the house replied with a great  deal of pertness that his master had two sorts of customers and that the gentleman at the other table had given him many a sixpence for wiping his shoes by this time the young templar who found his honour concerned in the dispute and that the eyes of the whole coffeehouse were upon him had thrown aside a paper he had in his hand and was coming towards us while we at the table made what haste we could to get away from the impending quarrel but were all of us surprised to see him as he approached nearer put on an air of deference and respect to whom the old man said hark you sirrah ill pay off your extravagant bills once more but will take effectual care for the future that your prodigality shall not spirit up a parcel of rascals to insult your father  tho i by no means approve either the impudence of the servants or the extravagance of the son i cannot but think the old gentleman was in some measure justly

know no one character that gives reason a greater shock at the same time that it presents a good ridiculous image to the imagination than that of a man of wit and pleasure about the town this description of a man of fashion spoken by some with a mixture of scorn and ridicule by others with great gravity as a laudable distinction is in every bodys mouth that spends any time in conversation my friend will honeycomb has this expression very frequently and i never could understand by the story which follows upon his mention of such a one but that his man of wit and pleasure was either a drunkard too old for wenching or a young lewd fellow with some liveliness who would converse with you receive kind offices of you and at the same time debauch your sister or lie with your wife according to his description a man of wit when he could have wenches for crowns apiece which he liked quite as well would be so extravagant as to bribe servants make false friendships fight relations i say according to him plain and simple vice was too little for a man of wit and pleasure but he would leave an easy and accessible wickedness to come at the same thing with only the addition of certain falshood and possible murder will thinks the town grown very dull in that we do not hear so much as we used to do of these coxcombs whom without observing it he describes as the most infamous rogues in nature with relation to friendship love or conversation  when pleasure is made the chief pursuit of life it will necessarily follow that such monsters as these will arise from a constant application to such blandishments as naturally root out the force of reason and reflection and substitute in their place a general impatience of thought and a constant pruiriency of inordinate desire  pleasure when it is a mans chief purpose disappoints it self and the constant application to it palls the faculty of enjoying it tho it leaves the sense of our inability for that we wish with a disrelish of every thing else thus the intermediate seasons of the man of pleasure are more heavy than one would impose upon the vilest criminal take him when he is awaked too soon after a debauch or disappointed in following a worthless woman without truth and there is no man living whose being is such a weight or vexation as his is he is an utter stranger to the pleasing reflections in the evening of a wellspent day or the gladness of heart or quickness of spirit in the morning after profound sleep or indolent slumbers he is not to be at ease any longer than he can keep reason and good sense without his curtains otherwise he will be haunted with the reflection that he could not believe such a one the woman that upon trial he found her what has he got by his conquest but to think meanly of her for whom a day or two before he had the highest honour and of himself for perhaps wronging the man whom of all men living he himself would least willingly have injured  pleasure seizes the whole man who addicts himself to it and will not give him leisure for any good office in life which contradicts the gaiety of the present hour you may indeed observe in people of pleasure a certain complacency and absence of all severity which the habit of a loose unconcerned life gives them but tell the man of pleasure your secret wants cares or sorrows and you will find he has given up the delicacy of his passions to the cravings of his appetites he little knows the perfect joy he loses for the disappointing gratifications which he pursues he looks at pleasure as she approaches and comes to him with the recommendation of warm wishes gay looks and graceful motion but he does not observe how she leaves his presence with disorder impotence downcast shame and conscious imperfection

industry and virtue their decays make them but appear the more venerable and the imperfections of their bodies are beheld as a misfortune to humane society that their make is so little durable  but to return more directly to my man of wit and pleasure in all orders of men wherever this is the chief character the person who wears it is a negligent friend father and husband and entails poverty on his unhappy descendants mortgages diseases and settlements are the legacies a man of wit and pleasure leaves to his family all the poor rogues that make such lamentable speeches after every sessions at tyburn were in their way men of wit and pleasure before they fell into the adventures which brought them thither  irresolution and procrastination in all a mans affairs are the natural effects of being addicted to pleasure dishonour to the gentleman and bankruptcy to the trader are the portion of either whose chief purpose of life is delight the chief cause that this pursuit has been in all ages received with so much quarter from the soberer part of mankind has been that some men of great talents have sacrificed themselves to it the shining qualities of such people have given a beauty to whatever they were engaged in and a mixture of wit has recommended madness for let any man who knows what it is to have passed much time in a series of jollity mirth wit or humourous entertainments look back at what he was all that while a doing and he will find that he has been at one instant sharp to some man he is sorry to have offended impertinent to some one it was cruelty to treat with such freedom ungracefully noisy at such a time unskilfully open at such a time unmercifully calumnious at such a time and from the whole course of his applauded satisfactions unable in the end to recollect any circumstance which can add to the enjoyment of his own mind alone or which he would put his character upon with other men thus it is with those who are best made for becoming pleasures but how monstrous is it in the generality of mankind who pretend this way without genius or inclination towards it the scene then is wild to an extravagance this is as if fools should mimick madmen pleasure of this kind is the intemperate meals and loud jollities of the common rate of country gentlemen whose practice and way of enjoyment is to put an end as fast as they can to that little

and magnanimity from thought and reflection the many adventures which attend their way of life makes their conversation so full of incidents and gives them so frank an air in speaking of what they have been witnesses of that no company can be more amiable than that of men of sense who are soldiers there is a certain irregular way in their narrations or discourse which has something more warm and pleasing than we meet with among men who are used to adjust and methodize their thoughts  i was this evening walking in the fields with my friend captain sentry and i could not from the many relations which i drew him into of what passed when he was in the service forbear expressing my wonder that the fear of death which we the rest of mankind arm ourselves against with so much contemplation reason and philosophy should appear so little in camps that common men march into open breaches meet opposite battalions not only without reluctance but with alacrity my friend answered what i said in the following manner what you wonder at may very naturally be the subject of admiration to all who are not conversant in camps but when a man has spent some time in that way of life he observes a certain mechanick courage which the ordinary race of men become masters of from acting always in a crowd they see indeed many drop but then they see many more alive they observe themselves escape very narrowly and they do not know why they should not again besides which general way of loose thinking they usually spend the other part of their time in pleasures upon which their minds are so entirely bent that short labours or dangers are but a cheap purchase of jollity triumph victory fresh quarters new scenes and uncommon adventures such are the thoughts of the executive part of an army and indeed of the gross of mankind in general but none of these men of mechanical courage have ever made any great figure in the profession of arms those who are formed for command are such as have reasoned themselves out of a consideration of greater good than length of days into such a negligence of their being as to make it their first position that it is one day to be resigned and since it is in the prosecution of worthy actions and service of mankind they can put it to habitual hazard the event of our designs say they as it relates to others is uncertain but as it relates to ourselves it must be prosperous while we are in the pursuit of our duty and within the terms upon which providence has ensured our happiness whether we die or live all that  nature has prescribed must be good and as death is natural to us it is absurdity to fear it fear loses its purpose when we are sure it cannot preserve us and we should draw resolution to meet it from the impossibility to escape it without a resignation to the necessity of dying there can be no capacity in man to attempt any thing that is glorious but when they have once attained to that perfection the pleasures of a life spent in martial adventures are as great as any of which the human mind is capable the force of reason gives a certain beauty mixed with the conscience of welldoing and thirst of glory to all which before was terrible and ghastly to the imagination add to this that the fellowship of danger the common good of mankind the general cause and the manifest virtue you may observe in so many men who made no figure till that day are so many incentives to destroy the little consideration of their own persons such are the heroick part of soldiers who are qualified for leaders as to the rest whom i before spoke of i know not how it is but they arrive at a certain habit of being void of thought insomuch that on occasion of the most imminent danger they are still in the same indifference nay i remember an instance of a gay frenchman who was led on in battle by a superior officer whose conduct it was his custom to speak of always with contempt and raillery and in the beginning of the action received a wound he was sensible was mortal his reflection on this occasion was i wish i could live another hour to see how this blundering coxcomb will get clear of this business   i remember two young fellows who rid in the same squadron of a troop of horse who were ever together they eat they drank they intreagued in a word all their passions and affections seemed to tend the same way and they appeared serviceable to each other in them we were in the dusk of the evening to march over a river and the troop these gentlemen belonged to were to be transported in a ferryboat as fast as they could one of the friends was now in the boat while the other was drawn up with others by the waterside waiting the return of the boat a disorder happened in the passage by an unruly horse and a gentleman who had the rein of his horse negligently under his arm was forced into the water by his horses jumping over the friend on the shore cryd out whos that is drowned trow he was immediately answerd your friend harry thompson he very gravely replyd ay he had a mad horse this short epitaph from such a familiar without more words gave me at that time under twenty a very moderate opinion of the friendship of companions thus is affection and every other motive of life in the generality rooted out by the present busie scene about them they lament no man whose capacity can be supplied by another and where men converse without delicacy the next man you meet will serve as well as he whom you have lived with half your life to such the devastation of countries the misery of inhabitants the cries of the pillaged and the silent sorrow of the great unfortunate are ordinary objects their minds are bent upon the little gratifications of their own senses and appetites forgetful of compassion insensible of glory avoiding only shame their whole hearts taken up with the trivial hope of meeting and being merry these are the people who make up the gross of the soldiery but the fine gentleman in that band of men is such a one as i have now in my eye who is foremost in all danger to which he is ordered his officers are his friends and companions as they are men of honour and gentlemen the private men his brethren as they are of his species he is beloved of all that behold him they wish him in danger as he views their ranks that they may have occasions to save him at their own hazard mutual love is the order of the files where he commands every man afraid for himself and his neighbour not lest their commander should punish them but lest he should be offended such is his regiment who knows mankind and feels their distresses so far as to prevent them just in distributing what is their due he would think himself below their tailor to wear a snip of their cloaths in lace

misunderstanding between those two stages of life the unhappy want of commerce arises from the insolent arrogance or exultation in youth and the irrational despondence or selfpity in age a young man whose passion and ambition is to be good and wise and an old one who has no inclination to be lewd or debauched are quite unconcerned in this speculation but the cocking young fellow who treads upon the toes of his elders and the old fool who envies the sawcy pride he sees in him are the objects of our present contempt and derision contempt and derision are harsh words but in what manner can one give advice to a youth in the pursuit and possession of sensual pleasures or afford pity to an old man in the impotence and desire of enjoying them when young men in publick places betray in their deportment an abandoned resignation to their appetites they give to sober minds a prospect of a despicable age which if not interrupted by death in the midst of their follies must certainly come when an old man bewails the loss of such gratifications which are passed he discovers a monstrous inclination to that which it is not in the course of providence to recal the state of an old man who is dissatisfyd merely for his being such is the most out of all measures of reason and good sense of any being we have any account of from the highest angel to the lowest worm how miserable is the contemplation to consider a libidinous old man while all created things besides himself and devils are following the order of providence fretting at the course of things and being almost the sole malecontent in the creation but let us a little reflect upon what he has lost by the number of years the passions which he had in youth are not to be obeyed as they were then but reason is more powerful now without the disturbance of them an old gentleman tother day in discourse with a friend of his reflecting upon some adventures they had in youth together cryd out oh jack those were happy days that is true replyd his friend but methinks we go about our business more quietly than we did then one would think it should be no small satisfaction to have gone so far in our journey that the heat of the day is over with us when life itself is a feaver as it is in licentious youth the pleasures of it are no other than the dreams of a man in that distemper and it is as absurd to wish the return of that season of life as for a man in health to be sorry for the loss of gilded palaces fairy walks and flowery pastures with which he remembers he was entertained in the troubled slumbers of a fit of sickness  as to all the rational and worthy pleasures of our being the conscience of a good fame the contemplation of another life the respect and commerce of honest men our capacities for such enjoyments are enlarged by years while health endures the latter part of life in the eye of reason is certainly the more eligible the memory of a wellspent youth gives a peaceable unmixed and elegant pleasure to the mind and to such who are so unfortunate as not to be able to look back on youth with satisfaction they may give themselves no little consolation that they are under no temptation to repeat their follies and that they at present despise them it was prettily said he that would be long an old man must begin early to be one it is too late to resign a thing after a man is robbed of it therefore it is necessary that before the arrival of age we bid adieu to the pursuits of youth otherwise sensual habits will live in our imaginations when our limbs cannot be subservient to them the poor fellow who lost his arm last siege will tell you he feels the fingers that were buried in flanders ake every cold morning at chelsea the fond humour of appearing in the gay and fashionable world and being applauded for trivial excellencies is what makes youth have age in contempt and makes age resign with so ill a grace the qualifications of youth but this in both sexes is inverting all things and turning the natural course of our minds which should build their approbations and dislikes upon what nature and reason dictate into chimera and confusion  age in a virtuous person of either sex carries in it an authority which makes it preferable to all the pleasures of youth if to be saluted attended and consulted with deference are instances of pleasure they are such as never fail a virtuous old age in the enumeration of the imperfections and advantages of the younger and later years of man they are so near in their condition that methinks it should be incredible we see so little commerce of kindness between them if we consider youth and age with tully regarding the affinity to death youth has many more chances to be near it than age what youth can say more than an old man he shall live till night youth catches distempers more easily its sickness is more violent and its recovery more doubtful the youth indeed hopes for many more days so cannot the old man the youths hopes are illgrounded for what is more foolish than to place any confidence upon an uncertainty but the old man has not room so much as for hope he is still happier than the youth he has already enjoyed what the other does but hope for one wishes to live long the other has lived long but alas is there any thing in human life the duration of which can be called long there is nothing which must end to be valued for its continuance if hours days months and years pass away it is no matter what hour what day what month or what year we die the applause of a good actor is due to him at whatever scene of the play he makes his exit it is thus in the life of a man of sense a short life is sufficient to manifest himself a man of honour and virtue when he ceases to be such

to be very severe against men upon all those occasions but all this while i am afraid you have been very little conversant with women or you would know the generality of them are not so angry as you imagine at the general vices among  us i am apt to believe begging your pardon that you are still what i my self was once a queer modest fellow and therefore for your information shall give you a short account of my self and the reasons why i was forced to wench drink play and do every thing which are necessary to the character of a man of wit and pleasure to be well with the ladies  you are to know then that i was bred a gentleman and had the finishing part of my education under a man of great probity wit and learning in one of our universities i will not deny but this made my behaviour and mein bear in it a figure of thought rather than action and a man of a quite contrary character who never thought in his life rallied me one day upon it and said he believed i was still a virgin there was a young lady of virtue present and i was not displeased to favour the insinuation but it had a quite contrary effect from what i expected i was ever after treated with great coldness both by that lady and all the rest of my acquaintance in a very little time i never came into a room but i could hear a whisper here comes the maid a girl of humour would on some occasion  say why how do you know more than any of us an expression of that kind was generally followed by a loud laugh in a word for no other fault in the world than that they really thought me as innocent as themselves i became of no consequence among them and was received always upon the foot of a jest this made so strong an impression upon me that i resolved to be as agreeable as the best of the men who laughd at me but i observed it was nonsense for me to be impudent at first among those who knew me my character for modesty was so notorious wherever i had hitherto appeared that i resolved to shew my new face in new quarters of the world my first step i chose with judgment for i went to astrop  and came down among a crowd of academicks at one dash the impudentest fellow they had ever seen in their lives flushed with this success i made love and was happy upon this conquest i thought it would be unlike a gentleman to stay longer with my mistress and crossed the country to bury i could give you a very good account of my self at that place also at these two ended my first summer of gallantry the winter following you would wonder at it but i relapsed into modesty upon coming among people of figure in london yet not so much but that the ladies who had formerly laughed at me said bless us how wonderfully that gentleman is improved some familiarities about the playhouses towards the end of the ensuing winter made me conceive new hopes of adventures and instead of returning the next summer to astrop or bury  i thought my self qualified to go to epsom and followed a young woman whose relations were jealous of my place in her favour to scarborough i carried my point and in my third year aspired to go to tunbridge and in the autumn of the same year made my appearance at bath i was now got into the way of talk proper for ladies and was run into a vast acquaintance among them which i always improved to the best advantage in all this course of time and some years following i found a sober modest man was always looked upon by both sexes as a precise unfashioned fellow of no life or spirit it was ordinary for a man who had been drunk in good company or passed a night with a wench to speak of it next day before women for whom he had the greatest respect he was reproved perhaps with a blow of the fan or an oh fie but the angry lady still preserved an apparent approbation in her countenance he was called a strange wicked fellow a sad wretch he shrugs his shoulders swears receives another blow swears again he did not know he swore and all was well you might often see men game in the presence of women and throw at once for more than they were worth to recommend themselves as men of spirit i found by long experience that the loosest principles and most abandoned behaviour carried all before them in pretensions to women of fortune the encouragement given to people of this stamp made me soon throw off the remaining impressions of a sober education in the abovementioned places as well as in town i always kept company with those who lived most at large and in due process of time i was a pretty rake among the men and a very pretty fellow among the women i must confess i had some melancholy hours upon the account of the narrowness of my fortune but my conscience at the same time gave me the comfort that i had qualified my self for marrying a fortune  when i had lived in this manner for some time and became thus accomplished i was now in the twenty seventh year of my age and about the forty seventh of my constitution my health and estate wasting very fast when i happened to fall into the company of a very pretty young lady in her own disposal i entertained the company as we men of gallantry generally do with the many haps and disasters watchings under windows escapes from jealous husbands and several other perils the young thing was wonderfully charmed with one that knew the world so well and talked so fine with desdemona all her lover said affected her it was strangetwas wondrous strange in a word i saw the impression i had made upon her and with a very little application the pretty thing has married me there is so much charm in her innocence and beauty that i do now as much detest the course i have been in for many years as i ever did before i entred into it  what i intend mr spectator by writing all this to you is that you would before you go any further with your panegyricks on the fair sex give them some lectures upon their silly approbations it is that i am weary of vice and that it was not my natural way that i am now so far recovered as not to bring this believing dear creature to contempt and poverty for her generosity to me at the same time tell the youth of good education of our sex that they take too little care of improving themselves in little things a good air at entring into a room a proper audacity in expressing himself with gaiety and gracefulness would make a young gentleman of virtue and sense capable of discountenancing the shallow impudent rogues that shine among the women  mr spectator i dont doubt but you are a very sagacious person but you are so great with tully of late that i

licence taken in discourse wherein the conversation on one part is involuntary and the effect of some necessary circumstance this happens in travelling together in the same hired coach sitting near each other in any publick assembly or the like i have upon making observations of this sort received innumerable messages from that part of the fair sex whose lot in life is to be of any trade or publick way of life they are all to a woman urgent with me to lay before the world the unhappy circumstances they are under from the unreasonable liberty which is taken in their presence to talk on what subject it is thought fit by every coxcomb who wants understanding or breeding one or two of these complaints i shall set down mr spectator  i keep a coffeehouse and am one of those whom you have thought fit to mention as an idol some time ago i suffered a good deal of raillery upon that occasion but shall heartily forgive you who are the cause of it if you will do me justice in another point what i ask of you is to acquaint my customers who are otherwise very good ones that i am unavoidably hasped in my bar and cannot help hearing the improper discourses they are pleased to entertain me with they strive who shall say the most immodest things in my hearing at the same time half a dozen of them loll at the bar staring just in my face ready to interpret my looks and gestures according to their own imaginations in this passive condition i know not where to cast my eyes place my hands or what to employ my self in but this confusion is to be a jest and i hear them say in the end with an air of mirth and subtlety let her alone she knows as well as we for all she looks so good mr spectator persuade gentlemen that it is out of all decency say it is possible a woman may be modest and yet keep a publickhouse be pleased to argue that in truth the affront is the more unpardonable because i am obligd to suffer it and cannot fly from it i do assure you sir the chearfulness of life which would arise from the honest gain i have is utterly lost to me from the endless flat impertinent pleasantries which i hear from morning to night in a word it is too much for me to bear and i desire you to acquaint them that i will keep pen and ink at the bar and write down all they say to me and send it to you for the press it is possible when they see how empty what they speak without the advantage of an impudent countenance and gesture will appear they may come to some sense of themselves and the insults they are guilty of towards me i am sir  your most humble servant  the idol  this representation is so just that it is hard to speak of it without an indignation which perhaps would appear too elevated to such as can be guilty of this inhuman treatment where they see they affront a modest plain and ingenuous behaviour this correspondent is not the only sufferer in this kind for i have long letters both from the royal and new exchange on the same subject they tell me that a young fop cannot buy a pair of gloves but he is at the same time straining for some ingenious ribaldry to say to the young woman who helps them on it is no small addition to the calamity that the rogues buy as hard as the plainest and modestest customers they have besides which they loll upon their counters half an hour longer than they need to drive away other customers who are to share their impertinencies with the milliner or go to another shop letters from changealley are full of the same evil and the girls tell me except i can chase some eminent merchants from their shops they shall in a short time fail it is very unaccountable that men can have so little deference to all mankind who pass by them as to bear being seen toying by twos and threes at a time with no other purpose but to appear gay enough to keep up a light conversation of commonplace jests to the injury of her whose credit is certainly hurt by it tho their own may be strong enough to bear it when we come to have exact accounts of these conversations it is not to be doubted but that their discourses will raise the usual stile of buying and selling instead of the plain downright lying and asking and bidding so unequally to what they will really give and take we may hope to have from these fine folks an exchange of compliments there must certainly be a great deal of pleasant difference between the commerce of lovers and that of all other dealers who are in a kind adversaries a sealed bond or a banknote would be a pretty gallantry to convey unseen into the hands of one whom a director is charmed with otherwise the cityloiterers are still more unreasonable than those at the other end of the town at the new exchange they are eloquent for want of cash but in the city they ought with cash to supply their want of eloquence  if one might be serious on this prevailing folly one might observe that it is a melancholy thing when the world is mercenary even to the buying and selling our very persons that young women tho they have never so great attractions from nature are never the nearer being happily disposed of in marriage i say it is very hard under this necessity it shall not be possible for them to go into a way of trade for their maintenance but their very excellencies and personal perfections shall be a disadvantage to them and subject them to be treated as if they stood there to sell their persons to prostitution there cannot be a more melancholy circumstance to one who has made any observation in the world than one of those erring creatures exposed to bankruptcy when that happens none of these toying fools will do any more than any other man they meet to preserve her from infamy insult and distemper a woman is naturally more helpless than the other sex and a man of honour and sense should have this in his view in all manner of commerce with her were this well weighed inconsideration ribaldry and nonsense would not be more natural to entertain women with than men and it would be as much impertinence to go into a shop of one of these young women without buying as into that of any other trader i shall end this speculation with a letter i have received from a pretty milliner in the city mr spectator  i have read your account of beauties and was not a little surprized to find no character of my self in it i do assure you i have little else to do but to give audience as i am such here are merchants of no small consideration who call in as certainly as they go to change to say something of my roguish eye and here is one who makes me once or twice a week tumble over all my goods and then owns it was only a gallantry to see me act with these pretty hands then lays out three pence in a little ribbon for his wristbands and thinks he is a man of great vivacity there is an ugly thing not far off me whose shop is frequented only by people of business that is all day long as busy as possible must i that am a beauty be treated with for nothing but my beauty be pleased to assign rates to my kind glances or make all pay who come to see me or i shall be undone by my admirers for want of customers albacinda eudosia and all the rest would be

think any thing could make a pleasanter entertainment than the history of the reigning favourites among the women from time to time about this town in such an account we ought to have a faithful confession of each lady for what she liked such and such a man and he ought to tell us by what particular action or dress he believed he should be most successful as for my part i have always made as easy a judgment when a man dresses for the ladies as when he is equipped for hunting or coursing the womans man is a person in his air and behaviour quite different from the rest of our species his garb is more loose and negligent his manner more soft and indolent that is to say in both these cases there is an apparent endeavour to appear unconcerned and careless in catching birds the fowlers have a method of imitating their voices to bring them to the snare and your womens men have always a similitude of the creature they hope to betray in their own conversation a womans man is very knowing in all that passes from one family to another has little pretty officiousnesses is not at a loss what is good for a cold and it is not amiss if he has a bottle of spirits in his pocket in case of any sudden indisposition  curiosity having been my prevailing passion and indeed the sole entertainment of my life i have sometimes made it my business to examine the course of intreagues as well as the manners and accomplishments of such as have been most successful that way in all my observation i never knew a man of good understanding a general favourite some singularity in his behaviour some whim in his way of life and what would have made him ridiculous among the men has recommended him to the other sex i should be very sorry to offend a people so fortunate as these of whom i am speaking but let any one look over the old beaux and he will find the man of success was remarkable for quarrelling impertinently for their sakes for dressing unlike the rest of the world or passing his days in an insipid assiduity about the fair sex to gain the figure he made amongst them add to this that he must have the reputation of being well with other women to please any one woman of gallantry for you are to know that there is a mighty ambition among the light part of the sex to gain slaves from the dominion of others my friend will honeycomb says it was a common bite with him to lay suspicions that he was favoured by a ladys enemy that is some rival beauty to be well with herself a little spite is natural to a great beauty and it is ordinary to snap up a disagreeable fellow lest another should have him that impudent toad bareface fares well among all the ladies he converses with for no other reason in the world but that he has the skill to keep them from explanation one with another did they know there is not one who likes him in her heart each would declare her scorn of him the next moment but he is well received by them because it is the fashion and opposition to each other brings them insensibly into an imitation of each other what adds to him the greatest grace is the pleasant thief as they call him is the most inconstant creature living has a wonderful deal of wit and humour and never wants something to say besides all which he has a most spiteful dangerous tongue if you should provoke him  to make a womans man he must not be a man of sense or a fool the business is to entertain and it is much better to have a faculty of arguing than a capacity of judging right but the pleasantest of all the womens equipage are your regular visitants these are volunteers in their service without hopes of pay or preferment it is enough that they can lead out from a publick place that they are admitted on a publick day and can be allowed to pass away part of that heavy load their time in the company of the fair but commend me above all others to those who are known for your ruiners of ladies these are the choicest spirits which our age produces we have several of these irresistible gentlemen among us when the company is in town these fellows are accomplished with the knowledge of the ordinary occurrences about court and town have that sort of good breeding which is exclusive of all morality and consists only in being publickly decent privately dissolute  it is wonderful how far a fond opinion of herself can carry a woman to make her have the least regard to a professed known womans man but as scarce one of all the women who are in the tour of gallantries ever hears any thing of what is the common sense of sober minds but are entertained with a continual round of flatteries they cannot be mistresses of themselves enough to make arguments for their own conduct from the behaviour of these men to others it is so far otherwise that a general fame for falshood in this kind is a recommendation and the coxcomb loaded with the favours of many others is received like a victor that disdains his trophies to be a victim to the present charmer  if you see a man more full of gesture than ordinary in a publick assembly if loud upon no occasion if negligent of the company round him and yet laying wait for destroying by that negligence you may take it for granted that he has ruined many a fair one the womans man expresses himself wholly in that motion which we call strutting an elevated chest a pinched hat a measurable step and a sly surveying eye are the marks of him now and then you see a gentleman with all these accomplishments but alas any one of them is enough to undo thousands when a gentleman with such perfections adds to it suitable learning there should be publick warning of his residence in town that we may remove our wives and daughters it happens sometimes that such a fine man has read all the miscellany poems a few of our comedies and has the translation of ovids epistles by heart oh if it were possible that such a one could be as true as he is charming but that is too much the women will share such a dear false man a little gallantry to hear him talk one would indulge ones self in let him reckon the sticks of ones fan say something of the cupids in it and then call one so many soft names which a man of his learning has at his fingers ends there sure is some excuse for frailty when attacked by such a force against a weak woman such is the soliloquy of many a lady one might name at the sight of one of these who makes it no iniquity to go on from day to day in the sin of womanslaughter  it is certain that people are got into a way of affectation with a manner of overlooking the most solid virtues and admiring the most trivial excellencies the woman is so far from expecting to be contemned for being a very injudicious silly animal that while she can preserve her features and her mein she knows she is still the object of desire and there is a sort of secret ambition from reading frivolous books and keeping as frivolous company each side to be amiable in imperfection and arrive at the

astrum naturæ deus humanæ mortalis in unum quodque caput   hor   i am very much at a loss to express by any word that occurs to me in our language that which is understood by indoles in latin the natural disposition to any particular art science profession or trade is very much to be consulted in the care of youth and studied by men for their own conduct when they form to themselves any scheme of life it is wonderfully hard indeed for a man to judge of his own capacity impartially that may look great to me which may appear little to another and i may be carried by fondness towards my self so far as to attempt things too high for my talents and accomplishments but it is not methinks so very difficult a matter to make a judgment of the abilities of others especially of those who are in their infancy my commonplace book directs me on this occasion to mention the dawning of greatness in alexander who being asked in his youth to contend for a prize in the olympick games answered he would if he had kings to run against him cassius who was one of the conspirators against cæsar gave as great a proof of his temper when in his childhood he struck a playfellow the son of sylla for saying his father was master of the roman people scipio is reported to have answered when some flatterers at supper were asking him what the romans should do for a general after his death take marius marius was then a very boy and had given no instances of his valour but it was visible to scipio from the manners of the youth that he had a soul formed for the attempt and execution of great undertakings i must confess i have very often with much sorrow bewailed the misfortune of the children of great britain when i consider the ignorance and undiscerning of the generality of schoolmasters the boasted liberty we talk of is but a mean reward for the long servitude the many heartaches and terrors to which our childhood is exposed in going through a grammarschool many of these stupid tyrants exercise their cruelty without any manner of distinction of the capacities of children or the intention of parents in their behalf there are many excellent tempers which are worthy to be nourished and cultivated with all possible diligence and care that were never designed to be acquainted with aristotle tully or virgil and there are as many who have capacities for understanding every word those great persons have writ and yet were not born to have any relish of their writings for want of this common and obvious discerning in those who have the care of youth we have so many hundred unaccountable creatures every age whipped up into great scholars that are for ever near a right understanding and will never arrive at it these are the scandal of letters and these are generally the men who are to teach others the sense of shame and honour is enough to keep the world itself in order without corporal punishment much more to train the minds of uncorrupted and innocent children it happens i doubt not more than once in a year that a lad is chastised for a blockhead when it is good apprehension that makes him incapable of knowing what his teacher means a brisk imagination very often may suggest an error which a lad could not have fallen into if he had been as heavy in conjecturing as his master in explaining but there is no mercy even towards a wrong interpretation of his meaning the sufferings of the scholars body are to rectify the mistakes of his mind  i am confident that no boy who will not be allured to letters without blows will ever be brought to any thing with them a great or good mind must necessarily be the worse for such indignities and it is a sad change to lose of its virtue for the improvement of its knowledge no one who has gone through what they call a great school but must remember to have seen children of excellent and ingenuous natures as has afterwards appeared in their manhood i say no man has passed through this way of education but must have seen an ingenuous creature expiring with shame with pale looks beseeching sorrow and silent tears throw up its honest eyes and kneel on its tender knees to an inexorable blockhead to be forgiven the false quantity of a word in making a latin verse the child is punished and the next day he commits a like crime and so a third with the same consequence i would fain ask any reasonable man whether this lad in the simplicity of his native innocence full of shame and capable of any impression from that grace of soul was not fitter for any purpose in this life than after that spark of virtue is extinguished in him tho he is able to write twenty verses in an evening  seneca says after his exalted way of talking as the immortal gods never learnt any virtue tho they are endowed with all that is good so there are some men who have so natural a propensity to what they should follow that they learn it almost as soon as they hear it  plants and vegetables are cultivated into the production of finer fruit than they would yield without that care and yet we cannot entertain hopes of producing a tender conscious spirit into acts of virtue without the same methods as is used to cut timber or give new shape to a piece of stone  it is wholly to this dreadful practice that we may attribute a certain hardiness and ferocity which some men tho liberally educated carry about them in all their behaviour to be bred like a gentleman and punished like a malefactor must as we see it does produce that illiberal sauciness which we see sometimes in men of letters  the spartan boy who suffered the fox which he had stolen and hid under his coat to eat into his bowels i dare say had not half the wit or petulance which we learn at great schools among us but the glorious sense of honour or rather fear of shame which he demonstrated in that action was worth all the learning in the world without it  it is methinks a very melancholy consideration that a little negligence can spoil us but great industry is necessary to improve us the most excellent natures are soon depreciated but evil tempers are long before they are exalted into good habits to help this by punishments is the same thing as killing a man to cure him of a distemper when he comes to suffer punishment in that one circumstance he is brought below the existence of a rational creature and is in the state of a brute that moves only by the admonition of stripes but since this custom of educating by the lash is suffered by the gentry of great britain  i would prevail only that honest heavy lads may be dismissed from slavery sooner than they are at present and not whipped on to their fourteenth or fifteenth year whether they expect any progress from them or not let the childs capacity be forthwith examined and he sent to some mechanick way of life without respect to his birth if nature designed him for nothing higher let him go before he has innocently suffered and is debased into a dereliction of mind for being what it is no guilt to be a plain man i would not here be supposed to have said that our learned men of either robe who have been whipped at school are not still men of noble and liberal minds but i am sure they had been much more so than they are had they never suffered that infamy  but tho there is so little care as i have observed taken or observation made of the natural strain of men it is no small comfort to me as a spectator that there is any right value set upon the bona indoles of other animals as appears by the following advertisement handed about the

thing else but health and disease we had no more to do but to put a lady into good humour and all we could wish followed of course then again your tully and your discourses of another life are the very bane of mirth and good humour prythee dont value thyself on thy reason at that exorbitant rate and the dignity of human nature take my word for it a settingdog has as good reason as any man in england had you as by your diurnals one would think you do set up for being in vogue in town you should have fallen in with the bent of passion and appetite your songs had then been in every pretty mouth in england and your little distichs had been the maxims of the fair and the witty to walk by but alas sir what can you hope for from entertaining people with what must needs make them like themselves worse than they did before they read you had you made it your business to describe corinna charming though inconstant to find something in human nature itself to make zoilus excuse himself for being fond of her and to make every man in good commerce with his own reflections you had done something worthy our applause but indeed sir we shall not commend you for disapproving us i have a great deal more to say to you but i shall sum it up all in this one remark in short sir you do not write like a gentleman  i am sir your most humble servant     mr spectator  the other day we were several of us at a teatable and according to custom and your own advice had the spectator read among us it was that paper wherein you are pleased to treat with great freedom that character which you call a womans man we gave up all the kinds you have mentioned except those who you say are our constant visitants i was upon the occasion commissioned by the company to write to you and tell you that we shall not part with the men we have at present till the men of sense think fit to relieve them and give us their company in their stead you cannot imagine but that we love to hear reason and good sense better than the ribaldry we are at present entertained with but we must have company and among us very inconsiderable is better than none at all we are made for the cements of society and came into the world to create relations among mankind and solitude is an unnatural being to us if the men of good understanding would forget a little of their severity they would find their account in it and their wisdom would have a pleasure in it to which they are now strangers it is natural among us when men have a true relish of our company and our value to say every thing with a better grace and there is without designing it something ornamental in what men utter before women which is lost or neglected in conversations of men only give me leave to tell you sir it would do you no great harm if you yourself came a little more into our company it would certainly cure you of a certain positive and determining manner in which you talk sometimes in hopes of your amendment  i am sir  your gentle reader     mr spectator  your professed regard to the fair sex may perhaps make them value your admonitions when they will not those of other men i desire you sir to repeat some lectures upon subjects which you have now and then in a cursory manner only just touched i would have a spectator wholly writ upon good breeding and after you have asserted that time and place are to be very much considered in all our actions it will be proper to dwell upon behaviour at church on sunday last a grave and reverend man preached at our church there was something particular in his accent but without any manner of affectation this particularity a set of gigglers thought the most necessary thing to be taken notice of in his whole discourse and made it an occasion of mirth during the whole time of sermon you should see one of them ready to burst behind a fan another pointing to a companion in another seat and a fourth with an arch composure as if she would if possible stifle her laughter there were many gentlemen who looked at them stedfastly but this they took for ogling and admiring them there was one of the merry ones in particular that found out but just then that she had but five fingers for she fell a reckoning the pretty pieces of ivory over and over again to find her self employment and not laugh out would it not be expedient mr spectator that the churchwarden should hold up his wand on these occasions and keep the decency of the place as a magistrate does the peace in a tumult elsewhere     mr spectator  i am a womans man and read with a very fine lady your paper wherein you fall upon us whom you envy what do you think i did you must know she was dressing i read the spectator to her and she laughed at the places where she thought i was touched i threw away your moral and taking up her girdle cried out give me but what this ribbon bound take all the rest the sun  goes round  she smiled sir and said you were a pedant so say of me what you please read

picked up several oriental manuscripts which i have still by me among others i met with one entitled the visions of mirzah which i have read over with great pleasure i intend to give it to the publick when i have no other entertainment for them and shall begin with the first vision which i have translated word for word as follows on the fifth day of the moon which according to the custom of my forefathers i always keep holy after having washed my self and offered up my morning devotions i ascended the high hills of bagdat in order to pass the rest of the day in meditation and prayer as i was here airing my self on the tops of the mountains i fell into a profound contemplation on the vanity of human life and passing from one thought to another surely said i man is but a shadow and life a dream whilst i was thus musing i cast my eyes towards the summit of a rock that was not far from me where i discovered one in the habit of a shepherd with a little musical instrument in his hand as i looked upon him he applied it to his lips and began to play upon it the sound of it was exceeding sweet and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpressibly melodious and altogether different from any thing i had ever heard they put me in mind of those heavenly airs that are played to the departed souls of good men upon their first arrival in paradise to wear out the impressions of the last agonies and qualify them for the pleasures of that happy place my heart melted away in secret raptures  i had been often told that the rock before me was the haunt of a genius and that several had been entertained with musick who had passed by it but never heard that the musician had before made himself visible when he had raised my thoughts by those transporting airs which he played to taste the pleasures of his conversation as i looked upon him like one astonished he beckoned to me and by the waving of his hand directed me to approach the place where he sat i drew near with that reverence which is due to a superior nature and as my heart was entirely subdued by the captivating strains i had heard i fell down at his feet and wept the genius smiled upon me with a look of compassion and affability that familiarized him to my imagination and at once dispelled all the fears and apprehensions with which i approached him he lifted me from the ground and taking me by the hand mirzah said he i have heard thee in thy soliloquies follow me  he then led me to the highest pinnacle of the rock and placing me on the top of it cast thy eyes eastward said he and tell me what thou seest i see said i a huge valley and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it the valley that thou seest said he is the vale of misery and the tide of water that thou seest is part of the great tide of eternity what is the reason said i that the tide i see rises out of a thick mist at one end and again loses itself in a thick mist at the other what thou seest said he is that portion of eternity which is called time measured out by the sun and reaching from the beginning of the world to its consummation examine now said he this sea that is bounded with darkness at both ends and tell me what thou discoverest in it i see a bridge said i standing in the midst of the tide the bridge thou seest said he is human life consider it attentively upon a more leisurely survey of it i found that it consisted of threescore and ten entire arches with several broken arches which added to those that were entire made up the number about an hundred as i was counting the arches the genius told me that this bridge consisted at first of a thousand arches but that a great flood swept away the rest and left the bridge in the ruinous condition i now beheld it but tell me further said he what thou discoverest on it i see multitudes of people passing over it said i and a black cloud hanging on each end of it as i looked more attentively i saw several of the passengers dropping thro the bridge into the great tide that flowed underneath it and upon farther examination perceived there were innumerable trapdoors that lay concealed in the bridge which the passengers no sooner trod upon but they fell thro them into the tide and immediately disappeared these hidden pitfalls were set very thick at the entrance of the bridge so that the throngs of people no sooner broke through the cloud but many of them fell into them they grew thinner towards the middle but multiplied and lay closer together towards the end of the arches that were entire  there were indeed some persons but their number was very small that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches but fell through one after another being quite tired and spent with so long a walk  i passed some time in the contemplation of this wonderful structure and the great variety of objects which it presented my heart was filled with a deep melancholy to see several dropping unexpectedly in the midst of mirth and jollity and catching at every thing that stood by them to save themselves some were looking up towards the heavens in a thoughtful posture and in the midst of a speculation stumbled and fell out of sight multitudes were very busy in the pursuit of bubbles that glittered in their eyes and danced before them but often when they thought themselves within the reach of them their footing failed and down they sunk in this confusion of objects i observed some with scymetars in their hands and others with urinals who ran to and fro upon the bridge thrusting several persons on trapdoors which did not seem to lie in their way  and which they might have escaped had they not been forced upon them  the genius seeing me indulge my self in this melancholy prospect told me i had dwelt long enough upon it take thine eyes off the bridge said he and tell me if thou yet seest any thing thou dost not comprehend upon looking up what mean said i those great flights of birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge and settling upon it from time to time i see vultures harpyes ravens cormorants and among many other featherd creatures several little winged boys that perch in great numbers upon the middle arches these said the genius are envy avarice superstition despair love with the like cares and passions that infest human life  i here fetched a deep sigh alas said i man was made in vain how is he given away to misery and mortality tortured in life and swallowed up in death the genius being moved with compassion towards me bid me quit so uncomfortable a prospect look no more said he on man in the first stage of his existence in his setting out for eternity but cast thine eye on that thick mist into which the tide bears the several generations of mortals that fall into it i directed my sight as i was ordered and whether or no the good genius strengthened it with any supernatural force or dissipated part of the mist that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate i saw the valley opening at the farther end and spreading forth into an immense ocean that had a huge rock of adamant running through the midst of it and dividing it into two equal parts the clouds still rested on one half of it insomuch that i could discover nothing in it but the other appeared to me a vast ocean planted with innumerable islands that were covered with fruits and flowers and interwoven with a thousand little shining seas that ran among them i could see persons dressed in glorious habits with garlands upon their heads passing among the trees lying down by the side of fountains or resting on beds of flowers and could hear a confused harmony of singing birds falling waters human voices and musical instruments gladness grew in me upon the discovery of so delightful a scene i wished for the wings of an eagle that i might fly away to those happy seats but the genius told me there was no passage to them except through the gates of death that i saw opening every moment upon the bridge the islands said he that lie so fresh and green before thee and with which the whole face of the ocean appears spotted as far as thou canst see are more in number than the sands on the seashore there are myriads of islands behind those which thou here discoverest reaching further than thine eye or even thine imagination can extend it self these are the mansions of good men after death who according to the degree and kinds of virtue in which they excelled are distributed among these several islands which abound with pleasures of different kinds and degrees suitable to the relishes and perfections of those who are settled in them every island is a paradise accommodated to its respective inhabitants are not these o mirzah habitations worth contending for does life appear miserable that gives thee opportunities of earning such a reward is death to be feared that will convey thee to so happy an existence think not man was made in vain who has such an eternity reserved for him i gazed with inexpressible pleasure on these happy islands at length said i shew me now i beseech thee the secrets that lie hid under those dark clouds which cover the ocean on the other side of the rock of adamant the genius making me no answer i turned about to address myself to him a second time but i found that he had left me i then turned again to the vision which i had been so long contemplating but instead of the rolling tide the arched bridge and the happy islands i saw nothing but the long hollow valley of bagdat with oxen sheep and camels grazing upon the sides of it  the end of the first vision of mirzah  c      footnote     have been laid for them corrected by an erratum in no     return to footnote mark  contents contents p     no   0 monday september        addison   cui mens divinior atque os magna sonaturum des nominis hujus honorem  hor   there is no character more frequently given to a writer than that of being a genius i have heard many a little sonneteer called a fine genius there is not an heroick scribler in the nation that has not his admirers who think him a great genius and as for your smatterers in tragedy there is scarce a man among them who is not cried up by one or other for a prodigious genius  my design in this paper is to consider what is properly a great genius and to throw some thoughts together on so uncommon a subject  among great geniuss those few draw the admiration of all the world upon them and stand up as the prodigies of mankind who by the meer strength of natural parts and without any assistance of arts or learning have produced works that were the delight of their own times and the wonder of posterity there appears something nobly wild and extravagant in these great natural geniuss that is infinitely more beautiful than all the turn and polishing of what the french call a bel esprit by which they would express a genius refined by conversation reflection and the reading of the most polite authors the greatest genius which  runs through the arts and sciences takes a kind of tincture from them and falls unavoidably into imitation  many of these great natural geniuss that were never disciplined and broken by rules of art are to be found among the ancients and in particular among those of the more eastern parts of the world homer has innumerable flights that virgil was not able to reach and in the old testament we find several passages more elevated and sublime than any in homer at the same time that we allow a greater and more daring genius to the ancients we must own that the greatest of them very much failed in or if you will that they were very much above the nicety and correctness of the moderns in their similitudes and allusions provided there was a likeness they did not much trouble themselves about the decency of the comparison thus solomon resembles the nose of his beloved to the tower of libanon which looketh toward damascus as the coming of a thief in the night is a similitude of the same kind in the new testament it would be endless to make collections of this nature homer illustrates one of his heroes encompassed with the enemy by an ass in a field of corn that has his sides belaboured by all the boys of the village without stirring a foot for it and another of them tossing to and fro in his bed and burning with resentment to a piece of flesh broiled on the coals this particular failure in the ancients opens a large field of raillery to the little wits who can laugh at an indecency but not relish the sublime in these sorts of writings the present emperor of persia conformable to this eastern way of thinking amidst a great many pompous titles denominates himself the sun of glory and the nutmeg of delight in short to cut off all cavilling against the ancients and particularly those of the warmer climates who had most heat and life in their imaginations we are to consider that the rule of observing what the french call the bienséance in an allusion has been found out of latter years and in the colder regions of the world where we would make some amends for our want of force and spirit by a scrupulous nicety and exactness in our compositions  our countryman shakespear was a remarkable instance of this first kind of great geniuss  i cannot quit this head without observing that pindar was a great genius of the first class who was hurried on by a natural fire and impetuosity to vast conceptions of things and noble sallies of imagination at the same time can any thing be more ridiculous than for men of a sober and moderate fancy to imitate this poets way of writing in those monstrous compositions which go among us under the name of pindaricks when i see people copying works which as horace has represented them are singular in their kind and inimitable when i see men following irregularities by rule and by the little tricks of art straining after the most unbounded flights of nature i cannot but apply to them that passage in terence  incerta hæc si tu postules ratione certâ facere nihilo plus agas quàm si des operam ut cum ratione insanias in short a modern pindarick writer compared with pindar is like a sister among the camisars  compared with virgils sibyl there is the distortion grimace and outward figure but nothing of that divine impulse which raises the mind above its self and makes the sounds more than human  there is another kind of great geniuss which i shall place in a second class not as i think them inferior to the first but only for distinctions sake as they are of a different kind this  second class of great geniuss are those that have formed themselves by rules and submitted the greatness of their natural talents to the corrections and restraints of art such among the greeks were plato and aristotle among the romans virgil and tully among the english milton and sir francis bacon   the genius in both these classes of authors may be equally great but shews itself after  a different manner in the first it is like a rich soil in a happy climate that produces a whole wilderness of noble plants rising in a thousand beautiful landskips without any certain order or regularity in the other it is the same rich soil under the same happy climate that has been laid out in walks and parterres and cut into shape and beauty by the skill of the gardener  the great danger in these latter kind of geniuss is lest they cramp their own abilities too much by imitation and form themselves altogether upon models without giving the full play to their own natural parts an imitation of the best authors is not to compare with a good original and i believe we may observe that very few writers make an extraordinary figure in the world who have not something in their way of thinking or expressing themselves that is peculiar to them and entirely their own   it is odd to consider what great geniuss are sometimes thrown away upon trifles  i once saw a shepherd says a famous italian author who  used to divert himself in his solitudes with tossing up eggs and catching them again without breaking them in which he had arrived to so great a degree of perfection that he would keep up four at a time for several minutes together playing in the air and falling into his hand by turns i think says the author i never saw a greater severity than in this mans face for by his wonderful perseverance and application he had contracted the seriousness and gravity of a privycouncillor and i could not but reflect with my self that the same assiduity and attention had they been rightly applied might have made him a greater mathematician than archimedes  c      footnote     that return to footnote mark   footnote     the camisars or french prophets originally from the cevennes came into england in   0

though you are pleased to retire from us so soon into the city i hope you will not think the affairs of the country altogether unworthy of your inspection for the future i had the honour of seeing your short face at sir roger de coverleys and have ever since thought your person and writings both extraordinary had you stayed there a few days longer you would have seen a country wake which you know in most parts of england is the evefeast of the dedication of our churches i was last week at one of these assemblies which was held in a neighbouring parish where i found their green covered with a promiscuous multitude of all ages and both sexes who esteem one another more or less the following part of the year according as they distinguish themselves at this time the whole company were in their holiday cloaths and divided into several parties all of them endeavouring to shew themselves in those exercises wherein they excelled and to gain the approbation of the lookers on  i found a ring of cudgelplayers who were breaking one anothers heads in order to make some impression on their mistresses hearts i observed a lusty young fellow who had the misfortune of a broken pate but what considerably added to the anguish of the wound was his overhearing an old man who shook his head and said that he questioned now if black kate would marry him these three years i was diverted from a farther observation of these combatants by a football match which was on the other side of the green where tom short behaved himself so well that most people seemed to agree it was impossible that he should remain a batchelor till the next wake having played many a match my self i could have looked longer on this sport had i not observed a country girl who was posted on an eminence at some distance from me and was making so many odd grimaces and writhing and distorting her whole body in so strange a manner as made me very desirous to know the meaning of it upon my coming up to her i found that she was overlooking a ring of wrestlers and that her sweetheart a person of small stature was contending with an huge brawny fellow who twirled him about and shook the little man so violently that by a secret sympathy of hearts it produced all those agitations in the person of his mistress who i dare say like cælia in shakespear on the same occasion could have wished herself invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg the squire of the parish treats the whole company every year with a hogshead of ale and proposes a beaverhat as a recompense to him who gives most falls this has raised such a spirit of emulation in the youth of the place that some of them have rendered themselves very expert at this exercise and i was often surmised to see a fellows heels fly up by a trip which was given him so smartly that i could scarce discern it i found that the old wrestlers seldom entered the ring till some one was grown formidable by having thrown two or three of his opponents but kept themselves as it were in a reserved body to defend the hat which is always hung up by the person who gets it in one of the most conspicuous parts of the house and looked upon by the whole family as something redounding much more to their honour than a coat of arms there was a fellow who was so busy in regulating all the ceremonies and seemed to carry such an air of importance in his looks that i could not help inquiring who he was and was immediately answered that he did not value himself upon nothing for that he and his ancestors had won so many hats that his parlour looked like a haberdashers shop however this thirst of glory in them all was the reason that no one man stood lord of the ring for above three falls while i was amongst them  the young maids who were not lookers on at these exercises were themselves engaged in some diversion and upon my asking a farmers son of my own parish what he was gazing at with so much attention he told me that he was seeing betty welch whom i knew to be his sweetheart pitch a bar  in short i found the men endeavoured to shew the women they were no cowards and that the whole company strived to recommend themselves to each other by making it appear that they were all in a perfect state of health and fit to undergo any fatigues of bodily labour  your judgment upon this method of love and gallantry as it is at present practised amongst us in the country will very much oblige sir yours c  if i would here put on the scholar and politician i might inform my readers how these bodily exercises or games were formerly encouraged in all the commonwealths of greece from whence the romans afterwards borrowed their pentathlum which was composed of running wrestling leaping throwing and boxing tho the prizes were generally nothing but a crown of cypress or parsley hats not being in fashion in those days that there is an old statute which obliges every man in england having such an estate to keep and exercise the long bow by which means our ancestors excelled all other nations in the use of that weapon and we had all the real advantages without the inconvenience of a standing army and that i once met with a book of projects in which the author considering to what noble ends that spirit of emulation which so remarkably shews it self among our common people in these wakes might be directed proposes that for the improvement of all our handicraft trades there should be annual prizes set up for such persons as were most excellent in their several arts but laying aside all these political considerations which might tempt me to pass the limits of my paper i confess the greatest benefit and convenience that i can observe in these country festivals is the bringing young people together and giving them an opportunity of shewing themselves in the most advantageous light a country fellow that throws his rival upon his back has generally as good success with their common mistress as nothing is more usual than for a nimblefooted wench to get a husband at the same time she wins a smock love and marriages are the natural effects of these anniversary assemblies i must therefore very much approve the method by which my correspondent tells me each sex endeavours to recommend it self to the other since nothing seems more likely to promise a healthy offspring or a happy cohabitation and i believe i may assure my country friend that there has been many a court lady who would be contented to exchange her crazy young husband for tom short and several men of quality who would have parted with a tender yokefellow for black kate  i am the more pleased with having love made the principal end and design of these meetings as it seems to be most agreeable to the intent for which they were at first instituted as we are informed by the learned dr kennet  with whose words i shall conclude my present paper these wakes says he were in imitation of the ancient  or lovefeasts and were first established in england by pope gregory the great who in an epistle to melitus the abbot gave order that they should be kept in sheds or arbories made up with branches and boughs of trees round the church  he adds that this laudable custom of wakes prevailed for many ages till the nice puritans began to exclaim against it as a remnant of popery and by degrees the precise humour grew so popular that at an exeter assizes the lord chief baron walter made an order for the suppression of all wakes but on bishop lauds complaining of this innovating humour the king commanded the order to be reversed  x      footnote     parochial antiquities      pp   0     return to footnote mark  contents contents p     no     wednesday september        addison   servetur ad imum qualis ab incœpto

different parties to please when the mind hovers among such a variety of allurements one had better settle on a way of life that is not the very best we might have chosen than grow old without determining our choice and go out of the world as the greatest part of mankind do before we have resolved how to live in it there is but one method of setting our selves at rest in this particular and that is by adhering stedfastly to one great end as the chief and ultimate aim of all our pursuits if we are firmly resolved to live up to the dictates of reason without any regard to wealth reputation or the like considerations any more than as they fall in with our principal design we may go through life with steadiness and pleasure but if we act by several broken views and will not only be virtuous but wealthy popular and every thing that has a value set upon it by the world we shall live and die in misery and repentance  one would take more than ordinary care to guard ones self against this particular imperfection because it is that which our nature very strongly inclines us to for if we examine ourselves throughly we shall find that we are the most changeable beings in the universe in respect of our understanding we often embrace and reject the very same opinions whereas beings above and beneath us have probably no opinions at all or at least no wavering and uncertainties in those they have our superiors are guided by intuition and our inferiors by instinct in respect of our wills we fall into crimes and recover out of them are amiable or odious in the eyes of our great judge and pass our whole life in offending and asking pardon on the contrary the beings underneath us are not capable of sinning nor those above us of repenting the one is out of the possibilities of duty and the other fixed in an eternal course of sin or an eternal course of virtue  there is scarce a state of life or stage in it which does not produce changes and revolutions in the mind of man our schemes of thought in infancy are lost in those of youth these too take a different turn in manhood till old age often leads us back into our former infancy a new title or an unexpected success throws us out of ourselves and in a manner destroys our identity a cloudy day or a little sunshine have as great an influence on many constitutions as the most real blessings or misfortunes a dream varies our being and changes our condition while it lasts and every passion not to mention health and sickness and the greater alterations in body and mind makes us appear almost different creatures if a man is so distinguished among other beings by this infirmity what can we think of such as make themselves remarkable for it even among their own species it is a very trifling character to be one of the most variable beings of the most variable kind especially if we consider that he who is the great standard of perfection has in him no shadow of change but is the same yesterday today and for ever  as this mutability of temper and inconsistency with our selves is the greatest weakness of human nature so it makes the person who is remarkable for it in a very particular manner more ridiculous than any other infirmity whatsoever as it sets him in a greater variety of foolish lights and distinguishes him from himself by an opposition of partycoloured characters the most humourous

the possession of any single man it would not make a very happy being though on the contrary if the miseries of the whole species were fixed in a single person they would make a very miserable one  i am engaged in this subject by the following letter which though subscribed by a fictitious name i have reason to believe is not imaginary mr spectator  i am one of your disciples and endeavour to live up to your rules which i hope will incline you to pity my condition i shall open it to you in a very few words about three years since a gentleman whom i am sure you yourself would have approved made his addresses to me he had every thing to recommend him but an estate so that my friends who all of them applauded his person would not for the sake of both of us favour his passion for my own part i resigned my self up entirely to the direction of those who knew the world much better than my self but still lived in hopes that some juncture or other would make me happy in the man whom in my heart i preferred to all the world being determined if i could not have him to have no body else about three months ago i received a letter from him acquainting me that by the death of an uncle he had a considerable estate left him which he said was welcome to him upon no other account but as he hoped it would remove all difficulties that lay in the way to our mutual happiness you may well suppose sir with how much joy i received this letter which was followed by several others filled with those expressions of love and joy which i verily believe no body felt more sincerely nor knew better how to describe than the gentleman i am speaking of but sir how shall i be able to tell it you by the last weeks post i received a letter from an intimate friend of this unhappy gentleman acquainting me that as he had just settled his affairs and was preparing for his journey he fell sick of a fever and died it is impossible to express to you the distress i am in upon this occasion i can only have recourse to my devotions and to the reading of good books for my consolation and as i always take a particular delight in those frequent advices and admonitions which you give to the publick it would be a very great piece of charity in you to lend me your assistance in this conjuncture if after the reading of this letter you find your self in a humour rather to rally and ridicule than to comfort me i desire you would throw it into the fire and think no more of it but if you are touched with my misfortune which is greater than i know how to bear your counsels may very much support and will infinitely oblige the afflicted leonora  a disappointment in love is more hard to get over than any other the passion itself so softens and subdues the heart that it disables it from struggling or bearing up against the woes and distresses which befal it the mind meets with other misfortunes in her whole strength she stands collected within her self and sustains the shock with all the force which  is natural to her but a heart in love has its foundations sapped and immediately sinks under the weight of accidents that are disagreeable to its favourite passion  in afflictions men generally draw their consolations out of books of morality which indeed are of great use to fortifie and strengthen the mind against the impressions of sorrow monsieur st evremont who does not approve of this method recommends authors who  are apt to stir up mirth in the mind of the readers and fancies don quixote can give more relief to an heavy heart than plutarch or seneca as it is much easier to divert grief than to conquer it this doubtless may have its effects on some tempers i should rather have recourse to authors of a quite contrary kind that give us instances of calamities and misfortunes and shew human nature in its greatest distresses  if the affliction we groan under be very heavy we shall find some consolation in the society of as great sufferers as our selves especially when we find our companions men of virtue and merit if our afflictions are light we shall be comforted by the comparison we make between our selves and our fellow sufferers a loss at sea a fit of sickness or the death of a friend are such trifles when we consider whole kingdoms laid in ashes families put to the sword wretches shut up in dungeons and the like calamities of mankind that we are out of countenance for our own weakness if we sink under such little stroaks of fortune  let the disconsolate leonora consider that at the very time in which she languishes for the loss of her deceased lover there are persons in several parts of the world just perishing in a shipwreck others crying out for mercy in the terrors of a deathbed repentance others lying under the tortures of an infamous execution or the like dreadful calamities and she will find her sorrows vanish at the appearance of those which are so much greater and more astonishing  i would further propose to the consideration of my afflicted disciple that possibly what she now looks upon as the greatest misfortune is not really such in it self for my own part i question not but our souls in a separate state will look back on their lives in quite another view than what they had of them in the body and that what they now consider as misfortunes and disappointments will very often appear to have been escapes and blessings  the mind that hath any cast towards devotion naturally flies to it in its afflictions  when i was in france i heard a very remarkable story of two lovers which i shall relate at length in my tomorrows paper not only because the circumstances of it are extraordinary but because it may serve as an illustration to all that can be said on this last head and shew the power of religion in abating that particular anguish which seems to lie so heavy on leonora the story was told me by a priest as i travelled with him in a stagecoach i shall give it my reader as well as i can remember in his own words after having premised that if consolations may be drawn from a wrong religion and a misguided devotion they cannot but flow much more naturally from those which are founded upon reason

heu non tua palmas  virg   constantia was a woman of extraordinary wit and beauty but very unhappy in a father who having arrived at great riches by his own industry took delight in nothing but his money theodosius was the younger son of a decayed family of great parts and learning improved by a genteel and vertuous education when he was in the twentieth year of his age he became acquainted with constantia who had not then passed her fifteenth as he lived but a few miles distance from her fathers house he had frequent opportunities of seeing her and by the advantages of a good person and a pleasing conversation made such an impression in her heart as it was impossible for time to efface  he was himself no less smitten with constantia a long acquaintance made them still discover new beauties in each other and by degrees raised in them that mutual passion which had an influence on their following lives it unfortunately happened that in the midst of this intercourse of love and friendship between theodosius and constantia there broke out an irreparable quarrel between their parents the one valuing himself too much upon his birth and the other upon his possessions the father of constantia was so incensed at the father of theodosius that he contracted an unreasonable aversion towards his son insomuch that he forbad him his house and charged his daughter upon her duty never to see him more in the mean time to break off all communication between the two lovers who he knew entertained secret hopes of some favourable opportunity that should bring them together he found out a young gentleman of a good fortune and an agreeable person whom he pitched upon as a husband for his daughter he soon concerted this affair so well that he told constantia it was his design to marry her to such a gentleman and that her wedding should be celebrated on such a day constantia who was overawed with the authority of her father and unable to object anything against so advantageous a match received the proposal with a profound silence which her father commended in her as the most decent manner of a virgins giving her consent to an overture of that kind the noise of this intended marriage soon reached theodosius who after a long tumult of passions which naturally rise in a lovers heart on such an occasion writ the following letter to constantia the thought of my constantia which for some years has been my only happiness is now become a greater torment to me than i am able to bear must i then live to see you anothers the streams the fields and meadows where we have so often talked together grow painful to me life it self is become a burden may you long be happy in the world but forget that there was ever such a man in it as theodosius  this letter was conveyed to constantia that very evening who fainted at the reading of it and the next morning she was much more alarmed by two or three messengers that came to her fathers house one after another to inquire if they had heard any thing of theodosius who it seems had left his chamber about midnight and could nowhere be found the deep melancholy which had hung upon his mind some time before made them apprehend the worst that could befall him constantia who knew that nothing but the report of her marriage could have driven him to such extremities was not to be comforted she now accused her self for having so tamely given an ear to the proposal of a husband and looked upon the new lover as the murderer of theodosius in short she resolved to suffer the utmost effects of her fathers displeasure rather than comply with a marriage which appeared to her so full of guilt and horror the father seeing himself entirely rid of theodosius and likely to keep a considerable portion in his family was not very much concerned at the obstinate refusal of his daughter and did not find it very difficult to excuse himself upon that account to his intended soninlaw who had all along regarded this alliance rather as a marriage of convenience than of love constantia had now no relief but in her devotions and exercises of religion to which her afflictions had so entirely subjected her mind that after some years had abated the violence of her sorrows and settled her thoughts in a kind of tranquillity she resolved to pass the remainder of her days in a convent her father was not displeased with a  resolution which  would save money in his family and readily complied with his daughters intentions accordingly in the twentyfifth year of her age while her beauty was yet in all its height and bloom he carried her to a neighbouring city in order to look out a sisterhood of nuns among whom to place his daughter there was in this place a father of a convent who was very much renowned for his piety and exemplary life and as it is usual in the romish church for those who are under any great affliction or trouble of mind to apply themselves to the most eminent confessors for pardon and consolation our beautiful votary took the opportunity of confessing herself to this celebrated father  we must now return to theodosius who the very morning that the abovementioned inquiries had been made after him arrived at a religious house in the city where now constantia resided and desiring that secresy and concealment of the fathers of the convent which is very usual upon any extraordinary occasion he made himself one of the order with a private vow never to enquire after constantia whom he looked upon as given away to his rival upon the day on which according to common fame their marriage was to have been solemnized having in his youth made a good progress in learning that he might dedicate himself  more entirely to religion he entered into holy orders and in a few years became renowned for his sanctity of life and those pious sentiments which he inspired into all who  conversed with him it was this holy man to whom constantia had determined to apply her self in confession tho neither she nor any other besides the prior of the convent knew any thing of his name or family the gay the amiable theodosius had now taken upon him the name of father francis and was so far concealed in a long beard a shaven  head and a religious habit that it was impossible to discover the man of the world in the venerable conventual  as he was one morning shut up in his confessional constantia kneeling by him opened the state of her soul to him and after having given him the history of a life full of innocence she burst out in tears and entred upon that part of her story in which he himself had so great a share my behaviour says she has i fear been the death of a man who had no other fault but that of loving me too much heaven only knows how dear he was to me whilst he livd and how bitter the remembrance of him has been to me since his death she here paused and lifted up her eyes that streamed with tears towards the father who was so moved with the sense of her sorrows that he could only command his voice which was broke with sighs and sobbings so far as to bid her proceed she followed his directions and in a flood of tears poured out her heart before him the father could not forbear weeping aloud insomuch that in the agonies of his grief the seat shook under him constantia who thought the good man was thus moved by his compassion towards her and by the horror of her guilt proceeded with the utmost contrition to acquaint him with that vow of virginity in which she was going to engage herself as the proper atonement for her sins and the only sacrifice she could make to the memory of theodosius the father who by this time had pretty well composed himself burst out again in tears upon hearing that name to which he had been so long disused and upon receiving this instance of an unparalleld fidelity from one who he thought had several years since given herself up to the possession of another amidst the interruptions of his sorrow seeing his penitent overwhelmed with grief he was only able to bid her from time to time be comforted — to tell her that her sins were forgiven her — that her guilt was not so great as she apprehended — that she should not suffer her self to be afflicted above measure after which he recovered himself enough to give her the absolution in form directing her at the same time to repair to him again the next day that he might encourage her in the pious resolutions she had taken and give her suitable exhortations for her behaviour in it constantia retired and the next morning renewed her applications theodosius having manned his soul with proper thoughts and reflections exerted himself on this occasion in the best manner he could to animate his penitent in the course of life she was entering upon and wear out of her mind those groundless fears and apprehensions which had taken possession of it concluding with a promise to her that he would from time to time continue his admonitions when she should have taken upon her the holy veil the rules of our respective orders says he will not permit that i should see you but you may assure your self not only of having a place in my prayers but of receiving such frequent instructions as i can convey to you by letters go on chearfully in the glorious course you have undertaken and you will quickly find such a peace and satisfaction in your mind which it is not in the power of the world to give  constantias heart was so elevated with the discourse of father francis that the very next day she entered upon her vow as soon as the solemnities of her reception were over she retired as it is usual with the abbess into her own apartment  the abbess had been informed the night before of all that had passed between her noviciate and father francis from whom she now delivered to her the following letter as the firstfruits of those joys and consolations which you may expect from the life you are now engaged in i must acquaint you that theodosius whose death sits so heavy upon your thoughts is still alive and that the father to whom you have confessed your self was once that theodosius whom you so much lament the love which we have had for one another will make us more happy in its disappointment than it could have done in its success providence has disposed of us for our advantage tho not according to our wishes consider your theodosius still as dead but assure your self of one who will not cease to pray for you in father  francis  constantia saw that the handwriting agreed with the contents of the letter and upon reflecting on the voice of the person the behaviour and above all the extreme sorrow of the father during her confession she discovered theodosius in every particular after having wept with tears of joy it is enough says she theodosius is still in being i shall live with comfort and die in peace  the letters which the father sent her afterwards are yet extant in the nunnery where she resided and are often read to the young religious in order to inspire them with good resolutions and sentiments of virtue it so happened that after constantia had lived about ten years in the cloyster a violent feaver broke out in the place which swept away great multitudes and among others theodosius upon his deathbed he sent his benediction in a very moving manner to constantia who at that time was herself so far gone in the same fatal distemper that she lay delirious upon the interval which generally precedes death in sicknesses of this nature the abbess finding that the physicians had given her over told her that theodosius was just gone before her and that he had sent her his benediction in his last moments constantia received it with pleasure and now says she if i do not ask anything improper let me be buried by theodosius my vow reaches no farther than the grave what i ask is i hope no violation of it — she died soon after and was interred according to her request  their tombs are still to be seen with a short latin inscription over them to the following purpose  here lie the bodies of father francis and sister constance they were lovely in their lives and in their deaths they were not divided  c

in our constitution there are several persons whose business it is to watch over our laws our liberties and commerce certain men might be set apart as superintendants of our language to hinder any words of a foreign coin from passing among us and in particular to prohibit any french phrases from becoming current in this kingdom when those of our own stamp are altogether as valuable the present war has so adulterated our tongue with strange words that it would be impossible for one of our great grandfathers to know what his posterity have been doing were he to read their exploits in a modern news paper our warriors are very industrious in propagating the french language at the same time that they are so gloriously successful in beating down their power our soldiers are men of strong heads for action and perform such feats as they are not able to express they want words in their own tongue to tell us what it is they atchieve and therefore send us over accounts of their performances in a jargon of phrases which they learn among their conquered enemies they ought however to be provided with secretaries and assisted by our foreign ministers to tell their story for them in plain english and to let us know in our mothertongue what it is our brave countrymen are about the french would indeed be in the right to publish the news of the present war in english phrases and make their campaigns unintelligible their people might flatter themselves that things are not so bad as they really are were they thus palliated with foreign terms and thrown into shades and obscurity but the english cannot be too clear in their narrative of those actions which have raised their country to a higher pitch of glory than it ever yet arrived at and which will be still the more admired the better they are explained  for my part by that time a siege is carried on two or three days i am altogether lost and bewildered in it and meet with so many inexplicable difficulties that i scarce know what side has the better of it till i am informed by the tower guns that the place is surrendered i do indeed make some allowances for this part of the war fortifications having been foreign inventions and upon that account abounding in foreign terms but when we have won battels which  may be described in our own language why are our papers filled with so many unintelligible exploits and the french obliged to lend us a part of their tongue before we can know how they are conquered they must be made accessory to their own disgrace as the britons were formerly so artificially wrought in the curtain of the roman theatre that they seemed to draw it up in order to give the spectators an opportunity of seeing their own defeat celebrated upon the stage for so mr dryden has translated that verse in virgil purpurea intexti  tollunt aulœa britanni  georg   v      which interwoven britains seem to raise and shew the triumph that their shame displays the histories of all our former wars are transmitted to us in our vernacular idiom to use the phrase of a great modern critick  i do not find in any of our chronicles that edward the third ever reconnoitred the enemy tho he often discovered the posture of the french and as often vanquished them in battel the black prince passed many a river without the help of pontoons and filled a ditch with faggots as successfully as the generals of our times do it with fascines our commanders lose half their praise and our people half their joy by means of those hard words and dark expressions in which our news papers do so much abound i have seen many a prudent citizen after having read every article inquire of his next neighbour what news the mail had brought  i remember in that remarkable year when our country was delivered from the greatest fears and apprehensions and raised to the greatest height of gladness it had ever felt since it was a nation i mean the year of blenheim i had the copy of a letter sent me out of the country which was written from a young gentleman in the army to his father a man of a good estate and plain sense as the letter was very modishly chequered with this modern military eloquence i shall present my reader with a copy of it sir  upon the junction of the french and bavarian armies they took post behind a great morass which they thought impracticable our general the next day sent a party of horse to reconnoitre them from a little hauteur at about a quarter of an hours  distance from the army who returned again to the camp unobserved through several defiles in one of which they met with a party of french that had been marauding and made them all prisoners at discretion the day after a drum arrived at our camp with a message which he would communicate to none but the general he was followed by a trumpet who they say behaved himself very saucily with a message from the duke of bavaria the next morning our army being divided into two corps made a movement towards the enemy you will hear in the publick prints how we treated them with the other circumstances of that glorious day i had the good fortune to be in that regiment that pushed the gens darms several french battalions who some say were a corps de reserve made a show of resistance but it only proved a gasconade for upon our preparing to fill up a little fossé in order to attack them they beat the chamade and sent us charte blanche their commandant with a great many other general officers and troops without number are made prisoners of war and will i believe give you a visit in england the cartel not being yet settled not questioning but these particulars will be very welcome to you i congratulate you upon them and am your most dutiful son c the father of the young gentleman upon the perusal of the letter found it contained great news but could not guess what it was he immediately communicated it to the curate of the parish who upon the reading of it being vexed to see any thing he could not understand fell into a kind of a passion and told him that his son had sent him a letter that was neither fish nor flesh nor good redherring i wish says he the captain may be compos mentis he talks of a saucy trumpet and a drum that carries messages then who is this charte blanche he must either banter us or he is out of his senses the father who always looked upon the curate as a learned man began to fret inwardly at his sons usage and producing a letter which he had written to him about three posts afore you see here says he when he writes for mony he knows how to speak intelligibly enough there is no man in england can express himself clearer when he wants a new furniture for his horse in short the old man was so puzzled upon the point that it might have fared ill with his son had he not seen all

mind of the first being and that those ideas which are in the mind of man are a transcript of the world to this we may add that words are the transcript of those ideas which are in the mind of man and that writing or printing are the transcript of words as the supreme being has expressed and as it were printed his ideas in the creation men express their ideas in books which by this great invention of these latter ages may last as long as the sun and moon and perish only in the general wreck of nature thus cowley in his poem on the resurrection mentioning the destruction of the universe has those admirable lines now all the wide extended sky and all th harmonious worlds on high and virgils sacred work shall die there is no other method of fixing those thoughts which arise and disappear in the mind of man and transmitting them to the last periods of time no other method of giving a permanency to our ideas and preserving the knowledge of any particular person when his body is mixed with the common mass of matter and his soul retired into the world of spirits books are the legacies that a great genius leaves to mankind which are delivered down from generation to generation as presents to the posterity of those who are yet unborn  all other arts of perpetuating our ideas continue but a short time statues can last but a few thousands of years edifices fewer and colours still fewer than edifices michael angelo fontana and raphael will hereafter be what phidias vitruvius and apelles are at present the names of great statuaries architects and painters whose works are lost the several arts are expressed in mouldring materials nature sinks under them and is not able to support the ideas which are imprest upon it  the circumstance which gives authors an advantage above all these great masters is this that they can multiply their originals or rather can make copies of their works to what number they please which shall be as valuable as the originals themselves this gives a great author something like a prospect of eternity but at the same time deprives him of those other advantages which artists meet with the artist finds greater returns in profit as the author in fame what an inestimable price would a virgil or a homer a cicero or an aristotle bear were their works like a statue a building or a picture to be confined only in one place and made the property of a single person  if writings are thus durable and may pass from age to age throughout the whole course of time how careful should an author be of committing any thing to print that may corrupt posterity and poison the minds of men with vice and error writers of great talents who employ their parts in propagating immorality and seasoning vicious sentiments with wit and humour are to be looked upon as the pests of society and the enemies of mankind they leave books behind them as it is said of those who die in distempers which breed an illwill towards their own species to scatter infection and destroy their posterity they act the counterparts of a confucius or a socrates and seem to have been sent into the world to deprave human nature and sink it into the condition of brutality  i have seen some romancatholick authors who tell us that vicious writers continue in purgatory so long as the influence of their writings continues upon posterity for purgatory say they is nothing else but a cleansing us of our sins which cannot be said to be done away so long as they continue to operate and corrupt mankind the vicious author say they sins after death and so long as he continues to sin so long must he expect to be punished tho the roman catholick notion of purgatory be indeed very ridiculous one cannot but think that if the soul after death has any knowledge of what passes in this world that of an immoral writer would receive much more regret from the sense of corrupting than satisfaction from the thought of pleasing his surviving admirers to take off from the severity of this speculation i shall conclude this paper with a story of an atheistical author who at a time when he lay dangerously sick and desired the assistance of a neighbouring curate confessed to him with great contrition that nothing sat more heavy at his heart than the sense of his having seduced the age by his writings and that their evil influence was likely to continue even after his death the curate upon further examination finding the penitent in the utmost agonies of despair and being himself a man of learning told him that he hoped his case was not so desperate as he apprehended since he found that he was so very sensible of his fault and so sincerely repented of it the penitent still urged the evil tendency of his book to subvert all religion and the little ground of hope there could be for one whose writings would continue to do mischief when his body was laid in ashes the curate finding no other way to comfort him told him that he did well in being afflicted for the evil design with which he published his book but that he ought to be very thankful that there was no danger of its doing any hurt that his cause was so very bad and his arguments so weak that he did not apprehend any ill effects of it in short that he might rest satisfied his book could do no more mischief after his death than it had done whilst he was living to which he added for his farther satisfaction that he did not believe any besides his particular friends and acquaintance had ever been at the pains of reading it or that any body after his death would ever enquire after it the dying man had still so much the frailty of an author in him as to be cut to the heart with these consolations and without answering the good man asked his friends about him with a peevishness that is natural to a sick person where they had picked up such a blockhead and whether they thought him a proper person to attend one in his condition the curate finding that the author did not expect to be dealt with as a real and sincere penitent but as a penitent of importance after a short admonition withdrew not questioning but he should be again sent for if the sickness grew desperate the author however recovered and has since written two or three other tracts with the same spirit and very luckily for his poor soul with the same success  c  contents contents p     no

unguided by the check of reason and judgment was the subject of a former speculation my reader may remember that he has seen in one of my papers a complaint of an unfortunate gentleman who was unable to contain himself when any ordinary matter was laid before him from adding a few circumstances to enliven plain narrative that correspondent was a person of too warm a complexion to be satisfied with things merely as they stood in nature and therefore formed incidents which should have happened to have pleased him in the story the same ungoverned fancy which pushed that correspondent on in spite of himself to relate publick and notorious falsehoods makes the author of the following letter do the same in private one is a prating the other a silent liar  there is little pursued in the errors of either of these worthies but mere present amusement but the folly of him who lets his fancy place him in distant scenes untroubled and uninterrupted is very much preferable to that of him who is ever forcing a belief and defending his untruths with new inventions but i shall hasten to let this liar in soliloquy who calls himself a castlebuilder describe himself with the same unreservedness as formerly appeared in my correspondent abovementioned if a man were to be serious on this subject he might give very grave admonitions to those who are following any thing in this life on which they think to place their hearts and tell them that they are really castlebuilders fame glory wealth honour have in the prospect pleasing illusions but they who come to possess any of them will find they are ingredients towards happiness to be regarded only in the second place and that when they are valued in the first degree they are as disappointing as any of the phantoms in the following letter

proper stature and killed with a good air and mein these are the gay phantoms that dance before my waking eyes and compose my daydreams i should be the most contented happy man alive were the chimerical happiness which springs from the paintings of the fancy less fleeting and transitory but alas it is with grief of mind i tell you the least breath of wind has often demolished my magnificent edifices swept away my groves and left no more trace of them than if they had never been my exchequer has sunk and vanished by a rap on my door the salutation of a friend has cost me a

possessions makes impressions of real woe besides bad œconomy is visible and apparent in builders of invisible mansions my tenants advertisements of ruins and dilapidations often cast a damp on my spirits even in the instant when the sun in all his splendor gilds my eastern palaces add to this the pensive drudgery in building and constant grasping aerial trowels distracts and shatters the mind

yet still once a month at least i dream of him so strong an impression did he make on my mind tis a sign he has fully terrified me waking who still continues to haunt me sleeping  and yet i may say without vanity that the business of the school was what i did without great difficulty and i was not remarkably unlucky and yet such was the masters severity that once a month or oftner i suffered as much as would have satisfied the law of the land for a petty larceny  many a white and tender hand which the fond mother has passionately kissed a thousand and a thousand times have i seen whipped

sets it often happens in publick assemblies that a party who came thither together or whose impertinencies are of an equal pitch act in concert and are so full of themselves as to give disturbance to all that are about them sometimes you have a set of whisperers who lay their heads together in order to sacrifice every body within their observation sometimes a set of laughers that keep up an insipid mirth in their own corner and by their noise and gestures shew they have no respect for the rest of the company you frequently meet with these sets at the opera the play the waterworks  and other publick meetings where their whole business is to draw off the attention of the spectators from the entertainment and to fix it upon themselves and it is to be observed that the impertinence is ever loudest when the set happens to be made up of three or four females who have got what you call a womans man among them  i am at a loss to know from whom people of fortune should learn this behaviour unless it be from the footmen who keep their places at a new play and are often seen passing away their time in sets at allfours in the face of a full house and with a perfect disregard to people of quality sitting on each side of them  for preserving therefore the decency of publick assemblies methinks it would be but reasonable that those who disturb others should pay at least a double price for their places or rather women of birth and distinction should be informed that a levity of behaviour in the eyes of people of understanding degrades them below their meanest attendants and gentlemen should know that a fine coat is a livery when the person who wears it discovers no higher sense than that of a footman i am sir your most humble servant     bedfordshire sept         mr

enough in life we are continually adding grief to grief and aggravating the common calamity by our cruel treatment of one another every mans natural weight of afflictions is still made more heavy by the envy malice treachery or injustice of his neighbour at the same time that the storm beats upon the whole species we are falling foul upon one another  half the misery of human life might be extinguished would men alleviate the general curse they lie under by mutual offices of compassion benevolence and humanity there is nothing therefore which we ought more to encourage in our selves and others than that disposition of mind which in our language goes under the title of goodnature and which i shall chuse for the subject of this days speculation  goodnature is more agreeable in conversation than wit and gives a certain air to the countenance which is more amiable than beauty it shows virtue in the fairest light takes off in some measure from the deformity of vice and makes even folly and impertinence supportable  there is no society or conversation to be kept up in the world without goodnature or something which must bear its appearance and supply its place for this reason mankind have been forced to invent a kind of artificial humanity which is what we express by the word goodbreeding for if we examine thoroughly the idea of what we call so we shall find it to be nothing else but an imitation and mimickry of goodnature or in other terms affability complaisance and easiness of temper reduced into an art  these exterior shows and appearances of humanity render a man wonderfully popular and beloved when they are founded upon a real goodnature but without it are like hypocrisy in religion or a bare form of holiness which when it is discovered makes a man more detestable than professed impiety  goodnature is generally born with us health prosperity and kind treatment from the world are great cherishers of it where they find it but nothing is capable of forcing it up where it does not grow of it self it is one of the blessings of a happy constitution which education may improve but not produce  xenophon  in the life of his imaginary prince whom he describes as a pattern for real ones is always celebrating the philanthropy or goodnature of his hero which he tells us he brought into the world with him and gives many remarkable instances of it in his childhood as well as in all the several parts of his life nay on his deathbed he describes him as being pleased that while his soul returned to him who  made it his body should incorporate with the great mother of all things and by that means become beneficial to mankind for which reason he gives his sons a positive order not to enshrine it in gold or silver but to lay it in the earth as soon as the life was gone out of it  an instance of such an overflowing of humanity such an exuberant love to mankind could not have entered into the imagination of a writer who had not a soul filled with great ideas and a general benevolence to mankind  in that celebrated passage of salust  where cæsar and cato are placed in such beautiful but opposite lights cæsars character is chiefly made up of goodnature as it shewed itself in all its forms towards his friends or his enemies his servants or dependants the guilty or the distressed as for catos character it is rather awful than amiable justice seems most agreeable to the nature of god and mercy to that of man a being who has nothing to pardon in himself may reward every man according to his works but he whose very best actions must be seen with grains of allowance cannot be too mild moderate and forgiving for this reason among all the monstrous characters in human nature there is none so odious nor indeed so exquisitely ridiculous as that of a rigid severe temper in a worthless man  this part of goodnature however which consists in the pardoning and overlooking of faults is to be exercised only in doing our selves justice and that too in the ordinary commerce and occurrences of life for in the publick administrations of justice mercy to one may be cruelty to others  it is grown almost into a maxim that goodnatured men are not always men of the most wit this observation in my opinion has no foundation in nature the greatest wits i have conversed with are men eminent for their humanity i take therefore this remark to have been occasioned by two reasons first because illnature among ordinary observers passes for wit a spiteful saying gratifies so many little passions in those who hear it that it generally meets with a good reception the laugh rises upon it and the man who utters it is looked upon as a shrewd satyrist this may be one reason why a great many pleasant companions appear so surprisingly dull when they have endeavoured to be merry in print the publick being more just than private clubs or assemblies in distinguishing between what is wit and what is illnature  another reason why the goodnatured man may sometimes bring his wit in question is perhaps because he is apt to be moved with compassion for those misfortunes or infirmities which another would turn into ridicule and by that means gain the reputation of a wit the illnatured man though but of equal parts gives himself a larger field to expatiate in he exposes those failings in human nature which the other would cast a veil over laughs at vices which the other either excuses or conceals gives utterance to reflections which the other stifles falls indifferently upon friends or enemies exposes the person who  has obliged him and in short sticks at nothing that may establish his character of a wit it is no wonder therefore he succeeds in it better than the man of humanity as a person who makes use of indirect methods is more likely to grow rich than the fair trader  l      footnote     cyropædia bk viii ch   return to footnote mark   footnote     that return   footnote    catiline c

induciæ bellum pax rursum   ter eun   upon looking over the letters of my female correspondents i find several from women complaining of jealous husbands and at the same time protesting their own innocence and desiring my advice on this occasion i shall therefore take this subject into my consideration and the more willingly because i find that the marquis of hallifax who in his advice to a daughter  has instructed a wife how to behave her self towards a false an intemperate a cholerick a sullen a covetous or a silly husband has not spoken one word of a jealous husband  jealousy is that pain which a man feels from the apprehension that he is not equally beloved by the person whom he entirely loves now because our inward passions and inclinations can never make themselves visible it is impossible for a jealous man to be thoroughly cured of his suspicions his thoughts hang at best in a state of doubtfulness and uncertainty and are never capable of receiving any satisfaction on the advantageous side so that his enquiries are most successful when they discover nothing his pleasure arises from his disappointments and his life is spent in pursuit of a secret that destroys his happiness if he chance to find it  an ardent love is always a strong ingredient in this passion for the same affection which stirs up the jealous mans desires and gives the party beloved so beautiful a figure in his imagination makes him believe she kindles the same passion in others and appears as amiable to all beholders and as jealousy thus arises from an extraordinary love it is of so delicate a nature that it scorns to take up with any thing less than an equal return of love not the warmest expressions of affection the softest and most tender hypocrisy are able to give any satisfaction where we are not persuaded that the affection is real and the satisfaction mutual for the jealous man wishes himself a kind of deity to the person he loves he would be the only pleasure of her senses the employment of her thoughts and is angry at every thing she admires or takes delight in besides himself  phædrias request to his mistress upon his leaving her for three days is inimitably beautiful and natural cum milite isto præsens absens ut sies dies noctesque me ames me desideres me somnies me exspectes de me cogites me speres me te oblectes mecum tola sis meus fac sis postremo animus quando ego sum tuus  ter eun  the jealous mans disease is of so malignant a nature that it converts all he takes into its own nourishment a cool behaviour sets him on the rack and is interpreted as an instance of aversion or indifference a fond one raises his suspicions and looks too much like dissimulation and artifice if the person he loves be cheerful her thoughts must be employed on another and if sad she is certainly thinking on himself in short there is no word or gesture so insignificant but it gives him new hints feeds his suspicions and furnishes him with fresh matters of discovery so that if we consider the effects of this passion one would rather think it proceeded from an inveterate hatred than an excessive love for certainly none can meet with more disquietude and uneasiness than a suspected wife if we except the jealous husband  but the great unhappiness of this passion is that it naturally tends to alienate the affection which it is so solicitous to engross and that for these two reasons because it lays too great a constraint on the words and actions of the suspected person and at the same time shews you have no honourable opinion of her both of which are strong motives to aversion  nor is this the worst effect of jealousy for it often draws after it a more fatal train of consequences and makes the person you suspect guilty of the very crimes you are so much afraid of it is very natural for such who are treated ill and upbraided falsely to find out an intimate friend that will hear their complaints condole their sufferings and endeavour to sooth and asswage their secret resentments besides jealousy puts a woman often in mind of an ill thing that she would not otherwise perhaps have thought of and fills her imagination with such an unlucky idea as in time grows familiar excites desire and loses all the shame and horror which might at first attend it nor is it a wonder if she who suffers wrongfully in a mans opinion of her and has therefore nothing to forfeit in his esteem resolves to give him reason for his suspicions and to enjoy the pleasure of the crime since she must undergo the ignominy such probably were the considerations that directed the wise man in his advice to husbands be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom and teach her not an evil lesson against thy self ecclus   and here among the other torments which this passion produces we may usually observe that none are greater mourners than jealous men when the person who  provoked their jealousy is taken from them then it is that their love breaks out furiously and throws off all the mixtures of suspicion which  choaked and smothered it before the beautiful parts of the character rise uppermost in the jealous husbands memory and upbraid him with the ill usage of so divine a creature as was once in his possession whilst all the little imperfections that were before  so uneasie to him wear off from his remembrance and shew themselves no more  we may see by what has been said that jealousy takes the deepest root in men of amorous dispositions and of these we may find three kinds who are most overrun with it  the first are those who are conscious to themselves of an infirmity whether it be weakness old age deformity ignorance or the like these men are so well acquainted with the unamiable part of themselves that they have not the confidence to think they are really beloved and are so distrustful of their own merits that all fondness towards them puts them out of countenance and looks like a jest upon their persons they grow suspicious on their first looking in a glass and are stung with jealousy at the sight of a wrinkle a handsome fellow immediately alarms them and every thing that looks young or gay turns their thoughts upon their wives  a second sort of men who are most liable to this passion are those of cunning wary and distrustful tempers it is a fault very justly found in histories composed by politicians that they leave nothing to chance or humour but are still for deriving every action from some plot and contrivance for drawing up a perpetual scheme of causes and events and preserving a constant correspondence between the camp and the counciltable and thus it happens in the affairs of love with men of too refined a thought they put a construction on a look and find out a design in a smile they give new senses and significations to words and actions and are ever tormenting themselves with fancies of their own raising they generally act in a disguise themselves and therefore mistake all outward shows and appearances for hypocrisy in others so that i believe no men see less of the truth and reality of things than these great refiners upon incidents who  are so wonderfully subtle and overwise in their conceptions  now what these men fancy they know of women by reflection your lewd and vicious men believe they have learned by experience they have seen the poor husband so misled by tricks and artifices and in the midst of his enquiries so lost and bewilderd in a crooked intreague that they still suspect an underplot in every female action and especially where they see any resemblance in the behaviour of two persons are apt to fancy it proceeds from the same design in both these men therefore bear hard upon the suspected party pursue her close through all her turnings and windings and are too well acquainted with the chace to be slung off by any false steps or doubles besides their acquaintance and conversation has lain wholly among the vicious part of womankind and therefore it is no wonder they censure all alike and look upon the whole sex as a species of impostors but if notwithstanding their private experience they can get over these prejudices and entertain a favourable opinion of some women yet their own loose desires will stir up new suspicions from another side and make them believe all men subject to the same inclinations with themselves  whether these or other motives are most predominant we learn from the modern histories of america as well as from our own experience in this part of the world that jealousy is no northern passion but rages most in those nations that lie nearest the influence of the sun it is a misfortune for a woman to be born between the tropicks for there lie the hottest regions of jealousy which as you come northward cools all along with the climate till you scarce meet with any thing like it in the polar circle our own nation is very temperately situated in this respect and if we meet with some few disordered with the violence of this passion they are not the proper growth of our country but are many degrees nearer the sun in their constitutions than in their climate  after this frightful account of jealousy and the persons who  are most subject to it it will be but fair to shew by what means the passion may be best allayd and those who are possessed with it set at ease other faults indeed are not under the wifes jurisdiction and should if possible escape her observation but jealousy calls upon her particularly for its cure and deserves all her art and application in the attempt besides she has this for her encouragement that her endeavours will be always pleasing and that she will still find the affection of her husband rising towards her in proportion as his doubts and suspicions vanish for as we have seen all along there is so great a mixture of love in jealousy as is well worth separating but this shall be the subject of another paper  l      footnote     miscellanies by the late lord

res amor est   ovid met   having in my yesterdays paper discovered the nature of jealousie and pointed out the persons who are most subject to it i must here apply my self to my fair correspondents who desire to live well with a jealous husband and to ease his mind of its unjust suspicions  the first rule i shall propose to be observed is that you never seem to dislike in another what the jealous man is himself guilty of or to admire any thing in which he himself does not excel a jealous man is very quick in his applications he knows how to find a double edge in an invective and to draw a satyr on himself out of a panegyrick on another he does not trouble himself to consider the person but to direct the character and is secretly pleased or confounded as he finds more or less of himself in it the commendation of any thing in another stirs up his jealousy as it shews you have a value for others besides himself but the commendation of that which he himself wants inflames him more as it shews that in some respects you prefer others before him jealousie is admirably described in this view by horace in his ode to lydia  quum tu lydia telephi cervicem roseam et cerea telephi laudas brachia væ meum fervens difficili bile tumet jecur tunc nec mens mihi nec color certâ sede manet humor et in genas furtim labitur arguens quam lentis penitus macerer ignibus  when telephus his youthful charms his rosie neck and winding arms with endless rapture you recite and in the pleasing name delight my heart inflamd by jealous heats with numberless resentments beats from my pale cheek the colour flies and all the man within me dies by turns my hidden grief appears in rising sighs and falling tears that shew too well the warm desires the silent slow consuming fires which on my inmost vitals prey and melt my very soul away the jealous man is not indeed angry if you dislike another but if you find those faults which are to be found in his own character you discover not only your dislike of another but of himself in short he is so desirous of ingrossing all your love that he is grieved at the want of any charm which he believes has power to raise it and if he finds by your censures on others that he is not so agreeable in your opinion as he might be he naturally concludes you could love him better if he had other qualifications and that by consequence your affection does not rise so high as he thinks it ought if therefore his temper be grave or sullen you must not be too much pleased with a jest or transported with any thing that is gay and diverting if his beauty be none of the best you must be a professed admirer of prudence or any other quality he is master of or at least vain enough to think he is  in the next place you must be sure to be free and open in your conversation with him and to let in light upon your actions to unravel all your designs and discover every secret however trifling or indifferent a jealous husband has a particular aversion to winks and whispers and if he does not see to the bottom of every thing will be sure to go beyond it in his fears and suspicions he will always expect to be your chief confident and where he finds himself kept out of a secret will believe there is more in it than there should be and here it is of great concern that you preserve the character of your sincerity uniform and of a piece for if he once finds a false gloss put upon any single action he quickly suspects all the rest his working imagination immediately takes a false hint and runs off with it into several remote consequences till he has proved very ingenious in working out his own misery  if both these methods fail the best way will be to let him see you are much cast down and afflicted for the ill opinion he entertains of you and the disquietudes he himself suffers for your sake there are many who take a kind of barbarous pleasure in the jealousy of those who  love them that insult over an aking heart and triumph in their charms which are able to excite so much uneasiness ardeat ipsa licet tormentis gaudet amantis  juv but these often carry the humour so far till their affected coldness and indifference quite kills all the fondness of a lover and are then sure to meet in their turn with all the contempt and scorn that is due to so insolent a behaviour on the contrary it is very probable a melancholy dejected carriage the usual effects of injured innocence may soften the jealous husband into pity make him sensible of the wrong he does you and work out of his mind all those fears and suspicions that make you both unhappy at least it will have this good effect that he will keep his jealousy to himself and repine in private either because he is sensible it is a weakness and will therefore hide it from your knowledge or because he will be apt to fear some ill effect it may produce in cooling your love towards him or diverting it to another  there is still another secret that can never fail if you can once get it believd and what is often practisd by women of greater cunning than virtue this is to change sides for a while with the jealous man and to turn his own passion upon himself to take some occasion of growing jealous of him and to follow the example he himself hath set you this counterfeited jealousy will bring him a great deal of pleasure if he thinks it real for he knows experimentally how much love goes along with this passion  and will besides feel  something like the satisfaction of a revenge in seeing you undergo all his own tortures but this indeed is an artifice so difficult and at the same time so disingenuous that it ought never to be put in practice but by such as have skill enough to cover the deceit and innocence to render it excusable  i shall conclude this essay with the story of herod and mariamne as i have collected it out of josephus  which may serve almost as an example to whatever can be said on this subject  mariamne had all the charms that beauty birth wit and youth could give a woman and herod all the love that such charms are able to raise in a warm and amorous disposition in the midst of this his fondness for mariamne he put her brother to death as he did her father not many years after the barbarity of the action was represented to mark antony who immediately summoned herod into egypt to answer for the crime that was there laid to his charge herod attributed the summons to antonys desire of mariamne whom therefore before his departure he gave into the custody of his uncle joseph with private orders to put her to death if any such violence was offered to himself this joseph was much delighted with mariamnes conversation and endeavoured with all his art and rhetorick to set out the excess of herods passion for her but when he still found her cold and incredulous he inconsiderately told her as a certain instance of her lords affection the private orders he had left behind him which plainly shewed according to josephs interpretation that he could neither live nor die without her this barbarous instance of a wild unreasonable passion quite put out for a time those little remains of affection she still had for her lord her thoughts were so wholly taken up with the cruelty of his orders that she could not consider the kindness that produced them and therefore represented him in her imagination rather under the frightful idea of a murderer than a lover herod was at length acquitted and dismissed by mark antony when his soul was all in flames for his mariamne but before their meeting he was not a little alarmd at the report he had heard of his uncles conversation and familiarity with her in his absence this therefore was the first discourse he entertained her with in which she found it no easy matter to quiet his suspicions but at last he appeared so well satisfied of her innocence that from reproaches and wranglings he fell to tears and embraces both of them wept very tenderly at their reconciliation and herod poured out his whole soul to her in the warmest protestations of love and constancy when amidst all his sighs and languishings she asked him whether the private orders he left with his uncle joseph were an instance of such an inflamed affection the jealous king was immediately roused at so unexpected a question and concluded his uncle must have been too familiar with her before he would have discovered such a secret in short he put his uncle to death and very difficultly prevailed upon himself to spare mariamne  after this he was forced on a second journey into egypt when he committed his lady to the care of sohemus with the same private orders he had before given his uncle if any mischief befel himself in the mean while mariamne so won upon sohemus by her presents and obliging conversation that she drew all the secret from him with which herod had intrusted him so that after his return when he flew to her with all the transports of joy and love she received him coldly with sighs and tears and all the marks of indifference and aversion this reception so stirred up his indignation that he had certainly slain her with his own hands had not he feared he himself should have become the greater sufferer by it it was not long after this when he had another violent return of love upon him mariamne was therefore sent for to him whom he endeavoured to soften and reconcile with all possible conjugal caresses and endearments but she declined his embraces and answered all his fondness with bitter invectives for the death of her father and her brother this behaviour so incensed herod that he very hardly refrained from striking her when in the heat of their quarrel there came in a witness subornd by some of mariamnes enemies who accused her to the king of a design to poison him herod was now prepared to hear any thing in her prejudice and immediately ordered her servant to be stretchd upon the rack who in the extremity of his tortures confest that his mistresss aversion to the king arose from something  sohemus had told her but as for any design of poisoning he utterly disowned the least knowledge of it this confession quickly proved fatal to sohemus who now lay under the same suspicions and sentence that joseph had before him on the like occasion nor would herod rest here but accused her with great vehemence of a design upon his life and by his authority with the judges had her publickly condemned and executed herod soon after her death grew melancholy and dejected retiring from the publick administration of affairs into a solitary forest and there abandoning himself to all the black considerations which naturally arise from a passion made up of love remorse pity and despair he used to rave for his

any regard how they are applied the gifts of nature and accomplishments of art are valuable but as they are exerted in the interest of virtue or governed by the rules of honour we ought to abstract our minds from the observation of any excellence in those we converse with till we have taken some notice or received some good information of the disposition of their minds otherwise the beauty of their persons or the charms of their wit may make us fond of those whom our reason and judgment will tell us we ought to abhor  when we suffer our selves to be thus carried away by meer beauty or meer wit omniamante with all her vice will bear away as much of our goodwill as the most innocent virgin or discreetest matron and there cannot be a more abject slavery in this world than to doat upon what we think we ought to contemn yet this must be our condition in all the parts of life if we suffer our selves to approve any thing but what tends to the promotion of what is good and honourable if we would take true pains with our selves to consider all things by the light of reason and justice tho a man were in the height of youth and amorous inclinations he would look upon a coquet with the same contempt or indifference as he would upon a coxcomb the wanton carriage in a woman would disappoint her of the admiration which she aims at and the vain dress or discourse of a man would destroy the comeliness of his shape or goodness of his understanding i say the goodness of his understanding for it is no less common to see men of sense commence coxcombs than beautiful women become immodest when this happens in either the favour we are naturally inclined to give to the good qualities they have from nature should abate in proportion but however just it is to measure the value of men by the application of their talents and not by the eminence of those qualities abstracted from their use i say however just such a way of judging is in all ages as well as this the contrary has prevailed upon the generality of mankind how many lewd devices have been preserved from one age to another which had perished as soon as they were made if painters and sculptors had been esteemed as much for the purpose as the execution of their designs modest and wellgoverned imaginations have by this means lost the representations of ten thousand charming portraitures filled with images of innate truth generous zeal couragious faith and tender humanity instead of which satyrs furies and monsters are recommended by those arts to a shameful eternity  the unjust application of laudable talents is tolerated in the general opinion of men not only in such cases as are here mentioned but also in matters which concern ordinary life if a lawyer were to be esteemed only as he uses his parts in contending for justice and were immediately despicable when he appeared in a cause which he could not but know was an unjust one how honourable would his character be and how honourable is it in such among us who follow the profession no otherwise than as labouring to protect the injured to subdue the oppressor to imprison the careless debtor and do right to the painful artificer but many of this excellent character are overlooked by the greater number who affect covering a weak place in a clients title diverting the course of an enquiry or finding a skilful refuge to palliate a falsehood yet it is still called eloquence in the latter though thus unjustly employed but resolution in an assassin is according to reason quite as laudable as knowledge and wisdom exercised in the defence of an ill cause  were the intention stedfastly considered as the measure of approbation all falsehood would soon be out of countenance and an address in imposing upon mankind would be as contemptible in one state of life as another a couple of courtiers making professions of esteem would make the same figure under breach of promise as two knights of the post convicted of perjury but conversation is fallen so low in point of morality that as they say in a bargain let the buyer look to it so in friendship he is the man in danger who is most apt to believe he is the more likely to suffer in the commerce who begins with the obligation of being the more ready to enter into it  but those men only are truly great who place their ambition rather in acquiring to themselves the conscience of worthy enterprizes than in the prospect of glory which attends them these exalted spirits would rather be secretly the authors of events which are serviceable to mankind than without being such to have the publick fame of it where therefore an eminent merit is robbed by artifice or detraction it does but encrease by such endeavours of its enemies the impotent pains which are taken to sully it or diffuse it among a crowd to the injury of a single person will naturally produce the contrary effect the fire will blaze out and burn up all that attempt to smother what they cannot extinguish  there is but one thing necessary to keep the possession of true glory which is to hear the opposers of it with patience and preserve the virtue by which it was acquired when a man is thoroughly perswaded that he ought neither to admire wish for or pursue any thing but what is exactly his duty it is not in the power of seasons persons or accidents to diminish his value he only is a great man who can neglect the applause of the multitude and enjoy himself independent of its favour this is indeed an arduous task but it should comfort a glorious spirit that it is the highest step to which human nature can arrive triumph applause acclamation are dear to the mind of man but it is still a more exquisite delight to say to your self you have done well than to hear the whole human race pronounce you glorious except you your self can join with them in your own reflections a mind thus equal and uniform may be deserted by little fashionable admirers and followers but will ever be had in reverence by souls

several handicraft prizes to be contended for by our british artizans and the influence they might have towards the improvement of our several manufactures i have since that been very much surprized by the following advertisement which i find in the postboy of the   th instant and again repeated in the postboy of the   th  on the  th of october next will be run for upon coleshillheath in

above or under to carry or be allowed weight for inches and to be entered friday the  th at the swan in coleshill before six in the evening also a plate of less value to be run for by asses the same day a gold ring to be grinnd for by men  the first of these diversions that is to be exhibited by the £ 0 racehorses may probably have its use but the two last in which the asses and men are concerned seem to me altogether extraordinary and unaccountable why they should keep running asses at coleshill or how making mouths turns to account in warwickshire more than in any other parts of england i cannot comprehend i have looked over all the olympic games and do not find any thing in them like an assrace or a match at grinning however it be i am informed that several asses are now kept in bodycloaths and sweated every morning upon the heath and that all the countryfellows within ten miles of the swan grinn an hour or two in their glasses every morning in order to qualify themselves for the  th of october the prize which is proposed to be grinnd for has raised such an ambition among the common people of outgrinning one another that many very discerning persons are afraid it should spoil most of the faces in the country and that a warwickshire man will be known by his grinn as romancatholicks imagine a kentish man is by his tail the gold ring which is made the prize of deformity is just the reverse of the golden apple that was formerly made the prize of beauty and should carry for its posy the old motto inverted detur tetriori or to accommodate it to the capacity of the combatants the frightfullst grinner be the winner in the mean while i would advise a dutch painter to be present at this great controversy of faces in order to make a collection of the most remarkable grinns that shall be there exhibited  i must not here omit an account which i lately received of one of these grinning matches from a gentleman who upon reading the abovementioned advertisement entertained a coffeehouse with the following narrative  upon the taking of namur  amidst other publick rejoicings made on that occasion there was a gold ring given by a whig justice of peace to be grinnd for the first competitor that entered the lists was a black swarthy french man who accidentally passed that way and being a man naturally of a witherd look and hard features promised himself good success he was placed upon a table in the great point of view and looking upon the company like miltons death grinnd horribly  a ghastly smile  his muscles were so drawn together on each side of his face that he shewd twenty teeth at a grinn and put the county in some pain lest a foreigner should carry away the honour of the day but upon a farther tryal they found he was master only of the merry grinn  the next that mounted the table was a malecontent in those days and a great master in the whole art of grinning but particularly excelled in the angry grinn he did his part so well that he is said to have made half a dozen women miscarry but the justice being apprised by one who stood near him that the fellow who grinned in his face was a jacobite and being unwilling that a disaffected person should win the gold ring and be looked upon as the best grinner in the country he ordered the oaths to be tendered unto him upon his quitting the table which the grinner refusing he was set aside as an unqualified person there were several other grotesque figures that presented themselves which it would be too tedious to describe i must not however omit a ploughman who lived in the farther part of the country and being very lucky in a pair of long lanthornjaws wrung his face into such a hideous grimace that every feature of it appeared under a different distortion the whole company stood astonished at such a complicated grinn and were ready to assign the prize to him had it not been proved by one of his antagonists that he had practised with verjuice for some days before and had a crab found upon him at the very time of grinning upon which the best judges of grinning declared it as their opinion that he was not to be looked upon as a fair grinner and therefore ordered him to be set aside as a cheat  the prize it seems fell at length upon a cobler giles gorgon by name who produced several new grinns of his own invention having been used to cut faces for many years together over his last at the very first grinn he cast every human feature out of his countenance at the second he became the face of a spout at the third a baboon at the fourth the head of a baseviol and at the fifth a pair of nutcrackers the whole assembly wondered at his accomplishments and bestowed the ring on him unanimously but what he esteemed more than all the rest a country wench whom he had wooed in vain for above five years before was so charmed with his grinns and the applauses which he received on all sides that she married him the week following and to this day wears the prize upon her finger the cobler having made use of it as his weddingring  this paper might perhaps seem very impertinent if it grew serious in the conclusion i would nevertheless leave it to the consideration of those who are the patrons of this monstrous tryal of skill whether or no they are not guilty in some measure of an affront to their species in treating after this manner the human face divine and turning that part of us which has so great an image impressed upon it into the image of a monkey whether the raising such silly competitions among the ignorant proposing prizes for such useless accomplishments filling the common peoples heads with such senseless ambitions and inspiring them with such absurd ideas of superiority and preheminence has not in it something immoral as

cannot subsist but by their agreement this was well represented in the sedition of the members of the humane body in the old roman fable it is often the case of lesser confederate states against a superior power which are hardly held together though their unanimity is necessary for their common safety and this is always the case of the landed and trading interest of great britain the trader is fed by the product of the land and the landed man cannot be clothed but by the skill of the trader and yet those interests are ever jarring  we had last winter an instance of this at our club in sir roger de coverley and sir andrew freeport between whom there is generally a constant though friendly opposition of opinions it happened that one of the company in an historical discourse was observing that carthaginian faith  was a proverbial phrase to intimate breach of leagues sir roger said it could hardly be otherwise that the carthaginians were the greatest traders in the world and as gain is the chief end of such a people they never pursue any other the means to it are never regarded they will if it comes easily get money honestly but if not they will not scruple to attain it by fraud or cozenage and indeed what is the whole business of the traders account but to overreach him who trusts to his memory but were that not so what can there great and noble be expected from him whose attention is for ever fixed upon ballancing his books and watching over his expences and at best let frugality and parsimony be the virtues of the merchant how much is his punctual dealing below a gentlemans charity to the poor or hospitality among his neighbours  captain sentry observed sir andrew very diligent in hearing sir roger and had a mind to turn the discourse by taking notice in general from the highest to the lowest parts of human society there was a secret tho unjust way among men of indulging the seeds of ill nature and envy by comparing their own state of life to that of another and grudging the approach of their neighbour to their own happiness and on the other side he who is the less at his ease repines at the other who he thinks has unjustly the advantage over him thus the civil and military lists look upon each other with much ill nature the soldier repines at the courtiers power and the courtier rallies the soldiers honour or to come to lower instances the private men in the horse and foot of an army the carmen and coachmen in the city streets mutually look upon each other with ill will when they are in competition for quarters or the way in their respective motions  it is very well good captain interrupted sir andrew you may attempt to turn the discourse if you think fit but i must however have a word or two with sir roger who i see thinks he has paid me off and been very severe upon the merchant i shall not continued he at this time remind sir roger of the great and noble monuments of charity and publick spirit which have been erected by merchants since the reformation but at present content my self with what he allows us parsimony and frugality if it were consistent with the quality of so antient a baronet as sir roger to keep an account or measure things by the most infallible way that of numbers he would prefer our parsimony to his hospitality if to drink so many hogsheads is to be hospitable we do not contend for the fame of that virtue but it would be worth while to consider whether so many artificers at work ten days together by my appointment or so many peasants made merry on sir rogers charge are the men more obliged i believe the families of the artificers will thank me more than the households of the peasants shall sir roger sir roger gives to his men but i place mine above the necessity or obligation of my bounty i am in very little pain for the roman proverb upon the carthaginian traders the romans were their professed enemies i am only sorry no carthaginian histories have come to our hands we might have been taught perhaps by them some proverbs against the roman generosity in fighting for and bestowing other peoples goods but since sir roger has taken occasion from an old proverb to be out of humour with merchants it should be no offence to offer one not quite so old in their defence when a man happens to break in holland they say of him that he has not kept true accounts this phrase perhaps among us would appear a soft or humorous way of speaking but with that exact nation it bears the highest reproach for a man to be mistaken in the calculation of his expence in his ability to answer future demands or to be impertinently sanguine in putting his credit to too great adventure are all instances of as much infamy as with gayer nations to be failing in courage or common honesty  numbers are so much the measure of every thing that is valuable that it is not possible to demonstrate the success of any action or the prudence of any undertaking without them i say this in answer to what sir roger is pleased to say that little that is truly noble can be expected from one who is ever poring on his cashbook or ballancing his accounts when i have my returns from abroad i can tell to a shilling by the help of numbers the profit or loss by my adventure but i ought also to be able to shew that i had reason for making it either from my own experience or that of other people or from a reasonable presumption that my returns will be sufficient to answer my expence and hazard and this is never to be done without the skill of numbers for instance if i am to trade to turkey i ought beforehand to know the demand of our manufactures there as well as of their silks in england and the customary prices that are given for both in each country i ought to have a clear knowledge of these matters beforehand that i may presume upon sufficient returns to answer the charge of the cargo i have fitted out the freight and assurance out and home the custom to the queen and the interest of my own money and besides all these expences a reasonable profit to my self now what is there of scandal in this skill what has the merchant done that he should be so little in the good graces of sir roger he throws down no mans enclosures and tramples upon no mans corn he takes nothing from the industrious labourer he pays the poor man for his work he communicates his profit with mankind by the preparation of his cargo and the manufacture of his returns he furnishes employment and subsistence to greater numbers than the richest nobleman and even the nobleman is obliged to him for finding out foreign markets for the produce of his estate and for making a great addition to his rents and yet tis certain that none of all these things could be done by him without the exercise of his skill in numbers  this is the œconomy of the merchant and the conduct of the gentleman must be the same unless by scorning to be the steward he resolves the steward shall be the gentleman the gentleman no more than the merchant is able without the help of numbers to account for the success of any action or the prudence of any adventure if for instance the chace is his whole adventure his only returns must be the stags horns in the great hall and the foxs nose upon the stable door without doubt sir roger knows the full value of these returns and if beforehand he had computed the charges of the chace a gentleman of his discretion would certainly have hanged up all his dogs he would never have brought back so many fine horses to the kennel he would never have gone so often like a blast over fields of corn if such too had been the conduct of all his ancestors he might truly have boasted at this day that the antiquity of his family had never been sullied by a trade a merchant had never been permitted with his whole estate to purchase a room for his picture in the gallery of the coverleys or to claim his descent from the maid of honour but tis very happy for sir roger that the merchant paid so dear for his ambition tis the misfortune of many other gentlemen to turn out of the seats of their ancestors to make way for such new masters as have been more exact in their accounts than themselves and certainly he deserves the estate a great deal better who has got it by his industry than he who has lost it by his negligence  t      footnote     punica fides return to footnote mark

from my correspondents the first discovers to me a species of females which have hitherto escaped my notice and is as follows mr spectator  i am a young gentleman of a competent fortune and a sufficient taste of learning to spend five or six hours every day very agreeably among my books that i might have nothing to divert me from my studies and to avoid the noises of coaches and chairmen i have taken lodgings in a very narrow street not far from whitehall but it is my misfortune to be so posted that my lodgings are directly opposite to those of a jezebel you are to know sir that a jezebel so calld by the neighbourhood from displaying her pernicious charms at her window appears constantly dressd at her sash and has a thousand little tricks and fooleries to attract the eyes of all the idle young fellows in the neighbourhood i have seen more than six persons at once from their several windows observing the jezebel i am now complaining of i at first looked on her my self with the highest contempt could divert my self with her airs for half an hour and afterwards take up my plutarch with great tranquillity of mind but was a little vexed to find that in less than a month she had considerably stoln upon my time so that i resolved to look at her no more but the jezebel who as i suppose might think it a diminution to her honour to have the number of her gazers lessend resolved not to part with me so and began to play so many new tricks at her window that it was impossible for me to forbear observing her i verily believe she put her self to the expence of a new wax baby on purpose to plague me she usd to dandle and play with this figure as impertinently as if it had been a real child sometimes she would let fall a glove or a pin cushion in the street and shut or open her casement three or four times in a minute when i had almost weand my self from this she came in her shiftsleeves and dressd at the window i had no way left but to let down my curtains which i submitted to though it considerably darkned my room and was pleased to think that i had at last got the better of her but was surprizd the next morning to hear her talking out of her window quite cross the street with another woman that lodges over me i am since informed that she made her a visit and got acquainted with her within three hours after the fall of my window curtains sir i am plagued every moment in the day one way or other in my own chambers and the jezebel has the satisfaction to know that tho i am not looking at her i am listning to her impertinent dialogues that pass over my head i would immediately change my lodgings but that i think it might look like a plain confession that i am conquerd and besides this i am told that most quarters of the town are infested with these creatures if they are so i am sure tis such an abuse as a lover of learning and silence ought to take notice of  i am sir yours c  i am afraid by some lines in this letter that my young student is touched with a distemper which he hardly seems to dream of and is too far gone in it to receive advice however i shall animadvert in due time on the abuse which he mentions having my self observed a nest of jezebels near the temple who make it their diversion to draw up the eyes of young templars that at the same time they may see them stumble in an unlucky gutter which runs under the window mr spectator  i have lately read the conclusion of your fortyseventh speculation upon butts with great pleasure and have ever since been thoroughly perswaded that one of those gentlemen is extreamly necessary to enliven conversation i had an entertainment last week upon the water for a lady to whom i make my addresses with several of our friends of both sexes to divert the company in general and to shew my mistress in particular my genius for raillery i took one of the most celebrated butts in town along with me it is with the utmost shame and confusion that i must acquaint you with the sequel of my adventure as soon as we were got into the boat i played a sentence or two at my butt which i thought very smart when my ill genius who i verily believe inspird him purely for my destruction suggested to him such a reply as got all the laughter on his side i was clashed at so unexpected a turn which the butt perceiving resolved not to let me recover my self and pursuing his victory rallied and tossed me in a most unmerciful and barbarous manner till we came to chelsea i had some small success while we were eating cheesecakes but coming home he renewed his attacks with his former good fortune and equal diversion to the whole company in short sir i must ingenuously own that i was never so handled in all my life and to compleat my misfortune i am since told that the butt flushed with his late victory has made a visit or two to the dear object of my wishes so that i am at once in danger of losing all my pretensions to wit and my mistress into  the bargain this sir is a true account of my present troubles which you are the more obliged to assist me in as you were your self in a great measure the cause of them by recommending to us an instrument and not instructing us at the same time how to play upon it  i have been thinking whether it might not be highly convenient that all butts should wear an inscription affixed to some part of their bodies shewing on which side they are to be come at and that if any of them are persons of unequal tempers there should be some method taken to inform the world at what time it is safe to attack them and when you had best to let them alone but submitting these matters to your more serious consideration  i am sir yours c  i have indeed seen and heard of several young gentlemen under the same misfortune with my present correspondent the best rule i can lay down for them to avoid the like calamities for the future is thoroughly to consider not only whether their companions are weak but whether themselves are wits  the following letter comes to me from exeter and being credibly informed that what it contains is matter of fact i shall give it my reader as it was sent me mr spectator  exeter sept    you were pleased in a late speculation to take notice of the inconvenience we lie under in the country in not being able to keep pace with the fashion but there is another misfortune which we are subject to and is no less grievous than the former which has hitherto escaped your observation i mean the having things palmed upon us for london fashions which were never once heard of there  a lady of this place had some time since a box of the newest ribbons sent down by the coach whether it was her own malicious invention or the wantonness of a london milliner i am not able to inform you but among the rest there was one cherrycoloured ribbon consisting of about half a dozen yards made up in the figure of a small headdress the foresaid lady had the assurance to affirm amidst a circle of female inquisitors who were present at the opening of the box that this was the newest fashion worn at court accordingly the next sunday we had several females who came to church with their heads dressd wholly in ribbons and looked like so many victims ready to be sacrificed this is still a reigning mode among us at the same time we have a set of gentlemen who take the liberty to appear in all publick places without any buttons to their coats which they supply with several little silver hasps tho our freshest advices from london make no mention of any such fashion and we are something shy of affording matter to the buttonmakers for a second petition   what i would humbly propose to the publick is that there may be a society erected in london to consist of the most skilful persons of both sexes for the inspection of modes and fashions and that hereafter no person or persons shall presume to appear singularly habited in any part of the country without a testimonial from the foresaid society that their dress is answerable to the mode at london by this means sir we shall know a little whereabout we are  if you could bring this matter to bear you would very much oblige

pretend to explain upon it till further consideration but leave the author of the epistle to express his condition his own way mr spectator  i do not deny but you appear in many of your papers to understand human life pretty well but there are very many things which you cannot possibly have a true notion of in a single life these are such as respect the married state otherwise i cannot account for your having overlooked a very good sort of people which are commonly called in scorn the henpeckt you are to understand that i am one of those innocent mortals who suffer derision under that word for being governed by the best of wives it would be worth your consideration to enter into the nature of affection it self and tell us according to your philosophy why it is that our dears shall do what they will with us shall be froward illnatured assuming sometimes whine at others rail then swoon away then come to life have the use of speech to the greatest fluency imaginable and then sink away again and all because they fear we do not love them enough that is the poor things love us so heartily that they cannot think it possible we should be able to love them in so great a degree which makes them take on so i say sir a true goodnatured man whom rakes and libertines call henpeckt shall fall into all these different moods with his dear life and at the same time see they are wholly put on and yet not be hardhearted enough to tell the dear good creature that she is an hypocrite this sort of good man is very frequent in the populous and wealthy city of london and is the true henpeckt man the kind creature cannot break through his kindnesses so far as to come to an explanation with the tender soul and therefore goes on to comfort her when nothing ails her to appease her when she is not angry and to give her his cash when he knows she does not want it rather than be uneasy for a whole month which is computed by hardhearted men the space of time which a froward woman takes to come to her self if you have courage to stand out  there are indeed several other species of the henpeckt and in my opinion they are certainly the best subjects the queen has and for that reason i take it to be your duty to keep us above contempt  i do not know whether i make my self understood in the representation of an henpeckt life but i shall take leave to give you an account of my self and my own spouse you are to know that i am reckoned no fool have on several occasions been tried whether i will take ill usage and yet the event has been to my advantage and yet there is not such a slave in turkey as i am to my dear she has a good share of wit and is what you call a very pretty agreeable woman i perfectly doat on her and my affection to her gives me all the anxieties imaginable but that of jealousy my being thus confident of her i take as much as i can judge of my heart to be the reason that whatever she does tho it be never so much against my inclination there is still left something in her manner that is amiable she will sometimes look at me with an assumed grandeur and pretend to resent that i have not had respect enough for her opinion in such an instance in company i cannot but smile at the pretty anger she is in and then she pretends she is used like a child in a word our great debate is which has the superiority in point of understanding she is eternally forming an argument of debate to which i very indolently answer thou art mighty pretty to this she answers all the world but you think i have as much sense as your self i repeat to her indeed you are pretty upon this there is no patience she will throw down any thing about her stamp and pull off her headcloaths fie my dear say i how can a woman of your sense fall into such an intemperate rage this is an argument which never fails indeed my dear says she you make me mad sometimes so you do with the silly way you have of treating me like a pretty idiot well what have i got by putting her into good humour nothing but that i must convince her of my good opinion by my practice and then i am to give her possession of my little ready money and for a day and half following dislike all she dislikes and extol every thing she approves i am so exquisitely fond of this darling that i seldom see any of my friends am uneasy in all companies till i see her again and when i come home she is in the dumps because she says she is sure i came so soon only because i think her handsome i dare not upon this occasion laugh but tho i am one of the warmest churchmen in the kingdom i am forced to rail at the times because she is a violent whig upon this we talk politicks so long that she is convincd i kiss her for her wisdom it is a common practice with me to ask her some question concerning the constitution which she answers me in general out of haringtons oceana  then i commend her strange memory and her arm is immediately lockd in mine while i keep her in this temper she plays before me sometimes dancing in the midst of the room sometimes striking an air at her spinnet varying her posture and her charms in such a manner that i am in continual pleasure she will play the fool if i allow her to be wise but if she suspects i like her for her trifling she immediately grows grave  these are the toils in which i am taken and i carry off my servitude as well as most men but my application to you is in behalf of the henpeckt in general and i desire a dissertation from you in defence of us you have as i am informed very good authorities in our favour and hope you will not omit the mention of the renowned socrates and his philosophick resignation to his wife xantippe this would be a very good office to the world in general for the henpeckt are powerful in their quality

as it is the effect of constitution i shall now speak of it as it is a moral virtue the first may make a man easy in himself and agreeable to others but implies no merit in him that is possessed of it a man is no more to be praised upon this account than because he has a regular pulse or a good digestion this goodnature however in the constitution which mr dryden somewhere calls a milkiness of blood  is an admirable groundwork for the other in order therefore to try our goodnature whether it arises from the body or the mind whether it be founded in the animal or rational part of our nature in a word whether it be such as is entituled to any other reward besides that secret satisfaction and contentment of mind which is essential to it and the kind reception it procures us in the world we must examine it by the following rules  first whether it acts with steadiness and uniformity in sickness and in health in prosperity and in adversity if otherwise it is to be looked upon as nothing else but an irradiation of the mind from some new supply of spirits or a more kindly circulation of the blood sir francis bacon mentions a cunning solicitor who  would never ask a favour of a great man before dinner but took care to prefer his petition at a time when the party petitioned had his mind free from care and his appetites in good humour such a transient temporary goodnature as this is not that philanthropy that love of mankind which deserves the title of a moral virtue  the next way of a mans bringing his goodnature to the test is to consider whether it operates according to the rules of reason and duty for if notwithstanding its general benevolence to mankind it makes no distinction between its objects if it exerts it self promiscuously towards the deserving and undeserving if it relieves alike the idle and the indigent if it gives it self up to the first petitioner and lights upon any one rather by accident than choice it may pass for an amiable instinct but must not assume the name of a moral virtue  the third tryal of goodnature will be the examining ourselves whether or no we are able to exert it to our own disadvantage and employ it on proper objects notwithstanding any little pain want or inconvenience which may arise to our selves from it in a word whether we are willing to risque any part of our fortune our reputation our health or ease for the benefit of mankind among all these expressions of goodnature i shall single out that which goes under the general name of charity as it consists in relieving the indigent that being a tryal of this kind which offers itself to us almost at all times and in every place  i should propose it as a rule to every one who is provided with any competency of fortune more than sufficient for the necessaries of life to lay aside a certain proportion of his income for the use of the poor this i would look upon as an offering to him who has a right to the whole for the use of those whom in the passage hereafter mentioned he has described as his own representatives upon earth at the same time we should manage our charity with such prudence and caution that we may not hurt our own friends or relations whilst we are doing good to those who are strangers to us  this may possibly be explained better by an example than by a rule  eugenius is a man of an universal goodnature and generous beyond the extent of his fortune but withal so prudent in the œconomy of his affairs that what goes out in charity is made up by good management eugenius has what the world calls two hundred pounds a year but never values himself above ninescore as not thinking he has a right to the tenth part which he always appropriates to charitable uses to this sum he frequently makes other voluntary additions insomuch that in a good year for such he accounts those in which he has been able to make greater bounties than ordinary he has given above twice that sum to the sickly and indigent eugenius prescribes to himself many particular days of fasting and abstinence in order to increase his private bank of charity and sets aside what would be the current expences of those times for the use of the poor he often goes afoot where his business calls him and at the end of his walk has given a shilling which in his ordinary methods of expence would have gone for coachhire to the first necessitous person that has fallen in his way i have known him when he has been going to a play or an opera divert the money which was designed for that purpose upon an object of charity whom he has met with in the street and afterwards pass his evening in a coffeehouse or at a friends fireside with much greater satisfaction to himself than he could have received from the most exquisite entertainments of the theatre by these means he is generous without impoverishing himself and enjoys his estate by making it the property of others  there are few men so cramped in their private affairs who may not be charitable after this manner without any disadvantage to themselves or prejudice to their families it is but sometimes sacrificing a diversion or convenience to the poor and turning the usual course of our expences into a better channel this is i think not only the most prudent and convenient but the most meritorious piece of charity which we can put in practice by this method we in some measure share the necessities of the poor at the same time that we relieve them and make ourselves not only their patrons  but their fellow sufferers  sir thomas brown in the last part of his religio medici in which he describes his charity in several heroick instances and with a noble heat of sentiments mentions that verse in the proverbs of solomon he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord  there is more rhetorick in that one sentence says he than in a library of sermons and indeed if those sentences were understood by the reader with the same emphasis as they are delivered by the author we needed not those volumes of instructions but might be honest by an epitome  this passage in scripture is indeed wonderfully persuasive but i think the same thought is carried much further in the new testament where our saviour tells us in a most pathetick manner that he shall hereafter regard the cloathing of the naked the feeding of the hungry and the visiting of the imprisoned as offices done to himself and reward them accordingly  pursuant to those passages in holy scripture i have somewhere met with the epitaph of a charitable man which has very much pleased me i cannot recollect the words but the sense of it is to this purpose what i spent i lost what i possessed is left to others what i gave away remains with me   since i am thus insensibly engaged in sacred writ i cannot forbear making an extract of several passages which i have always read with great delight in the book of job it is the account which that holy man gives of his behaviour in the days of his prosperity and if considered only as a human composition is a finer picture of a charitable and goodnatured man than is to be met with in any other author  oh that i were as in months past as in the days when god preserved me when his candle shined upon my head and when by his light i walked through darkness when the almighty was yet with me when my children were about me when i washed my steps with butter and the rock poured out rivers of oyl  when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me because i delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i caused the widows heart to sing for joy i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame i was a father to the poor and the cause which i knew not i searched out did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the poor let me be weighed in an even ballance that god may know mine integrity if i did despise the cause of my manservant or my maidservant when they contended with me what then shall i do when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one fashion us in the womb if i have withheld the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail or have eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof if i have seen any perish for want of cloathing or any poor without covering if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep if i have lift up my hand against the fatherless when i saw my help in the gate then let mine arm fall from my shoulderblade and mine arm be broken from the bone if i have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me or lift up myself when evil found him neither have i suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doors to the traveller if my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof complain if i have eaten the fruits thereof without mony or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley       footnote     cleomenes to pantheus would i could share thy balmy even temper and milkiness of blood

you to speak of that torture in the breast of a man and not to mention also the pangs of it in the heart of a woman you have very judiciously and with the greatest penetration imaginable considered it as woman is the creature of whom the diffidence is raised but not a word of a man who is so unmerciful as to move jealousy in his wife and not care whether she is so or not it is possible you may not believe there are such tyrants in the world but alas i can tell you of a man who is ever out of humour in his wifes company and the pleasantest man in the world every where else the greatest sloven at home when he appears to none but his family and most exactly welldressed in all other places alas sir is it of course that to deliver ones self wholly into a mans power without possibility of appeal to any other jurisdiction but to his own reflections is so little an obligation to a gentleman that he can be offended and fall into a rage because my heart swells tears into my eyes when i see him in a cloudy mood i pretend to no succour and hope for no relief but from himself and yet he that has sense and justice in every thing else never reflects that to come home only to sleep off an intemperance and spend all the time he is there as if it were a punishment cannot but give the anguish of a jealous mind he always leaves his home as if he were going to court and returns as if he were entring a gaol i could add to this that from his company and his usual discourse he does not scruple being thought an abandoned man as to his morals your own imagination will say enough to you concerning the condition of me his wife and i wish you would be so good as to represent to him for he is not illnatured and reads you much that the moment i hear the door shut after him i throw myself upon my bed and drown the child he is so fond of with my tears and often frighten it with my cries that i curse my being that i run to my glass all over bathed in sorrows and help the utterance of my inward anguish by beholding the gush of my own calamities as my tears fall from my eyes this looks like an imagined picture to tell you but indeed this is one of my pastimes hitherto i have only told you the general temper of my mind but how shall i give you an account of the distraction of it could you but conceive how cruel i am one moment in my resentment and at the ensuing minute when i place him in the condition my anger would bring him to how compassionate it would give you some notion how miserable i am and how little i deserve it when i remonstrate with the greatest gentleness that is possible against unhandsome appearances and that married persons are under particular rules when he is in the best humour to receive this i am answered only that i expose my own reputation and sense if i appear jealous i wish good sir you would take this into serious consideration and admonish husbands and wives what terms they ought to keep towards each other your thoughts on this important subject will have the greatest reward that which descends on such as feel the sorrows of the afflicted give me leave to subscribe my self your unfortunate humble servant celinda  i had it in my thoughts before i received the letter of this lady to consider this dreadful passion in the mind of a woman and the smart she seems to feel does not abate the inclination i had to recommend to husbands a more regular behaviour than to give the most exquisite of torments to those who love them nay whose torment would be abated if they did not love them  it is wonderful to observe how little is made of this inexpressible injury and how easily men get into a habit of being least agreeable where they are most obliged to be so but this subject deserves a distinct speculation and i shall observe for a day or two the behaviour of two or three happy pair i am acquainted with before i pretend to make a system of conjugal morality i design in the first place to go a few miles out of town and there i know where to meet one who practises all the parts of a fine gentleman in the duty of an husband when he was a batchelor much business made him particularly negligent in his habit but now there is no young lover living so exact in the care of his person one who asked why he was so long washing his mouth and so delicate in the choice and wearing of his linen was answered because there is a woman of merit obliged to receive me kindly and i think it incumbent upon me to make her inclination go along with her duty  if a man would give himself leave to think he would not be so unreasonable as to expect debauchery and innocence could live in commerce together or hope that flesh and blood is capable of so strict an allegiance as that a fine woman must go on to improve her self till she is as good and impassive as an angel only to preserve a fidelity to a brute and a satyr the lady who desires me for her sake to end one of my papers with the following letter i am

require speculations of wit and humour the others are those of a more solemn and sober turn who find no pleasure but in papers of morality and sound sense the former call every thing that is serious stupid the latter look upon every thing as impertinent that is ludicrous were i always grave one half of my readers would fall off from me were i always merry i should lose the other i make it therefore my endeavour to find out entertainments of both kinds and by that means perhaps consult the good of both more than i should do did i always write to the particular taste of either as they neither of them know what i proceed upon the sprightly reader who takes up my paper in order to be diverted very often finds himself engaged unawares in a serious and profitable course of thinking as on the contrary the thoughtful man who perhaps may hope to find something solid and full of deep reflection is very often insensibly betrayed into a fit of mirth in a word the reader sits down to my entertainment without knowing his bill of fare and has therefore at least the pleasure of hoping there may be a dish to his palate  i must confess were i left to my self i should rather aim at instructing than diverting but if we will be useful to the world we must take it as we find it authors of professed severity discourage the looser part of mankind from having any thing to do with their writings a man must have virtue in him before he will enter upon the reading of a seneca or an epictetus the very title of a moral treatise has something in it austere and shocking to the careless and inconsiderate  for this reason several unthinking persons fall in my way who would give no attention to lectures delivered with a religious seriousness or a philosophick gravity they are insnared into sentiments of wisdom and virtue when they do not think of it and if by that means they arrive only at such a degree of consideration as may dispose them to listen to more studied and elaborate discourses i shall not think my speculations useless i might likewise observe that the gloominess in which sometimes the minds of the best men are involved very often stands in need of such little incitements to mirth and laughter as are apt to disperse melancholy and put our faculties in good humour to which some will add that the british climate more than any other makes entertainments of this nature in a manner necessary  if what i have here said does not recommend it will at least excuse the variety of my speculations i would not willingly laugh but in order to instruct or if i sometimes fail in this point when my mirth ceases to be instructive it shall never cease to be innocent a scrupulous conduct in this particular has perhaps more merit in it than the generality of readers imagine did they know how many thoughts occur in a point of humour which a discreet author in modesty suppresses how many stroaks in raillery present themselves which could not fail to please the ordinary taste of mankind but are stifled in their birth by reason of some remote tendency which they carry in them to corrupt the minds of those who read them did they know how many glances of illnature are industriously avoided for fear of doing injury to the reputation of another they would be apt to think kindly of those writers who endeavour to make themselves diverting without being immoral one may apply to these authors that passage in waller  poets lose half the praise they would have got were it but known what they discreetly blot as nothing is more easy than to be a wit with all the abovementioned liberties it requires some genius and invention to appear such without them  what i have here said is not only in regard to the publick but with an eye to my particular correspondent who has sent me the following letter which i have castrated in some places upon these considerations sir  having lately seen your discourse upon a match of grinning i cannot forbear giving you an account of a whistling match which with many others i was entertained with about three years since at the bath the prize was a guinea to be conferred upon the ablest whistler that is on him who could whistle clearest and go through his tune without laughing to which at the same time he was provoked  by the antick postures of a merryandrew who was to stand upon the stage and play his tricks in the eye of the performer there were three competitors for the ring the first was a plowman of a very promising aspect his features were steady and his muscles composed in so inflexible a stupidity that upon his first appearance every one gave the guinea for lost the pickled herring however found the way to shake him for upon his whistling a country jigg this unlucky wag danced to it with such a variety of distortions and grimaces that the countryman could not forbear smiling upon him and by that means spoiled his whistle and lost the prize  the next that mounted the stage was an undercitizen of the bath a person remarkable among the inferior people of that place for his great wisdom and his broad band he contracted his mouth with much gravity and that he might dispose his mind to be more serious than ordinary began the tune of the children in the wood and went through part of it with good success when on a sudden the wit at his elbow who had appeared wonderfully grave and attentive for some time gave him a touch upon the left shoulder and stared him in the face with so bewitching a grin that the whistler relaxed his fibres into a kind of simper and at length burst out into an open laugh the third who entered the lists was a footman who in defiance of the merryandrew and all his arts whistled a scotch tune and an italian sonata with so settled a countenance that he bore away the prize to the great admiration of some hundreds of persons who as well as my self were present at this trial of skill now sir i humbly conceive whatever you have determined of the grinners the whistlers ought to be encouraged not only as their art is practised without distortion but as it improves country musick promotes gravity and teaches ordinary people to keep their countenances if they see any thing ridiculous in their betters besides that it seems an entertainment very particularly adapted to the bath as it is usual for a rider to whistle to his horse when he would make his waters pass  i am sir c  postscript  after having despatched these two important points of grinning and whistling i hope you will oblige the world with some reflections upon yawning as i have seen it practised on a twelfthnight among other christmas gambols at the house of a very worthy gentleman who always entertains his tenants at that time of the year they yawn for a cheshire cheese and begin about midnight when the whole company is disposed to be drowsie he that yawns widest and at the same time so naturally as to produce the most yawns among his spectators carries home

achivi  hor   the following letter  has so much weight and good sense that i cannot forbear inserting it tho it relates to an hardened sinner whom i have very little hopes of reforming viz lewis xiv of france mr spectator  amidst the variety of subjects of which you have treated i could wish it had fallen in your way to expose the vanity of conquests this thought would naturally lead one to the french king who has been generally esteemed the greatest conqueror of our age till her majestys armies had torn from him so many of his countries and deprived him of the fruit of all his former victories for my own part if i were to draw his picture i should be for taking him no lower than to the peace of reswick  just at the end of his triumphs and before his reverse of fortune and even then i should not forbear thinking his ambition had been vain and unprofitable to himself and his people  as for himself it is certain he can have gained nothing by his conquests if they have not rendered him master of more subjects more riches or greater power what i shall be able to offer upon these heads i resolve to submit to your consideration  to begin then with his increase of subjects from the time he came of age and has been a manager for himself all the people he had acquired were such only as he had reduced by his wars and were left in his possession by the peace he had conquered not above one third part of flanders and consequently no more than one third part of the inhabitants of that province  about  00 years ago the houses in that country were all numbered and by a just computation the inhabitants of all sorts could not then exceed   0 000 souls and if any man will consider the desolation by almost perpetual wars the numerous armies that have lived almost ever since at discretion upon the people and how much of their commerce has removed for more security to other places he will have little reason to imagine that their numbers have since increased and therefore with one third part of that province that prince can have gained no more than one third part of the inhabitants or   0 000 new subjects even tho it should be supposed they were all contented to live still in their native country and transfer their allegiance to a new master  the fertility of this province its convenient situation for trade and commerce its capacity for furnishing employment and subsistence to great numbers and the vast armies that have been maintained here make it credible that the remaining two thirds of flanders are equal to all his other conquests and consequently by all he cannot have gained more than   0 000 new subjects men women and children especially if a deduction shall be made of such as have retired from the conqueror to live under their old masters  it is time now to set his loss against his profit and to shew for the new subjects he had acquired how many old ones he had lost in the acquisition i think that in his wars he has seldom brought less into the field in all places than  00 000 fighting men besides what have been left in garrisons and i think the common computation is that of an army at the latter end of a campaign without sieges or battle scarce four fifths can be mustered of those that came into the field at the beginning of the year his wars at several times till the last peace have held about  0 years and if  0 000 yearly lost or a fifth part of his armies are to be multiplied by  0 he cannot have lost less than  00 000 of his old subjects all ablebodyd men a greater number than the new subjects he had acquired  but this loss is not all providence seems to have equally divided the whole mass of mankind into different sexes that every woman may have her husband and that both may equally contribute to the continuance of the species it follows then that for all the men that have been lost as many women must have lived single and it were but charity to believe they have not done all the service they were capable of doing in their generation in so long a course of years great part of them must have died and all the rest must go off at last without leaving any representatives behind by this account he must have lost not only  00000 subjects but double that number and all the increase that was reasonably to be expected from it  it is said in the last war there was a famine in his kingdom which swept away two millions of his people this is hardly credible if the loss was only of one fifth part of that sum it was very great but tis no wonder there should be famine where so much of the peoples substance is taken away for the kings use that they have not sufficient left to provide against accidents where so many of the men are taken from the plough to serve the king in his wars and a great part of the tillage is left to the weaker hands of so many women and children whatever was the loss it must undoubtedly be placed to the account of his ambition  and so must also the destruction or banishment of   or  00 000 of his reformed subjects he could have no other reasons for valuing those lives so very cheap but only to recommend himself to the bigotry of the spanish nation  how should there be industry in a country where all property is precarious what subject will sow his land that his prince may reap the whole harvest parsimony and frugality must be strangers to such a people for will any man save today what he has reason to fear will be taken from him tomorrow and where is the encouragement for marrying will any man think of raising children without any assurance of cloathing for their backs or so much as food for their bellies and thus by his fatal ambition he must have lessened the number of his subjects not only by slaughter and destruction but by preventing their very births he has done as much as was possible towards destroying posterity itself  is this then the great the invincible lewis this the immortal man the toutpuissant or the almighty as his flatterers have called him is this the man that is so celebrated for his conquests for every subject he has acquired has he not lost three that were his inheritance are not his troops fewer and those neither so well fed or cloathed or paid as they were formerly tho he has now so much greater cause to exert himself and what can be the reason of all this but that his revenue is a great deal less his subjects are either poorer or not so many to be plundered by constant taxes for his use  it is well for him he had found out a way to steal a kingdom if he had gone on conquering as he did before his ruin had been long since finished this brings to my mind a saying of king pyrrhus after he had a second time beat the romans in a pitched battle and was complimented by his generals yes says he such another victory and i am quite undone and since i have mentioned pyrrhus i will end with a very good though known story of this ambitious mad man when he had shewn the utmost fondness for his expedition against the romans cyneas his chief minister asked him what he proposed to himself by this war why says pyrrhus to conquer the romans and reduce all italy to my obedience what then says cyneas to pass over into sicily says pyrrhus and then all the sicilians must be our subjects and what does your majesty intend next why truly says the king to conquer carthage and make myself master of all africa and what sir says the minister is to be the end of all your expeditions why then says the king for the rest of our lives well sit down to good wine how sir replied cyneas to better than we have now before us have we not already as much as we can drink   riot and excess are not the becoming characters of princes but if pyrrhus and lewis had debauched like vitellius they had been less hurtful to

which happen in families i do not remember that you have touched upon the marriage of children without the consent of their parents i am one of these  unfortunate persons i was about fifteen when i took the liberty to choose for my self and have ever since languished under the displeasure of an inexorable father who though he sees me happy in the best of husbands and blessed with very fine children can never be prevailed upon to forgive me he was so kind to me before this unhappy accident that indeed it makes my breach of duty in some measure inexcusable and at the same time creates in me such a tenderness towards him that i love him above all things and would die to be reconciled to him i have thrown myself at his feet and besought him with tears to pardon me but he always pushes me away and spurns me from him i have written several letters to him but he will neither open nor receive them about two years ago i sent my little boy to him dressed in a new apparel but the child returned to me crying because he said his grandfather would not see him and had ordered him to be put out of his house my mother is won over to my side but dares not mention me to my father for fear of provoking him about a month ago he lay sick upon his bed and in great danger of his life i was pierced to the heart at the news and could not forbear going to inquire after his health my mother took this opportunity of speaking in my behalf she told him with abundance of tears that i was come to see him that i could not speak to her for weeping and that i should certainly break my heart if he refusd at that time to give me his blessing and be reconciled to me he was so far from relenting towards me that he bid her speak no more of me unless she had a mind to disturb him in his last moments for sir you must know that he has the reputation of an honest and religious man which makes my misfortune so much the greater god be thanked he is since recovered but his severe usage has given me such a blow that i shall soon sink under it unless i may be relieved by any impressions which the reading of this in your paper may make upon him  i am c  of all hardnesses of heart there is none so inexcusable as that of parents towards their children an obstinate inflexible unforgiving temper is odious upon all occasions but here it is unnatural the love tenderness and compassion which are apt to arise in us towards those who  depend upon us is that by which the whole world of life is upheld the supreme being by the transcendent excellency and goodness of his nature extends his mercy towards all his works and because his creatures have not such a spontaneous benevolence and compassion towards those who are under their care and protection he has implanted in them an instinct that supplies the place of this inherent goodness i have illustrated this kind of instinct in former papers and have shewn how it runs thro all the species of brute creatures as indeed the whole animal creation subsists by it  this instinct in man is more general and uncircumscribed than in brutes as being enlarged by the dictates of reason and duty for if we consider our selves attentively we shall find that we are not only inclined to love those who descend from us but that we bear a kind of  or natural affection to every thing which relies upon us for its good and preservation dependance is a perpetual call upon humanity and a greater incitement to tenderness and pity than any other motive whatsoever  the man therefore who notwithstanding any passion or resentment can overcome this powerful instinct and extinguish natural affection debases his mind even below brutality frustrates as much as in him lies the great design of providence and strikes out of his nature one of the most divine principles that is planted in it  among innumerable arguments which  might be brought against such an unreasonable proceeding i shall only insist on one we make it the condition of our forgiveness that we forgive others in our very prayers we desire no more than to be treated by this kind of retaliation the case therefore before us seems to be what they call a case in point the relation between the child and father being what comes nearest to that between a creature and its creator if the father is inexorable to the child who has offended let the offence be of never so high a nature how will he address himself to the supreme being under the tender appellation of a father and desire of him such a forgiveness as he himself refuses to grant  to this i might add many other religious as well as many prudential considerations but if the last mentioned motive does not prevail i despair of succeeding by any other and shall therefore conclude my paper with a very remarkable story which is recorded in an old chronicle published by freher among the writers of the german history   eginhart who was secretary to charles the great became exceeding popular by his behaviour in that post his great abilities gaind him the favour of his master and the esteem of the whole court imma the daughter of the emperor was so pleased with his person and conversation that she fell in love with him as she was one of the greatest beauties of the age eginhart answerd her with a more than equal return of passion they stifled their flames for some time under apprehension of the fatal consequences that might ensue eginhart at length resolving to hazard all rather than be deprived of one whom his heart was so much set upon conveyed himself one night into the princesss apartment and knocking gently at the door was admitted as a person who  had something to communicate to her from the emperor he was with her in private most part of the night but upon his preparing to go away about break of day he observed that there had fallen a great snow during his stay with the princess this very much perplexed him lest the prints of his feet in the snow might make discoveries to the king who often used to visit his daughter in the morning he acquainted the princess imma with his fears who after some consultations upon the matter prevailed upon him to let her carry him through the snow upon her own shoulders it happened that the emperor not being able to sleep was at that time up and walking in his chamber when upon looking through the window he perceived his daughter tottering under her burden and carrying his first minister across the snow which she had no sooner done but she returned again with the utmost speed to her own apartment the emperor was extreamly troubled and astonished at this accident but resolved to speak nothing of it till a proper opportunity in the mean time eginhart knowing that what he had done could not be long a secret determined to retire from court and in order to it begged the emperor that he would be pleased to dismiss him pretending a kind of discontent at his not having been rewarded for his long services the emperor would not give a direct answer to his petition but told him he would think of it and appointed  a certain day when he would let him know his pleasure he then called together the most faithful of his counsellors and acquainting them with his secretarys crime asked them their advice in so delicate an affair they most of them gave their opinion that the person could not be too severely punished who had thus dishonoured his master upon the whole debate the emperor declared it was his opinion that eginharts punishment would rather encrease than diminish the shame of his family and that therefore he thought it the most adviseable to wear out the memory of the fact by marrying him to his daughter accordingly eginhart was called in and acquainted by the emperor that he should no longer have any pretence of complaining his services were not rewarded for that the princess imma should be given him  in marriage with a dower suitable to her quality which was soon after performed

myself am a woman who have been one of the unhappy that have fallen into this misfortune and that by the insinuation of a very worthless fellow who served others in the same manner both before my ruin and since that time i had as soon as the rascal left me so much indignation and resolution as not to go upon the town as the phrase is but took to work for my living in an obscure place out of the knowledge of all with whom i was before acquainted  it is the ordinary practice and business of life with a set of idle fellows about this town to write letters send messages and form appointments with little raw unthinking girls and leave them after possession of them without any mercy to shame infamy poverty and disease were you to read the nauseous impertinences which are written on these occasions and to see the silly creatures sighing over them it could not but be matter of mirth as well as pity a little prentice girl of mine has been for some time applied to by an irish fellow who dresses very fine and struts in a laced coat and is the admiration of seamstresses who are under age in town ever since i have had some knowledge of the matter i have debarred my prentice from pen ink and paper but the other day he bespoke some cravats of me i went out of the shop and left his mistress to put them up into a bandbox in order to be sent to him when his man called when i came into the shop again i took occasion to send her away and found in the bottom of the box written these words why would you ruin a harmless creature that loves you then in the lid there is no resisting strephon i searched a little farther and found in the rim of the box at eleven of clock at night come in an hackneycoach at the end of our street this was enough to alarm me i sent away the things and took my measures accordingly an hour or two before the appointed time i examined my young lady and found her trunk stuffed with impertinent letters and an old scroll of parchment in latin which her lover had sent her as a settlement of fifty pounds a year among other things there was also the best lace i had in my shop to make him a present for cravats i was very glad of this last circumstance because i could very conscientiously swear against him that he had enticed my servant away and was her accomplice in robbing me i procured a warrant against him accordingly every thing was now prepared and the tender hour of love approaching i who had acted for myself in my youth the same senseless part knew how to manage accordingly therefore after having locked up my maid and not being so much unlike her in height and shape as in a huddled way not to pass for her i delivered the bundle designed to be carried off to her lovers man who came with the signal to receive them thus i followed after to the coach where when i saw his master take them in i cryed out thieves thieves and the constable with his attendants seized my expecting lover i kept my self unobserved till i saw the crowd sufficiently encreased and then appeared to declare the goods to be mine and had the satisfaction to see my man of mode put into the roundhouse with the stolen wares by him to be produced in evidence against him the next morning this matter is notoriously known to be fact and i have been contented to save my prentice and take a years rent of this mortified lover not to appear further in the matter this was some penance but sir is this enough for a villany of much more pernicious consequence than the trifles for which he was to have been indicted should not you and all men of any parts or honour put things upon so right a foot as that such a rascal should not laugh at the imputation of what he was really guilty and dread being accused of that for which he was arrested  in a word sir it is in the

valued not only in times of the greatest simplicity but among the most polite ages of mankind jothams fable of the trees  is the oldest that is extant and as beautiful as any which have been made since that time nathans fable of the poor man and his lamb  is likewise more ancient than any that is extant besides the abovementioned and had so good an effect as to convey instruction to the ear of a king without offending it and to bring the man after gods own heart to a right sense of his guilt and his duty we find æsop in the most distant ages of greece and if we look into the very beginnings of the commonwealth of rome we see a mutiny among the common people appeased by a fable of the belly and the limbs  which was indeed very proper to gain the attention of an incensed rabble at a time when perhaps they would have torn to pieces any man who had preached the same doctrine to them in an open and direct manner as fables took their birth in the very infancy of learning they never flourished more than when learning was at its greatest height to justify this assertion i shall put my reader in mind of horace the greatest wit and critick in the augustan age and of boileau the most correct poet among the moderns not to mention la fontaine who by this way of writing is come more into vogue than any other author of our times  the fables i have here mentioned are raised altogether upon brutes and vegetables with some of our own species mixt among them when the moral hath so required but besides this kind of fable there is another in which the actors are passions virtues vices and other imaginary persons of the like nature some of the ancient criticks will have it that the iliad and odyssey of homer are fables of this nature and that the several names of gods and heroes are nothing else but the affections of the mind in a visible shape and character thus they tell us that achilles in the first iliad represents anger or the irascible part of human nature that upon drawing his sword against his superior in a full assembly pallas is only another name for reason which checks and advises him upon that occasion and at her first appearance touches him upon the head that part of the man being looked upon as the seat of reason and thus of the rest of the poem as for the odyssey i think it is plain that horace considered it as one of these allegorical fables by the moral which he has given us of several parts of it the greatest italian wits have applied themselves to the writing of this latter kind of fables as spencers fairyqueen is one continued series of them from the beginning to the end of that admirable work if we look into the finest prose authors of antiquity such as cicero plato xenophon and many others we shall find that this was likewise their favourite kind of fable i shall only further observe upon it that the first of this sort that made any considerable figure in the world was that of hercules meeting with pleasure and virtue which was invented by prodicus who lived before socrates and in the first dawnings of philosophy he used to travel through greece by vertue of this fable which procured him a kind reception in all the markettowns where he never failed telling it as soon as he had gathered an audience about him   after this short preface which i have made up of such materials as my memory does at present suggest to me before i present my reader with a fable of this kind which i design as the entertainment of the present paper i must in a few words open the occasion of it  in the account which plato gives us of the conversation and behaviour of socrates the morning he was to die he tells the following circumstance  when socrates his fetters were knocked off as was usual to be done on the day that the condemned person was to be executed being seated in the midst of his disciples and laying one of his legs over the other in a very unconcerned posture he began to rub it where it had been galled by the iron and whether it was to shew the indifference with which he entertained the thoughts of his approaching death or after his usual manner to take every occasion of philosophizing upon some useful subject he observed the pleasure of that sensation which now arose in those very parts of his leg that just before had been so much pained by the fetter upon this he reflected on the nature of pleasure and pain in general and how constantly they succeeded one another to this he added that if a man of a good genius for a fable were to represent the nature of pleasure and pain in that way of writing he would probably join them together after such a manner that it would be impossible for the one to come into any place without being followed by the other   it is possible that if plato had thought it proper at such a time to describe socrates launching out into a discourse which  was not of a piece with the business of the day he would have enlarged upon this hint and have drawn it out into some beautiful allegory or fable but since he has not done it i shall attempt to write one myself in the spirit of that divine author     there were two families which from the beginning of the world were as opposite to each other as light and darkness the one of them lived in heaven and the other in hell the youngest descendant of the first family was pleasure who was the daughter of happiness who was the child of virtue who was the offspring of the gods these as i said before had their habitation in heaven the youngest of the opposite family was pain who was the son of misery who was the child of vice who was the offspring of the furies the habitation of this race of beings was in hell  the middle station of nature between these two opposite extremes was the earth which was inhabited by creatures of a middle kind neither so virtuous as the one nor so vicious as the other but partaking of the good and bad qualities of these two opposite families jupiter considering that this species commonly called man was too virtuous to be miserable and too vicious to be happy that he might make a distinction between the good and the bad ordered the two youngest of the abovementioned families pleasure who was the daughter of happiness and pain who was the son of misery to meet one another upon this part of nature which lay in the halfway between them having promised to settle it upon them both provided they could agree upon the division of it so as to share mankind between them pleasure and pain were no sooner met in their new habitation but they immediately agreed upon this point that pleasure should take possession of the virtuous and pain of the vicious part of that species which was given up to them but upon examining to which of them any individual they met with belonged they found each of them had a right to him for that contrary to what they had seen in their old places of residence there was no person so vicious who had not some good in him nor any person so virtuous who had not in him some evil the truth of it is they generally found upon search that in the most vicious man pleasure might lay a claim to an hundredth part and that in the most virtuous man pain might come in for at least two thirds this they saw would occasion endless disputes between them unless they could come to some accommodation to this end there was a marriage proposed between them and at length concluded by this means it is that we find pleasure and pain are such constant yokefellows and that they either make their visits together or are never far asunder if pain comes into an heart he is quickly followed by pleasure and if pleasure enters you may be sure pain is not far off  but notwithstanding this marriage was very convenient for the two parties it did not seem to answer the intention of jupiter in sending them among mankind to remedy therefore this inconvenience it was stipulated between them by article and confirmed by the consent of each family that notwithstanding they here possessed the species indifferently upon the death of every single person if he was found to have in him a certain proportion of evil he should be dispatched into the infernal regions by a passport from pain there to dwell with misery vice and the furies or on the contrary if he had in him a certain proportion of good he should be dispatched into heaven by a passport from pleasure there

which i never thought of at my first starting it this has been the fate of my paper on the match of grinning which has already produced a second paper on parallel subjects and brought me the following letter by the last post i shall not premise any thing to it further than that it is built on matter of fact and is as follows sir  you have already obliged the world with a discourse upon grinning and have since proceeded to whistling from whence you at length came  to yawning from this i think you may make a very natural transition to sleeping i therefore recommend to you for the subject of a paper the following advertisement which about two months ago was given into every bodys hands and may be seen with some additions in the daily courant of august the ninth nicholas hart  who slept last year in st bartholomews hospital intends to sleep this year at the cock and bottle in littlebritain having since inquired into the matter of fact i find that the abovementioned nicholas hart is every year seized with a periodical fit of sleeping which begins upon the fifth of august and ends on the eleventh of the same month that  • on the first of that month he grew dull  • on the second appeared drowsy  • on the third fell a yawning  • on the fourth began to nod  • on the fifth dropped asleep  • on the sixth was heard to snore  • on the seventh turned himself in his bed  • on the eighth recovered his former posture  • on the ninth fell a stretching  • on the tenth about midnight awaked  • on the eleventh in the morning called for a little smallbeer this account i have extracted out of the journal of this sleeping worthy as it has been faithfully kept by a gentleman of lincolnsinn who has undertaken to be his historiographer i have sent it to you not only as it represents the actions of nicholas hart but as it seems a very natural picture of the life of many an honest english gentleman whose whole history very often consists of yawning nodding stretching turning sleeping drinking and the like extraordinary particulars i do not question sir that if you pleased you could put out an advertisement not unlike the  abovementioned of several men of figure that mr john suchaone gentleman or thomas suchaone esquire who slept in the country last summer intends to sleep in town this winter the worst of it is that the drowsy part of our species is chiefly made up of very honest gentlemen who live quietly among their neighbours without ever disturbing the publick peace they are drones without stings i could heartily wish that several turbulent restless ambitious spirits would for a while change places with these good men and enter themselves into nicholas harts fraternity could one but lay asleep a few busy heads which i could name from the first of november next to the first of may ensuing  i question not but it would very much redound to the quiet of particular persons as well as to the benefit of the publick  but to return to nicholas hart i believe sir you will think it a very extraordinary circumstance for a man to gain his livelihood by sleeping and that rest should procure a man sustenance as well as industry yet so it is that nicholas got last year enough to support himself for a twelvemonth i am likewise informed that he has this year had a very comfortable nap the poets value themselves very much for sleeping on parnassus but i never heard they got a groat by it on the contrary our friend nicholas gets more by sleeping than he could by working and may be more properly said than ever homer was to have had golden dreams fuvenal indeed mentions a drowsy husband who raised an estate by snoring but then he is represented to have slept what the common people call a dogs sleep or if his sleep was real his wife was awake and about her business your pen which  loves to moralize upon all subjects may raise something methinks on this circumstance also and point out to us those sets of men who instead of growing rich by an honest industry recommend themselves to the favours of the great by making themselves agreeable companions in the participations of luxury and pleasure  i must further acquaint you sir that one of the most eminent pens in grubstreet is now employed in writing the dream of this miraculous sleeper which i hear will be of a more than ordinary length as it must contain all the particulars that are supposed to have passed in his imagination during so long a sleep he is said to have gone already through three days and three nights of it and to have comprised in them the most remarkable passages of the four first empires of the world if he can keep free from partystrokes his work may be of use but this i much doubt having been informed by one of his friends and confidents that he has spoken some

themselves than in what the world calls zeal there are so many passions which hide themselves under it and so many mischiefs arising from it that some have gone so far as to say it would have been for the benefit of mankind if it had never been reckoned in the catalogue of virtues it is certain where it is once laudable and prudential it is an hundred times criminal and erroneous nor can it be otherwise if we consider that it operates with equal violence in all religions however opposite they may be to one another and in all the subdivisions of each religion in particular  we are told by some of the jewish rabbins that the first murder was occasioned by a religious controversy and if we had the whole history of zeal from the days of cain to our own times we should see it filled with so many scenes of slaughter and bloodshed as would make a wise man very careful how he suffers himself to be actuated by such a principle when it only regards matters of opinion and speculation  i would have every zealous man examine his heart thoroughly and i believe he will often find that what he calls a zeal for his religion is either pride interest or illnature a man who  differs from another in opinion sets himself above him in his own judgment and in several particulars pretends to be the wiser person this is a great provocation to the proud man and gives a very keen edge to what he calls his zeal and that this is the case very often we may observe from the behaviour of some of the most zealous for orthodoxy who have often great friendships and intimacies with vicious immoral men provided they do but agree with them in the same scheme of belief the reason is because the vicious believer gives the precedency to the virtuous man and allows the good christian to be the worthier person at the same time that he cannot come up to his perfections this we find exemplified in that trite passage which we see quoted in almost every system of ethicks tho upon another occasion  video meliora proboque deteriora sequor   ov   on the contrary it is certain if our zeal were true and genuine we should be much more angry with a sinner than a heretick since there are several cases which  may excuse the latter before his great judge but none which  can excuse the former  interest is likewise a great inflamer and sets a man on persecution under the colour of zeal for this reason we find none are so forward to promote the true worship by fire and sword as those who find their present account in it but i shall extend the word interest to a larger meaning than what is generally given it as it relates to our spiritual safety and welfare as well as to our temporal a man is glad to gain numbers on his side as they serve to strengthen him in his private opinions every proselyte is like a new argument for the establishment of his faith it makes him believe that his principles carry conviction with them and are the more likely to be true when he finds they are conformable to the reason of others as well as to his own and that this temper of mind deludes a man very often into an opinion of his zeal may appear from the common behaviour of the atheist who maintains and spreads his opinions with as much heat as those who believe they do it only out of passion for gods glory  illnature is another dreadful imitator of zeal many a good man may have a natural rancour and malice in his heart which  has been in some measure quelled and subdued by religion but if it finds any pretence of breaking out which does not seem to him inconsistent with the duties of a christian it throws off all restraint and rages in its full fury zeal is therefore a great ease to a malicious man by making him believe he does god service whilst he is gratifying the bent of a perverse revengeful temper for this reason we find that most of the massacres and devastations which  have been in the world have taken their rise from a furious pretended zeal  i love to see a man zealous in a good matter and especially when his zeal shews it self for advancing morality and promoting the happiness of mankind but when i find the instruments he works with are racks and gibbets gallies and dungeons when he imprisons mens persons confiscates their estates ruins their families and burns the body to save the soul i cannot stick to pronounce of such a one that whatever he may think of his faith and religion his faith is vain and his religion unprofitable  after having treated of these false zealots in religion i cannot forbear mentioning a monstrous species of men who one would not think had any existence in nature were they not to be met with in ordinary conversation i mean the zealots in atheism one would fancy that these men tho they fall short in every other respect of those who make a profession of religion would at least outshine them in this particular and be exempt from that single fault which seems to grow out of the imprudent fervours of religion but so it is that infidelity is propagated with as much fierceness and contention wrath and indignation as if the safety of mankind depended upon it there is something so ridiculous and perverse in this kind of zealots that one does not know how to set them out in their proper colours they are a sort of gamesters who  are eternally upon the fret though they play for nothing they are perpetually teizing their friends to come over to them though at the same time they allow that neither of them shall get any thing by the bargain in short the zeal of spreading atheism is if possible more absurd than atheism it self  since i have mentioned this unaccountable zeal which appears in atheists and infidels i must further observe that they are likewise in a most particular manner possessed with the spirit of bigotry they are wedded to opinions full of contradiction and impossibility and at the same time look upon the smallest difficulty in an article of faith as a sufficient reason for rejecting it notions that fall in with the common reason of mankind that are conformable to the sense of all ages and all nations not to mention their tendency for promoting the happiness of societies or of particular persons are exploded as errors and prejudices and schemes erected in their stead that are altogether monstrous and irrational and require the most extravagant credulity to embrace them i would fain ask one of these bigotted infidels supposing all the great points of atheism as the casual or eternal formation of the world the materiality of a thinking substance the mortality of the soul the fortuitous organization of the body the motions and gravitation of matter with the like particulars were laid together and formed into  a kind of creed according to the opinions of the most celebrated atheists i say supposing such a creed as this were formed and imposed upon any one people in the world whether it would not require an infinitely greater measure of faith than any set of articles which they so violently oppose let me therefore advise this generation of wranglers for their own and for the publick good to act at least so consistently with themselves as not to burn with zeal for irreligion and with bigotry for nonsense  c      footnote     the man that return to footnote mark   footnote     that return   footnote     that return

hor   upon my return to my lodgings last night i found a letter from my worthy friend the clergyman whom i have given some account of in my former papers he tells me in it that he was particularly pleased with the latter part of my yesterdays speculation and at the same time enclosed the following essay which he desires me to publish as the sequel of that discourse it consists partly of uncommon reflections and partly of such as have been already used but now set in a stronger light a believer may be excused by the most hardened atheist for endeavouring to make him a convert because he does it with an eye to both their interests the atheist is inexcusable who tries to gain over a believer because he does not propose the doing himself or the believer any good by such a conversion  the prospect of a future state is the secret comfort and refreshment of my soul it is that which makes nature look gay about me it doubles all my pleasures and supports me under all my afflictions i can look at disappointments and misfortunes pain and sickness death itself and what is worse than death the loss of those who are dearest to me with indifference so long as i keep in view the pleasures of eternity and the state of being in which there will be no fears nor apprehensions pains nor sorrows sickness nor separation why will any man be so impertinently officious as to tell me all this is only fancy and delusion is there any merit in being the messenger of ill news if it is a dream let me enjoy it since it makes me both the happier and better man  i must confess i do not know how to trust a man who  believes neither heaven nor hell or in other words a future state of rewards and punishments not only natural selflove but reason directs us to promote our own interest above all things it can never be for the interest of a believer to do me a mischief because he is sure upon the balance of accompts to find himself a loser by it on the contrary if he considers his own welfare in his behaviour towards me it will lead him to do me all the good he can and at the same time restrain him from doing me any injury an unbeliever does not act like a reasonable creature if he favours me contrary to his present interest or does not distress me when it turns to his present advantage honour and goodnature may indeed tie up his hands but as these would be very much strengthened by reason and principle so without them they are only instincts or wavering unsettled notions which  rest on no foundation  infidelity has been attackd with so good success of late years that it is driven out of all its outworks the atheist has not found his post tenable and is therefore retired into deism and a disbelief of revealed religion only but the truth of it is the greatest number of this set of men are those who for want of a virtuous education or examining the grounds of religion know so very little of the matter in question that their infidelity is but another term for their ignorance  as folly and inconsiderateness are the foundations of infidelity the great pillars and supports of it are either a vanity of appearing wiser than the rest of mankind or an ostentation of courage in despising the terrors of another world which have so great an influence on what they call weaker minds or an aversion to a belief that must cut them off from many of those pleasures they propose to themselves and fill them with remorse for many of those they have already tasted  the great received articles of the christian religion have been so clearly proved from the authority of that divine revelation in which they are delivered that it is impossible for those who have ears to hear and eyes to see not to be convinced of them but were it possible for any thing in the christian faith to be erroneous i can find no ill consequences in adhering to it the great points of the incarnation and sufferings of our saviour produce naturally such habits of virtue in the mind of man that i say supposing it were possible for us to be mistaken in them the infidel himself must at least allow that no other system of religion could so effectually contribute to the heightning of morality they give us great ideas of the dignity of human nature and of the love which the supreme being bears to his creatures and consequently engage us in the highest acts of duty towards our creator our neighbour and our selves how many noble arguments has saint paul raised from the chief articles of our religion for the advancing of morality in its three great branches to give a single example in each kind what can be a stronger motive to a firm trust and reliance on the mercies of our maker than the giving us his son to suffer for us what can make us love and esteem even the most inconsiderable of mankind more than the thought that christ died for him or what dispose us to set a stricter guard upon the purity of our own hearts than our being members of christ and a part of the society of which that immaculate person is the head but these are only a specimen of those admirable enforcements of morality which the apostle has drawn from the history of our blessed saviour  if our modern infidels considered these matters with that candour and seriousness which they deserve we should not see them act with such a spirit of bitterness arrogance and malice they would not be raising such insignificant cavils doubts and scruples as may be started against every thing that is not capable of mathematical demonstration in order to unsettle the minds of the ignorant disturb the publick peace subvert morality and throw all things into confusion and disorder if none of these reflections can have any influence on them there is one that perhaps may because it is adapted to their vanity by which they seem to be guided much more than their reason i would therefore have them consider that the wisest and best of men in all ages of the world have been those who lived up to the religion of their country when they saw nothing in it opposite to morality and to the best lights they had of the divine nature pythagorass first rule directs us to worship the gods as it is ordained by law for that is the most natural interpretation of the precept  socrates who was the most renowned among the heathens both for wisdom and virtue in his last moments desires his friends to offer a cock to æsculapius  doubtless out of a submissive deference to the established worship of his country xenophon tells us that his prince whom he sets forth as a pattern of perfection when he found his death approaching offered sacrifices on the mountains to the persian jupiter and the sun according to the custom of the persians for those are the words of the historian  nay the epicureans and atomical philosophers shewed a very remarkable modesty in this particular for though the being of a god was entirely repugnant to their schemes of natural philosophy they contented themselves with the denial of a providence asserting at the same time the existence of gods in general because they would not shock the common belief of mankind and the religion of their

persons he speaks of that i shall insert his letter at length mr spectator i do not know that you have ever touched upon a certain species of women whom we ordinarily call jilts you cannot possibly go upon a more useful work than the consideration of these dangerous animals the coquet is indeed one degree towards the jilt but the heart of the former is bent upon admiring her self and giving false hopes to her lovers but the latter is not contented to be extreamly amiable but she must add to that advantage a certain delight in being a torment to others thus when her lover is in the full expectation of success the jilt shall meet him with a sudden indifference and admiration in her face at his being surprised that he is received like a stranger and a cast of her head another way with a pleasant scorn of the fellows insolence it is very probable the lover goes home utterly astonished and dejected sits down to his scrutore sends her word in the most abject terms that he knows not what he has done that all which was desirable in this life is so suddenly vanished from him that the charmer of his soul should withdraw the vital heat from the heart which pants for her he continues a mournful absence for some time pining in secret and out of humour with all things which he meets with at length he takes a resolution to try his fate and explain with her resolutely upon her unaccountable carriage he walks up to her apartment with a thousand inquietudes and doubts in what manner he shall meet the first cast of her eye when upon his first appearance she flies towards him wonders where he has been accuses him of his absence and treats him with a familiarity as surprising as her former coldness this good correspondence continues till the lady observes the lover grows happy in it and then she interrupts it with some new inconsistency of behaviour for as i just now said the happiness of a jilt consists only in the power of making others uneasy but such is the folly of this sect of women that they carry on this pretty skittish behaviour till they have no charms left to render it supportable corinna that used to torment all who conversed with her with false glances and little heedless unguarded motions that were to betray some inclination towards the man she would ensnare finds at present all she attempts that way unregarded and is obliged to indulge the jilt in her constitution by laying artificial plots writing perplexing letters from unknown hands and making all the young fellows in love with her till they find out who she is thus as before she gave torment by disguising her inclination she is now obliged to do it by hiding her person  as for my own part mr spectator it has been my unhappy fate to be jilted from my youth upward and as my taste has been very much towards intreague and having intelligence with women of wit my whole life has passed away in a series of impositions i shall for the benefit of the present race of young men give some account of my loves i know not whether you have ever heard of the famous girl about town called kitty this creature for i must take shame upon my self was my mistress in the days when keeping was in fashion kitty under the appearance of being wild thoughtless and irregular in all her words and actions concealed the most accomplished jilt of her time her negligence had to me a charm in it like that of chastity and want of desires seemed as great a merit as the conquest of them the air she gave herself was that of a romping girl and whenever i talked to her with any turn of fondness she would immediately snatch off my perriwig try it upon herself in the glass clap her arms a kimbow draw my sword and make passes on the wall take off my cravat and seize it to make some other use of the lace or run into some other unaccountable rompishness till the time i had appointed to pass away with her was over i went from her full of pleasure at the reflection that i had the keeping of so much beauty in a woman who as she was too heedless to please me was also too inattentive to form a design to wrong me long did i divert every hour that hung heavy upon me in the company of this creature whom i looked upon as neither guilty or innocent but could laugh at my self for my unaccountable pleasure in an expence upon her till in the end it appeared my pretty insensible was with child by my footman  this accident roused me into a disdain against all libertine women under what appearance soever they hid their insincerity and i resolved after that time to converse with none but those who lived within the rules of decency and honour to this end i formed my self into a more regular turn of behaviour and began to make visits frequent assemblies and lead out ladies from the theatres with all the other insignificant duties which the professed servants of the fair place themselves in constant readiness to perform in a very little time having a plentiful fortune fathers and mothers began to regard me as a good match and i found easie admittance into the best families in town to observe their daughters but i who was born to follow the fair to no purpose have by the

net hyaena throws is so fine that you are taken in it before you can observe any part of her work i attempted her for a long and weary season but i found her passion went no farther than to be admired and she is of that unreasonable temper as not to value the inconstancy of her lovers provided she can boast she once had their addresses biblis was the second i aimed at and her vanity lay in purchasing the adorers of others and not in rejoicing in their love it self biblis is no mans mistress but every womans rival as soon as i found this i fell in love with chloe who is my present pleasure and torment i have writ to her danced with her and fought for her and have been her man in the sight and expectation of the whole town these  three years and thought my self near the end of my wishes when the other day she called me into her closet and told me with a very grave face that she was a woman of honour and scorned to deceive a man who loved her with so much sincerity as she saw i did and therefore she must inform me that she was by nature the most inconstant creature breathing and beggd of me not to marry her if i insisted upon it i should but that she was lately fallen

good conscience should be the measure of our ambition in this kind that is to say a man of spirit should contemn the praise of the ignorant and like being applauded for nothing but what he knows in his own heart he deserves besides which the character of the person who commends you is to be considered before you set a value upon his esteem the praise of an ignorant man is only goodwill and you should receive his kindness as he is a good neighbour in society and not as a good judge of your actions in point of fame and reputation the satyrist said very well of popular praise and acclamations give the tinkers and coblers their presents again and learn to live of your self  it is an argument of a loose and ungoverned mind to be affected with the promiscuous approbation of the generality of mankind and a man of virtue should be too delicate for so coarse an appetite of fame men of honour should endeavour only to please the worthy and the man of merit should desire to be tried only by his peers i thought it a noble sentiment which i heard yesterday uttered in conversation i know said a gentleman a way to be greater than any man if he has worth in him i can rejoice in his superiority to me and that satisfaction is a greater act of the soul in me than any in him which can possibly appear to me this thought could not proceed but from a candid and generous spirit and the approbation of such minds is what may be esteemed true praise for with the common rate of men there is nothing commendable but what they themselves may hope to be partakers of or arrive at but the motive truly glorious is when the mind is set rather to do things laudable than to purchase reputation where there is that sincerity as the foundation of a good name the kind opinion of virtuous men will be an unsought but a necessary consequence the lacedemonians tho a plain people and no pretenders to politeness had a certain delicacy in their sense of glory and sacrificed to the muses when they entered upon any great enterprise  they would have the commemoration of their actions be transmitted by the purest and most untainted memorialists the din which attends victories and publick triumphs is by far less eligible than the recital of the actions of great men by honest and wise historians it is a frivolous pleasure to be the admiration of gaping crowds but to have the approbation of a good man in the cool reflections of his closet is a gratification worthy an heroick spirit the applause of the crowd makes the head giddy but the attestation of a reasonable man makes the heart glad  what makes the love of popular or general praise still more ridiculous is that it is usually given for circumstances which are foreign to the persons admired thus they are the ordinary attendants on power and riches which may be taken out of one mans hands and put into anothers the application only and not the possession makes those outward things honourable the vulgar and men of sense agree in admiring men for having what they themselves would rather be possessed of the wise man applauds him whom he thinks most virtuous the rest of the world him who is most wealthy  when a man is in this way of thinking i do not know what can occur to one more monstrous than to see persons of ingenuity address their services and performances to men no way addicted to liberal arts in these cases the praise on one hand and the patronage on the other are equally the objects of ridicule dedications to ignorant men are as absurd as any of the speeches of bulfinch in the droll such an address one is apt to translate into other words and when the different parties are thoroughly considered the panegyrick generally implies no more than if the author should say to the patron my very good lord you and i can never understand one another therefore i humbly desire we may be intimate friends for the future  the rich may as well ask to borrow of the poor as the man of virtue or merit hope for addition to his character from any but such as himself he that commends another engages so much of his own reputation as he gives to that person commended and he that has nothing laudable in himself is not of ability to be such a surety the wise phocion was so sensible how dangerous it was to be touched with what the multitude approved that upon a general acclamation made when he was making an oration he turned to an intelligent friend who stood near him and asked in a surprized manner what slip have i made   i shall conclude this paper with a billet which has fallen into my hands and was written to a lady from a gentleman whom she had highly commended the author of it had formerly been her lover when all possibility of commerce between them on the subject of love was cut off she spoke

buckley  mr spectator having of late descanted upon the cruelty of parents to their children i have been induced at the request of several of mr spectators admirers to inclose this letter which i assure you is the original from a father to his own son notwithstanding the latter gave but little or no provocation it would be wonderfully obliging to the world if mr spectator would give his opinion of it in some of his speculations and particularly to  mr buckley  your humble servant     sirrah  you are a sawcy audacious rascal and both fool and mad and i care not a farthing whether you comply or no that does not raze out my impressions of your insolence going about railing at me and the next day to sollicit my favour these are inconsistencies such as discover thy reason depraved to be brief i never desire to see your face and sirrah if you go to the workhouse it is no disgrace to me for you to be supported there and if you starve in the streets ill never give any thing underhand in your behalf if i have any more of your scribling nonsense ill break your head the first time i set sight on you you are a stubborn beast is this your gratitude for my giving you mony you rogue ill

outside of your letter i shall give you a great knock on the skull for it  was there ever such an image of paternal tenderness it was usual among some of the greeks to make their slaves drink to excess and then expose them to their children who by that means conceived an early aversion to a vice which makes men appear so monstrous and irrational i have exposed this picture of an unnatural father with the same intention that its deformity may deter others from its resemblance if the reader has a mind to see a father of the same stamp represented in the most exquisite stroaks of humour he may meet with it in one of the finest comedies that ever appeared upon the english stage i mean the part of sir sampson  in love for love  i must not however engage my self blindly on the side of the son to whom the fond letter abovewritten was directed his father calls him a sawcy and audacious rascal in the first line and i am afraid upon examination he will prove but an ungracious youth to go about railing at his father and to find no other place but the outside of his letter to tell him that might overcomes right if it does not discover his reason to be depraved and that he is either fool or mad as the cholerick old gentleman tells him we may at least allow that the father will do very well in endeavouring to better his judgment and give him a greater sense of his duty but whether this may be brought about by breaking his head or giving him a great knock on the skull ought i think to be well considered upon the whole i wish the father has not met with his match and that he may not be as equally paired with a son as the mother in virgil  crudelis tu quoque mater crudelis mater magis an puer improbus ille improbus ille puer crudelis tu quoque mater  or like the crow and her egg in the greek proverb  i must here take notice of a letter which i have received from an unknown correspondent upon the subject of my paper upon which the foregoing letter is likewise founded the writer of it seems very much concerned lest that paper should seem to give encouragement to the disobedience of children towards their parents but if the writer of it will take the pains to read it over again attentively i dare say his apprehensions will vanish pardon and reconciliation are all the penitent daughter requests and all that i contend for in her behalf and in this case i may use the saying of an eminent wit who upon some great men pressing him to forgive his daughter who had married against his consent told them he could refuse nothing to their instances but that he would have them remember there was difference between giving and forgiving  i must confess in all controversies between parents and their children i am naturally prejudiced in favour of the former the obligations on that side can never be acquitted and i think it is one of the greatest reflections upon human nature that parental instinct should be a stronger motive to love than filial gratitude that the receiving of favours should be a less inducement to goodwill tenderness and commiseration than the conferring of them and that the taking care of any person should endear the child or dependant more to the parent or benefactor than the parent or benefactor to the child or dependant yet so it happens that for one cruel parent we meet with a thousand undutiful children this is indeed wonderfully contrived as i have formerly observed for the support of every living species but at the same time that it shews the wisdom of the creator it discovers the imperfection and degeneracy of the creature  the obedience of children to their parents is the basis of all government and set forth as the measure of that obedience which we owe to those whom providence hath placed over us  it is father le conte  if i am not mistaken who tells us how want of duty in this particular is punished among the chinese insomuch that if a son should be known to kill or so much as to strike his father not only the criminal but his whole family would be rooted out nay the inhabitants of the place where he lived would be put to the sword nay the place itself would be razed to the ground and its foundations sown with salt for say they there must have been an utter depravation of manners in that clan or society of people who could have bred up among them so horrible an offender to this i shall add a passage out of the first book of herodotus that historian in his account of the persian customs and religion tells us it is their opinion that no man ever killed his father or that it is possible such a crime should be in nature but that if any thing like it should ever happen they conclude that the reputed son must have been illegitimate supposititious or begotten in adultery their opinion in this particular shews sufficiently what a notion they must have had of undutifulness in general  l      footnote     sir sampson legend in congreves play which ends with the heroines

religion that in countries where popery prevails besides the advantage of licensed stews there are large endowments given for the incurabili i think he called them such as are past all remedy and are allowed such maintenance and support as to keep them without further care till they expire this manner of treating poor sinners has methinks great humanity in it and as you are a person who pretend to carry your reflections upon all subjects whatever occur to you with candour and act above the sense of what misinterpretation you may meet with i beg the favour of you to lay before all the world the unhappy condition of us poor vagrants who are really in a way of labour instead of idleness there are crowds of us whose manner of livelihood has long ceased to be pleasing to us and who would willingly lead a new life if the rigour of the virtuous did not for ever expel us from coming into the world again as it now happens to the eternal infamy of the male sex falshood among you is not reproachful but credulity in women is infamous  give me leave sir to give you my history you are to know that i am a daughter of a man of a good reputation tenant to a man of quality the heir of this great house took it in his head to cast a favourable eye upon me and succeeded i do not pretend to say he promised me marriage i was not a creature silly enough to be taken by so foolish a story but he ran away with me up to this town and introduced me to a grave matron with whom i boarded for a day or two with great gravity and was not a little pleased with the change of my condition from that of a country life to the finest company as i believed in the whole world my humble servant made me to understand that i should be always kept in the plentiful condition i then enjoyed when after a very great fondness towards me he one day took his leave of me for four or five days in the evening of the same day my good landlady came to me and observing me very pensive began to comfort me and with a smile told me i must see the world when i was deaf to all she could say to divert me she began to tell me with a very frank air that i must be treated as i ought and not take these squeamish humours upon me for my friend had left me to the town and as their phrase is she expected i would see company or i must be treated like what i had brought my self to this put me into a fit of crying and i immediately in a true sense of my condition threw myself on the floor deploring my fate calling upon all that was good and sacred to succour me while i was in all my agony i observed a decrepid old fellow come into the room and looking with a sense of pleasure in his face at all my vehemence and transport in a pause of my distress i heard him say to the shameless old woman who stood by me she is certainly a new face or else she acts it rarely with that the gentlewoman who was making her market of me in all the turn of my person the heaves of my passion and the suitable changes of my posture took occasion to commend my neck my shape my eyes my limbs all this was accompanied with such speeches as you may have heard horsecoursers make in the sale of nags when they are warranted for their soundness you understand by this time that i was left in a brothel and exposed to the next bidder that could purchase me of my patroness this is so much the work of hell the pleasure in the possession of us wenches abates in proportion to the degrees we go beyond the bounds of innocence and no man is gratified if there is nothing left for him to debauch well sir my first man when i came upon the town was sir jeoffry foible who was extremely lavish to me of his money and took such a fancy to me that he would have carried me off if my patroness would have taken any reasonable terms for me but as he was old his covetousness was his strongest passion and poor i was soon left exposed to be the common refuse of all the rakes and debauchees in town i cannot tell whether you will do me justice or no till i see whether you print this or not otherwise as i now live with sal i could give you a very just account of who and who is together in this town you perhaps wont believe it but i

affected his senses equally on each side and tempted him in the very same degree whether it would be possible for him to eat of either they generally determine this question to the disadvantage of the ass who they say would starve in the midst of plenty as not having a single grain of freewill to determine him more to the one than to the other the bundle of hay on either side striking his sight and smell in the same proportion would keep him in a perpetual suspence like the two magnets which travellers have told us are placed one of them in the roof and the other in the floor of mahomets buryingplace at mecca and by that means say they pull the impostors iron coffin with such an equal attraction that it hangs in the air between both of them as for the asss behaviour in such nice circumstances whether he would starve sooner than violate his neutrality to the two bundles of hay i shall not presume to determine but only take notice of the conduct of our own species in the same perplexity when a man has a mind to venture his money in a lottery every figure of it appears equally alluring and as likely to succeed as any of its fellows they all of them have the same pretensions to good luck stand upon the same foot of competition and no manner of reason can be given why a man should prefer one to the other before the lottery is drawn in this case therefore caprice very often acts in the place of reason and forms to it self some groundless imaginary motive where real and substantial ones are wanting i know a wellmeaning man that is very well pleased to risque his good fortune upon the number      because it is the year of our lord i am acquainted with a tacker that would give a good deal for the number      on the contrary i have been told of a certain zealous dissenter who being a great enemy to popery and believing that bad men are the most fortunate in this world will lay two to one on the number      against any other number because says he it is the number of the beast several would prefer the number    000 before any other as it is the number of the pounds in the great prize in short some are pleased to find their own age in their number some that they have got a number which makes a pretty appearance in the cyphers and others because it is the same number that succeeded in the last lottery each of these upon no other grounds thinks he stands fairest for the great lot and that he is possessed of what may not be improperly called the golden number  these principles of election are the pastimes and extravagancies of human reason which is of so busie a nature that it will be exerting it self in the meanest trifles and working even when it wants materials the wisest of men are sometimes acted by such unaccountable motives as the life of the fool and the superstitious is guided by nothing else  i am surprized that none of the fortunetellers or as the french call them the diseurs de bonne avanture who publish their bills in every quarter of the town have not turned our lotteries to their advantage did any of them set up for a caster of fortunate figures what might he not get by his pretended discoveries and predictions  i

principles and conversation have been canvassed upon this occasion and various conjectures made why he should thus set his heart upon number     i have examined all the powers in those numbers broken them into fractions extracted the square and cube root divided and multiplied them all ways but could not arrive at the secret till about three days ago when i received the following letter from an unknown hand by which i find that mr nathaniel cliff is only the agent and not the principal in this advertisement mr spectator  i am the person that lately advertised i would give ten shillings more than the current price for the ticket no     in the lottery now drawing which is a secret i have communicated to some friends who rally me incessantly upon that account you must know i have but one ticket for which reason and a certain dream i have lately had more than once i was resolved it should be the number i most approved i am so positive i have pitched upon the great lot that i could almost lay all i am worth of it my visions are so frequent and strong upon this occasion that i have not only possessed the lot but disposed of the money which in all probability it will sell for this

about him and methought i could observe in his countenance different motions of delight as he turned his eye towards the one and the other of them the man is a person moderate in his designs for their preferment and welfare and as he has an easy fortune he is not sollicitous to make a great one his eldest son is a child of a very towardly disposition and as much as the father loves him i dare say he will never be a knave to improve his fortune i do not know any man who has a juster relish of life than the person i am speaking of or keeps a better guard against the terrors of want or the hopes of gain it is usual in a crowd of children for the parent to name out of his own flock all the great officers of the kingdom there is something so very surprizing in the parts of a child of a mans own that there is nothing too great to be expected from his endowments i know a good woman who has but three sons and there is she says nothing she expects with more certainty than that she shall see one of them a bishop the other a judge and the third a court physician the humour is that any thing which can happen to any mans child is expected by every man for his own but my friend whom i was going to speak of does not flatter himself with such vain expectations but has his eye more upon the virtue and disposition of his children than their advancement or wealth good habits are what will certainly improve a mans fortune and reputation but on the other side affluence of fortune will not as probably produce good affections of the mind  it is very natural for a man of a kind disposition to amuse himself with the promises his imagination makes to him of the future condition of his children and to represent to himself the figure they shall bear in the world after he has left it when his prospects of this kind are agreeable his fondness gives as it were a longer date to his own life and the survivorship of a worthy man in  his son is a pleasure scarce inferior to the hopes of the continuance of his own life that man is happy who can believe of his son that he will escape the follies and indiscretions of which he himself was guilty and pursue and improve every thing that was valuable in him the continuance of his virtue is much more to be regarded than that of his life but it is the most lamentable of all reflections to think that the heir of a mans fortune is such a one as will be a stranger to his friends alienated from the same interests and a promoter of every thing which he himself disapproved an estate in possession of such a successor to a good man is worse than laid waste and the family of which he is the head is in a more deplorable condition than that of being extinct  when i visit the agreeable seat of my honoured friend ruricola and walk from room to room revolving many pleasing occurrences and the expressions of many just sentiments i have heard him utter and see the booby his heir in pain while he is doing the honours of his house to the friend of his father the heaviness it gives one is not to be expressed want of genius is not to be imputed to any man but want of humanity is a mans own fault the son of ruricola whose life was one continued series of worthy actions and gentlemanlike inclinations is the companion of drunken clowns and knows no sense of praise but in the flattery he receives from his own servants his pleasures are mean and inordinate his language base and filthy his  behaviour rough and absurd is this creature to be accounted the successor of a man of virtue wit and breeding at the same time that i have this melancholy prospect at the house where i miss my old friend i can go to a gentlemans not far off it where he has a daughter who is the picture both of his body and mind but both improved with the beauty and modesty peculiar to her sex it is she who supplies the loss of her father to the world she without his name or fortune is a truer memorial of him than her brother who succeeds him in both such an offspring as the eldest son of my friend perpetuates his father in the same manner as the appearance of his ghost would it is indeed ruricola but it is ruricola grown frightful  i know not to what to attribute the brutal turn which this young man has taken except it may be to a certain severity and distance which his father used towards him and might perhaps have occasioned a dislike to those modes of life which were not made amiable to him by freedom and affability  we may promise our selves that no such excrescence will appear in the family of the cornelii where the father lives with his sons like their eldest brother and the sons converse with him as if they did it for no other reason but that he is the wisest man of their acquaintance as the cornelii are eminent traders their good correspondence with each other is useful to all that know them as well as to themselves and their friendship goodwill and kind offices are disposed of jointly as well as their fortune so that no one ever obliged one of them who had not the obligation multiplied in returns from them all  it is the most beautiful object the eyes of man can behold to see a man of worth and his son live in an entire unreserved correspondence the mutual kindness and affection between them give an inexpressible satisfaction to all who know them it is a sublime pleasure which encreases by the participation it is as sacred as friendship as pleasurable as love and as joyful as religion this state of mind does not only dissipate sorrow which would be extream without it but enlarges pleasures which would otherwise be contemptible the most indifferent thing has its force and beauty when it is spoke by a kind father and an insignificant trifle has its weight when offered by a dutiful child i know not how to express it but i think i may call it a transplanted selflove all the enjoyments and sufferings which a man meets with are regarded only as they concern him in the relation he has to another a mans very honour receives a new value to him when he thinks that when he is in his grave it will be had in remembrance that such an action was done by such a ones father such considerations sweeten the old mans evening and his soliloquy delights him when he can say to himself no man can tell my child his father was either unmerciful or unjust my son shall meet many a man who shall say to him i was obliged to thy father and be my child a friend to his child for ever  it is not in the power of all men to leave illustrious names or great fortunes to their posterity but they can very much conduce to their having industry probity valour and justice it is in every mans power to leave his son the honour of descending from a virtuous man and add the blessings of heaven to whatever he leaves him i shall end this rhapsody with a letter to an excellent young man of my acquaintance who has lately lost a worthy father dear sir  i know no part of life more impertinent than the office of administring consolation i will not enter into it for i cannot but applaud your grief the virtuous principles you had from that excellent man whom you have lost have wrought in you as they ought to make a youth of three and twenty incapable of comfort upon coming into possession of a great fortune i doubt not but that you will honour his memory by a modest enjoyment of his estate and scorn to triumph over his grave by employing in riot excess and debauchery what he purchased with so much industry prudence and wisdom this is the true way to shew the sense you have of your loss and to take

when we look round us and behold the strange variety of faces and persons which fill the streets with business and hurry it is no unpleasant amusement to make guesses at their different pursuits and judge by their countenances what it is that so anxiously engages their present attention of all this busie crowd there are none who would give a man inclined to such enquiries better diversion for his thoughts than those whom we call good courtiers and such as are assiduous at the levées of great men these worthies are got into an habit of being servile with an air and enjoy a certain vanity in being known for understanding how the world passes in the pleasure of this they can rise early go abroad sleek and welldressed with no other hope or purpose but to make a bow to a man in courtfavour and be thought by some insignificant smile of his not a little engaged in his interests and fortunes it is wondrous that a man can get over the natural existence and possession of his own mind so far as to take delight either in paying or receiving such cold and repeated civilities but what maintains the humour is that outward show is what most men pursue rather than real happiness thus both the idol and idolater equally impose upon themselves in pleasing their imaginations this way but as there are very many of her majestys good subjects who are extreamly uneasie at their own seats in the country where all from the skies to the centre of the earth is their own and have a mighty longing to shine in courts or be partners in the power of the world i say for the benefit of these and others who hanker after being in the whisper with great men and vexing their neighbours with the changes they would be capable of making in the appearance at a country sessions it would not methinks be amiss to give an account of that market for preferment a great mans levée  for ought i know this commerce between the mighty and their slaves very justly represented might do so much good as to incline the great to regard business rather than ostentation and make the little know the use of their time too well to spend it in vain applications and addresses  the famous doctor in moorfields who gained so much reputation for his horary predictions is said to have had in his parlour different ropes to little bells which hung in the room above stairs where the doctor thought fit to be oraculous if a girl had been deceived by her lover one bell was pulled and if a peasant had lost a cow the servant  rung another this method was kept in respect to all other passions and concerns and   sifted the enquirer and gave the doctor notice accordingly the levée of a great man is laid after the same manner and twenty whispers false alarms and private intimations pass backward and forward from the porter the valet and the patron himself before the gaping crew who are to pay their court are gathered together when the scene is ready the doors fly open and discover his lordship  there are several ways of making this first appearance you may be either half dressed and washing your self which is indeed the most stately but this way of opening is peculiar to military men in whom there is something graceful in exposing themselves naked but the politicians or civil officers have usually affected to be more reserved and preserve a certain chastity of deportment whether it be hieroglyphical or not this difference in the military and civil list i will not say but have  ever understood the fact to be that the close minister is buttoned up and the brave officer openbreasted on these occasions  however that is i humbly conceive the business of a levée is to receive the acknowledgments of a multitude that a man is wise bounteous  valiant and powerful when the first shot of eyes is  made it is wonderful to observe how much submission the patrons modesty can bear and how much servitude the clients spirit can descend to in the vast multiplicity of business and the crowd about him my lords parts are usually so great that to the astonishment of the whole assembly he has something to say to every man there and that so suitable to his capacity as any man may judge that it is not without talents that men can arrive at great employments i have known a great man ask a flagofficer which way was the wind a commander of horse the present price of oats and a stockjobber at what discount such a fund was with as much ease as if he had been bred to each of those several ways of life now this is extreamly obliging for at the same time that the patron informs himself of matters he gives the person of whom he enquires an opportunity to exert himself what adds to the pomp of those interviews is that it is performed with the greatest silence and order imaginable the patron is usually in the midst of the room and some humble person gives him a whisper which his lordship answers aloud it is well yes i am of your opinion pray inform yourself further you may be sure of my part in it this happy man is dismissed and my lord can turn himself to a business of a quite different nature and offhand give as good an answer as any great man is obliged to for the chief point is to keep in generals and if there be any thing offered thats particular to be in haste  but we are now in the height of the affair and my lords creatures have all had their whispers round to keep up the farce of the thing and the dumb show is become more general he casts his eye to that corner and there to mr suchaone to the other and when did you come to town and perhaps just before he nods to another and enters with him but sir i am glad to see you now i think of it each of those are happy for the next four and twenty hours and those who bow in ranks undistinguished and by dozens at a time think they have very good prospects if they hope to arrive at such notices half a year hence  the satyrist says  there is seldom common sense in high fortune and one would think to behold a levée that the great were not only infatuated with their station but also that they believed all below were seized too else how is it possible that they could think of imposing upon themselves and others in such a degree as to set up a levée for any thing but a direct farce but such is the weakness of our nature that when men are a little exalted in their condition they immediately conceive they have additional senses and their capacities enlarged not only above other men but above human comprehension it self thus it is ordinary to see a great man attend one listning bow to one at a distance and call to a third at the same instant a girl in new ribbands is not more taken with her self nor does she betray more apparent coquetries than even a wise man in such a circumstance of courtship i do not know any thing that i ever thought so very distasteful as the affectation which is recorded of cæsar to wit that he would dictate to three several writers at the same time this was an ambition below the greatness and candour of his mind he indeed if any man had pretensions to greater faculties than any other mortal was the person but such a way of acting is childish and inconsistent with the manner of our being and it appears from the very nature of things that there cannot be any thing effectually dispatched in the distraction of a publick levée but the whole seems

wife it is no matter what is the reason of a mans grief if it be heavy as it is her unhappy man is convinced that she means him no dishonour but pines to death because she will not have so much deference to him as to avoid the appearances of it the author of the following letter is perplexed with an injury that is in a degree yet less criminal and yet the source of the utmost unhappiness mr spectator  i have read your papers which relate to jealousy and desire your advice in my case which you will say is not common i have a wife of whose virtue i am not in the least doubtful yet i cannot be satisfied she loves me which gives me as great uneasiness as being faulty the other way would do i know not whether i am not yet more miserable than in that case for she keeps possession of my heart without the return of hers i would desire your observations upon that temper in some women who will not condescend to convince their husbands of their innocence or their love but are wholly negligent of what reflections the poor men make upon their conduct so they cannot call it criminal when at the same time a little tenderness of behaviour or regard to shew an inclination to please them would make them entirely at ease do not such women deserve all the misinterpretation which they neglect to avoid or are they not in the actual practice of guilt who care not whether they are thought guilty or not if my wife does the most ordinary thing as visiting her sister or taking the air with her mother it is always carried with the air of a secret then she will sometimes tell a thing of no consequence as if it was only want of memory made her conceal it before and this only to dally with my anxiety i have complained to her of this behaviour in the gentlest terms imaginable and beseeched her not to use him who desired only to live with her like an indulgent friend as the most morose and unsociable husband in the world it is no easy matter to describe our circumstance but it is miserable with this aggravation that it might be easily mended and yet no remedy endeavoured she reads you and there is a phrase or two in this letter which she will know came from me if we enter into an explanation which may tend to our future quiet by your means you shall have our joint thanks in the mean time i am as much as i can in this ambiguous condition be any thing sir  your humble servant     mr spectator  give me leave to make you a present of a character not yet described in your papers which is that of a man who treats his friend with the same odd variety which a fantastical female tyrant practises towards her lover i have for some time had a friendship with one of these mercurial persons the rogue i know loves me yet takes advantage of my fondness for him to use me as he pleases we are by turns the best friends and the greatest strangers imaginable sometimes you would think us inseparable at other times he avoids me for a long time yet neither he nor i know why when we meet next by chance he is amazed he has not seen me is impatient for an appointment the same evening and when i expect he should have kept it i have known him slip away to another place where he has sat reading the news when there is no post smoaking his pipe which he seldom cares for and staring about him in company with whom he has had nothing to do as if he wondered how he came there  that i may state my case to you the more fully i shall transcribe some short minutes i have taken of him in my almanack since last spring for you must know there are certain seasons of the year according to which i will not say our friendship but the enjoyment of it rises or falls in march and april he was as various as the weather in may and part of june i found him the sprightliest besthumoured fellow in the world in the dogdays he was much upon the indolent in september very agreeable but very busy and since the glass fell last to changeable he has made three appointments with me and broke them every one however i have good hopes of him this winter especially if you will lend me your assistance to reform him which will be a great ease and pleasure to  sir your most humble servant october         t  contents contents p     no     saturday october         addison     there is a story in the arabian nights tales  of a king who had long languished under an ill habit of body and had taken abundance of remedies to no purpose at length says the fable a physician cured him by the following method he took an hollow ball of wood and filled it with several drugs after which he closd it up so artificially that nothing appeared he likewise took a mall and after having hollowed the handle and that part which strikes the ball he enclosed in them several drugs after the same manner as in the ball it self he then ordered the sultan who was his patient to exercise himself early in the morning with these rightly prepared instruments till such time as he should sweat when as the story goes the vertue of the medicaments perspiring through the wood had so good an influence on the sultans constitution that they cured him of an indisposition which all the compositions he had taken inwardly had not been able to remove this eastern allegory is finely contrived to shew us how beneficial bodily labour is to health and that exercise is the most effectual physick i have described in my hundred and fifteenth paper from the general structure and mechanism of an human body how absolutely necessary exercise is for its preservation i shall in this place recommend another great preservative of health which in many cases produces the same effects as exercise and may in some measure supply its place where opportunities of exercise are wanting the preservative i am speaking of is temperance which has those particular advantages above all other means of health that it may be practised by all ranks and conditions at any season or in any place it is a kind of regimen into which every man may put himself without interruption to business expence of mony or loss of time if exercise throws off all superfluities temperance prevents them if exercise clears the vessels temperance neither satiates nor overstrains them if exercise raises proper ferments in the humours and promotes the circulation of the blood temperance gives nature her full play and enables her to exert her self in all her force and vigour if exercise dissipates a growing distemper temperance starves it  physick for the most part is nothing else but the substitute of exercise or temperance medicines are indeed absolutely necessary in acute distempers that cannot wait the slow operations of these two great instruments of health but did men live in an habitual course of exercise and temperance there would be but little occasion for them accordingly we find that those parts of the world are the most healthy where they subsist by the chace and that men lived longest when their lives were employed in hunting and when they had little food besides what they caught blistering cupping bleeding are seldom of use but to the idle and intemperate as all those inward applications which are so much in practice among us are for the most part nothing else but expedients to make luxury consistent with health the apothecary is perpetually employed in countermining the cook and the vintner it is said of diogenes  that meeting a young man who was going to a feast he took him up in the street and carried him home to his friends as one who was running into imminent danger had not he prevented him what would that philosopher have said had he been present at the gluttony of a modern meal would not he have thought the master of a family mad and have begged his servants to tie down his hands had he seen him devour fowl fish and flesh swallow oyl and vinegar wines and spices throw down sallads of twenty different herbs sauces of an hundred ingredients confections and fruits of numberless sweets and flavours what unnatural motions and counterferments must such a medley of intemperance produce in the body for my part when i behold a fashionable table set out in all its magnificence i fancy that i see gouts and dropsies feavers and lethargies with other innumerable distempers lying in ambuscade among the dishes  nature delights in the most plain and simple diet every animal but man keeps to one dish herbs are the food of this species fish of that and flesh of a third man falls upon every thing that comes in his way not the smallest fruit or excrescence of the earth scarce a berry or a mushroom can escape him  it is impossible to lay down any determinate rule for temperance because what is luxury in one may be temperance in another but there are few that have lived any time in the world who are not judges of their own constitutions so far as to know what kinds and what proportions of food do best agree with them were i to consider my readers as my patients and to prescribe such a kind of temperance as is accommodated to all persons and such as is particularly suitable to our climate and way of living i would copy the following rules of a very eminent physician make your whole repast out of one dish if you indulge in a second avoid drinking any thing strong till you have finished your meal at  the same time abstain from all sauces or at least such as are not the most plain and simple a man could not be well guilty of gluttony if he stuck to these few obvious and easy rules in the first case there would be no variety of tastes to sollicit his palate and occasion excess nor in the second any artificial provocatives to relieve satiety and create a false appetite were i to prescribe a rule for drinking it should be formd upon a saying quoted by sir william temple  the first glass for my self the second for my friends the third for good humour and the fourth for mine enemies but because it is impossible for one who lives in the world to diet himself always in so philosophical a manner i think every man should have his days of abstinence according as his constitution will permit these are great reliefs to nature as they qualifie her for struggling with hunger and thirst whenever any distemper or duty of life may put her upon such difficulties and at the same time give her an opportunity of extricating her self from her oppressions and recovering the several tones and springs of her distended vessels besides that abstinence well timed often kills a sickness in embryo and destroys the first seeds of an indisposition it is observed by two or three ancient authors  that socrates notwithstanding he lived in athens during that great plague which has made so much noise through all ages and has been celebrated at different times by such eminent hands i say notwithstanding that he lived in the time of this devouring pestilence he never caught the least infection which those writers unanimously ascribe to that uninterrupted temperance which he always observed  and here i cannot but mention an observation which i have often made upon reading the lives of the philosophers and comparing them with any series of kings or great men of the same number if we consider these ancient sages a great part of whose philosophy consisted in a temperate and abstemious course of life one would think the life of a philosopher and the life of a man were of two different dates for we find that the generality of these wise men were nearer an hundred than sixty years of age at the time of their respective deaths but the most remarkable instance of the efficacy of temperance towards the procuring of long life is what we meet with in a little book published by lewis cornare the venetian which i the rather mention because it is of undoubted credit as the late venetian ambassador who was of the same family attested more than once in conversation when he resided in england cornaro who was the author of the little treatise i am mentioning was of an infirm constitution till about forty when by obstinately persisting in an exact course of temperance he recovered a perfect state of health insomuch that at fourscore he published his book which has been translated into english upon the title of sure and certain methods  of attaining a long and healthy life he lived to give a  rd or  th edition of it and after having passed his hundredth year died without pain or agony and like one who falls asleep the treatise i mention has been taken notice of by several eminent authors and is written with such a spirit of chearfulness religion and good sense as are the natural concomitants of temperance and sobriety the mixture of the old man in it is rather a recommendation than a discredit to it  having designed this paper as the sequel to that upon exercise i have not here considered temperance as it is a moral virtue which i shall make the subject of a future speculation but only as it is the means of health  l      footnote     the history of the greek king and douban the physician told by the fisherman to the genie in the story of the fisherman return to footnote mark

moralists in all ages and that is that they are always professing themselves and teaching others to be happy this state is not to be arrived at in this life therefore i would recommend to you to talk in an humbler strain than your predecessors have done and instead of presuming to be happy instruct us only to be easy the thoughts of him who would be discreet and aim at practicable things should turn upon allaying our pain rather than promoting our joy great inquietude is to be avoided but great felicity is not to be attained the great lesson is æquanimity a regularity of spirit which is a little above chearfulness and below mirth chearfulness is always to be supported if a man is out of pain but mirth to a prudent man should always be accidental it should naturally arise out of the occasion and the occasion seldom be laid for it for those tempers who want mirth to be pleased are like the constitutions which flag without the use of brandy therefore i say let your precept be be easy that mind is dissolute and ungoverned which must be hurried out of it self by loud laughter or sensual pleasure or else be  wholly unactive  there are a couple of old fellows of my acquaintance who meet every day and smoak a pipe and by their mutual love to each other tho they have been men of business and bustle in the world enjoy a greater tranquility than either could have worked himself into by any chapter of seneca indolence of body and mind when we aim at no more is very frequently enjoyed but the very enquiry after happiness has something restless in it which a man who lives in a series of temperate meals friendly conversations and easy slumbers gives himself no trouble about while men of refinement are talking of tranquility he possesses it  what i would by these broken expressions recommend to you mr spectator is that you would speak of the way of life which plain men may pursue to fill up the spaces of time with satisfaction it is a lamentable circumstance that wisdom or as you call it philosophy should furnish ideas only for the learned and that a man must be a philosopher to know how to pass away his time agreeably it would therefore be worth your pains to place in an handsome light the relations and affinities among men which render their conversation with each other so grateful that the highest talents give but an impotent pleasure in comparison with them you may find descriptions and discourses which will render the fireside of an honest artificer as entertaining as your own club is to you goodnature has an endless source of pleasure in it and the representation of domestick life filled with its natural gratifications instead of the necessary vexations which are generally insisted upon in the writings of the witty will be a very good office

who are a spectator as well as such subjects which appear indeed more speculative but are less instructive in a word sir i would have you turn your thoughts to the advantage of such as want you most

of their different ages and tempers as the particular profession or business in which they were educated and brought up  i am the more surprised to find this subject so little touched on since what i am here speaking of is so apparent as not to escape the most vulgar observation the business men are chiefly conversant in does not only give a certain cast or turn to their minds but is very often apparent in their outward behaviour and some of the most indifferent actions of their lives it is this air diffusing itself over the whole man which helps us to find out a person at his first appearance so that the most careless observer fancies he can scarce be mistaken in the carriage of a seaman or the gaite of a taylor  the liberal arts though they may possibly have less effect on our external mein and behaviour make so deep an impression on the mind as is very apt to bend it wholly one way  the mathematician will take little less than demonstration in the most common discourse and the schoolman is as great a friend to definitions and syllogisms the physician and divine are often heard to dictate in private companies with the same authority which they exercise over their patients and disciples while the lawyer is putting cases and raising matter for disputation out of every thing that occurs  i may possibly some time or other animadvert more at large on the particular fault each profession is most infected with but shall at present wholly apply my self to the cure of what i last mentioned namely that spirit of strife and contention in the conversations of gentlemen of the long robe  this is the more ordinary because these gentlemen regarding argument as their own proper province and very often making ready money of it think it unsafe to yield before company they are shewing in common talk how zealously they could defend a cause in court and therefore frequently forget to keep that temper which is absolutely requisite to render conversation pleasant and instructive  captain sentry pushes this matter so far that i have heard him say he has known but few pleaders that were tolerable company  the captain who is a man of good sense but dry conversation was last night giving me an account of a discourse in which he had lately been engaged with a young wrangler in the law i was giving my opinion says the captain without apprehending any debate that might arise from it of a generals behaviour in a battle that was fought some years before either the templer or my self were born the young lawyer immediately took me up and by reasoning above a quarter of an hour upon a subject which i saw he understood nothing of endeavoured to shew me that my opinions were ill grounded upon which says the captain to avoid any farther contests i told him that truly i had not considerd those several arguments which he had brought against me and that there might be a great deal in them ay but says my antagonist who would not let me escape so there are several things to be urged in favour of your opinion which you have omitted and thereupon begun to shine on the other side of the question upon this says the captain i came over to my first sentiments and entirely acquiesced in his reasons for my so doing upon which the templer again recovered his former posture and confuted both himself and me a third time in short says my friend i found he was resolved to keep me at swords length and never let me close with him so that i had nothing left but to hold my tongue and give my antagonist free leave to smile at his victory who i found like hudibras could still change sides and still confute   for my own part i have ever regarded our inns of courts as nurseries of statesmen and lawgivers which makes me often frequent that part of the town with great pleasure  upon my calling in lately at one of the most noted temple coffeehouses i found the whole room which was full of young students divided into several parties each of which was deeply engaged in some controversie the management of the late ministry was attacked and defended with great vigour and several preliminaries to the peace were proposed by some and rejected by others the demolishing of dunkirk was so eagerly insisted on and so warmly controverted as had like to have produced a challenge in short i observed that the desire of victory whetted with the little prejudices of party and interest generally carried the argument to such an height as made the disputants insensibly conceive an aversion towards each other and part with the highest dissatisfaction on both sides  the managing an argument handsomely being so nice a point and what i have seen so very few excel in i shall here set down a few rules on that head which among other things i gave in writing to a young kinsman of mine who had made so great a proficiency in the law that he began to plead in company upon every subject that was started  having the entire manuscript by me i may perhaps from time to time publish such parts of it as i shall think requisite for the instruction of the british youth what regards my present purpose is as follows  avoid disputes as much as possible in order to appear easie and wellbred in conversation you may assure your self that it requires more wit as well as more good humour to improve than to contradict the notions of another but if you are at any time obliged to enter on an argument give your reasons with the utmost coolness and modesty two things which scarce ever fail of making an impression on the hearers besides if you are neither dogmatical nor shew either by your actions or words that you are full of your self all will the more heartily rejoice at your victory nay should you be pinched in your argument you may make your retreat with a very good grace you were never positive and are now glad to be better informed this has made some approve the socratical way of reasoning where while you scarce affirm any thing you can hardly be caught in an absurdity and tho possibly you are endeavouring to bring over another to your opinion which is firmly fixd you seem only to desire information from him  in order to keep that temper which is  so difficult and yet so necessary to preserve you may please to consider that nothing can be more unjust or ridiculous than to be angry with another because he is not of your opinion the interests education and means by which men attain their knowledge are so very different that it is impossible they should all think alike and he has at least as much reason to be angry with you as you with him sometimes to keep your self cool it may be of service to ask your self fairly what might have been your opinion had you all the biasses of education and interest your adversary may possibly have but if you contend for the honour of victory alone you may lay down this as an infallible maxim that you cannot make a more false step or give your antagonists a greater advantage over you than by falling into a passion  when an argument is over how many weighty reasons does a man recollect which his heat and violence made him utterly forget  it is yet more absurd to be angry with a man because he does not apprehend the force of your reasons or gives weak ones of his own if you argue for reputation this makes your victory the easier he is certainly in all respects an object of your pity rather than anger and if he cannot comprehend what you do you ought to thank nature for her favours who has given you so much the clearer understanding  you may please to add this consideration that among your equals no one values your anger which only preys upon its master and perhaps you may find it not very consistent either with prudence or your ease to punish your self whenever you meet with a fool or a knave  lastly if you propose to your self the true end of argument which is information it may be a seasonable check to your passion for if you search purely after truthtwill be almost indifferent to you where you find it i cannot in this place omit an observation which i have often made namely that nothing procures a man more esteem and less envy from the whole company than if he chooses the part of moderator without engaging directly on either side in a dispute this gives him the character of impartial furnishes him with an opportunity of sifting things to the bottom shewing his judgment and of sometimes making handsome compliments to each of the contending parties  i shall close this subject with giving you one caution when you have gained a victory do not push it too far tis sufficient to let the company and your adversary see tis in your power but that you are too generous to make use of it  x      footnote     part i canto i v     0 return to

midst of flames without being hurt a salamander knows no distinction of sex in those she converses with grows familiar with a stranger at first sight and is not so narrowspirited as to observe whether the person she talks to be in breeches or petticoats she admits a male visitant to her bedside plays with him a whole afternoon at pickette walks with him two or three hours by moonlight and is extreamly scandalized at the unreasonableness of an husband or the severity of a parent that would debar the sex from such innocent liberties your salamander is therefore a perpetual declaimer against jealousie and admirer of the french goodbreeding and a great stickler for freedom in conversation in short the salamander lives in an invincible state of simplicity and innocence her constitution is preservd in a kind of natural frost she wonders what people mean by temptation and defies mankind to do their worst her chastity is engaged in a constant ordeal or fiery tryal like good queen emma  the pretty innocent walks blindfold among burning ploughshares without being scorched or singed by them  it is not therefore for the use of the salamander whether in a married or single state of life that i design the following paper but for such females only as are made of flesh and blood and find themselves subject to human frailties  as for this part of the fair sex who are not of the salamander kind i would most earnestly advise them to observe a quite different conduct in their behaviour and to avoid as much as possible what religion calls temptations and the world opportunities did they but know how many thousands of their sex have been gradually betrayed from innocent freedoms to ruin and infamy and how many millions of ours have begun with flatteries protestations and endearments but ended with reproaches perjury and perfidiousness they would shun like death the very first approaches of one that might lead them into inextricable labyrinths of guilt and misery i must so far give up the cause of the male world as to exhort the female sex in the language of chamont in the orphan  trust not a man we are by nature false dissembling subtle cruel and unconstant when a man talks of love with caution trust him but if he swears hell certainly deceive thee i might very much enlarge upon this subject but shall conclude it with a story which i lately heard from one of our spanish officers  and which may shew the danger a woman incurs by too great familiarities with a male companion  an inhabitant of the kingdom of castile being a man of more than ordinary prudence and of a grave composed behaviour determined about the fiftieth year of his age to enter upon wedlock in order to make himself easy in it he cast his eye upon a young woman who had nothing to recommend her but her beauty and her education her parents having been reduced to great poverty by the wars which  for some years have laid that whole country waste the castilian having made his addresses to her and married her they lived together in perfect happiness for some time when at length the husbands affairs made it necessary for him to take a voyage to the kingdom of naples where a great part of his estate lay the wife loved him too tenderly to be left behind him they had not been a shipboard above a day when they unluckily fell into the hands of an algerine pirate who carried the whole company on shore and made them slaves the castilian and his wife had the comfort to be under the same master who seeing how dearly they loved one another and gasped after their liberty demanded a most exorbitant price for their ransom the castilian though he would rather have died in slavery himself than have paid such a sum as he found would go near to ruin him was so moved with compassion towards his wife that he sent repeated orders to his friend in spain who happened to be his next relation to sell his estate and transmit the money to him his friend hoping that the terms of his ransom might be made more reasonable and unwilling to sell an estate which he himself had some prospect of inheriting formed so many delays that three whole years passed away without any thing being done for the setting of them at liberty  there happened to live a french renegado in the same place where the castilian and his wife were kept prisoners as this fellow had in him all the vivacity of his nation he often entertained the captives with accounts of his own adventures to which he sometimes added a song or a dance or some other piece of mirth to divert them during  their confinement his acquaintance with the manners of the algerines enabled him likewise to do them several good offices the castilian as he was one day in conversation with this renegado discovered to him the negligence and treachery of his correspondent in castile and at the same time asked his advice how he should behave himself in that exigency he further told the renegado that he found it would be impossible for him to raise the money unless he himself might go over to dispose of his estate the renegado after having represented to him that his algerine master would never consent to his release upon such a pretence at length contrived a method for the castlian to make his escape in the habit of a seaman the castilian succeeded in his attempt and having sold his estate being afraid lest the money should miscarry by the way and determining to perish with it rather than lose one who was much dearer to him than his life he returned himself in a little vessel that was going to algiers it is impossible to describe the joy he felt on this occasion when he considered that he should soon see the wife whom he so much loved and endear himself more to her by this uncommon piece of generosity the renegado during the husbands absence so insinuated himself into the good graces of his young wife and so turned her head with stories of gallantry that she quickly thought him the finest gentleman she had ever conversed with to be brief her mind was quite alienated from the honest castilian whom she was taught to look upon as a formal old fellow unworthy the possession of so charming a creature she had been instructed by the renegado how to manage herself upon his arrival so that she received him with an appearance of the utmost love and gratitude and at length perswaded him to trust their common friend the renegado with the money he had brought over for their ransom as not questioning but he would beat down the terms of it and negotiate the affair more to their advantage than they themselves could do the good man admired her prudence and followed her advice i wish i could conceal the sequel of this story but since i cannot i shall dispatch it in as few words as possible the castilian having slept longer than ordinary the next morning upon his awaking found his wife had left him he immediately arose and enquired after her but was told that she was seen with the renegado about break of day in a word her lover having got all things ready for their departure they soon made their escape out of the territories of algiers carried away the money and left the castilian in captivity who partly through the cruel treatment of the incensed algerine his master and partly through the unkind usage of his unfaithful wife died some few months after  l      footnote    the story

considered the mercenary practice of men in the choice of wives if you would please to employ your thoughts upon that subject you would easily conceive the miserable condition many of us are in who not only from the laws of custom and modesty are restrained from making any advances towards our wishes but are also from the circumstance of fortune out of all hope of being addressed to by those whom we love under all these disadvantages i am obliged to apply my self to you and hope i shall prevail with you to print in your very next paper the following letter which is a declaration of passion to one who has made some feint addresses to me for some time i believe he ardently loves me but the inequality of my fortune makes him think he cannot answer it to the world if he pursues his designs by way of marriage and i believe as he does not want discerning he discovered me looking at him the other day unawares in such a manner as has raised his hopes of gaining me on terms the men call easier but my heart was very full on this occasion and if you know what love and honour are you will pardon me that i use no further arguments with you but hasten to my letter to him whom i call

after very much perplexity in my self and revolving how to acquaint you with my own sentiments and expostulate with you concerning yours i have chosen this way by which means i can be at once revealed to you or if you please lie concealed if i do not within few days find the effect which i hope from this the whole affair shall be buried in oblivion but alas what am i going to do when i am about to tell you that i love you but after i have done so i am to assure you that with all the passion which ever entered a tender heart i know i can banish you from my sight for ever when i am convinced that you have no inclinations towards me but to my dishonour but alas sir why should you sacrifice the real and essential happiness of life to the opinion of a world that moves upon no other foundation but professd error and prejudice you all can observe that riches alone do not make you happy and yet give up every thing else when it stands in competition with riches since the world is so bad that religion is left to us silly women and you men act generally upon principles of profit and pleasure i will talk to you without arguing from any thing but what may be most to your advantage as a man of the world and i will lay before you the state of the case supposing that you had it in your power to make me your mistress or your wife and hope to convince you that the latter is more for your interest and will contribute more to your pleasure we will suppose then the scene was laid and you were now in expectation of the approaching evening wherein i was to meet you and be carried to what convenient corner of the town you thought fit to consummate all which your wanton imagination has promised you in the possession of one who is in the bloom of youth and in the reputation of innocence you would soon have enough of me as i am sprightly young gay and airy when fancy is sated and finds all the promises it made  it self false where is now the innocence which charmed you the first hour you are alone you will find that the pleasure of a debauchee is only that of a destroyer he blasts all the fruit he tastes and where the brute has been devouring there is nothing left worthy the relish of the man reason resumes her place after imagination is cloyed and i am with the utmost distress and confusion to behold my self the cause of uneasie reflections to you to be visited by stealth and dwell for the future with the two companions the most unfit for each other in the world solitude and guilt i will not insist upon the shameful obscurity we should pass our time in nor run over the little short snatches of fresh air and free commerce which all people must be satisfied with whose actions will not bear examination but leave them to your reflections who have seen of that life of which i have but a meer idea  on the other hand if you can be so good and generous as to make me your wife you may promise your self all the obedience and tenderness with which gratitude can inspire a virtuous woman whatever gratifications you may promise your self from an agreeable person whatever compliances from an easie temper whatever consolations from a sincere friendship you may expect as the due of your generosity what at present in your ill view you promise your self from me will be followed by distaste and satiety but the transports of a virtuous love are the least part of its happiness the raptures of innocent passion are but like lightning to the day they rather interrupt than advance the pleasure of it how happy then is that life to be where the highest pleasures of sense are but the lower parts of its felicity  now am i to repeat to you the unnatural request of taking me in direct terms i know there stands between me and that happiness the haughty daughter of a man who can give you suitably to your fortune but if you weigh the attendance and behaviour of her who comes to you in partnership of your fortune and expects an equivalent with that of her who enters your house as honoured and obliged by that permission whom of the two will you chuse you perhaps will think fit to spend a day abroad in the common entertainments of men of sense and fortune she will think herself illused in that absence and contrive at home an expence proportioned to the appearance which you make in the world she is in all things to have a regard to the fortune which she brought you i to the fortune to which you introduced me the commerce between you two will eternally have the air of a bargain between us of a friendship joy will ever enter into the room with you and kind wishes attend my benefactor when he leaves it ask your self how would you be pleased to enjoy for ever the pleasure of having laid an immediate obligation on a grateful mind such will be your case

october         steele   vincit amor patriæ  virg   the ambition of princes is many times as hurtful to themselves as to their people this cannot be doubted of such as prove unfortunate in their wars but it is often true too of those who are celebrated for their successes if a severe view were to be taken of their conduct if the profit and loss by their wars could be justly ballanced it would be rarely found that the conquest is sufficient to repay the cost  as i was the other day looking over the letters of my correspondents i took this hint from that of philarithmus  which has turned my present thoughts upon political arithmetick an art of greater use than entertainment my friend has offered an essay towards proving that lewis xiv with all his acquisitions is not master of more people than at the beginning of his wars nay that for every subject he had acquired he had lost three that were his inheritance if philarithmus is not mistaken in his calculations lewis must have been impoverished by his ambition  the prince for the publick good has a sovereign property in every private persons estate and consequently his riches must encrease or decrease in proportion to the number and riches of his subjects for example if sword or pestilence should destroy all the people of this metropolis god forbid there should be room for such a supposition but if this should be the case the queen must needs lose a great part of her revenue or at least what is charged upon the city must encrease the burden upon the rest of her subjects perhaps the inhabitants here are not above a tenth part of the whole yet as they are better fed and clothd and lodgd than her other subjects the customs and excises upon their consumption the imposts upon their houses and other taxes do very probably make a fifth part of the whole revenue of the crown but this is not all the consumption of the city takes off a great part of the fruits of the whole island and as it pays such a proportion of the rent or yearly value of the lands in the country so it is the cause of paying such a proportion of taxes upon those lands the loss then of such a people must needs be sensible to the prince and visible to the whole kingdom  on the other hand if it should please god to drop from heaven a new people equal in number and riches to the city i should be ready to think their excises customs and houserent would raise as great a revenue to the crown as would be lost in the former case and as the consumption of this new body would be a new market for the fruits of the country all the lands especially those most adjacent would rise in their yearly value and pay greater yearly taxes to the publick the gain in this case would be as sensible as the former loss  whatsoever is assessd upon the general is levied upon individuals it were worth the while then to consider what is paid by or by means of the meanest subjects in order to compute the value of every subject to the prince  for my own part i should believe that seven eighths of the people are without property in themselves or the heads of their families and forced to work for their daily bread and that of this sort there are seven millions in the whole island of great britain and yet one would imagine that seven eighths of the whole people should consume at least three fourths of the whole fruits of the country if this is the case the subjects without property pay three fourths of the rents and consequently enable the landed men to pay three fourths of their taxes now if so great a part of the landtax were to be divided by seven millions it would amount to more than three shillings to every head and thus as the poor are the cause without which the rich could not pay this tax even the poorest subject is upon this account worth three shillings yearly to the prince  again one would imagine the consumption of seven eighths of the whole people should pay two thirds of all the customs and excises and if this sum too should be divided by seven millions viz the number of poor people it would amount to more than seven shillings to every head and therefore with this and the former sum every poor subject without property except of his limbs or labour is worth at least ten shillings yearly to the sovereign so much then the queen loses with every one of her old and gains with every one of her new subjects  when i was got into this way of thinking i presently grew conceited of the argument and was just preparing to write a letter of advice to a member of parliament for opening the freedom of our towns and trades for taking away all manner of distinctions between the natives and foreigners for repealing our laws of parish settlements and removing every other obstacle to the increase of the people but as soon as i had recollected with what inimitable eloquence my fellowlabourers had exaggerated the mischiefs of selling the birthright of britons for a shilling of spoiling the pure british blood with foreign mixtures of introducing a confusion of languages and religions and of letting in strangers to eat the bread out of the mouths of our own people i became so humble as to let my project fall to the ground and leave my country to encrease by the ordinary way of generation  as i have always at heart the publick good so i am ever contriving schemes to promote it and i think i may without vanity pretend to have contrived some as wise as any of the castlebuilders i had no sooner given up my former project but my head was presently full of draining fens and marshes banking out the sea and joining new lands to my country for since it is thought impracticable to encrease the people to the land i fell immediately to consider how much would be gained to the prince by encreasing the lands to the people  if the same omnipotent power which made the world should at this time raise out of the ocean and join to great britain an equal extent of land with equal buildings corn cattle and other conveniences and necessaries of life but no men women nor children i should hardly believe this would add either to the riches of the people or revenue of the prince for since the present buildings are sufficient for all the inhabitants if any of them should forsake the old to inhabit the new part of the island the increase of houserent in this would be attended with at least an equal decrease of it in the other besides we have such a sufficiency of corn and cattle that we give bounties to our neighbours to take what exceeds of the former off our hands and we will not suffer any of the latter to be imported upon us by our fellowsubjects and for the remaining product of the country tis already equal to all our markets but if all these things should be doubled to the same buyers the owners must be glad with half their present prices the landlords with half their present rents and thus by so great an enlargement of the country the rents in the whole would not increase nor the taxes to the publick  on the contrary i should believe they would be very much diminished for as the land is only valuable for its fruits and these are all perishable and for the most part must either be used within the year or perish without use the owners will get rid of them at any rate rather than they should waste in their possession so that tis probable the annual production of those perishable things even of one tenth part of them beyond all possibility of use will reduce one half of their value it seems to be for this reason that our neighbour merchants who ingross all the spices and know how great a quantity is equal to the demand destroy all that exceeds it it were natural then to think that the annual production of twice as much as can be used must reduce all to an eighth part of their present prices and thus this extended island would not exceed one fourth part of its present value or pay more than one fourth part of the present tax  it is generally observed that in countries of the greatest plenty there is the poorest living like the schoolmens ass in one of my speculations the people almost starve between two meals the truth is the poor which are the bulk of the nation work only that they may live and if with two days labour they can get a wretched subsistence for a week they will hardly be brought to work the other four but then with the wages of two days they can neither pay such prices for their provisions nor such excises to the government  that paradox therefore in old hesiod or half is more than the whole is very applicable to the present case since nothing is more true in political arithmetick than that the same people with half a country is more valuable than with the whole i begin to think there was nothing absurd in sir w petty when he fancied if all the highlands of scotland and the whole kingdom of ireland were sunk in the ocean so that the people were all saved and brought into the lowlands of great britain nay though they were to be reimburst the value of their estates by the body of the people yet both the sovereign and the subjects in general would be enriched by the very loss   if the people only make the riches the father of ten children is a greater benefactor to his country than he who has added to it  0 000 acres of land and no people it is certain lewis has joind vast tracts of land to his dominions but if philarithmus says true that he is not now master of so many subjects as before we may then account for his not being able to bring such mighty armies into the field and for their being neither so well fed nor cloathed nor paid as formerly the reason is plain lewis must needs have been impoverished not only by his loss of subjects but by his acquisition of lands  t

of a child with devotion which seldom dies in a mind that has received an early tincture of it though it may seem extinguished for a while by the cares of the world the heats of youth or the allurements of vice it generally breaks out and discovers it self again as soon as discretion consideration age or misfortunes have brought the man to himself the fire may be covered and overlaid but cannot be entirely quenched and smothered  a state of temperance sobriety and justice without devotion is a cold lifeless insipid condition of virtue and is rather to be styled philosophy than religion devotion opens the mind to great conceptions and fills it with more sublime ideas than any that are to be met with in the most exalted science and at the same time warms and agitates the soul more than sensual pleasure  it has been observed by some writers that man is more distinguished from the animal world by devotion than by reason as several brute creatures discover in their actions something like a faint glimmering of reason though they betray in no single circumstance of their behaviour any thing that bears the least affinity to devotion it is certain the propensity of the mind to religious worship the natural tendency of the soul to fly to some superior being for succour in dangers and distresses the gratitude to an invisible superintendent which  rises in us upon receiving any extraordinary and unexpected good fortune the acts of love and admiration with which the thoughts of men are so wonderfully transported in meditating upon the divine perfections and the universal concurrence of all the nations under heaven in the great article of adoration plainly shew that devotion or religious worship must be the effect of tradition from some first founder of mankind or that it is conformable to the natural light of reason or that it proceeds from an instinct implanted in the soul it self for my part i look upon all these to be the concurrent causes but which ever of them shall be assigned as the principle of divine worship it manifestly points to a supreme being as the first author of it  i may take some other opportunity of considering those particular forms and methods of devotion which are taught us by christianity but shall here observe into what errors even this divine principle may sometimes lead us when it is not moderated by that right reason which was given us as the guide of all our actions  the two great errors into which a mistaken devotion may betray us are enthusiasm and superstition  there is not a more melancholy object than a man who has his head turned with religious enthusiasm a person that is crazed tho with pride or malice is a sight very mortifying to human nature but when the distemper arises from any indiscreet fervours of devotion or too intense an application of the mind to its mistaken duties it deserves our compassion in a more particular manner we may however learn this lesson from it that since devotion it self which one would be apt to think could not be too warm may disorder the mind unless its heats are tempered with caution and prudence we should be particularly careful to keep our reason as cool as possible and to guard our selves in all parts of life against the influence of passion imagination and constitution  devotion when it does not lie under the check of reason is very apt to degenerate into enthusiasm when the mind finds herself very much inflamed with her devotions she is too much inclined to think they are not of her own kindling but blown up by something divine within her if she indulges this thought too far and humours the growing passion she at last flings her self into imaginary raptures and extasies and when once she fancies her self under the influence of a divine impulse it is no wonder if she slights human ordinances and refuses to comply with any established form of religion as thinking her self directed by a much superior guide  as enthusiasm is a kind of excess in devotion superstition is the excess not only of devotion but of religion in general according to an old heathen saying quoted by aulus gellius religentem esse oportet religiosum nefas a man should be religious not superstitious for as the author tells us nigidius observed upon this passage that the latin words which terminate in osus generally imply vicious characters and the having of any quality to an excess   an enthusiast in religion is like an obstinate clown a superstitious man like an insipid courtier enthusiasm has something in it of madness superstition of folly most of the sects that fall short of the church of england have in them strong tinctures of enthusiasm as the roman catholick religion is one huge overgrown body of childish and idle superstitions  the roman catholick church seems indeed irrecoverably lost in this particular if an absurd dress or behaviour be introduced in the world it will soon be found out and discarded on the contrary a habit or ceremony tho never so ridiculous which  has taken sanctuary in the church sticks in it for ever a gothic bishop perhaps thought it proper to repeat such a form in such particular shoes or slippers another fancied it would be very decent if such a part of publick devotions were performed with a mitre on his head and a crosier in his hand to this a brother vandal as wise as the others adds an antick dress which he conceived would allude very aptly to such and such mysteries till by degrees the whole office has degenerated into an empty show  their successors see the vanity and inconvenience of these ceremonies but instead of reforming perhaps add others which they think more significant and which take possession in the same manner and are never to be driven out after they have been once admitted i have seen the pope officiate at st peters where for two hours together he was busied in putting on or off his different accoutrements according to the different parts he was to act in them  nothing is so glorious in the eyes of mankind and ornamental to human nature setting aside the infinite advantages which  arise from it as a strong steady masculine piety but enthusiasm and superstition are the weaknesses of human reason that expose us to the scorn and derision of infidels and sink us even below the beasts that perish  idolatry may be looked upon as another error arising from mistaken devotion but because reflections on that subject would be of no use to an english reader i shall not enlarge upon it      footnote    that return to footnote mark

horret  hor   the other day as i passed along the street i saw a sturdy prenticeboy disputing with an hackneycoachman and in an instant upon some word of provocation throw off his hat and cutperiwig  clench his fist and strike the fellow a slap on the face at the same time calling him rascal and telling him he was a gentlemans son the young gentleman was it seems bound to a blacksmith and the debate arose about payment for some work done about a coach near which they fought his master during the combat was full of his boys praises and as he called to him to play with his hand and foot and throw in his head he made all us who stood round him of his party by declaring the boy had very good friends and he could trust him with untold gold as i am generally in the theory of mankind i could not but make my reflections upon the sudden popularity which was raised about the lad and perhaps with my friend tacitus fell into observations upon it which were too great for the occasion or ascribed this general favour to causes which had nothing to do towards it but the young blacksmiths being a gentleman was methought what created him good will from his present equality with the mob about him add to this that he was not so much a gentleman as not at the same time that he called himself such to use as rough methods for his defence as his antagonist the advantage of his having good friends as his master expressed it was not lazily urged but he shewed himself superior to the coachman in the personal qualities of courage and activity to confirm that of his being well allied before his birth was of any service to him  if one might moralize from this silly story a man would say that whatever advantages of fortune birth or any other good people possess above the rest of the world they should shew collateral eminences besides those distinctions or those distinctions will avail only to keep up common decencies and ceremonies and not to preserve a real place of favour or esteem in the opinion and common sense of their fellowcreatures  the folly of peoples procedure in imagining that nothing more is necessary than property and superior circumstances to support them in distinction appears in no way so much as in the domestick part of life it is ordinary to feed their humours into unnatural excrescences if i may so speak and make their whole being a wayward and uneasy condition for want of the obvious reflection that all parts of human life is a commerce it is not only paying wages and giving commands that constitutes a master of a family but prudence equal behaviour with readiness to protect and cherish them is what entitles a man to that character in their very hearts and sentiments it is pleasant enough to observe that men expect from their dependants from their sole motive of fear all the good effects which a liberal education and affluent fortune and every other advantage cannot produce in themselves a man will have his servant just diligent sober and chaste for no other reasons but the terrour of losing his masters favour when all the laws divine and human cannot keep him whom he serves within bounds with relation to any one of those virtues but both in great and ordinary affairs all superiority which is not founded on merit and virtue is supported only by artifice and stratagem thus you see flatterers are the agents in families of humourists and those who govern themselves by any thing but reason makebates distant relations poor kinsmen and indigent followers are the fry which support the œconomy of an humoursome rich man he is eternally whispered with intelligence of who are true or false to him in matters of no consequence and he maintains twenty friends to defend him against the insinuations of one who would perhaps cheat him of an old coat  i shall not enter into farther speculation upon this subject at present but think the following letters and petition are made up of proper sentiments on this occasion mr spectator  i am a servant to an old lady who is governed by one she calls her friend who is so familiar an one that she takes upon her to advise her without being called to it and makes her uneasie with all about her pray sir be pleased to give us some remarks upon voluntary counsellors and let these people know that to give any body advice is to say to that person i am your betters pray sir as near as you can describe that eternal flirt and disturber of families mrs taperty who is always visiting and putting people in a way as they call it if you can make her stay at home one evening you will be a general benefactor to all the ladies women in town and particularly to  your loving friend  susan civil     mr spectator  i am a footman and live with one of those men each of whom is said to be one of the best humoured men in the world but that he is passionate pray be pleased to inform them that he who is passionate and takes no care to command his hastiness does more injury to his friends and servants in one half hour than whole years can attone for this master of mine who is the best man alive in common fame disobliges some body every day he lives and strikes me for the next thing i do because he is out of humour at it if these gentlemen knew  that they do all the mischief that is ever done in conversation they would reform and i who have been a spectator of gentlemen at dinner for many years have seen that indiscretion does ten times more mischief than illnature but you will represent this better than your abused  humble servant  thomas smoaky     to the spectator  the humble petition of john steward robert butler harry cook and abigail chambers in behalf of themselves and their relations belonging to and dispersed in the several services of most of the great families within the cities of london and westminster  sheweth  that in many of the families in which your petitioners live and are employed the several heads of them are wholly unacquainted with what is business and are very little judges when they are well or ill used by us your said petitioners  that for want of such skill in their own affairs and by indulgence of their own laziness and pride they continually keep about them certain mischievous animals called spies  that whenever a spy is entertained the peace of that house is from that moment banished  that spies never give an account of good services but represent our mirth and freedom by the words wantonness and disorder  that in all families where there are spies there is a general jealousy and misunderstanding  that the masters and mistresses of such houses live in continual suspicion of their ingenuous and true servants and are given up to the management of those who are false and perfidious  that such masters and mistresses who entertain spies are no longer more than cyphers in their own families and that we your petitioners are with great disdain obliged to pay all our respect and expect all our maintenance from such spies  your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that you would represent the premises to all persons of condition and your petitioners as in duty bound shall for ever pray c  t
