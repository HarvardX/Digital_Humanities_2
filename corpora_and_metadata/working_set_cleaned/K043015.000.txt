the rivals a comedy  price one shilling and sixpence  the rivals a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in covent garden  london printed for john wilkie no    st pauls churchyard mdcclxxv  preface a preface to a play seems generally to be considered as a kind of closetprologue in which  if his piece has been successful  the author solicits that indulgence from the reader which he had before experienced from the audience but as the scope and immediate object of a play is to please a mixed assembly in representation whose judgment in the theater at least is decisive its degree of reputation is usually as determined as public before it can be prepared for the cooler tribunal of the study thus any farther solicitude on the part of the writer becomes unnecessary at least if not an intrusion and if the piece has been condemned in the performance i fear an address to the closet like an appeal to posterity is constantly regarded as the procrastination of a suit from a consciousness of the weakness of the cause from these considerations the following comedy would certainly have been submitted to the reader without any further introduction than what it had in the representation but that its success has probably been founded on a circumstance which the author is informed has not before attended a theatrical trial and which consequently ought not to pass unnoticed  i need scarcely add that the circumstance alluded to was the withdrawing of the piece to remove those imperfections in the first representation which were too obvious to escape reprehension and too numerous to admit of a hasty correction there are few writers i believe who even in the fullest consciousness of error do not wish to palliate the faults which they acknowledge and however trifling the performance to second their confession of its deficiencies by whatever plea seems least disgraceful to their ability in the present instance it cannot be said to amount either to candor or modesty in me to acknowledge an extreme inexperience and want of judgment on matters in which without guidance from practice or spur from success a young man should scarcely boast of being an adept if it be said that under such disadvantages no one should attempt to write a play  i must beg leave to dissent from the position while the first point of experience that i have gained on the subject is a knowledge of the candor and judgment with which an impartial public distinguishes between the errors of inexperience and incapacity and the indulgence which it shows even to a disposition to remedy the defects of either  it were unnecessary to enter into any farther extenuation of what was thought exceptionable in this play but that it has been said that the managers should have prevented some of the defects before its appearance to the public  and in particular the uncommon length of the piece as represented the first night  it were an ill return for the most liberal and gentlemanly conduct on their side to suffer any censure to rest where none was deserved hurry in writing has long been exploded as an excuse for an author  however in the dramatic line it may happen that both an author and a manager may wish to fill a chasm in the entertainment of the public with a hastiness not altogether culpable the season was advanced when i first put the play into mr harriss hands  it was at that time at least double the length of any acting comedy  i profited by his judgment and experience in the curtailing of it  till i believe his feeling for the vanity of a young author got the better of his desire for correctness and he left many excrescences remaining because he had assisted in pruning so many more hence though i was not uninformed that the acts were still too long i flattered myself that after the first trial i might with safer judgment proceed to remove what should appear to have been most dissatisfactory  many other errors there were which might in part have arisen from my being by no means conversant with plays in general either in reading or at the theater  yet i own that in one respect i did not regret my ignorance for as my first wish in attempting a play was to avoid every appearance of plagiary i thought i should stand a better chance of effecting this from being in a walk which i had not frequented and where consequently the progress of invention was less likely to be interrupted by starts of recollection for on subjects on which the mind has been much informed invention is slow of exerting itself  faded ideas float in the fancy like halfforgotten dreams and the imagination in its fullest enjoyments becomes suspicious of its offspring and doubts whether it has created or adopted  with regard to some particular passages which on the first nights representation seemed generally disliked i confess that if i felt any emotion of surprise at the disapprobation it was not that they were disapproved of but that i had not before perceived that they deserved it as some part of the attack on the piece was begun too early to pass for the sentence of judgment which is ever tardy in condemning it has been suggested to me that much of the disapprobation must have arisen from virulence of malice rather than severity of criticism but as i was more apprehensive of there being just grounds to excite the latter than conscious of having deserved the former i continue not to believe that probable which i am sure must have been unprovoked however if it was so and i could even mark the quarter from whence it came it would be ungenerous to retort for no passion suffers more than malice from disappointment for my own part i see no reason why the author of a play should not regard a first nights audience as a candid and judicious friend attending in behalf of the public at his last rehearsal if he can dispense with flattery he is sure at least of sincerity and even though the annotation be rude he may rely upon the justness of the comment considered in this light that audience whose fiat is essential to the poets claim whether his object be fame or profit has surely a right to expect some deference to its opinion from principles of politeness at least if not from gratitude  as for the little puny critics who scatter their peevish strictures in private circles and scribble at every author who has the eminence of being unconnected with them as they are usually spleenswoln from a vain idea of increasing their consequence there will always be found a petulance and illiberality in their remarks which should place them as far beneath the notice of a gentleman as their original dullness had sunk them from the level of the most unsuccessful author  it is not without pleasure that i catch at an opportunity of justifying myself from the charge of intending any national reflection in the character of sir lucius otrigger if any gentlemen opposed the piece from that idea i thank them sincerely for their opposition and if the condemnation of this comedy however misconceived the provocation could have added one spark to the decaying flame of national attachment to the country supposed to be reflected on i should have been happy in its fate and might with truth have boasted that it had done more real service in its failure than the successful morality of a thousand stagenovels will ever effect  it is usual i believe to thank the performers in a new play for the exertion of their several abilities but where as in this instance their merit has been so striking and uncontroverted as to call for the warmest and truest applause from a number of judicious audiences the poets afterpraise comes like the feeble acclamation of a child to close the shouts of a multitude the conduct however of the principals in a theater cannot be so apparent to the public  i think it therefore but justice to declare that from this theater the only one i can speak of from experience those writers who wish to try the dramatic line will meet with that candor and liberal attention which are generally allowed to be better calculated to lead genius into excellence than either the precepts of judgment or the guidance of experience  the author  prologue by the author spoken by mr woodward and mr quick enter sergeant at law and attorney serj what is here  a vile cramp hand i cannot see without my

is sir anthony here   jul he is  we are arrived within this hour  and i suppose he will be here to wait on mrs malaprop as soon as he is dressed   lyd then before we are interrupted let me impart to you some of my distress  i know your gentle nature will sympathize with me though your prudence may condemn me  my letters have informed you of my whole connection with beverley  but i have lost him julia  my aunt has discovered our intercourse by a note she intercepted and has confined me ever since  yet would you believe it she has fallen absolutely in love with a tall irish baronet she met one night since we have been here at lady macshuffles rout   jul you jest lydia   lyd no upon my word  she absolutely carries on a kind of correspondence with him under a feigned name though till she chooses to be known to him  but it is a delia or a celia i assure you   jul then surely she is now more indulgent to her niece   lyd quite the contrary since she has discovered her own frailty she is become more suspicious of mine then i must inform you of another plague  that odious acres is to be in bath today so that i protest i shall be teased out of all spirits   jul come come lydia hope the best  sir anthony shall use his interest with mrs malaprop   lyd but you have not heard the worst unfortunately i had quarreled with my poor beverley just before my aunt made the discovery and i have not seen him since to make it up   jul what was his offense   lyd nothing at all  but i dont know how it was as often as we had been together we had never had a quarrel  and somehow i was afraid he would never give me an opportunity  so last thursday i wrote a letter to myself to inform myself that beverley was at that time paying his addresses to another woman  i signed it your friend unknown showed it to beverley charged him with his falsehood put myself in a violent passion and vowed i would never see him more   jul and you let him depart so and have not seen him since   lyd twas the next day my aunt found the matter out i intended only to have teased him three days and a half and now i have lost him for ever   jul if he is as deserving and sincere as you have representd him to me he will never give you up so yet consider lydia you tell me he is but an ensign and you have thirty thousand pounds   lyd but you know i lose most of my fortune if i marry without my aunts consent till of age and that is what i have determined to do ever since i knew the penalty  nor could i love the man who would wish to wait a day for the alternative   jul nay this is caprice   lyd what does julia tax me with caprice  i thought her lover faulkland had enured her to it   jul i do not love even his faults   lyd but apropos  you have sent to him i suppose   jul not yet upon my word  nor has he the least idea of my being in bath  sir anthonys resolution was so sudden i could not inform him of it   lyd well julia you are your own mistress though under the protection of sir anthony yet have you for this long year been the slave to the caprice the whim the jealousy of this ungrateful faulkland who will ever delay assuming the right of a husband while you suffer him to be equally imperious as a lover   jul nay you are wrong entirely  we were contracted before my fathers death  that and some consequent embarrassments have delayed what i know to be my faulklands most ardent wish  he is too generous to trifle on such a point  and for his character you wrong him there too  no lydia he is too proud too noble to be jealous if he is captious it is without dissembling if fretful without rudeness  unused to the soppery of love he is negligent of the little duties expected from a lover  but being unhackneyd in the passion his love is ardent and sincere and as it engrosses his whole soul he expects every thought and emotion of his mistress to move in unison with his  yet though his pride calls for this full return  his humility makes him undervalue those qualities in him which should entitle him to it and not feeling why he should be loved to the degree he wishes he still suspects that he is not loved enough  this temper i must own has cost me many unhappy hours but i have learned to think myself his debtor for those imperfections which arise from the ardour of his love   lyd well i cannot blame you for defending him  but tell me heartily julia had he never saved your life do you think you should have been attached to him as you are  believe me the rude blast that overset your boat was a prosperous gale of love to him   jul gratitude may have strengthened my attachment to mr faulkland but i loved him before he had preserved me yet surely that alone were an obligation sufficient   lyd obligation  why a waterspaniel would have done as much  well i should never think of giving my heart to a man because he could swim   jul come lydia you are too inconsiderate   lyd nay i do but jest  what is here   enter lucy in a hurry lucy o maam here is sir anthony

is that you will promise to forget this fellow  to illiterate him i say quite from your memory   lyd ah madam our memories are independent of our wills  it is not so easy to forget   mrs mal but i say it is miss there is nothing on earth so easy as to forget if a person chooses to set about it  i am sure i have as much forgot your poor dear uncle as if he had never existed  and i thought it my duty so to do and let me tell you lydia these violent memories dont become a young woman   sir anth why sure she will not pretend to remember what she is ordered not  aye this comes of her reading   lyd what crime madam have i committed to be treated thus   mrs mal now dont attempt to extirpate yourself from the matter you know i have proof controvertible of it  but tell me will you promise to do as youre bid  will you take a husband of your friends choosing   lyd madam i must tell you plainly that had i no preference for any one else the choice you have made would be my aversion   mrs mal what business have you miss with preference and aversion they dont become a young woman and you ought to know that as both always wear off it is safest in matrimony to begin with a little aversion i am sure i hated your poor dear uncle before marriage as if he would been a blackamoor  and yet miss you are sensible what a wife i made  and when it pleased heaven to release me from him it is unknown what tears i shed  but suppose we were going to give you another choice will you promise us to give up this beverley   lyd could i belie my thoughts so far as to give that promise my actions would certainly as far belie my words   mrs mal take yourself to your room  you are fit company for nothing but your own illhumours   lyd willingly maam  i cannot change for the worse    exit lydia mrs mal there is a little intricate hussy for you   sir anth it is not to be wondered at maam  all this is the natural consequence of teaching girls to read  had i a thousand daughters by heavens i would as soon have them taught the blackart as their alphabet   mrs mal nay nay sir anthony you are an absolute misanthropy   sir anth in my way hither mrs malaprop i observed your nieces maid coming forth from a circulating library  she had a book in each hand  they were halfbound volumes with marbled covers  from that moment i guessed how full of duty i should see her mistress   mrs mal those are vile places indeed   sir anth madam a circulating library in a town is as an evergreen tree of diabolical knowledge  it blossoms through the year  and depend on it mrs malaprop that they who are so fond of handling the leaves will long for the fruit at last   mrs mal well but sir anthony your wife lady absolute was fond of books   sir anth aye  and injury sufficient they were to her madam  but were i to choose another helpmate the extent of her erudition should consist in her knowing her simple letters without their mischievous combinations  and the summit of her science be  her ability to count as far as twenty  the first mrs malaprop would enable her to work a a upon my linen  and the latter would be quite sufficient to prevent her giving me a shirt no   and a stock no     mrs mal fie fie sir anthony you surely speak laconically   sir anth why mrs malaprop in moderation now what would you have a woman know   mrs mal observe me sir anthony  i would by no means wish a daughter of mine to be a progeny of learning i dont think so much learning becomes a young woman for instance  i would never let her meddle with greek or hebrew or algebra or simony or fluxions or paradoxes or such inflammatory branches of learning  neither would it be necessary for her to handle any of your mathematical astronomical diabolical instruments  but sir anthony i would send her at nine years old to a boardingschool in order to learn a little ingenuity and artifice  then sir she should have a supercilious knowledge in accounts  and as she grew up i would have her instructed in geometry that she might know something of the contagious countries  but above all sir anthony she should be mistress of orthodoxy that she might not misspell and mispronounce words so shamefully as girls usually do and likewise that she might reprehend the true meaning of what she is saying  this sir anthony is what i would have a woman know  and i dont think there is a superstitious article in it   sir anth well well mrs malaprop i will dispute the point no further with you though i must confess that you are a truly moderate and polite arguer for almost every third word you say is on my side of the question  but mrs malaprop to the more important point in debate  you say you have no objection to my proposal   mrs mal none i assure you  i am under no positive engagement with mr acres and as lydia is so obstinate against him perhaps your son may have better success   sir anth well madam i will write for the boy directly  he knows not a syllable of this yet though i have for some time had the proposal in my head he is at present with his regiment   mrs mal we have never seen your son sir anthony but i hope no objection on his side   sir anth objection  let him object if he dare  no no mrs malaprop jack knows that the least demur puts me in a frenzy directly  my process was always very simple  in their younger days twas jack do this  if he demurd  i knocked him down  and if he grumbled at that  i always sent him out of the room   mrs mal aye and the properest way of my conscience  nothing is so conciliating to young people as severity  well sir anthony i shall give mr acres his discharge and prepare lydia to receive your sons invocations  and i hope you will represent her to the captain as an object not altogether illegible   sir anth madam i will handle the subject prudently  well i must leave you  and let me beg you mrs malaprop to enforce this matter roundly to the girl  take my advice  keep a tight hand  if she rejects this proposal  clap her under lock and key  and if you were just to let the servants forget to bring her dinner for three or four days you cannot conceive how she would come about   exit sir anth mrs mal well at any rate i shall be glad to get her from under my intuition  she has somehow discovered my partiality for sir lucius otrigger  sure lucy cannot have betrayed me  no the girl is such a simpleton i should have made her confess it  lucy  lucy   calls had she been one of your artificial ones i should never have trusted her   enter lucy lucy did you call maam   mrs mal yes girl  did you see sir lucius while you was out   lucy no indeed maam not a glimpse of him   mrs mal you are sure lucy that you never mentioned    lucy o gemini i would sooner cut my tongue out   mrs mal well dont let your simplicity be imposed on   lucy no maam   mrs mal so come to me presently and i will give you another letter to sir lucius  but mind lucy  if ever you betray what you are entrusted with  unless it be other peoples secrets to me you forfeit my malevolence for ever  and your being a simpleton shall be no excuse for your locality    exit mrs malaprop lucy ha ha ha  so my dear simplicity let me give you a little respite   altering her manner  let girls in my station be as fond as they please of appearing expert and knowing in their trusts  commend me to a mask of silliness and a pair of sharp eyes for my own interest under it  let me see to what account i have turned my simplicity lately   looks at a paper for abetting miss lydia languish in a design of running away with an ensign  in money  sundry times  twelve pound twelve  gowns five  hats ruffles caps etc etc  numberless  from the said ensign within this last month six guineas and a half  about a quarters pay  item from mrs malaprop for betraying the young people to her  when i found matters were likely to be discovered  two guineas and a black paduasoy  item from mr acres for carrying diverse letters  which i never delivered  two guineas and a pair of buckles  item

scholar i assure you  says that there is no meaning in the common oaths and that nothing but their antiquity makes them respectable  because he says the ancients would never stick to an oath or two but would say by jove or by bacchus or by mars or by venus or by pallas according to the sentiment  so that to swear with propriety says my little major the oath should be an echo to the sense and this we call the oath referential or sentimental swearing  ha ha ha it is genteel is not it   abs very genteel and very new indeed  and i dare say will supplant all other figures of imprecation

think a woman the worse for being handsome but sir if you please to recollect you before hinted something about a hump or two one eye and a few more graces of that kind  now without being very nice i own i should rather choose a wife of mine to have the usual number of limbs and a limited quantity of back and though one eye may be very agreeable yet as the prejudice has always run in favor of two i would not wish to affect a singularity in that article   sir anth what a phlegmatic sot it is why sirrah youre an anchorite  a vile insensible stock  you a soldier  youre a walking block fit only to dust the companys regiment on  odds life i have a great mind to marry the girl myself   abs i am entirely at your disposal sir if you should think of addressing miss anguish yourself i suppose you would have me marry the aunt or if you should change youre mind and take the old lady  it is the same to me  i will marry the niece   sir anth upon my word jack you are either a very great hypocritie or  but come i know your indifference on such a subject must be all a lie  i am sure it must  come now  d  n your demure face  come confess jack  you have been lying  have not you you have been lying hey i will never forgive you if you have not  so now own my dear jack you have been playing the hypocrite hey  i will never forgive you if you have not been lying and playing the hypocrite   abs i am

solus faulk they told me julia would return directly wonder she is not yet come  how mean does this captious unsatisfied temper of mine appear to my cooler judgment yet i know not that i indulge it in any other point  but on this one subject and to this one object whom i think i love beyond my life i am ever ungenerously fretful and madly capricious  i am conscious of it  yet i cannot correct myself what tender honest joy sparkled in her eyes when we met  how delicate was the warmth of her expressions  i was ashamed to appear less happy  though i had come resolved to wear a face of coolness and upbraiding sir anthonys presence prevented my proposed expostulations  yet i must be satisfied that she has not been so very happy in my absence  she is coming  yes  i know the nimbleness of her tread when she thinks her impatient faulkland counts the moments of her stay   enter julia jul i had not hoped to see you again so soon   faulk could i julia be contented with my first welcome  restrained as we were by the presence of a third person   jul o faulkland when your kindness can make me thus happy let me not think that i discovered more coolness in your first salutation than my longhoarded joy could have presaged   faulk twas but your fancy julia  i was rejoiced to see you  to see you in such health  sure i had no cause for coldness   jul nay then i see you have taken something ill  you must not conceal from me what it is   faulk well then  shall i own to you  but you will despise me julia  nay i despise myself for it  yet i will own that my joy at hearing of your health and arrival here by your neighbor acres was something damped by his dwelling much on the high spirits you had enjoyed in devonshire  on your mirth  your singing  dancing and i know not what  for such is my temper julia that i should regard every mirthful moment in your absence as a treason to constancy  the mutual tear that steals down the cheek of parting lovers is a compact that no smile shall live there till they meet again   jul must i never cease to tax my faulkland with this teasing minute caprice  can the idle reports of a silly boor weigh in your breast against my tried affection   faulk they have no weight with me julia no no  i am happy if you have been so  yet only say that you did not sing with mirth  say that you thought of faulkland in the dance   jul i never can be happy in your absence  if i wear a countenance of content it is to show that my mind holds no doubt of my faulklands truth  if i seemed sad  it were to make malice triumph and say that i had fixed my heart on one who left me to lament his roving and my own credulity  believe me faulkland i mean not to upbraid you when i say that i have often dressed sorrow in smiles lest my friends should guess whose unkindness had caused my tears   faulk you were ever all goodness to me  o i am a brute when i but admit a doubt of your true constancy   jul if ever without such cause from you as i will not suppose possible you find my affections veering but a point may i become a proverbial scoff for levity and base ingratitude   faulk ah julia that last word is grating to me i would i had no title to your gratitude search your heart julia perhaps what you have mistaken for love is but the warm effusion of a too thankful heart   jul for what quality must i love you   faulk for no quality to regard me for any quality of mind or understanding were only to esteem me and for person  i have often wished myself deformed to be convinced that i owed no obligation there for any part of your affection   jul where nature has bestowed a show of nice attention in the features of a man he should laugh at it as misplaced i have seen men who in this vain article perhaps might rank above you but my heart has never asked my eyes if it were so or not   faulk now this is not well from you julia  i despise person in a man  yet if you loved me as i wish though i were an aethiop you would think none so fair   jul i see you are determined to be unkind  the contract which my poor father bound us in gives you more than a lovers privilege   faulk again julia you raise ideas that feed and justify my doubts  i would not have been more free  no  i am proud of my restraint  yet  yet  perhaps your high respect alone for this solemn compact has fettered your inclinations which else had made worthier choice  how shall i be sure had you remained unbound in thought and promise that i should still have been the object of your persevering love   jul then try me now  let us be free as strangers as to what is past  my heart will not feel more liberty   faulk there now so hasty julia so anxious to be free  if your love for me were fixed and ardent you would not loose your hold even though i wished it   jul o you torture me to the heart  i cannot bear it   faulk i do not mean to distress you  if i loved you less i should never give you an uneasy moment  but hear me  all my fretful doubts arise from this  women are not used to weigh and separate the motives of their affections  the cold dictates of prudence gratitude or filial duty may sometimes be mistaken for the pleadings of the heart  i would not boast  yet let me say that i have neither age person or character to found dislike on  my fortune such as few ladies could be charged with indiscretion in the match  o julia when love receives such countenance from prudence nice minds will be suspicious of its birth   jul i know not whither your insinuations would tend  as they seem pressing to insult me  i will spare you the regret of having done so  i have given you no cause for this   exit in tears faulk in tears stay julia stay but for a moment  the door is fastened  julia  my soul  but for one moment  i hear her sobbing  sdeath what a brute am i to use her thus yet stay  aye  she is coming now  how little resolution there is in woman  how a few soft words can turn them  no faith  she is not coming either  why julia  my love  say but that you forgive me  come but to tell me that  now this is being too resentful  stay she is coming too  i thought she would  no steadiness in any thing her going away must have been a mere trick then  she shant see that i was hurt by it  i will affect indifference   hums a tune then listens  no  z  ds she is not coming  nor dont intend it i suppose  this is not steadiness but obstinacy yet i deserve it  what after so long an absence to quarrel with her tenderness  twas barbarous and unmanly  i should be ashamed to see her now  i will wait till her just resentment is abated  and when i distress her so again may i lose her for ever and be linked instead to some antique virago whose knawing passions and longhoarded spleen shall make me curse my folly half the day and all the night   exit scene iii mrs malaprops lodgings mrs malaprop and captain absolute mrs mal your being sir anthonys son captain would itself be a sufficient accommodation  but from the ingenuity of your appearance i am convinced you deserve the character here given of you   abs permit me to say madam that as i never yet have had the pleasure of seeing miss languish my principal inducement in this affair at present is the honor of being allied to mrs malaprop of whose intellectual accomplishments elegant manners and unaffected learning no tongue is silent   mrs mal sir you do me infinite honor  i beg captain you will be seated   sit  ah few gentlemen now a days know how to value the ineffectual qualities in a woman few think how a little knowledge become a gentlewoman men have no sense now but for the worthless flower beauty   abs it is but too true indeed maam  yet i fear our ladies should share the blame  they think our admiration of beauty so great that knowledge in them would be superfluous thus like gardentrees they seldom show fruits till time has robbed them of the more specious blossom  few like mrs malaprop and the orangetree are rich in both at once   mrs mal sir  you overpower me with goodbreeding  he is the very pineapple of politeness you are not ignorant captain that this giddy girl has somehow contrived to fix her affections on a beggarly strolling evesdropping ensign whom none of us have seen and nobody knows any thing of   abs o i have heard the silly affair before  i am not at all prejudiced against her on that account   mrs mal you are very good and very considerate captain  i am sure i have done every thing in my power since i exploded the affair long ago i laid my positive conjunction on her never to think on the fellow again  i have since laid sir anthonys preposition before her  but i am sorry to say she seems resolved to decline every particle that i enjoin her   abs it must be very distressing indeed maam   mrs mal it gives me the hydrostatics to such a degree  i thought she had persisted from corresponding with him but behold this very day i have interceded another letter from the fellow i believe i have it in my pocket   abs o the devil my last note   aside mrs mal aye here it is   abs aye my note indeed o the little traitress lucy   aside mrs mal there perhaps you may know the writing   gives him the letter abs i think i have seen the hand before  yes i certainly must have seen this hand before    mrs mal nay but read it captain   abs reads my souls idol my adored lydia  very tender indeed   mrs mal tender aye and profane too of my conscience   abs i am excessively alarmed at the intelligence you send me the more so as my new rival    mrs mal that is you sir  has universally the character of being an accomplished gentleman and a man of honor  well that is handsome enough   mrs mal o the fellow had some design in writing so    abs that he had i will answer for him maam   mrs mal but go on sir  you will see presently   abs as for the old weatherbeaten shedragon who guards you  who can he mean by that   mrs mal me sir  me  he means me there  what do you think now  but go on a little further   abs impudent scoundrel  it shall go hard but i will elude her vigilance as i am told that the same ridiculous vanity which makes her dress up her coarse features and deck her dull chat with hard words which she dont understand    mrs mal there sir an attack upon my language what do you think of that  an aspersion upon my parts of speech was ever such a brute save if i reprehend any thing in this world it is the use of my oracular tongue and a nice derangement of epitaphs   abs he deserves to be hanged and quartered let me see  same ridiculous vanity    mrs mal you need not read it again sir   abs i beg pardon maam does also lay her open to the grossest deceptions from flattery and pretended admiration  an impudent coxcomb so that i have a scheme to see you shortly with the old harridans consent and even to make her a go between in our interviews  was ever such assurance   mrs mal did you ever hear any thing like it  he will elude my vigilance will he  yes yes ha ha he is very likely to enter these floors  well try who can plot best   abs ha ha had a conceited puppy ha ha ha  well but mrs malaprop as the girl seems so infatuated by this fellow suppose you were to wink at her corresponding with him for a little time  let her even plot an elopement with him  then do you connive at her escape  while i just in the nick will have the fellow laid by the heels and fairly contrive to carry her off in his stead   mrs mal i am delighted with the scheme never was any thing better perpetrated   abs but pray could not i see the lady for a few minutes now  i should like to try her temper a little   mrs mal why i dont know  i doubt she is not prepared for a first visit of this kind  there is a decorum in these matters   abs o lord she will not mind me  only tell her beverley    mrs mal sir    abs gently good tongue   aside mrs mal what did you say of beverley   abs o i was going to propose that you should tell her by way of jest that it was beverley who was below  she would come down fast enough then  ha ha ha   mrs mal twould be a trick she welldeserves  besides you know the fellow tells her he will get my consent to see her  ha ha  let him if he can i say again  lydia come down here  calling  he will make me a gobetween in their interviews  ha ha ha come down i say lydia  i dont wonder at your laughing ha ha ha his impudence is truly ridiculous   abs it is very ridiculous upon my soul maam ha ha ha   mrs mal the little hussy will not hear  well i will go and tell her at once who it is  she shall know that capt absolute is come to wait on her  and i will make her behave as becomes a young woman   abs as you please maam   mrs mal for the present captain your servant  ah you have not done laughing yet i see  elude my vigilance yes yes ha ha ha   exit abs ha ha ha one would think now that i might throw off all disguise at once and seize my prize with security  but such is lydias caprice that to undeceive were probably to lose her  i will see whether she knows me   walks aside and seems engaged in looking at the pictures enter lydia lyd what a scene am i now to go through surely nothing can be more dreadful than to be obliged to listen to the loathsome addresses of a stranger to ones heart  i have heard of girls persecuted as i am who have appealed in behalf of their favored lover to the generosity of his rival suppose i were to try it  there stands the hated rival  an officer too  but o how unlike my beverley  i wonder he dont begin  truly he seems a very negligent wooer  quite at his ease upon my word i will speak first  mr absolute   abs madam   turns round lyd o heavens beverley   abs hush  hush my life  softly be not surprised   lyd i am so astonished and so terrified and so overjoyed  for heavens sake how came you here   abs briefly  i have deceived your aunt  i was informed that my new rival was to visit here this evening and contriving to have him kept away have passed myself on her for capt absolute   lyd o charming  and she really takes you for young absolute   abs o she is convinced of it   lyd ha ha ha i cannot forbear laughing to think how her sagacity is overreached   abs but we trifle with our precious moments  such another opportunity may not occur  then let me now conjure my kind my condescending angel to fix the time when i may rescue her from undeserved persecution and with a licensed warmth plead for my reward   lyd will you then beverley consent to forfeit that portion of my paltry wealth  that burden on the wings of love   abs o come to me  rich only thus  in loveliness  bring no portion to me but thy love  twill be generous in you lydia  for well you know it is the only dower your poor beverley can repay   lyd how persuasive are his words  how charming will poverty be with him   abs ah my soul what a life will we then live love shall be our idol and support we will worship him with a monastic strictness abjuring all worldly toys to center every thought and action there  proud of calamity we will enjoy the wreck of wealth while the surrounding gloom of adversity shall make the flame of our pure love show doubly bright  by heavens i would fling all goods of fortune from me with a prodigal hand to enjoy the scene where i might clasp my lydia to my bosom and say the world affords no smile to me  but here   embracing her if she holds out now the devil is in it   aside lyd now could i fly with him to the antipodes but my persecution is not yet come to a crisis   enter mrs malaprop listening mrs mal i am impatient to know how the little huzzy deports herself  aside abs so pensive lydia  is then your warmth abated   mrs mal warmth abated  so  she has been in a passion i suppose   lyd no  nor ever can while i have life   mrs mal an illtemperd little devil  she will be in a passion all her life  will she   lyd think not the idle threats of my ridiculous aunt can ever have any weight with me   mrs mal very dutiful upon my word   lyd let her choice be capt absolute but beverley is mine   mrs mal i am astonished at her assurance  to his face  this to his face   abs thus then let me enforce my suit   kneeling mrs mal aye  poor young man  down on his knees entreating for pity  i can contain no longer  why huzzy huzzy  i have overheard you   abs o confound her vigilance   aside mrs mal capt absolute  i know not how to apologize for her shocking rudeness   abs so  all is safe i find  aside i have hopes madam that time will bring the young lady    mrs mal o there is nothing to be hoped for from her she is as headstrong as an allegory on the banks of nile   lyd nay madam what do you charge me with now   mrs mal why thou unblushing rebel  didnt you tell this gentleman to his face that you loved another better  didnt you say you never would be his   lyd no madam  i did not   mrs mal good heavens what assurance  lydia lydia you ought to know that lying dont become a young woman  didnt you boast that beverley  that stroller beverley possessed your heart  tell me that i say   lyd it is true maam and none but beverley    mrs mal hold  hold assurance  you shall not be so rude   abs nay pray mrs malaprop dont stop the young ladys speech  she is very welcome to talk thus  it does not hurt me in the least i assure you   mrs mal you are too good captain  too amiably patient  but come with me miss  let us see you again soon captain  remember

had not been for a little rogue of a major who ran away with her before she could get a sight of me  and i wonder too what it is the ladies can see in them to be so fond of them  unless it be a touch

greatest pleasure in the world   sir luc o faith i am in the luck of it  i never could have found him in a sweeter temper for my purpose  to be sure i am just come in the nick now to enter into conversation with him and so quarrel genteelly sir lucius goes up to absolute  with regard to that matter captain i must beg leave to differ in opinion with you   abs upon my word then you must be a very subtle disputant  because sir i happened just then to be giving no opinion at all   sir luc that is no reason  for give me leave to tell you a man may think an untruth as well as speak one   abs very true sir but if the man never utters his thoughts i should think they might stand a chance of escaping controversy   sir luc then sir you differ in opinion with me which amounts to the same thing   abs harkee sir lucius  if i had not before known you to be a gentleman upon my soul i should not have discovered it at this interview  for what you can drive at unless you mean to quarrel with me i cannot conceive   sir luc i humbly thank you sir for the quickness of your apprehension bowing  you have named the very thing i would be at   abs very well sir  i shall certainly not baulk your inclinations  but i should be glad you would please to explain your motives   sir luc pray sir be easy  the quarrel is a very pretty quarrel as it stands  we should only spoil it by trying to explain it  however your memory is very short  or you could not have forgot an affront you passed on me within this week  so no more but name your time and place   abs well sir since you are so bent on it the sooner the better  let it be this evening  here by the springgardens  we shall scarcely be interrupted   sir luc faith that same interruption in affairs of this nature shows very great illbreeding  i dont know what is the reason but in england if a thing of this kind gets wind people make such a pother that a gentleman can never fight in peace and quietness  however if it is the same to you captain i should take it as a particular kindness if you would let us meet in kingsmeadfields as a little business will call me there about six oclock and i may dispatch both matters at once   abs it

be forfeited by this unhappy act  i know not whether it is so  but sure that alone can never make us unhappy  the little i have will be sufficient to support us and exile never should be splendid

folly by years of tender adoration   jul hold faulkland  that you are free from a crime which i before feared to name heaven knows how sincerely i rejoice  these are tears of thankfulness for that but

small fieldpieces upon my conscience mr acres you must leave those things to me  stay now  i will show you measures paces along the stage there now that is a very pretty distance  a pretty gentlemans distance   acres z  ds we might as well fight in a sentrybox  i tell you sir lucius the farther he is off the cooler i shall take my aim   sir luc faith then i suppose you would aim at him best of all if he was out of sight   acres no sir lucius  but i should think forty or eight and thirty yards    sir luc pho pho nonsense three or four feet between the mouths of your pistols is as good as a mile   acres odds bullets no  by my valor there is no merit in killing him so near  do my dear sir lucius let me bring him down at a long shot  a long shot sir lucius if you love me   sir luc well  the gentlemans friend and i must settle that  but tell me now mr acres in case of an accident is there any little will or commission i could execute for you   acres i am much obliged to you sir lucius  but i dont understand    sir luc why you may think there is no being shot at without a little risk  and if an unlucky bullet should carry a quietus with it  i say it will be no time then to be bothering you about family matters   acres a quietus   sir luc for instance now  if that should be the case  would you choose to be pickled and sent home  or would it be the same to you to lie here in the abbey  i am told there is very snug lying in the abbey   acres pickled  snug lying in the abbey  odds tremors sir lucius dont talk so   sir luc i suppose mr acres you never were engaged in an affair of this kind before   acres no sir lucius never before   sir luc ah that is a pity  there is nothing like being used to a thing  pray now how would you receive the gentlemans shot   acres odds files  i have practiced that  there sir lucius  there puts himself in an attitude  a sidefront hey  odd i will make myself small enough  i will stand edgeways   sir luc now  youre quite out  for if you stand so when i take my aim    levelling at him acres z  ds sir lucius  are you sure it is not cocked   sir luc never fear   acres but  but  you dont know  it may go off of its own head   sir luc pho be easy  well now if i hit you in the body my bullet has a double chance  for if it misses a vital part on your right side  twill be very hard if it dont succeed on the left   acres a vital part o my poor vitals   sir luc but there  fix yourself so  placing him let him see the broad side of your full front  there  now a ball or two may pass clear through your body and never do any harm at all   acres clean through me  a ball or two clean through me   sir luc aye  may they  and it is much the genteelest attitude into the bargain   acres lookee sir lucius  i would just as leive be shot in an awkward posture as a genteel one  so by my valor i will stand edgeways   sir luc  looking at his watch sure they dont mean to disappoint us  hah  no faith  i think i see them coming   acres hey  what  coming    sir luc aye  who are those yonder getting over the style   acres there are two of them indeed  well  let them come  hey sir lucius  we  we  we  we  will not run    sir luc run   acres no  i say  we will not run by my valor   sir luc what the devils the matter with you   acres nothing  nothing  my dear friend  my dear sir lucius  but  iii dont feel quite so bold somehow  as i did   sir luc o fie  consider your honor   acres aye  true  my honor  do sir lucius hedge in a word or two every now and then about my honor   sir luc well here they are coming  looking acres sir lucius  if i want with you i should almost think i was afraid  if my valor should leave me  valor will come and go   sir luc then pray keep it fast while you have it   acres sir lucius  i doubt it is going  yes  my valor is certainly going  it is sneaking off  i feel it oozing out as it were at the palms of my hands   sir luc your honor  your honor  here they are   acres o mercy  now  that i were safe at clodhall or could be shot before i was aware   enter faulkland and absolute sir luc gentlemen your most obedient  hah  what captain absolute  so i suppose sir you are come here just like myself  to do a kind office first for your friend  then to proceed to business on your own account   acres what jack  my dear jack  my dear friend   abs hearkee bob beverleys at hand   sir luc well mr acres  i dont blame your saluting the gentleman civilly  so mr beverley  to faulkland if you will choose your weapons the captain and i will measure the ground   faulk my weapons sir   acres odds life sir lucius i am not going to fight mr faulkland these are my particular friends   sir luc what sir did not you come here to fight mr acres   faulk not i upon my word sir   sir luc well now that is mighty provoking but i hope mr faulkland as there are three of us come on purpose for the game  you will not be so cantanckerous as to spoil the party by sitting out   abs o pray faulkland fight to oblige sir lucius   faulk nay if mr acres is so bent on the matter   acres no no mr faulkland  i will bear my disappointment like a christian  lookee sir lucius there is no occasion at all for me to fight and if it is the same to you i would as lieve let it alone   sir luc observe me mr acres  i must not be trifled with you have certainly challenged somebody  and you came here to fight him  now if that gentleman is willing to represent him  i cannot see for my soul why it is not just the same thing   acres z  ds sir lucius  i tell you it is one beverley i have challenged  a fellow you see that dare not show his face if he were here i would make him give up his pretensions directly    abs hold bob  let me set you right  there is no such man as beverley in the case  the person who assumed that name is before you and as his pretensions are the same in both characters he is ready to support them in whatever way you please   sir luc well this is lucky  now you have an opportunity    acres what quarrel with my dear friend jack absolute  not if he were fifty beverleys z  ds sir lucius you would not have me be so unnatural   sir luc upon my conscience mr acres your valor has oozed away with a vengeance   acres not in the least odds backs and abettors i will be your second with all my heart  and if you should get a quietus you may command me entirely i will get you a snug lying in the abbey here or pickle you and send you over to blunderbusshall or any of the kind with the greatest pleasure   sir luc pho pho you are little better than a coward   acres mind gentlemen he calls me a coward coward was the word by my valor   sir luc well sir   acres lookee sir lucius tisnt that i mind the word coward  coward may be said in joke  but if you had called me a poltroon odds daggers and balls   sir luc well sir   acres  i should have thought you a very illbred man   sir luc pho you are beneath my notice   abs nay sir lucius you cannot have a better second than my friend acres  he is a most determined dog  called in the country fighting bob  he generally kills a man a week dont you bob   acres aye  at home   sir luc well then captain it is we must begin  so come out my little counselor draws his sword and ask the gentleman whether he will resign the lady without forcing you to proceed against him   abs come on then sir  draws since you will not let it be an amicable suit here is my reply    enter sir anthony david and the women david knock em all down sweet sir anthony knock down my master in particular  and bind his hands over to their good behavior   sir anth put up jack put up or i shall be in a frenzy  how came you in a duel sir   abs faith sir that gentleman can tell you better than i twas he called on me and you know sir i serve his majesty   sir anth here is a pretty fellow i catch him going to cut a mans throat and he tells me he serves his majesty  zounds sirrah then how durst you draw the kings sword against one of his subjects   abs sir i tell you that gentleman called me out without explaining his reasons   sir anth gad sir how came you to call my son out without explaining your reasons   sir luc your son sir insulted me in a manner which my honor could not brook   sir anth zounds jack how durst you insult the gentleman in a manner which his honor could not brook   mrs mal come come let us have no honor before ladies  captain absolute come here  how could you intimidate us so  here is lydia has been terrified to death for you   abs for fear i should be killed or escape maam   mrs mal nay no delusions to the past  lydia is convinced speak child   sir luc with your leave maam i must put in a word here  i believe i could interpret the young ladys silence  now mark    lyd what is it you mean sir   sir luc come come delia we must be serious now  this is no time for trifling   lyd it is true sir and your reproof bids me offer this gentleman my hand and solicit the return of his affections   abs o my little angel say you so  sir lucius  i perceive there must be some mistake here  with regard to the affront which you affirm i have given you  i can only say that it could not have been intentional  and as you must be convinced that i should not fear to support a real injury  you shall now see that i am not ashamed to atone for an inadvertency  i ask your pardon  but for this lady while honored with her approbation i will support my claim against any man whatever   sir anth well said jack and i will stand by you my boy   acres mind i give up all my claim  i make no pretensions to any thing in the world  and if i cannot get a wife without fighting for her by my valor i will live a bachelor   sir luc captain give me your hand  an affront handsomely acknowledged becomes an obligation  and as for the lady  if she chooses to deny her own hand writing here   taking out letters mrs mal o he will desolve my mystery  sir lucius perhaps there is some mistake  perhaps i can illuminate    sir luc pray old gentlewoman dont interfere where you have no business  miss languish are you my delia or not   lyd indeed sir lucius i am not    lydia and absolute walk aside mrs mal sir lucius otrigger  ungrateful as you are  i own the soft impeachment  pardon my blushes i am delia   sir luc you delia  pho pho be easy   mrs mal why thou barbarous vandyke  those letters are mine  when you are more sensible of my benignity  perhaps i may be brought to encourage your addresses   sir luc mrs malaprop i am extremely sensible of your condescension and whether you or lucy have put this trick upon me i am equally beholden to you  and to show you i am not ungrateful captain absolute since you have taken that lady from me i will give you my delia into the bargain   abs i am much obliged to you sir lucius but here is our friend fighting bob unprovided for   sir luc hah little valor  here will you make your fortune   acres odds wrinkles no  but give us your hand sir lucius forget and forgive but if ever i give you a chance of pickling me again say bob acres is a dunce that is all   sir anth come mrs malaprop dont be cast down  you are in your bloom yet   mrs mal o sir anthony  men are all barbarians    all retire but julia and faulkland jul he seems dejected and unhappy  not sullen  there was some foundation however for the tale he told me  o woman how true should be your judgment when your resolution is so weak   faulk julia  how can i sue for what i so little deserve i dare not presume  yet hope is the child of penitence   jul oh faulkland you have not been more faulty in your unkind treatment of me than i am now in wanting inclination to resent it as my heart honestly bids me place my weakness to the account of love i should be ungenerous not to admit the same plea for yours   faulk now i shall be blessed indeed   sir anthony comes forward sir anth what is going on here  so you have been quarrelling too i warrant  come julia i never interfered before but let me have a hand in the matter at last  all the faults i have ever seen in my friend faulkland seemed to proceed from what he calls the delicacy and warmth of his affection for you  there marry him directly julia you will find he will mend surprisingly   the rest come forward sir luc come now i hope there is no dissatisfied person but what is content for as i have been disappointed myself it will be very hard if i have not the satisfaction of seeing other people succeed better    acres you are right sir lucius  so jack i wish you joy  mr faulkland the same  ladies  come now to show you i am neither vexed nor angry odds tabors and pipes i will order the fiddles in half an hour to the new rooms  and i insist on you all meeting me there   sir anth gad sir i like your spirit and at night we single lads will drink a health to the young couples and a husband to mrs malaprop   faulk our partners are stolen from us jack  i hope to be congratulated by each other  yours for having checked in time the errors of an illdirected imagination which might have betrayed an innocent heart and mine for having by her gentleness and candor reformed the unhappy temper of one who by it made wretched whom he loved most and tortured the heart he ought to have adored   abs well jack we have both tasted the bitters as well as the sweets of love  with this difference only that you always prepared the bitter cup for yourself while i    lyd was always obliged to me for it hey mr modesty  but come no more of that  our happiness is now as unallayd as general   jul then let us study to preserve it so and while hope pictures to us a flattering scene of future bliss let us deny its pencil those colors which are too bright to be lasting  when hearts deserving happiness would unite their fortune virtue would crown them with an unfading garland of modest hurtless flowers but illjudging passion will force the gaudier rose into the wreath whose thorn offends them when its leaves are dropped
