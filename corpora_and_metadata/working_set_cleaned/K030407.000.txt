alfred  a tragedy  as performed at the theater royal in covent garden   lectori credere mavult hor dublin printed by byrn and son sycamorealley for the company of booksellers  mdcclxxvii  preface the success of a dramatic piece on the stage depends says voltaire upon accidental circumstances but the day of publication decides its fate  persuaded of the truth of this remark the author of the tragedy of alfred would have submitted his performance to the final judgment of the reader without preface or apology if he had not been advised and indeed urged to make a reply to some hostile criticisms which appear to have been founded upon prejudice and opinion rather than reason and argument  it has been alleged that the character of alfred in the tragedy does not agree with the character of alfred in history that the hero the legislator is degraded to a lover who enters the danish camp from a private not a public motive and acts the part of an impostor  in tragedy if the subject be historical an author is not permitted to introduce events contrary to the great established facts of history for instance in the tragedy of alfred the hero must not be killed nor driven out of england by the danes but preserving those ancient foundations as the piers of his bridge the author may bend his arches and finish the fabric according to his taste and fancy for the poet is at liberty and it is the essence of his art to invent such intermediate circumstances and incidents as he thinks will produce the most affecting situations in this department the poets fancy is controuled by nothing but probability and consistence of character the barriers of dramatic truth let us apply this principle to the point in dispute  alfred was a young man when he fought the battle of ethendune the victory which gave him possession of the kingdom must have been gained before he begun to model the state is it improbable to suppose that a young hero was in love is it inconsistent to represent the person who was a legislator when advanced in years as a lover in his youth does it degrade the character of a hero to suppose that he was in love with the princess whom he afterward married is it not rather injurious to his heroism to conclude that he chose a consort whom he did not love if this reasoning is just there will be no difficulty in vindicating the subsequent conduct of the hero the dramatic and the real alfred are both involved in the charge of imposture both entered the danish camp in disguise the previous events as narrated in the tragedy are nearly the same with those mentioned in history alfred for almost two years had wandered through england concealing himself under feigned names and characters he lived in the midst of his enemies by being supposed to be dead emerging from this obscurity he appears in the tragedy and is informed of the alarming ambiguous situation of ethelswida his usual stratagems present themselves one would think naturally to his mind extremely agitated and prone both by temper and habit to the most daring and romantic enterprises he resolves to enter the danish camp to learn the fate of ethelswida and observe the strength and order of the enemys army before he ventures a decisive engagement  the continued artifice is inevitable the conduct of alfred in the camp of hinguar the manner in which he deceives the dane is extremely similar to the conduct of orestes in the electra of sophocles which no critic hitherto has blamed orestes enters the palace of aegisthus as the messenger of his own death carrying an urn which contains he says the ashes of orestes whose untimely fate he most circumstantially relates the grecian hero practices the deceit with an intention to kill the persons whom he deceives the english hero deceives hinguar only to gain access to ethelswida without meaning to hurt the person of his enemy to praise sophocles and blame the author of alfred for the same conduct seems a direct contradiction which can only be accounted for in one way an imaginary idea has been formed of the character of alfred as an old mortified ascetic sage of spirit too sublime and aetherial to descend to human passions or human actions but the real as well as the dramatic alfred was a young hero a bard a winner of battles brave and magnanimous but compelled by the pressure of those desperate times in which he lived to practice a thousand arts to exist by simulation and dissimulation whoever recollects and weighs these circumstances will it is presumed readily pardon the artifice of alfred in the tragedy and acknowledge that the feigned incidents of the piece are altogether consistent with the true if not the author must be contented to labor under the imputation of an erroneous judgment for he meant nothing less than to degrade the character of alfred on the contrary finding in the records of a remote and barbarous age a hero of great renown but from the defect of his historians involved in clouds and darkness qui caput inter nubila condit he was tempted to seize his name and display his character in new situations connected with the old and well known events of his life and fortune the play is printed as it was performed an alteration has been made in one scene and sent to the theater which if the tragedy should be resumed or revived may perhaps contribute to heighten its effect  prologue to furnish a new prologue for each play to dress the selfsame dish a different way exhausts the poets art and every year palates grow nicer rarities more dear the cabinet who in the green room sit the secret junto of the realm of wit in these hard times resolved their stock to spare and crib the prologue from the bill of fare alfred on english ground alone may stand the darling hero of his native land no no our poet cried  this is no time nor is it prudent now to save your rhyme fired with my subject i have rashly dared and you in prologue should protect your bard when my adventurous muse indulged before now ventring further needs indulgence more she dares to trace the workings of a mind the greatest and the best of human kind adjust its movements to dramatic plan and blend the godlike hero with the man the greater alfreds fame our bard risks more such weight the flying courser never bore alfred whose life such strange events adorn that history beholds romance with scorn him to present here in his native land where still his genius and his laws command is an attempt like his who rashly tried the burning chariot of the sun to guide yet this attempt from admiration rose nor should he find in alfreds kingdom foes he who by temper led not love of fame is the fond echo of your heros name epilogue by mr garrick our bards of late so tragic in their calling have scarce preserved one heroine from falling whether the dame be widow maid or wife she seldom from their hands escapes with life if this green cloth could speak would it not tell upon its wellworn nap how often i fell to death in various forms delivered up steel kills me one night and the next the cup the tragic process is as short as certain with she makes the motion of stabbing this  or and here of drinking poon this i drop  then drops the curtain no saint can lead a better life than i for half is spent in studyng how to die the learned dispute how tragedies should end o happily say some  some death defend mild critics wish good fortune to the good while others hotbrained roar for blood blood blood  the fair though nervous tragic to the soul delights in daggers and the poisoned bowl i would not give a blackpin for a play unless in tenderness i melt away from pangs and death no lovers would i save they should be wretched and despairand rave and never together lie  but in the grave the brave rough soldier a soft heart discovers he swears and weeps at once when dead the lovers as down his cheeks run trickling natures tide damn it  i wish those young ones had not died though from his eyes the drop of pity falls he fights like caesar when his country calls in spite of critic laws our bard takes part and joins in concert with the soldiers heart o let your feelings with his party side for once forgive me that i have not died too hard that fate which kills a virgin bride dramatis personae men alfred king of england mr lewis edwin earl of devonshire mr hull earl of surrey mr

secret from my breast astonished as i am at such a secret who can unfold the cause why at this hour when big with englands fate each moment rolls does alfred hide himself in clouds and darkness and spread uncertain rumors of his state confounding all belief  devonshire he spread them not from his uncertain fate those rumors rose ere since that time when the perfidious dane attacked the english in the hour of peace on alfreds wedding day  officer it was believed that alfred in the general carnage fell at cyppenham that in the swelling flood of wintry avon ethelswida perished  devonshire such was the first report  officer fain would i hear the eventful tale of muchenduring alfred and what is yet of ethelswida known  devonshire when faithless hinguar with his host advanced the king distracted for his lovely bride sent off a hundred knights by surrey led to guard the princess to a place of safety then furious faced the dane  with odds oppressed around their king his faithful nobles fell alfred by favor of the night escaped and wandered long obscure from place to place through woods and forests like some beast of prey by cruel hunters chased much he endured and much his people suffered english virtue like englands oak grew firmer from the storm often the peasant his last morsel brought to the dark wood or cave where alfred lay if questioned by the dane denied the deed and died undaunted to preserve his prince  officer the story thrills my blood by heaven and earth  where did he rest at last  devonshire he never rested even when he had a place of refuge found where the deep winding streams parret and the one their waters mix a little island lies with alders overgrown no name it had though now the name of athelney it bears marshes and pools by inundation formed perplex the dire approach there alfred fixed his dreary habitation two brave knights at first were all his train day after day the numbers grew and many a gallant knight found out the wild asylum of his lord from thence with inroads fierce they galled the dane dark as the spirits of the night they came and vanished at the dawn in that retreat the sun through every sign over alfred rolled  officer did ethelswida there rejoin her lord  devonshire nor she herself nor any of her train have ere been heard of since she left her lord  officer for certain then she lives if she had perished her fate would have been known  devonshire the danes ascribed to me the inroads made by daring alfred and both the danish princes took the field hinguar with fire and sword laid waste the land hubba his host to kenwith castle led and with strong siege begirt my ancient towers then alfred issued from his lonely isle concealed as now beneath another name  officer did alfred fight in kenwiths bloody field  devonshire he fixed the fortune of that doubtful day when hubba with his life the reafen lost the enchanted standard on whose magic wings conquest till then had flown the battle won alfred impatient bent his rapid course to westmorland where as he fondly hoped his ethelswida dwelt he found her not and late last night in deep despair returned  officer i see the clouded tract through which he passed invisible  now he has reached the point and will break forth in splendour we shall fight tomorrow or today  devonshire on these steep hills by nature and by art impregnable which far and wide command wiltonias vale in absence of the king my camp i pitched audacious hinguar occupies the plain and braves us to descend  officer proclaim the king the king of england at his peoples head then roll their rising valor on the foe  devonshire thy zeal becomes thee he will choose his time mean while the story of his death believed lessens the weight and burden of the war prevents the junction of the danish chiefs and makes our foes secure soldier farewell theking expects me in my tent he rests  officer my bosom throbs to see him rise in arms exit manet devonshire spirits in heaven may there attain perfection but weakness in this world is natures stamp with which she marks the sons of men her own who can compare with this accomplished prince in valor or in virtue he excells the counselor the sage in civil wisdom the light of ancient times shines in his soul and the bards listen to his voice divine but vain his virtue and his wisdom vain against affections power too much he loved and mourns too much his ethelswida lost he comes with grief oppressed enter alfred health to the king has balmy sleep descended on his cares  alfred my sleep is haunted with my waking thoughts the vision of the night is ethelswida sometimes a broken seen of other woes my troubled fancy to her image joins and adds the monarchs to the lovers grief this very night in dreams i thought myself under the friendly roof where once i lay beset on every side with danish spears when to preserve my life a noble youth the only offspring of a widowed dame unknown to me my personage assumed and stopped the hounds that bayd for alfreds blood  devonshire o generous youth  alfred full in the gate he stood and brandishing his sword aloud proclaimed that englands king alive should never be taken headlong the foes rushed on numbers he slew at last unshrinking in his place he fell and still the danes believe that youth was alfred  devonshire no wonder that they should   alfred this very night pale in his wounds the gallant form appeared whilst over the bleeding body of her son majestic in her grief his mother hung enter a messenger messenger to devonshire a warrior from the danish camp demands admittance to thy presence  alfred let him enter exit mess alfred walks aside enter a warrior with his beaver down devonshire stranger unfold thy purpose he takes

alfred is ethelswida captive  surrey yes my lord  alfred to whom  surrey to hinguar  alfred to my mortal foe is she in hinguars power is brutal hinguar the master of her fate  surrey would that i durst this painful truth deny  alfred o wretched alfred destined to suffer misery and shame that princes seldom feel all other ills although in troops they came i have endured manhood and patience yield to this o surrey had i been surrey and had thou been alfred i never had brought such tidings to my friend  surrey great is the grief that renders thee unjust hear me o king and if thou blamst me then illfated surrey shall offend no more  alfred what has my passion spoke thy pallid cheek thy hollow eye those inauspicious arms are signals of distress  surrey the story hear of ethelswidas fortune how it chanced that surrey lives to tell it  alfred o my friend forget my words with destiny at odds and with myself impatience glanced at thee the martyr of my cause  surrey that fatal night when with my precious charge i left my lord through many dangers happily we passed but when we reached fair edens distant vale we found no refuge there  alfred too well i know the scots had razed pendragons lofty tower then whither did thou fly  surrey there i dismissed most of my faithful knights a few i kept of chosen men the choice eastward we steered toward the wilds beyond the source of tine by midnight marches in untrodden paths that wind over mountains vast through valleys deep we reached a lonely mansion in a dale which at the foot of snowclad cheviot lies there ethelswida found a safe retreat and in those deserts wild she might have dwelt unheard of and unknown  alfred why did she not  surrey the rumor of thy death a tempest raised which from that harbor drove her out to sea on me she laid her absolute commands to guide and guard her as i could to kenwith my friends i warned to meet us on our way and on we went till one unhappy time the danes surpised us in a narrow vale against their fierce attack our little band around the princess formed a fence of steel more and more narrow still the circle grew till i alone was left with ethelswida alone i fought till at her feet i fell her dismal shrieks her piercing cries i heard more grievous sar than all the wounds i bore  alfred methinks i hear her cries she called on alfred did she not surrey providence divine why was not alfred near  surrey as i have heard from some who in the troops of hinguar fought for he it was who led the hostile band she swoond with grief and terror on the spot the dane to her unwonted pity showed and raised her from the ground  alfred tell me the truth do not deceive me surrey  surrey o my lord i never did nor will l now deceive thee but of the princess this i only know that in the danish camp she still remains guarded with care her name and rank unknown  alfred what should i think can she submit to live  to live her honor lost how did thou scape from such a slaughter and how came thou hither commissioned by the dane  surrey when night came on some english peasants who had seen the fight crept from their huts in secret to the field with pious purpose to inter the dead in me alone some sparks of life they found their care preserved me when my strength returned to hinguars camp i went gave out myself of danish race although in england born my service was accepted i have found favor in hinguars sight and in the band that guards his person serve from them i learned that ethelswida near his tent is lodged a mournful captive  alfred near his tent o heaven how have i merited  devonshire raise not thine eyes nor lift thy hands to heaven far other looks far other actions heaven of thee requires thou art a king a soldier and a lover fight for thy crown thy country and thy bride go forth this instant animate thy troops and lead them to revenge their wrongs and thine alfred muses why does my royal master hang his head and bend on earth his eyes  alfred forbear my lord to surrey what is thine errand to the camp of england  surrey to offer battle  but the true intent of hinguar is to learn if alfred lives for various rumors have perplexed the dane  alfred he shall be satisfied i see a ray which through the darkness breaks it grows more bright my friend the tumult of my thoughts forgive surrey goes aside with surrey manet devonshire what does he meditate i know his mind with dreadful images is filled in hinguars arms he sees his ravished bride ravished or not she is captive to his foe enflavd by force it is force must set her free he cannot treat with hinguar that he knows by sad experience for the woes of alfred and all the evils of this hapless land arose from englands confidence in denmark no ties divine or human bind the danes of all the impious race by far the worst and most profane is hinguar  alfred to surrey go prepare for my reception  surrey ah may heaven avert those ills which my prophetic soul forebodes exit surrey devonshire i heard the parting words of faithful surrey which mark too well the color of thy purpose  alfred thy approbation i do not expect none can approve but those who feel like me the danish camp disguised i will explore clad in the vesture of a british bard and learn for certain ethelswidas fate whatever has befallen my hapless bride assured of that my heart shall shake no more  devonshire something like this my anxious soul foretold  alfred i read thy thoughts but urge me not to hear thy friendly counsels which i cannot follow in great events the agitated mind consults its genius only low or high the active spirits in that level flow nor fall nor rise to act anothers counsel that potent counselor directs me now i feel the impulse often in perils felt nor is my arm confined to ethelswida the strength and order of the danish host how and what quarter i may best attack attentive i will observe  devonshire since thou have fixed thy resolution to contend is vain the part of friendship now is to consult how we may guard thee best  alfred by the moons light as with a swift career their camp i passed a wood extended on the right i saw their left the village ethendune defends can thou inform if they have opened paths or planted watches there  devonshire neither my lord presumptuous hinguar holds such caution vain  alfred when dusky eve descends in the dark time between the fall of night and the moons rise in silence thither march a thousand men chosen with care the bravest of our host there let them watch till morn if no alarm comes ere the dawn at dawn they may retire  devonshire to choose and lead that band shall be my care my warriors are the hunters of the hill accustomed to the woods fearless they move by the pale glimpses of the clouded moon to them the changeful aspects of the night whose false presentiments armies often confound in all their forms are known  alfred i would not wish a better leader nor a braver band  devonshire the word  alfred st george  devonshire o may he guard the king and as the minds of yonder heathen host in darkness lie so may their eyes be dark and blind to alfred  alfred as they still have been this is no new though seeming bold attempt i have essayed it for a slighter cause when in the isle of athelney ilay the quarters of the dane i often explored in this disguise and marked destructions line farewell thy wisdom no direction needs nor shall i long be absent from my friend exeunt end of the first act act ii scene the danish camp enter surrey surrey the tale of orpheus which in rome i heard whose lyre

signet of his power he never trusted to another hand  alfred when in the rocky cave i found him dead i then resolved king of the warlike danes to bear to thee the tidings of his death and as a proof which could not be denied that ring i took which erst mine eyes beheld upon his finger placed with rites and charms when he was crowned in london englands king  hinguar i will reward thee to thy utmost wish thou art no saxon but of british race and love the mountains of thy native land choose where they fairest rise they shall be thine with all their valleys and their sylvan streams the gods i serve have sent thee to my aid it is my belief thou can assist me much in what is dearer to my soul than empire  alfred how can the bard assist a prince like thee  hinguar in high respect i hold thy art divine whatever thou art magician bard or seer or if thou art all these i crave thine aid amidst my victories i am most wretched by love tormented unsuccessful love  alfred thy love with equal

her dire frenzy from distress arise from sudden perturbation of the mind or is the cause unknown  hinguar from grief from fear from terror to excess her frenzy rose dreadful the shock she suffered  alfred how my lord what did she suffer  hinguar in her person nothing but agony of mind to an excess not easy to describe  alfred has she revealed her name her family  hinguar by different names she calls herself and when with questions urged she makes extravagant fantastic answers and seems unconscious of her true condition  alfred her general temper is it sad or gay for frenzy is most various

he meant to circumvent the soul of ethelswida should i consent to wed a danish bride he hopes to rouse the woman in thy heart and profit by the rage of slighted beauty  ethelswida perhaps the women of his savage land have taught him thus to judge of womankind if they are like the clouds that change their form and careless fly before each shifting gale far different is the soul of ethelswida alfred

the valkyrian maids i go to odin and the hall of joy thou of thy love bereft shall waste thy days in lamentation like the wretch who pines by helas lake and drinks the poisoned stream poured from the jaws of snakes i laugh at thee and like my fathers die dies alfred his dying voice of me prophetic fpake o ethelswida and surrey too in alfreds cause has fallen now on the top the summit of affliction like a tree stripped of bark and branch i stand bare on all sides and naked to the storm falls voice behind the scenes where is the conquering king my lord my husband make way and let me rush  where is my alfred ethelswida enters and sees him edwin following ethelswida eternal powers is this the scene of joy after a pause looking at the robe am the cause accursed of alfreds death and englands ruin bear me witness heaven  but words are vain let those bewail their doom who live to suffer and prolong their pain the gleam of hope extinguished by despair sharpens my sense of misery and spreads a deeper horror on my tortured mind my sure and now my only friend come forth draws a dagger spirit of alfred stay alfred revives alfred the shades of death still swim before my eyes i heard the ghost

sad commencement of our woes deep on my heart engraved was the resolve not to survive thee in the storms of fortune that anchor held like fate  alfred whence came that sign which friends and foes deceived  ethelswida true was the sign of death the wearer of my garment died for me mistaken  alfred twas a wounded mind which laid me low oppressed with grief i sunk edwin my friend   devonshire

decree the nations now are one with hinguar died the enmity of england and of denmark my people with their monarch shall be blessed whilst such a partner of my empire reigns  ethelswida nor shall the story of the toils of alfred sink to oblivion in the tide of time or to posterity descend in vain from hence the people of the land he loved and future princes of that land may learn fearless to stem the torrent of disaster and never of england or themselves despair  finis
