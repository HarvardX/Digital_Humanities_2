thine be the task to carve his carcass foul the dunciad only can describe his soul a letter to the writer of a letter to my lord  occasioned by a letter to the publisher of the present edition of the dunciad variorum sir the author of the dunciad has now obliged himself and is perfectly happy in beholding his illustrious brat the just semblance of his sweet tempered parent make his appearance he had long promised or rather threatened the public with this edition but nobody would believe that any creature could be hardy or vain or wicked enough to undertake to utter a virulent lampoon with the names of many worthy persons at full length but it seems the raneour of his mind has got the better of his fears and the itch of scribbling is much superior to the dread of chastisement  well then having like caesar written his own commentaries and given himself various readings upon himself having guarded himself on all sides and surrounded his text with prolegomena testimonia arguments indexes appendix etc and adorned himself with all the pomp and trappings that usually attend the dignity of an established writer of antiquity behold him strutting into the world and expecting to receive the reverence due to his quality optat ephippia mus and however awkardly they become him he rejoices in them behold him now proclaiming himself a classick behold a personage whom he styles william cleland walking gravely before our poetical dictator bare headed with the fasces on his shoulder and a little behind him an ugly northern thing formerly his colleague in scandal and criticism an odd mixture of doctor poet buffoon punster politician antiquary and cook methinks i see them now marching in solemn parade round the new created classicks garden at twickenham i hear them repeating the dunciad and the neighboring shores resound his verses  yet has not the author of the dunciads vanity outrun his judgment so many lengths to persuade him to set his own name to this modest performance therefore has he borrowed and very properly the name of martinus scriblerus and not content with this or apprehensive this was not a sufficient protection for him he has published a letter to his publisher and signed it william cleland  i have many reasons which induce me to believe that this friend of scribleruss whom he calls william cleland is a counterfeit friend only and the words stand like richard roe and john do for form sake only in a recovery and to give the modest author of the dunciad an opportunity of saying something pretty in his own favor mr congreve in his way of the world shows us a coxcomb who used to enquire for himself at a chocolatehouse and not finding himself there would leave letters for himself but our little merry author goes farther he prints letters to himself writes libels threatens forgives punishes and is really the drawcansir of the age  in the publishers preface for our classick gives us a publishers preface as well as a preface to the publisher he takes upon him to answer for posterity and very modestly assures us that this insipid poem will be read by posterity these are his words in this monument they must expect to survive  and here survive they shall oh dreadful as long as the english tongue shall remain such as it was in the reigns of queen anne and king george if this pigmy animals wit could come up to his malice what work would he make with those who should be so unhappy to fall under his displeasure but as it is if this monument as he calls it should last let the present age inform him and hereby it does inform him that it will stand only as a monument of his infamy and those that come after us will and must believe the persons who stood the marks of his petulant malice to be worthy and good men and the enemies of the author of the dunciad will be always looked upon as the friends of virtue they will see a little invidious narrow mind in every line he has written they will blush at his indecent idaeas and be shocked at his scurrility therefore i applaud your design sir of printing your letter in quarto exactly on the same size with that of the dunciad variorum let it be bound up with it let them cling together through every age there the author of the dunciad shall survive and survive he shall  as long as the english tongue shall remain such as it was in the reigns of queen anne and king george if this should be the case what courage what allies what stature must future ages conceive this giant warrior to be aided with they will imagine him at least to be seven foot high beyond the growth of his cotemporaries both in stature and understanding will they not be surprised when i assure them and i do hereby assure them for i sir put in my claim to immortality too by being annexed to you that this same giant was but about four foot and an half high of a structure a little irregular and his genius low and indecent as his form  but i lose my purpose which was to show the improbability that any man should be so weak or unadvised or hungry after any sort of fame to so mean a degree to place or suffer his name to be placed before a lewd and infamous libel therefore i say this same author has written a letter to himself in the name of one william cleland and made him to commend and applaud the author for what every one knows he is liable by the laws of the land to be punished when he shall be discovered and for this cause at the same time that he has placed every gentlemans name whom he has abused at full length he has not dared to subscribe his own  it is usual for the merry andrew after he has played over his arch tricks for some time to put on a grave face to rectify his muscles and to harangue his audience in a more sober wise to prepare them to receive the doctor with respect and this is always done in a prefatory way before the doctor produces his medals or his pacquets or proceeds to poison himself or the company our doctor of the dunciad has thought it proper it seems that somebody should for form sake take upon him this character and if he has not made his supposed friend to rise to the dignity of his zany he may at least be allowed to be the vinegar of the ring and be qualified to whip the people into a circle before the sports begin as the character of this w c thus drawn by the libeller is of a very uncommon kind i will give it you in some observations upon this merry letter of the author of the dunciad in the name of this w c to the publisher of the dunciad that is to nobody it having been never publicly sold when he wrote his letter so that here is one w c whom nobody ever heard of writing to a certain publisher whom nobody knew  this same author says in the name of w c that it was a mark of his humanity to stay so long before he executed his vengeance upon those who had offended him now as nobody knows better than he the strength and bitterness of his own gall nobody can assure us so well as he how long malice will keep alive fifteen or twenty years at least it seems but now as this humanity of his as he is pleased to call it would be a very dangerous plea at the old baily in an indictment for the destroying a mans person i think it should weigh as little with the candid in justifying the destruction of a mans reputation  but he makes his william cleland a party to his crime likewise and declares he assisted in composing the libel he makes him affirm he was obliged to it in humanity for says he very gravely it was an orphan an orphan libel libels are all orphans dear william cleland a sort of children whom their fathers never care to own and though your humanity may be very great i think in this case your prudence will hardly weight against it there are very good reasons why this same author does not own his child and if you knew or considered them sure you would not thrust your ears into the dispute but i forget that this w c is only an ens rationis a man of straw set up by the candid author of the dunciad to combat for him  immediately after this our libeller forgot what he just before affirmed and makes this very w c to say he has found out the father of the bastard he makes him most impudently to declare mr pope to be the author if he means as i hope he does not the poet of that name who has been so much obliged by the public who is or ought to be by his education a gentleman whom books ought to have taught humanity and polite conversation and letters decency and good manners what does this infamous author deserve for making his w c abuse him in this manner but the reasons he gives why he conceives mr pope to be the author are equally scurrilous and ridiculous every one was curious says he to read what could be said to prove mr pope a dunce and was ready to pay something for such a discovery how came he to imagine every one  curious to find this gentleman a dunce if he knows him to be the author of the dunciad every man of common sense may easily judge what he is but as the person who has written that low and infamous satyr has not yet dared to set his own name before it i think it did not become this same w c whoever he is to do it for him if w c was a real and not a feigned person i do not doubt but mr pope would do himself justice for this abuse and recur to the laws for satisfaction upon him  but this author of the dunciad whoever he is must be a pleasant fellow for he goes on and makes his man of straw w c declare that when he saw mr pope attacked or written against or answered by those who were abused for he will have him to be his author still that he thought it was become a common cause the danger was common to all and his concern ought to be so too and he causes him very seriously to deliver it as his opinion that those who attacked mr pope must be traitors to church and state and women strange stuff a little venomous wretch not mr pope is lashed for his ribaldry and his ill nature and this author makes one w c without any other proof but his bare word to declare that they have insulted the fallen the friendless the exiled and the dead it is plain he would in this place put his w c upon us for one not well affected to our present establishment it is very well there is no such person as this w c if there should be such a one and he should have a place under the government what chastisement would not this low author merit for putting these words into his mouth we do very well know some people have fallen in the unhappy divisions of our country as he gently terms the late unnatural rebellion some are friendless some exiled and others dead and therefore those who have written against these people must bear the lash of our authors satyr if it be true that they have insulted these people let our author remember that they first insulted their country and its laws  this same friend of his goes on and does now discover some fears that hang about him least he should be taken for a fool or a knave by keeping mr p company though it luckily happens that his writing this letter has determined his character yet he very judiciously conceives it was his duty to vindicate him in print from all calumny or to be deemed either the one or the other so that according to this notion all the acquaintance of mr p are obliged to print in his vindication or to be esteemed fools or knaves here the author puts forth his whole head  this can only be the overweening conceit of a selfsufficient writer an assuming spurious classick asserting his supremacy and demanding obedience as you will see for immediately after this he affects the regal style he causes his w c to proclaim his royalty and accordingly he issues his edicts that all offenders against him shall be chastised he likens them to assassins he says poverty shall not be any excuse nor to be pleaded before him no more than at the old baily neither shall they says he receive the benefit of the clergy but some time after this his majesty cools he is graciously pleased to show mercy and he makes his herald w c to grant his dunces a little bread and a little fame how ridiculous is it to see a diminutive strutting thing erecting himself into a mocksovereign a modest homuncio who at the same time that he privately assassinates calls those whom he wounds assassins but let us consider this author of the dunciad as he really is a person poetically mad jealous of fame and envious of every rival grasping at the smallest shadow of reputation all his attention fixed to one point raving after imaginary honors and seeking infamy in fame and we shall incline to pity rather than censure this throws into ones mind the situation of the mad tailor in bedlam who called himself alexander the great was gracious and bountiful and just and cruel and victorious and good and bad as those ideas struck his sick brain  by this time sir you may imagine i am not a little weary of raking into this heap of nonsense and vanity now before me but as i now cast my eye forward i cannot help observing upon this imaginary letter writer where he tells us the author of the dunciad has a contempt for the writings of those he has written against this is not at all unlikely one very seldom has a good opinion of those whom one has an ill opinion of but they are dunces and should be abused for pretending to wit if this be the case neither the great scriblerus nor w c nor mr p himself are exempt from the lash of satyr for great dignified lettered as they are somebody may print and declare them dunces and attempt to displace this stupendous magistrate and all his mad ministry who usurp the throne of wit what a very scanderberg of an author is this  w c i mean the author of the dunciad in his name goes on and compares boileau to himself what has the great boileau done to deserve to be compared with an insignificant ribald but as he is now concluding his elegant epistle he makes w c as is usual in the beginning of a new reign to publish an act of grace and mercy is offered to those who shall repent and merit it these are his royal words by w c if ever he the author of the dunciad shall give us an edition of this poem himself i may see some of them treated as gently  on their repentance and better mind as perault and quinault were at last by boileau  this little bouncing mock emperor concludes in the name of w c with this singular observation on mr ps modesty that he never wrote a line that he was ever ashamed or unwilling to own now i think it is impossible any person but mr p himself can be assured of this at least nobody but mr p can know that mr p has no manner of grace or modesty or morals and he must be a very blunderer of a letterwriter who could venture to assure the public so and in the name of one who pretends to be ambitious of being called his friend  if now sir after all the reasons i have given to the contrary this w c should happen to be an existence separate from scriblerus it appears however very plainly from his manner of thinking that he is very like him and therefore might easily be mistaken for him in this case we can only say that the passion of friendship has misled him and we must forgive the weakness of his head for the warmth of his heart this praiseworthy zeal for maintaining a cause the goodness or badness of which the advocate is absolutely ignorant of reminds me of a story told me by a very merry old fellow who was in his youth enrolled as a private gentleman in the lifeguards of king william he was in esteem with the rest of the troop as a soldier of letters and was called by the gentlemen of the belt by way of distinction the scholar this character he bore unrivaled for some time till a brother of the sword grew jealous of his reputation and set up against him his rival who had been bookkeeper to a carrier and from thence derived his title to letters took every opportunity of opposing him when any subject a little out of the reach of the rest of the company was started one evening my friend in the height of his argument threw out a sentence of tully and was immediately taken up by his antagonist for false latin the debate ran high the troop divided upon the point and yet were unwilling to determine positively in a cause into the merits of which they could not see till one who was the bookkeepers comrade a very brave though not a learned man pulled him by the sleeve and leading him into a private room directed him to lay his hand upon his heart and inform him upon his honor whether the words spoken were true or false latin and being answered upon his honor they were false latin he returned immediately into the circle of the warriors they had left and placing his hand on his sword declared with great intrepidity that the latin the gentleman had spoken was false latin and he would maintain it  i am sir etc richard smith   whereas a certain untowardly downlooking fellow who would be deemed of quality and is indeed filius populi has taken upon him the office of ps nuncio and published in coffeehouses several scurrilous and scandalous bulls or lampoons of his holiness his master this is to let him know that he is found out and if he goes on he will be punished as the laws and statutes of this realm shall require  a letter to a noble lord occasioned by the late publication of the dunciad variorum turpitudo personae ejus in quam liberius invehimur nos vindicabit ignosces etiam iracundiae nostrae que justa est in ejusmodi and homines and cives cicero my lord april the  th      together with the dunciad i am to return your lordship many thanks for the loan of so uncommon a piece which cannot but be highly welcome to all the true lovers of scandal since it leaves them no room to doubt as to most of the persons libelled in it you were pleased to assure me my lord that it was left at your house by an unknown hand and that you were an utter stranger both to the author and to the nature of his performance it is but reasonable therefore that i should satisfy your lordship as to these two particulars in return for your goodness in lending me this book when i had sought for it in vain by the means of all the booksellers and publishers in town it may not be improper at the same time to acquaint you that copies have been left at many peers houses in the same manner as your lordships was whilst the favorites of the author have had whole cargoes sent them to dispose of thus has a little insignificant lampooner with unparalleled impudence made people of the first quality privy to and some of them innocently publishers of his scandal for which doubtless he will be chastised as he deserves  i find at the head of this libel a long stupid letter which though subscribed by another name must doubtless by scribleruss or which is the same thing the author of the dunciads encomium upon himself he has i know not with what intent brought in the praises too of one mr pope maliciously insinuating that this poem was of his composing which one would fancy it impossible it should be for that writer after having acquired the dignity of a poet would surely never condescend to accept of the office of scavenger and rake into all the filth of the town i confess i at first conceived the name subscribed to this letter to be such an one as scriblerus but i have been since assured that it is no fictitious name but the real one of a person now living who is deeply read in the indexes of books and the secret histories of families whether this be the letterwriters established character or not the world must judge but this i will venture to affirm that as the real author of the dunciad can add no reputation to this william cleland so this william cleland can add no reputation to the author of the dunciad should there be any thing here like the association between the lion and the jackcall i believe in this case the jackcall would prove the greater beast of the two not that i would be hereby thought to exclude this person from any title he may have to the other of these appellations i remember to have been present at a trial for a rape wherein the girl to prove her former chastity brought in an old bawd for her evidence doubtless this story will admit of no application in the present case but to use a scrap of this mans own scrap of latin fastiditis gratiam  being then obliged to presume that mr popes known veracity and good nature would not admit him to be suspected of having wrote such an heap of lies and abuse as is contained in the dunciad i have used my utmost endeavors to discover the true author of that poem and having succeeded in my research i have prefixed to this tract his effigies as it has been exactly transcribed from a busto which was returned upon a certain ingenious sculptors hand for resembling in a most unflattering manner the original by the rueful features of it i am confident your lordship will immediately discover who is the renowned father of the dunciad  you will not i am sure expect that i should enter into an examination of the poetical merit of that piece that would subject me to a task for which i am wholly unfit i mean the reading it a second time but i am well informed that the reception which the first edition met with from the town showed that the performance was thought as mean as the design in my cursory view of it though i met with some lines here and there poetical enough yet i thought the generality of them very prosaick the whole tale loose and unconnected the transitions unnatural the parodies on the most admired passages of the ancients were not only too frequent but likewise too faintly and poorly wrought up either to strike or delight the reader and besides the nastiness of the games and of all the imagery in the poem the very language often sunk into downright ribaldry as when a gentlewomans breasts are styled her forebuttocks or her cowlike udders upon the whole i judged this dunciad to be below all criticism both as to its style and versification  indeed the morality of it as well as of the notes of scriblerus and variorum may deserve a much stricter scrutiny felons in the condemned hold at newgate who have no characters to forfeit and but little enjoyment of life to lose may venture to attack the reputations of other men without fear or shame but unless under those circumstances none but a madman could be tempted to do it how shall i astonish your lordship then when i assure you that no desperate raver but a poor reptile who as he is the most helpless is likewise the most timid creature living has acted this part he is become a voluntary prisoner to his own house rather than not enjoy the pitiful pleasure of aspersing with impunity persons all of them better members of the community than himself and many of them of a much higher rank in life than he must ever pretend to who can only derive a mock title not from his ancestors but his shoulders in his first edition he had traduced certain characters for which every one has always had the utmost veneration and thinks now by leaving out the names of some and falsely filling up the blanks of others as well as by absconding for a time to escape the stripes that ought to be the just reward of such writings how monstrous therefore has it been to insinuate that they have reached a presence where good nature truth and humanity only can be graciously received or encouraged the reverse whereof are the characteristicks of the dunciad  i am sensible that the retailers in scandal have always endeavored to pass upon the world by the laudable appellation of satyrists and would take shelter under the great names of horace juvenal and boileau not considering that these precedents will never be to their purpose those generous correctors of vice never attacked persons but errors nor ever exposed the private character but the public appearance of men at the same time taking especial care to pay the strictest regard to truth even while the scourge was in their hands and therefore boileau in his own vindication speaking of chapelain who was a bad poet says en blamant ses ecrits ai je dun style affreux distille sur sa vie un venin dangereux i must likewise inform this halflearned tribe that the codrus of juvenal which these abusive writers so often quote for their justification was no real person but a name designed in general to signify any bad poet  true and just satyr will always have its weight scandal will always be condemned the one is beneficial to society the other is detrimental to it whenever a man has taken upon himself the profession of any art or science by writing or otherwise he has certainly submitted his talents therein to the judgment of the world a writer therefore who in that art or science consistent with good manners exposes the defects of his fellow writer be it by ridicule or argument is guilty of nothing that is blameable but rather does a praiseworthy action by endeavoring to rectify the judgments of men and prevent pretenders to science from imposing on the public the censuring an author then only as such is what every man has a right to do from the moment he appears in print hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim but under this pretext to attack his private reputation as a member of society must be the result of the same villainous principles as would lead a man to be guilty of robbery or murder had he courage enough for the road the civil magistrate alone has a right to enquire into mens personal characters and if they deserve it to expose and punish them and it seems but just that this authority should be vested solely in him since no one else can with any certainty be informed of what passes in private life  the predecessors of the writer of the dunciad the elaborate authors of grubstreet have frequently transgressed this equitable rule and finding too general a propensity toward enquiring into the blemishes of otherwise great characters have sometimes been pretty liberal of their personal reflections in order to render their several dunciads the more saleable yet these men had at least so much decency as to do this under feigned names or by pointing at persons only by their initial letters which were liable to various readings thus whilst the obscurity of their scandal screend them from punishment their very proceeding was a tacit confession of the guilt of such invectives but it was doubtless reserved for the modest author of the dunciad to invent the ne plus ultra of scandal by calling men every way his superiors rogues blockheads drunkards and liars in print with their names at length whilst he suppresses his own that he may be exempt from the fear of a very low punishment but to which his ears seem to be legally entitled  as this is my first appearance in print i have hitherto escaped the malice of this scandalmongers pen and do not now write out of any hatred to him but real love for mankind a regard to humanity and the rules of society have raised in me an indignation against a writer who has the insolence to appear in public in defiance of them all i am resolved therefore though such a procedure with relation to any honest man would be detestable to mark him to the world let us examine a little into the character of this diminutive creature who makes so free with those of other men  i find that upon his first coming to town out of pure compassion for his exotic figure narrow circumstances and humble appearance the late mr wycherley admitted him into his society and suffered him notwithstanding his make to be his humble admirer at wills and afterward finding in him a glimmering of genius recommended him to some people of rank and introduced him to the most eminent men of letters which courtesy he soon after repaid with a satirical copy of verses on his benefactor this put an end to their correspondence some time before mr wycherley died his acquaintance by this means being made with sir richard steel and mr addison they likewise in compassion to his unhappy form and destitute condition endeavored to procure him a support under both by setting on foot a subscription in his behalf it was indeed for a work which as has since appeared they must have known he was not equal to but they hoped with their friendly assistance to have supplied his defects however his subscriptions were no sooner full when the little mischievous urchin no longer able to contain his malice wrote a satyr upon both these gentlemen as he did afterward an abusive libel on one of them and as many things which had passed in private conversation at buttons coffeehouse came to be known by the lord o of which infidelity scriblerus was suspected he was obliged to absent himself for some years from thence after this he listed openly in the tory service and every week published scandalous invectives on those very whigs who had been his amplest subscribers he was in this honorable occupation when the late queen died and our poet soon changing his note found means to be introduced to some of the young ladies of the court four of these who were his best friends and patronesses as they are to any thing that carries the face of wit or learning he abused in a scurvy ballad for which any other man would have received correction but in his case these generous ladies contented themselves with showing a contempt of his malice and banishing him their company this did not hinder him from writing a second lampoon wherein he spared not the most exalted characters though under feigned names and adding treachery to ill nature he threw the scandalous imputation of having wrote this libel on a lady of quality whose wit is equal to her beauty and whose character might have suffered by this impudent forgery of his but i begin to be tired as i believe your lordship is too with raking into the dirty parts of this foul character i shall therefore pass over the many other low scenes of his life to come to his masterpiece of scandal the dunciad this misshapen lump of malice and ill nature at the earnest request of all his friends who feared his abuse more than his enemies had for some years forborne writing lampoons except it were on a curl or a lintot when at last grown weary of this restraint and unable to live in peace with society he collected a list of names yet unabused by him and resolved to throw them together into one satyr to furnish himself therefore with matter he went round all his cully booksellers enquiring for scandal of any kind and an abusive story being told him of a parson in drink which the relater thought could not come within his scheme of satyr as reflecting upon one that had never appeared in print he told him that he was resolved to put it down to laurus for as to the truth of it the town would never be at the trouble to enquire into that  thus compiled and thus composed the dunciad made its appearance last summer and was so universally exploded for its witless ill nature and falsehood that the gentlemen traduced in it being only pointed at by their initial letters did not think it worth their care to correct the author in the manner he deserved yet i have been credibly informed that some of them resorted to no place where scriblerus might possibly be met with without the provision of a rod to whip this old boy for his untoward malice but he absconding for above a month and the scandal having hurt no creature but the author himself their resentment cooled and the little lampooner might have been at peace had he not wantonly revived the memory of his former malice by reprinting this pitiful poem on royal paper giving at full length the names of most of those mentioned in it together with a comment more abusive than the text which he published under an appellation very proper to himself i mean that of scriblerus this was such a consummate piece of insolence as one would think could admit of no aggravation yet he found means to add one degree of impudence more to it by presuming at first to make men of rank and quality in a manner his publishers  your lordship may wonder that one who has conducted himself after this manner should not have suffered under the due correction of some of those whom he has thus wantonly abused it is most certain that nothing in the figure of a man could have escaped punishment for such repeated insults many of them on persons of distinction but this poetaster having unhappily a resemblance in his size and make to the animal much inferior to man it seems he has been universally looked upon as beneath the dignity of resentment upon this occasion i cannot but call to mind a story which i have somewhere read of an honest highlander who was walking along holborn when he heard a voice cry rogue scot rogue scot his northern blood fired at the insult and he drew his broad sword looking round him on every side to discover the object of his indignation when at last he found that the voice came from a parrot perched on a balcony within his reach but the generous scot disdaining to stain his trusty blade with such ignoble blood put up his sword again with a sour smile saying gin ye were a mon as you are a green geuse i would split your weem  a sword indeed has never been deemed a weapon fit for the correction of libellers thersites who in mr popes homer resembles our author both in shape and malice was cudgelled by ulysses for his faucy language to his betters aretin the only author besides that of the dunciad within these three hundred years that acquired a famous infamy by his pen bragged of keeping many kings and princes tributary to him in order to purchase an exemption from his satyrs yet it seems some of the princes of his own country found out a better method of dealing with him for having been abused by him they ordered the insolent creature such a bastinado as at once put an end to his satirical vein and being by this treatment brought to himself he had such a true sense of his vile character that he turned his mind wholly toward devotion in which strain he wrote many books with such success as to obtain at length the name of the divine aretin should the like treatment of the father of the dunciad produce the like effect what service might he not be of to religion by composing pious hymns for the great festivals of the year and perhaps by a translation of all the psalms the first of which it seems he has already imitated in a most edifying manner were scriblerus to undertake the whole psalms and perform that work with the justness and accuracy of his other translations it might not only eclipse sternhold and hopkins but even vie with that of tate and brady and then what would not the public owe to those who by the human means of a stick should have wrought so useful as well as praeter natural a conversion  but aretin had the shape of a man and might bear a beating whereas our poet must of necessity expire under the very first blow and he can by the structure of his person only be liable to one sort of correction that of the rod which some years ago mr ambrose philips being abused by him bought for his use and stuck up at the bar of buttons coffeehouse and which he avoided by his usual practice after every lampoon of remaining a close prisoner at home the same discipline was prepared for him last summer which he escaped in the manner abovementioned and i am informed that the rods are now ready for his chastisement as soon as he shall be found in a proper place for whipping  in the mean time as all criminals who fly from justice are executed in effigy his figure is exposed and four inscriptions under it on the several sides of the pedestal in greek latin spanish and english in the greek and latin for having offended those languages by presuming to translate or imitate what he did not understand and in his native tongue for having made his british muse which ought to be chaste and delicate to speak the language of the stews and of billingsgate the spanish inscription carries in it an instruction which might have been of use to him had he read it before he became a libeller instead of a satyrist this curious image having been communicated to me by one of those who are abused in the dunciad in whose possession it now is i thought it proper to take a cut from it which i have prefixed to this publication  whenever it happens that a worthy mind is lodged in a deformed body i am persuaded that all virtuous men commiserate the case and far from indulging any reflections on the figure would use their utmost endeavors to make both the owner and the rest of the world forget it but when as is the sad fate of the author of the dunciad a crooked carcass is become the habitation of a much more crooked mind and when this creature far from being humbled by the irregularity of the form assigned him by providence makes the very despicableness of it a protection to him for venting such malice as he would not dare to utter were he a possible mark for indignation to lay hold of i think in such a case mind and body which seem so well adapted to each other should go together and be jointly exhibited and exposed to the contempt of that society which can have no other reparations made them for the injuries of such an untoward animal  a virtuous man has strongly implanted in him a philanthropy or innate humanity which restrains him from reflecting too severely on the frailties of his fellow creatures as remembering that they are all of them of one species but scriblerus distinguished indeed in a most remarkable manner by nature from the rest of mankind has no tenderness or regard for them but looks upon himself as one of a quite different race of beings nor shall i ever look upon him in another light  where indeed is the definition of man to which he can be said to answer if  be the term can he have the assurance to pretend to that characteristick who looks with envy on every thing that contributes to the peace or benefit of society and is never happy but when he is creating feuds and animosities even amongst the most intimate of his acquintance if man be styled a rational creature will scriblerus come within that description who knowing how little able he is to defend either his own character or person wantonly begins the attack on others man is often defined to be a risible animal were this meant to denote a creature that we laugh at the author of the dunciad would bid fair to be comprehended but all the grammarians agree that it signifies an animal susceptible of laughter which scriblerus was never in good humor enough with himself or others to be nor has he been observed since the hour of his birth to have risen above a broad grin common to him with the quadrupede most resembling human nature thus whatsoever is the definition he still appears excluded from the human species which may in some measure account for as well as excuse his universal ill will to our race  as i find that this last pompous edition of the dunciad is in quarto i have conformed myself to that size in this publication that your lordship may be enabled to bind up this true account of the author and his effigies with the work it self since all of them seem calculated for one and the same purpose to make his infamy immortal and his malice contemptible  i have the pleasure to give your lordship in public this testimony of my obedience and of the respect with which  i am my lord your lordship s most obedient humble servant will flogg   the martiniad with notes in one book at twickenham chronicles remark there dwelt a little parish clerk a peevish wight full fond of fame and martin scribler was his name meagre and wan and steeplecrownd his visage long and shoulders round his crippled corpse two spindle pegs support instead of human legs his shriveld skin of dusky grain a crickets voice and monkeys brain this martin had the knack of rhyme and spent at crambo all his time lampoons and songs devised so plenty while he made ten you scarce told twenty whoever durst in verse indite he had him strait in black and white was any neighbor caught in liquor martin compared him to the vicar no features could with him find grace the long he called a rueful face the man who rose to the rotund he sunk him down in dull profund no sex no age no state forbore the dead the living rich or poor wise fool young old fat lean or neither martin lampoond em all together the parish thus abused determine to crush the rhyming biting vermin they cudgels rods and whips prepare of this clerk martin was aware and skulkd behind a northern lout of shoulders broad and visage stout this loon he caught and much caressed him and thus in guileful wise addressed him you are i ween a beuklearnd scot unlike our dunces here i wot i write alas but what i write these dull ones only gibe and slight now would you be so good to own my work twould hugely please the town instead of mine then set your name and you shall win immortal fame the scot thus wheedled by the clerk set to his name some say his mark this done the loon stead of his pack had the whole parish on his back remarks  the martiniad for so all the manuscripts reclaim although some critics have asserted not without appearance of reason that it ought to have been called the martinee in imitation of the odyssee this poem like that being historical and loosely told and in no means rising to the epic force of the iliad but as our last modern classic scriblerus has surmounted this difficulty and called his the dunciad we fear not to follow the guidance of so established an author especially as he is the hero of our poem and so style this the martiniad  at twickenham read twicknam or twittnam this village is at present honored with the residence of a small modern classic and of some of his poetical underlings and commentators it is most pleasantly situated on the banks of the great river thames and has been celebrated in lyric poetry by the late mr thomas durfey who in his richmond balls speaking of the inhabitants thereof styles them twicknam loobies  a little parish clerk that office requiring a talent in vociferation the same is most elegantly insinuated under the epithet little it being a received british adage little and loud  and martin scribler was his name he was not like the generality of clerks content with reading or singing the works of other men but likewise composed many of his own and perhaps too audaciously as well as too ludicrously invaded the sacred province of king david by vying with him in psalmody though i am told that our martin went no farther than the first psalm not having met with any sort of encouragement in that undertaking  steeple crowned a most adequate expression for the crown of a parishclerk whose head in this respect bears a  resemblance to a steeple inasmuch as both are intended for the omament of the church what church scriblers steeplecrown now adorneth is as much a question as it was anciently what city might claim the birth of homer however it should seem by the crown being its self a steeple that martins typical head belonged to some church that claimed to itself the supremacy  crickets voice this is an animal famous for the smallness of his voice and legs he is observed to creep into the chimneys of old houses where there is much filth and nastiness and where the walls are full of holes hence men who get into families only to pick up scandal and find out their flaws are often assimilated to crickets  monkeys brain this is not to be understood in a literal sense but metaphorically and as monkeys are commonly mischievous mimicks we are to understand those dispositions to have been in our parishclerk  while he made ten you scarce told twenty this is a very quaint parody on the  of  whoever durst in verse indite he had him strait in black and white   there is a very wide difference between the manuscripts of the best authority as to the reading of this distick that of the vatican has it did any one but go to she he had him down in black and white   and this reading they support from authorities out of scriblers own dunciad where expressions tantamount are very frequent  the alexandrine copy to which we shall pay all due veneration runs thus did any drop their evening cates whip a lampoon was at their gates   this lection is not likewise unsupported with authorities but we adhere to the text as conveying the most cleanly ideas  the vicar a very inoffensive divine who had never given  clerk any provocation but he could not bear any one of a rank superior to his in the church and was offended at the vicars pretending to sing in another key than he had set the psalm and therefore trumpd up a story of his being found drunk in a kennel  rueful face how blind alas are all mortals in their own case you see our martin can sneer at the countenances of others when in the whole parish of twickenham there was not a more rueful face than his own vid essigies scribleri at the head of this publication  rotund an expression in scriblerus for plump denoting as he says obesity and he is of opinion that a fat man cannot be a man of wit for although he seems to admit guts in a mans brain he will not allow of brains in his guts  dull profund the manuscripts read deep but corrige meo periculo dull as in the text our clerks prosund being very shallow ut omnibus constat  lampoond them all together the churchwardens of twickenham affirm that there was a gathering made for martin for his christmas hymn he being at that time so poor that he was a perfect burden on the parish and they say he no sooner got the money than he lampoond the whole village but chiefly the churchwardens and those who had been the chief contributors toward his collection  to crush the rhiming biting vermin the scholiast will have it crack as an expression more apposite to an insect that bites for says this learned annotator whoever heard of crushing a louse or a flea  cudgels rods and whips these are the instruments commonly made use of for the chastisement of seurvy lampooners vid dunciad lib ii v   0 and sequent  northern lout alias  minshew drives the same from lutum mud or dirt but skinner from loeyes saxon for a layman or leos one of the vulgar it signifies one of the scum or dregs of the people  and visage stout this hemistich be of no farther use than to fill up the verse which without it would have remained imperfect these neutral expressions are in the crast of poetry called replenishers i could give you many instances out of our classick scriblerus but shall content myself with one in the dunciad variorum lib iii v     and  00  it stood in the first edition thus thy dragons  and  shall taste and from each show rise duller than the last   and i take it the true reason why our poet left those gaps was because he could not fill them up but one mr  having called upon him in a very earnest manner to do him that favor he discovered two replenishers or in the political language stopgaps and the verse ran thus thy dragons magistrates and peers and it might as well have been thy dragons shrieves and swordbearer shall taste or else to rise higher thy dragons may and aldermen shall taste or it might have done to the full as well thus thy dragons fa fe fi fo fum shall taste   from this one instance the curious reader may discover that a replenisher is a word which adds to the measure without affecting the sense of the verse not unlike the false calves worn by the spindleshankd which help the outward appearance of the leg without contributing any thing to its strength  this loon loon in minshew is said to signify the same as lout but in bailey it is made to denote a dull heavy headed fellow lazy and good for nothing  beauk learned scot here our author in speaking of a scotchman very humorously and elegantly falls into the very dialect of that country doubtless in imitation of the classic author of the dunciad where he speaks of wormius a great antiquary and makes use of the old english style calling him the myster wight  as to the term beuklearnd i find our scholiast observes that this scotchman was apt to examine books as expert jockeys do horses only by their head and tail and was therefore deeply read in the title pages and indexes only  immortal fame corrige meo periculo and read immoral fame for although all the manuscripts agree with the text yet is it very manifest that the spurious t must have crept into the first manuscript by the inaccuracy of the transcriber who being doubtless one of little genius did not perceive how  it was to attribute the word immortal to the fame of any of scriblers works and this error being once crept in the servile transcribers have all followed one another in it from this one example i think the reader may infer notwithstanding the vulgar opinion to the contrary that good sense is required to constitute a true critic  pack denotes a bundle of clothes or linen the form of which is peculiar to those of north britain many of the inhabitants whereof come up to london with one of these at their back and as soon as they can get into a more genteel method of traveling are apt to forget the pack they came up with we may affirm that our highland loons pack is fuller of scandal than of linen  had the whole parish this must be understood figuratively for although milo arrived to the strength of carrying an ox yet had he ennurd himself thereto by bearing him daily on his shoulders from a calf so had our highlander first bore one then two then three men peradventure he might have attained to the force of carrying a great number but to think that he could step from a pack at once to bear a whole parish is unnatural and absurd wherefore by parish are here understood the cudgels rods and whips of the said parish and for these his back seems to have been broad enough  finis appendix a curious receipt wherein is disclosed the art of writing poetry with a small genius taken from martinus scribleruss writings reader be thou gentle or be thou otherwise i have always thy profit and pleasure before mine eyes from the which i shall not readily swerve else may thou in all probability cast me off as is usually practiced with unprofitable servants as i have by my sagacity discovered certain mechanical rules by the help whereof scriblerus has obtained unto himself the name of a mighty poet i question not but the imparting the same unto thee will be of contentment and delight it may furthermore be a work conducive toward the strength and glory of this my native island by multiplying the number of poets therein these have hitherto been but few from a mistaken opinion that a genius learning and a good ear were requisite to constitute a poet whereas from the following plain and easy rules it will most evidently appear that application and practice only are necessary by the help of these i will undertake that any industrious englishman may in the space of one month become as great a versificator as even the great scriblerus himself  let the man then whose sublime passion it is to shine in poesy accustom himself to tautophonys or ingeminations of sounds this is most effectually performed by selecting words that begin with the same consonant and these placed at due distances two three or more in one and the same verse create a music in poetry insomuch as that the lines so composed may be indifferently either sung or said of a truth this is an art which seems to have escaped the knowledge of all the ancients whether of greece or of rome and was hidden from the most celebrated even of our british poets being like many other inestimable secrets wrapped in the dark womb of time to be brought to light only by the skillful midwifery of the renowned scriblerus some traces indeed there are of this art amongst some of the monkish writers from whence our poet may have taken the hint but the monks never reduced the same to any regular practice as our modern classick has done nor did they make use thereof in any but latin verses and those chiefly technical ones for the help of memory so that the invention or at least the perfection of this nostrum is owing to martinus  conformable to his rules were i to mention an author whose pride could bear no fame but his own and that of his servile flatterers i would make the verses run thus poets support like pampered priests their pride such stigmatize as stick not to their side where the well chosen ps of the first line and the soft hissing ss of the second compose a most excellent harmony but past all peradventure courteous reader for such doubtless by this time thou art become thou may deem it more for thy instruction to learn this poetical jingle in the words of scriblerus himself  dunciad lib

round and reappear i might give a thousand more instances of the same nature for indeed there are not any two lines together in the whole dunciad or in any other of the writings of this author wherein the same mechanical trick is not practiced and it is from thence that he has acquired the name of melodious martin and not as has been falsely insinuated from his having sung his own psalm in a certain lutheran congregation the which we esteem of only as a fictitious tale devised for mirth it being well known that our poet belongs to a much more ancient church but to return to our subject whosoever by an unwearied exercise in vocabularies and dictionaries of rhyme shall have replenished the tubes of his memory with similar sounds will in proportion to his application and labor therein rival or even surpass if possible the merit of our great martinus  any person moderately versed in poetical works must have remarked that adjectives are most commonly foisted in not to add to the sense but in order to fill up the measure of a verse in all such emergencies it behooves our apprentice in poesy to make a most fervent search for an adjective that begins with the same letter as his substantive even although the context should seem to suffer thereby thus must comfort always be cold the day at noon dawning the fury even of scriblerus fatal garments gorgeous though all tattered head heavy limbs lazy mind muddy night noisy plight pleasing be it never so sad quail quivering rake reeling though sober sot social and treat or theobald tasteless true it is that this ingenious gentleman has manifested as good a taste as any of our writers whatsoever but what has truth to do with scriblerick poetry his name and tasteless both commence with the same letter and therefore until he shall present us with a more convenient adjective beginning with a t he must be contented with this abusive and unjust one euphoniae gratia  these adjectives or others in their stead having been choicely collected as has been premised out of the dictionary constant regard being had to the initial consonant they must at sometimes immediately precede or follow their respective substantives and at others may be severed at a due distance from the same from whence will result a most delectable variety of harmony for the first sort take this example formed was his figure foul in limbs in face a perfect parody on human race but reader thou will be much more edified with the words of martinus the father and undisputed inventor of this poesy hear then the soft sweetwarbling twicknam swan

instance  scurvy shall sound thy scandal to mankind and as thy make so monstrous is thy mind but without all doubt the reader coveteth examples from the mouth of martinus as being far more authentic

explained unto thee the first secret in scribleruss poesy namely that divine one of ingemination and as i have set before thee a great diversity of examples these must suffice to give thee full light into this mystery the rest must be the result of thine own diligence in putting this precept properly in practice  proceed we then to certain other mechanical rules whereby great and eminent poets may be produced without the help of genius in the second place therefore the  hiatus in m s valde deflendus  although in this place there be a gap in our manuscript which can never enough be lamented by the learned yet are there preserved to us many fragments of the same containing most curious secrets but as they are replete with quotations from scriblerus i must defer exhibiting them till a more convenient season i think in the long winter nights in which all well regulated families assemble round the chimney a present of this nature may not be uncomfortable at such a season should any one endued with an even steady voice read the many excerptions out of scriblerus contained in the remaining parts of this manuscript what with the genial warmth of the fire the lullaby whistling of the wind and the monotony or sameness of sound in the verses that slumber might effectually be procured which is so soporiferously described in the second book of the dunciad perhaps that good effect might be produced at this very hour without any concurring helps were it possible to find people whose blood in spring ran sluggish enough to sit still and hear such a work read to them  notwithstanding the great veneration i have for the author of the preceding manuscript yet must i beg leave to animadvert on one assertion therein which i take to be erroneous viz that the divine art of ingemination of sounds in poesy was the sole invention of martinus scriblerus whereas in justice to the memory of his predecessor mr john grub the great founder of the street and sect which still bear his name i shall venture to affirm that he was no stranger to this mystery this will most evidently appear by a most curious fragment of his which i shall here subjoin and which perhaps may be a present as welcome to the public as those many books of tacitus said to have been lately retrieved by the fidelity of the constantinopolitan library keeper who may well be styled the bentley of the east such is the beauty of the allegory couched in the few lines of our fragment and such the harmony of its versification as may justly entitle it to a place in the next edition of the dunciad the verses of mr grub are as follow  thus trojan boots tinged with tartarean glue near which the greasy great gambadoes grew while coaches rumbled round my roman nose and green iniquity grew gray in prose i intended here to have taken leave of my patient reader for such doubtless he is who has been so good as to accompany me thus far but reflecting with my self that our martinus has not had the leisure or occasion of celebrating the due praises of his panegyrical letter writer i have determined for the present to supply this defect by a distick written in the spirit and style of our poet see clumsy cleland lay a claim to wit from puzzled prose in poets praises writ   a parody on the verses written on mrs biddy l by an ingenious divine the snarling tribe did momus late entreat a satyrist to form
