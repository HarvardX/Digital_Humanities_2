the honor to inform you that on yesterday morning the enemy made a sudden and unexpected movement from the several posts they had taken in   our front they broke up their whole encampments the preceding night and have advanced towards kingsbridge and the north river the design of this manœuver is a matter of much conjecture and speculation and cannot be accounted for with any   degree of certainty the grounds we had taken possession of were strong and advantageous and such as they could not have gained without much loss of blood in case an attempt had been made i had taken every possible precaution to prevent their outflanking   us which may have led to the present measure they may still have in view their original plan and by a sudden wheel try to accomplish it detachments are constantly out to observe their motions and to harass them as much as possible in consequence of this movement i called a council of general officers today to consult of such measures as should be adopted in case they pursued their retreat to new york the result of which is herewith transmitted  in respect to myself i cannot indulge an idea that general howe supposing he is going to new york means to close the campaign and to sit down without attempting something more i think it highly probable and almost certain that he will make a descent with a part of his troops into jersey and as soon as i am satisfied that the present manœuver is real and not a feint i shall use every means in my power to forward a part of our force to counteract his designs nor shall i be disappointed if he sends a detachment to the southward for the purpose of making a winter campaign from the information i have received there is now a number of transports at red hook with about three thousand troops on board their destination as given out is to rhode island but this seems altogether improbable for various reasons among others the season is much against it in the southern states they will find it   milder and much more favorable for their purposes i shall take the liberty of mentioning that it may not be improper to suggest the probability of such a measure to the assemblies and conventions in those states that they may be on their guard and of the propriety of their establishing and laying up magazines of provisions and other necessaries in suitable places this is a matter of exceeding importance and what cannot be too much attended to from the approaching dissolution of the army and the departure of the new levies which is on the eve of taking place and the little prospect of levying a new one in time i have wrote to the eastern states by the unanimous advice of the general officers to forward supplies of militia in the room of those that are now here and who it is feared will not be prevailed on to stay any longer than the time they are engaged for the propriety of this application i trust will appear when it is known that not a single officer is yet commissioned to recruit and when it is considered how essential it is to keep up some show of force and shadow of an army  i expect the   enemy will bend their force against fort washington and invest it immediately from some advices it is an object that will attract their earliest attention i am happy to inform you that in the engagement on monday sennight i have reason to believe our loss was by no means so considerable as was conjectured at first by some deserters and prisoners we are told that of the enemy was tolerably great some accounts make it about four hundred in killed and wounded all agree that among the former there was a colonel carr of the thirtyfifth regiment the force that will be sent to jersey after i am satisfied   of mr howes retreat in addition to those now there according to my present opinion will make it necessary for me to go with them to put things in a proper channel and such a way of defence as shall seem most probable to check the progress of the enemy in case they should attempt a descent there or a move towards philadelphia i have the honor to be c  george washington   november      white plains governor livingston to governor livingston white plains   november      sir on tuesday morning the enemy broke up their encampments which were in front of our lines after having remained there several days without attempting any thing they have gone towards the north river and kingsbridge this sudden and unexpected movement is a matter of much speculation some suppose they are going into winterquarters and will sit down in new york without doing more than investing fort washington i cannot subscribe   wholly to this opinion myself that they will invest fort washington is a matter of which there can be no doubt and i think there is a strong probability that general howe will detach a part of his force to make an incursion into the jerseys provided he is going to new york he must attempt something on account of his reputation for what has he done as yet with his great army  persuaded that an expedition to the jerseys will succeed his arrival in new york with a detachment of his army as soon as i can be satisfied that the present manœuver is a real retreat and not a feint i shall throw over a body of our troops with the utmost expedition to assist in checking his progress at the same time i beg leave to recommend to your consideration the propriety and necessity that some measures should be taken to place your militia on the best footing possible and that a part of them may be in readiness to supply the place of the troops denominated new levies from your state whose term of service will presently expire your vigilance and attention i know will not be wanting in any instance yet there is one thing more i will take the liberty to mention that is that the inhabitants contiguous to the water should be prepared to remove their stock grain effects and carriages upon the earliest notice if they are not the calamities   which they will suffer will be beyond all description and the advantages derived to the enemy immensely great they have treated all here without discrimination the distinction of whig and tory has been lost in one general scene of ravage and desolation the article of forage is of great importance to them and not a blade should remain for their use what cannot be removed with convenience should be consumed without the least hesitation these several matters i thought it my duty to suggest to you not doubting but you will give them such attention as they may seem to deserve and that your own good judgment will point out many more necessary regulations adapted to the exigency of our affairs i do not know the state of the barracks about elizabethtown amboy and brunswic they may be exceedingly necessary to cover our troops i think therefore it would be advisable to have them examined and that you should direct such necessary repairs to be made as they may require i have the honor to be c george washington   november      majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene headquarters   november      sir the late passage of three vessels up the north river which we have just recd advice of is so plain a proof of the inefficacy of all the obstructions we have thrown into it that i cannot but think it will fully justify a change in the disposition which has  0 been made if we cannot prevent vessels from passing up and the enemy are possessed of the surrounding country what valuable purpose can it answer to attempt to hold a post from which the expected benefit cannot be had i am therefore inclined to think that it will not be prudent to hazard the men and stores at mount washington but as you are on the spot leave it to you to give such orders as to evacuating mount washington as you may judge best and so far revoking the order given to colonel magaw to defend it to the last the best accounts obtained from the enemy assure us of a considerable movement among their boats last evening and so far as can be collected from the various sources of intelligence they must design a penetration into jersey and to fall down upon your post you will therefore immediately have all the stores c removed which you do not deem necessary for your defence and as the enemy have drawn great relief from the forage and provisions which they have found in the country and which our tenderness spared you will do well to prevent their receiving any fresh supplies there by destroying it if the inhabitants will not drive off their stock and remove the hay and grain c in time experience has shown that a contrary conduct is not of the least advantage to the poor inhabitants from whom all their effects of every kind are taken without distinction and without the least satisfaction troops are filing off from hence as fast as our situation and circumstances will admit in order to be    transported over the river with all expedition i am c  p s i need not suggest to you the necessity of giving general mercer early information of all circumstances that he may move up to your relief with what troops he has george washington   november      white plains to the president of congress white plains   november      gentlemen i have been favored with yours of the   st ulto by monsr laytaniac and must take the liberty of referring you to my former letters upon the subject of providing for the french gentlemen who shall incline to enter the service of the states to me there    appears that one of two modes must be adopted they must either be appointed to places in some of the regiments or formed into a distinct corps the former was advised as the most eligible in respect to the gentlemen who were here before it requires time to form an accurate opinion of the merits of an officer and the present situation of the army will not allow me to pay a particular attention to monsr laytaniac or such notice as he may wish to receive or i to give nor is there any way of making his stay here agreeable i have c  george washington   november      lieutenantgeneral howe to lieutenantgeneral howe headquarters   november      sir yesterday evening i received the favor of your letter of the  th instant major stewarts servant having never represented himself as a person not enlisted in your army he was considered as a prisoner of war and sent as such to jersey but upon your information that he was not in the capacity of a soldier    i will give immediate directions for him to be brought back that he may return to his master this servant was charged with a letter of a private and delicate nature but major stewart may be assured the contents neither were nor shall be permitted to transpire i regret that it has not been in my power to effect the proposed exchange of prisoners before this time as soon as the proposition was agreed to i wrote to the governors and conventions of the different states where the prisoners were to have them collected and sent to the most convenient places in the neighborhood of the two armies their dispersed situation for their better accommodation has been the reason of the delay at least i cannot ascribe it to any other cause it has not arisen sir from any design on my part and i am persuaded the difficulty of drawing them together must be evident to you especially as it was early suggested in some of my former letters as to the charge of your officers being confined in common gaols i had hoped that you were satisfied by my assurances on this head before it is not my wish that severity should be exercised towards any whom the fortune of war has thrown or shall throw into our hands on the contrary it is my desire that the utmost humanity should be shown them i am convinced the latter has been the prevailing line of conduct to prisoners there have been instances in which some have met with less indulgence than could have been wished owing to a refractory conduct and a disregard of paroles if there are other instances    in which a strict regard to propriety has not been observed they have not come to my knowledge and if you will be pleased to point them out and to particularize the names of the officers the earliest inquiry shall be made into the complaint and the cause removed if any exists with respect to the stragglers who have lately fallen into our hands i cannot upon the best consideration discern how the agreement subsisting between us is affected by sending them to places from whence they may be easily collected upon a general exchange that the custom of war requires or that the interest of an army would admit of a daily exchange of prisoners are points on which we are so unhappy as to differ in sentiment the opportunities of conveying intelligence and many other consequences flowing from such an intercourse seem so very obvious that upon further reflection i flatter myself you will think with me on this subject but if otherwise it might have been exemplified on your part in the immediate return of such stragglers from our army as have fallen into your hands which would have justified an expectation of a similar conduct from us i am sir with great respect c  george washington  0th day of november      white plains majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee instructions sir the late movement of the enemy and the probability of their having designs upon the jerseys confirmed by sundry accounts from deserters and prisoners rendering it necessary to throw a    body of troops over the north river i shall immediately follow and the command of the army which remains after general heaths division marches to peekskill devolving upon you i have to request that you will be particularly attentive that all the intrenching and other tools excepting those in immediate use be got together and delivered to the quarter master general or major reed who heretofore has been intrusted with them that you will direct the commanding officer of artillery to exert himself in having the army well supplied with musket cartridges for this purpose a convenient place at a distance should be fixed on that the business may go on uninterrupted that no troops who have been furnished with arms accoutrements or camp utensils be suffered to depart the camp before they have delivered them either to the commissary of stores or the quarter master general or his assistant as the case may be taking receipts therefor in exoneration of those which they have passed in a particular manner let the tents be taken care of committed to the quarter master generals care a little time now must manifest the enemys designs point out to you the measures proper to be pursued by that part of the army under your command i shall give no directions therefore on this head having the most entire confidence in your judgment and military exertions one thing however i will suggest namely that as the appearance of embarking troops for the jerseys may be intended as a feint to weaken us and render the strong post we now hold more vulnerable or if they find that troops are assembled with more expedition and in greater numbers than they expected on the jersey shore to oppose them i say as it is possible from one or the other of the motives that they may yet pay the army under your command a visit it will be unnecessary i am persuaded to recommend to you the propriety of putting this post if you stay at it into a proper posture of defence and guarding against surprises but i would recommend it to your consideration whether under the suggestion above your retiring to croton bridge and some strong post still more easterly covering the other passes through the highlands may not be more advisable than to run the hazard of an attack with unequal numbers at any rate i think all your baggage    and stores except such as are necessary for immediate use ought to be to the northward of croton river in case of your removal from hence i submit to the consideration of yourself and the general officers with you the propriety of destroying the hay to prevent the enemy from reaping the benefit of it you will consider the post at crotons or pines bridge as under your immediate care as also that lately occupied by general parsons and the other at wrights mill the first i am taught to believe is of consequence and the other two can be of little use while the enemy hover about the north river and upon our right flank general wooster of the state of connecticut and by order of the governor commanding several regiments of militia is now i presume in or about stamford they were to receive orders from me and they are to of course do it from you there are also some other regiments of connecticut militia who came out with general saltonstall and annexed to general parsonss brigade and others whom you must dispose of as occasion and circumstances shall require but as by the late returns many of those regiments are reduced to little more than a large company i recommend the discharge of all such supernumerary officers and the others annexed to some brigade as the season will soon oblige the enemy to betake themselves to winterquarters and will not permit our troops to remain much longer in tents it may be well to consider in time where magazines of provisions and forage should be laid in for the army on the east side hudsons river peekskill or the neighborhood would i should think be a very advantageous post for as many as can be supported there croton bridge may possibly be another good deposit or somewhere more easterly for the rest as the commissary and quartermaster c may assist in pointing out it may not be amiss to remind you for it must as it ought to have some influence on your deliberations and measures that the massachusetts militia stand released from their contract the   th this instant  that the connecticut militia are not engaged for any fixed period  by what i can learn begin to grow very impatient to return and few indeed of whom are left if the enemy should remove the whole or the greater part of their force to the west side of hudsons river i have no doubt of your following    with all possible despatch leaving the militia  invalids to cover the frontiers of connecticut in case of need given at headquarters near the white plains this  0th day of november       george washington  0 november      governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters  0 november      sir i was yesterday evening favored with a call by the gentlemen appointed commissioners from your state to arrange your officers and to adopt some line of conduct for recruiting the quota of men which you are to furnish in discussing this subject the gentlemen informed me that your assembly to induce    their men to enlist more readily into the service had passed a vote advancing their pay twenty shillings per month over and above that allowed by congress it is seldom that i interfere with the determinations of any public body or venture to hold forth my opinion contrary to the decisions which they form but upon this occasion i must take the liberty to mention especially as the influence of that vote will be general and continental that according to my ideas and those of every general officer i have consulted a more mistaken policy could not have been adopted or one that in its consequences will more effectually prevent the great object which congress have in view and which the situation of our affairs so loudly calls for the levying a new army that the advance allowed by your state may be the means of raising your quota of men sooner than it otherwise would perhaps may be true but when it is considered that it will be an effectual bar to the other states in raising the quotas exacted from them when it is certain that if their quotas could be made up without this advance coming to their knowledge the moment they come to act with troops who receive a higher pay jealousy impatience and mutiny will immediately take place and occasion desertions if not a total dissolution of the army—it must be viewed as injurious and fatal point of light that troops will never act together in the same cause and for different pay must be obvious to every one experience has already proved it in this army that congress will take up the subject and make the advance    general is a matter of which there can be but little probability as the addition of a suit of clothes to the former pay of the privates was a long time debated before it could be obtained i am c george washington    november      peekskill to the president of congress peekskill    november      sir i have only time to acknowledge the honor of your letter of the  th inst and its several inclosures and to inform you that agreeable to the resolves of congress i shall use every measure in my power that the moving and present confused state of the army will admit of for to appoint officers for recruiting you will have been advised before this of the arrival of commissioners from massachusetts others have come from connecticut but from the present appearance of things we seem but little if any nearer levying an army i had anticipated the resolve respecting the militia by writing to the eastern states and to the jerseys by the advice of my general officers and from a consciousness of the necessity of getting in a number of men if possible to keep up the appearance of our army how my applications will succeed the event must determine i have little or no reason to expect that the militia now here will remain a day longer than the time they first engaged for i have recommended their stay and requested it in general orders general lincoln and the massachusetts commissioners are using their interest with  0 those from that state but as far as i can judge we cannot rely on their staying  i left white plains about eleven oclock yesterday all peace then the enemy appeared to be preparing for their expedition to jersey according to every information what their designs are or whether their present conduct is not a feint i cannot determine the maryland and virginia troops under lord stirling have crossed the river as have part of those from the jerseys the remainder are now embarking the troops judged necessary to secure the several posts through the highlands have also got up i am going to examine the passes and direct such works as may appear necessary after which and making the best disposition i can of things in this quarter i intend to proceed to jersey which i expect to do tomorrow  the assemblies of massachusetts and connecticut to induce their men more readily to engage in the service have voted an advance pay of twenty shillings per month in addition to that allowed by the congress to privates it may perhaps be the means of their levying the quotas exacted from them    sooner than they could otherwise have been raised but i am of opinion a more fatal and mistaken policy could not have entered their councils or one more detrimental to the general cause the influence of the vote will become continental and materially affect the other states in making up their levies if they could do it i am certain when the troops come to act together that jealousy impatience and mutiny would necessarily arise a different pay cannot exist in the same army the reasons are obvious and experience has proved their force in the case of the eastern and southern troops last spring sensible of this and of the pernicious consequences that would inevitably result from the advance i have prevented the commissioners from proceeding or publishing their terms till they could obtain the sense of congress upon the subject and remonstrated against it in a letter to governor trumbull i am not singular in opinion i have the concurrence of all the general officers of its fatal tendency  i congratulate you and congress upon the news from ticonderoga and that general carleton and his army have been obliged to return to canada without attempting any thing i have the honor to be c     george washington   th day of november      peekskill majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath instructions the uncertainty with respect to the designs of the enemy renders any disposition of our army at this time a little unsettled but for the present your division with such troops as are now at forts constitution montgomery and independence are to be under your command and remain in this quarter for the security of the above posts and the passes through the highlands from this place and the one on the west side of hudsons river colonel tashs regiment is meant to be included in this command unnecessary it is for me to say any thing to evince the importance of securing the land and water communication through these passes or to prove the indispensable necessity of using every exertion in your power to have such works erected for the defence of them as your own judgment assisted by that of your brigadiers and the engineer may shew the expediency of to form an accurate judgment of the proper places to fortify in order effectually to secure the two land passes abovementioned through the highlands requires a considerable degree of attention and knowledge of the roads and ways leading through the hills these you must get from information and observation as my stay here will not allow me to give any direction on this head with precision you will not only keep in view the importance of securing these passes but the necessity of doing it without delay not only from the probability of the enemys attempting to seize them but from the advanced season which will not admit of any spade work after the frost which may be daily expected sets in lose not a moments time therefore in choosing the grounds on the east and west side of the river on which your intended works are to be erected let your men designed for each post be speedily allotted and by your presence and otherwise do every thing to stimulate the officers respectively commanding at each to exert themselves in forwarding them the cheapest kind of barracks must be erected contiguous to these places where no covering now is for the men these may i should think be built of logs and made warm at very little    cost in apportioning your men to the different posts those to be established as well as those already fixed on the river i advise your keeping the corps as much as possible together and also desire that in this allotment you will consult your officers and such gentlemen as have it in their power from their superior knowledge of the country to afford you good advice independent of the barracks which may be found necessary for the men at the posts beforementioned i should think others ought to be built at such places in this neighborhood as the quartermastergeneral and engineer shall point out as this must from the nature of it be considered in an important point of view and as well adapted for winter quarters for part of the army as any other place can be if contrary to the general received opinion general howes remove to dobbs ferry was only intended as a feint to draw off part of our force from the place which we last occupied and should he make an attempt upon general lee you are to give him all the aid you can taking care at the same time to keep guard in the posts and passes you occupy for the speedy and regular punishment of officers you are hereby authorized and empowered whilst you remain in a separate camp to hold general courtsmartial and carry the judgments of them into execution in all cases whatsoever be particularly careful of all intrenching tools tents seeing that the bottoms of them are not covered with dirt and above all take care that no discharged soldier is suffered to carry away any of the public arms or accoutrements apply to the commissary of stores for a list of those things furnished to the respective colonels of regiments and see that they account for them before the men are dismissed in like manner should every thing had of the quartermastergeneral be delivered up keep persons employed in making of cartridges and be particularly attentive that the stores are taken care of and the powder kept from receiving damage also prevent the soldiery from committing any kind of waste and injuries to private or public property the men which composed the detachment under colonel lasher are all to join their respective corps immediately given at headquarters at peekskill this   th day of november         george washington    november      to the president of congress general greenes quarters     november      sir i have the honor to inform you of my arrival here yesterday and that the whole of the troops belonging to the states which lay south of hudsons river and which were in new york government have passed over to this side except the regiment lately colonel smallwoods which i expect is now on their march that they may be ready to check any incursions the enemy may attempt in this neighborhood i intend to quarter them at brunswic amboy elizabethtown newark and about this place unless congress should conceive it necessary for any of them to be stationed at or more contiguous to philadelphia in such case they will be pleased to signify their pleasure there will be very few of them after the departure of those who were engaged for the flying camp and which is fast approaching the disposition i have mentioned seems to me well calculated for the end proposed and also for their accommodation the movements and designs of the enemy are not yet understood various are the opinions and reports on this head from every information the whole have removed from dobbs ferry towards kingsbridge and it seems to be generally believed on all hands that the investing of fort washington is one object they have in view but that can employ but a small part of their force whether they intend a southern expedition must be determined by time    to me there appears a probability of it and which seems to be favored by the advices we have that many transports are wooding and watering  general greenes letter would give you the substance of the intelligence brought by mr mersereau from staten island in this instance which he received before it came to me enclosed you have copies of two letters from general howe and of my answer to the first of them the letter alluded to and returned in his last was one from myself to mrs washington of the   th ultimo from whence i conclude that all the letters which went by the boston express have come to his possession     you will also perceive that genl howe has requested the return of peter jack a servant to major stewart to which i have consented as he was not in the military line and the requisition agreable to the custom of war this servant having been sent to philadelphia with the waldeckers and other prisoners i must request the favor of you to have him conveyed to genl greene by the earliest opportunity in order that he may be returned to his master  before i conclude i beg leave not only to suggest but to urge the necessity of increasing our field artillery very considerably experience has convinced me as it has every gentleman of discernment in this army that while we remain so much inferior to the enemy in this instance we must carry on the war under infinite disadvantages and without the smallest probability of success it has been peculiarly owing to the situation of the country where their operations have been conducted and to the rough and strong grounds we possessed ourselves of and over which    they had to pass that they have not carried their arms by means of their artillery to a much greater extent when these difficulties cease by changing the scene of action to a level champaign country the worst of consequences are justly to be apprehended i would therefore with the concurrence of all the officers whom i have spoke to upon the subject submit to the consideration of congress whether immediate measures ought not to be taken for procuring a respectable train it is agreed on all hands that each battalion should be furnished at least with two pieces and that a smaller number than a hundred of three pounds fifty of six pounds and fifty of twelve pounds should not be provided in addition to those we now have besides these if some eighteen and twentyfour pounders are ordered the train will be more serviceable and complete the whole should be of brass for the most obvious reasons they will be much more portable and not half so liable to burst and when they do no damage is occasioned by it and they may be cast over again the sizes before described should be particularly attended to if they are not there will be great reason to expect mistakes and confusion in the charges in time of action as it has frequently happened in the best regulated armies the disparity between those i have mentioned and such as are of an intermediate size is difficult to discern it is also agreed that a regiment of artillerists with approved and experienced officers should be obtained if possible and some engineers of known reputation and abilities i am sorry    to say too ready an indulgence has been given to several appointments in the latter instance and that men have been promoted who seem to me to know but little if any thing of the business perhaps this train c may be looked upon by some as large and expensive true it will be so but when it is considered that the enemy having effected but little in the course of the present campaign will use their utmost efforts to subjugate us in the next every consideration of that sort should be disregarded and every possible preparation made to frustrate their unjust and wicked attempts how they are to be procured is to be inquired into that we cannot provide them among ourselves or more than a very small proportion so trifling as not to deserve our notice is evident therefore i would advise with all imaginable deference that without any abatement of our own in formal exertions application should be immediately made to such powers as can and may be willing to supply them they cannot be obtained too early if soon enough and i am told they may be easily had from france and holland  mr trumbull the commissary general has frequently mentioned to me of late the inadequacy of his pay to his trouble and the great risk he is subject to on account of the large sums of money which pass thro his hands he has stated his case with a view of laying it before congress and obtaining a more adequate compensation my sentiments upon the subject are already known but yet i shall take the    liberty to add that i think his complaint to be well founded and that his pay considering the important duties and risks of his office by no means sufficient and that the footing he seems to think it should be upon himself appears just and reasonable a proposition having been made long since to general howe and agreed to by him for an exchange of prisoners in consequence of the resolutions of congress to that effect i shall be extremely happy if you will give directions to the committees and those having the charge of prisoners in the several states south of jersey to transmit me proper lists of the names of all the commissioned officers and of their ranks and the corps they belong to also the number of noncommissioned and privates and their respective regiments you will perceive by his letter he supposes me to have effected some delay or to have been unmindful of the proposition i had made i propose to stay in this neighborhood a few days to which time i expect the designs of the enemy will be more disclosed and their incursions be made in this quarter or their investiture of fort washington if they are intended  i have the honor to be c   0 george washington    november      majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee general greenes headquarters    november      dear sir you will see by the enclosed resolves that congress have entered into some new regulations respecting the enlistment of the new army and reprobating the measures adopted by the state of massachusetts bay for raising their quota of men as every possible exertion should be used for recruiting the army as speedily as may be i request that you immediately publish in orders that an allowance of a dollar and onethird of a dollar will be paid to the officers for every soldier they shall enlist whether in or out of camp also that it will be optional in the soldier to enlist during the continuance of the war or for three years unless sooner discharged by congress in the former case they are to receive all such bounty and pay as have been heretofore mentioned in orders those who engage for the latter time that of three years are not to receive the bounty in land that no mistakes may be made you will direct the recruiting officers from your division to provide two distinct enlisting rolls one for those to sign who engage during the war the other for those who enlist for    three years if their service shall be so long requested  i am sorry to inform you that this day about twelve oclock the enemy made a general attack upon    our lines about fort washington which having carried the garrison retired within the fort colonel magaw finding there was no prospect of retreating across the river surrendered the post we do not yet know the loss of killed and wounded on either side but i imagine it must have been pretty considerable as the engagement at some parts of the lines was of long continuance and heavy neither do i know the terms of capitulation the force of the garrison before the attack was almost two thousand men before i left peekskill i urged to general heath the necessity of securing the pass through the highlands next to the river as well on that as this side and to the forts above but as the preserving of these and others which lie more easterly and which are equally essential is a matter of the last importance i must beg you to turn your attention that way and to have such measures adopted for their defence as your judgment shall suggest to be necessary i do not mean to advise abandoning your present post contrary to your own opinion but only to mention my ideas of the importance of those passes and that you cannot give too much attention to their security by having works erected in the most advantageous places for that purpose i am dear sir c  p s the enclosed letter for governor trumbull you will please to transmit by the  st opportunity    george washington    november      to the president of congress general greenes quarters    november      sir since i had the honor of addressing you last an important event has taken place of which i wish to give you the earliest intelligence the preservation of the passage of the north river was an object of so much consequence that i thought no pains or expense too great for that purpose and therefore after sending off all the valuable stores except such as were necessary for its defence i determined agreeable to the advice of most of the general officers to risk something to defend the post on the east side called mount washington when the army moved up in consequence of general howes landing at frogs point colonel magaw was left on that command with about twelve hundred men and orders given to defend it to the last afterwards reflecting upon the smallness of the garrison and the difficulty of their holding it if general howe should fall down upon it with his whole force i wrote to general greene who had the command on the jersey shore directing him to govern himself by circumstances and to retain or evacuate the post as he should think best and revoking the absolute order to colonel magaw to defend the post to the last extremity general greene struck with the importance of the post and the discouragement which our evacuation of posts must necessarily have given reinforced colonel magaw with detachments from several regiments of    the flying camp but chiefly of pennsylvania so as to make up the number about two thousand in this situation things were yesterday when general howe demanded the surrender of the garrison to which colonel magaw returned a spirited refusal  immediately upon receiving an account of this transaction i came from hackinsac to this place and had partly crossed the north river when i met general putnam and general greene who were just returning from thence and informed me that the troops were in high spirits and would make a good defence and it being late at night i returned early this morning colonel magaw posted his troops partly in the lines thrown up by our army on our first coming thither from new york and partly on a commanding hill lying north of mount washington the lines being all to the southward in this position the attack began about ten oclock which our troops stood and returned the fire in such    a manner as gave me great hopes that the enemy was entirely repulsed but at this time a body of troops crossed haerlem river in boats and landed inside of the second lines our troops being then engaged in the first colonel cadwalader who commanded in the lines sent off a detachment to oppose them but they being overpowered by numbers gave way upon which colonel cadwalader ordered his troops to retreat in order to gain the fort it was done with much confusion and the enemy crossing over came in upon them in such a manner that a number of them surrendered at this time the hessians advanced on the north side of the fort in very large bodies they were received by the troops posted there with proper spirit and kept back a considerable time but at length they were also obliged to submit to a superiority of numbers and retire under the cannon of the fort the enemy having advanced thus far halted and immediately a flag went in with a repetition of the demand of the fortress as i suppose  at this time i sent a billet to colonel magaw directing him to hold out and i would endeavor this evening to bring off the garrison if the fortress could not be maintained as i did not expect it could the enemy being possessed of the adjacent ground but before this reached him he had entered too far into a treaty to retract after which colonel cadwalader told another    messenger who went over that they had been able to obtain no other terms than to surrender as prisoners of war  in this situation matters now stand i have stopped general bealls and general heards brigades to preserve the post and stores here which with the other troops i hope we shall be able to effect i do not yet know the numbers killed or wounded on either side but from the heaviness and continuance of fire in some places i imagine there must have been considerable execution the loss of such a number of officers and men many of whom have been trained with more than common attention will i fear be severely felt but when that of the arms and accoutrements is added much more so and must be a further incentive to procure as considerable a supply as possible for the new troops as soon as it can be done i am c  george washington    november      hackinsac john augustine washington to john augustine washington hackinsac    november      dear brother at the white plains the enemy advanced a second time upon us as if they meant a general attack but finding us ready to receive them and upon such ground as they could not approach without loss they filed off and returned towards new york as it was conceived that this manœuver was made with a design    to attack fort washington or to throw a body of troops into the jerseys or what might be still worse aim a stroke at philadelphia i hastened over to this side with about five thousand men by a circuitous march of about sixtyfive miles which we were obliged to take on account of the shipping that opposed the passage at all the lower ferries but i did not arrive in time to take measures to save fort washington though i got here myself a day or two before it surrendered which happened on the   th instant after making a defence of about four or five hours only we have no particular account of the loss on either side or of the circumstances attending this matter the whole garrison after being driven from the outer lines and returning within the fort surrendered themselves prisoners of war but have given me no account of the terms by a letter which i have just received from general greene at fort lee i am informed that one of the train of artillery came across the river last night on a raft by his account the enemy have suffered greatly on the north side of fort washington colonel rawlingss regiment late hugh stephensons was posted there and behaved with great spirit colonel magaw could not get the men to man the lines otherwise he would not have given up the fort this is a most unfortunate affair and has given me great mortification as we have lost not only two thousand men that were there but a good deal of artillery and some of the best arms we had and what adds to my mortification is that this post after the    last ships went past it was held contrary to my wishes and opinion as i conceived it to be a hazardous one but it having been determined on by a full council of general officers and a resolution of congress having been received strongly expressive of their desire that the channel of the river which we had been laboring to stop for a long time at that place might be obstructed if possible and knowing that this could not be done unless there were batteries to protect the obstruction i did not care to give an absolute order for withdrawing the garrison till i could get round and see the situation of things and then it became too late as the fort was invested upon the passing of the last ships i had given it as my opinion to general greene under whose care it was that it would be best to evacuate the place but as the order was discretionary and his opinion differed from mine it unhappily was delayed too long to my great grief as i think general howe considering his army and ours would have had but a poor tale to tell without it and would have found it difficult unless some southern expedition may prove successful to reconcile the people of england to the conquest of a few pitiful islands none of which were defensible considering the great number of ships and the power they have by sea to surround and render them unapproachable  it is a matter of great grief and surprise to me to find the different states so slow and inattentive to that essential business of levying their quotas of men    in ten days from this date there will not be above two thousand men if that number of the fixed established regiments on this side of hudsons river to oppose howes whole army and very little more on the other to secure the eastern colonies and the important passes leading through the highlands to albany and the country about the lakes  in short it is impossible for me in the compass of a letter to give you any idea of our situation of my difficulties and of the constant perplexities and mortifications i meet with derived from the unhappy policy of short enlistments and delaying them too long last fall or winter before the army which was then to be raised was set about i represented in clear and explicit terms the evils which would arise from short enlistments the expense which must attend the raising an army every year the futility of such an army when raised and if i had spoken with a prophetic spirit i could not have foretold the evils with more accuracy than i did all the year since i have been pressing congress to delay no time in engaging men upon such terms as would insure success telling them that the longer it was delayed the more difficult it would prove but the measure was not commenced  0 till it was too late to be effected and then in such a manner as to bid adieu to every hope of getting an army from which any services are to be expected  the different states without regard to the qualifications of an officer quarelling about the appointments and nominating such as are not fit to be shoeblacks from the local attachments of this or that member of assembly  i am wearied almost to death with the retrograde motion of things and i solemnly protest that a pecuniary reward of twenty thousand pounds a year would not induce me to undergo what i do and after all perhaps to lose my character as it is impossible under such a variety of distressing circumstances to conduct matters agreeably to public expectation or even to the expectation of those who employ me as they will not make proper allowances for the difficulties their own errors have occasioned i am glad to find by your last letter that your family are tolerably well recovered from the indisposition they labored under god grant you all health and happiness nothing in this world would contribute    so much to mine as to be once more fixed among you in the peaceable enjoyment of my own vine and figtree adieu my dear sir remember me affectionately to my sister and the children and give my compliments to those who inquire after your sincerely affectionate brother george washington    november      hackensack to the president of congress hackensack    november      sir i have not been yet able to obtain a particular account of the unhappy affair of the   th nor of the terms on which the garrison surrendered the intelligence that has come to hand is not so full and accurate as i could wish one of the artillery and whose information is most direct who escaped on sunday night says the enemys loss was very considerable especially in the attack made above the fort by the division of hessians that marched from kingsbridge and where lieut colo rawlings of the late colo stevensons regiment was posted they burnt yesterday one or two houses on the heights and contiguous to the fort and appeared by advices from general greene to be moving in the evening their main body down towards the city whether they will close the campaign without attempting something more or make an incursion into jersey must be determined by the events themselves as fort lee was always considered as only necessary in conjunction with that on the east side of the river to preserve the communication across and to    prevent the enemy from a free navigation it has become of no importance by the loss of the other or not so material as to employ a force for its defences being viewed in this light and apprehending that the stores there would be precariously situated their removal has been determined on to bound brook above brunswick prince town springfield and acquankinac bridge as places that will not be subject to sudden danger in case the enemy should pass the river and which have been thought proper as a repository for some of our stores of provisions and forage the troops belonging to the flying camp under genls heard and beall with what remains of genl ewings brigade are now at fort lee where they will continue till the stores are got away by the time that is effected their term of enlistment will be near expiring and if the enemy should make a push in this quarter the only troops that there will be to oppose em will be hands hazlets the regiments from virginia and that lately smallwoods—the latter greatly reduced by the losses it sustained on long island c and sickness nor are the rest by any means complete in addition to these i am told there are a few of the militia of this state which have been called in by governor livingston i shall make such a disposition of the whole at brunswick and at the intermediate posts as shall seem most likely to guard against the designs of the enemy and to prevent them making an irruption or foraging with detached parties    the inclosed letter from cols miles and atlee will shew congress the distressed situation of our prisoners in new york and will become greater every day by the cold inclement season that is approaching it will be happy if some expedient can be adopted by which they may be furnished with necessary blankets and cloathing humanity and the good of the service require it i think the mode suggested by these gentlemen for establishing a credit appears as likely to succeed and as eligible as any that occurs to me it is probable many articles that may be wanted can be obtained there and upon better terms than elsewhere in respect to provision their allowance perhaps is as good as the situation of general howes stores will admit of it has been said of late by deserters and others that they were rather scant by a letter from the paymaster general of the   th he says there will be a necessity that large and early remittances should be made him the demands when the troops now in service are dismissed will be extremely great besides the bounty to recruits will require a large supply and he adds that the commissary general has informed him that between this and the last of december he shall have occasion for a million of dollars   st—the unhappy affair of the   th has been succeeded by further misfortunes yesterday morning a large body of the enemy landed between dobbs ferry and fort lee  their object was evidently    to inclose the whole of our troops and stores that lay between the north and heckenseck rivers which form a very narrow neck of land for this purpose they formed and marched as soon as they had ascended the high ground towards the fort upon the first information of their having landed and of their movements our men were ordered to meet them but finding their numbers greatly superior and that they were extending themselves to seize on the passes over the river it was thought prudent to withdraw our men which was effected and their retreat secured we lost the whole of the cannon that was at the fort except two twelve pounders and a great deal of baggage—between two and three hundred tents about a thousand barrells of flour and other stores in the quarter masters department this loss was inevitable as many of the stores has been removed as circumstances and time would admit of the ammunition had been happily got away our present situation between hackensack and passaic rivers being exactly similar to our late one and our force here by no means adequate to an opposition that will promise the smallest probability of success we are taking measures to retire over the waters of the latter where the best disposition will be formed that circumstances will admit of by colo cadwalader who has been permitted by genl howe to return to his friends  i am informed    the surrender of the garrison on the   th was on the common terms as prisoners of war the loss of the hessians about three hundred privates and twenty seven officers killed and wounded about forty of the british troops and two or three officers the loss on our side but inconsiderable    your favor of the   th was duly received my letter to the board of war on the subject of the return of the waldeckers i presume you will have seen  george washington    november      hackinsac majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee hackinsac    november      dear general it must be painful to you as well as to us that i have no news to send you but of a melancholy nature yesterday morning the enemy landed a large body of troops below dobbss ferry and advanced very rapidly to the fort called by your name i immediately went over and as the fort was not tenable on this side and we were in a narrow neck of land the passes out of which the enemy were attempting to seize i directed the troops consisting of bealls heards the remainder of ewings brigades and some other parts of broken regiments to move over to the west side of hackinsac river a considerable quantity of stores and some artillery have fallen into the enemys hands we have no account of their movements this morning but as this country is almost    a dead flat and we have not an intrenching tool and not above three thousand men and they much broken and dispirited not only with our ill success but the loss of their tents and baggage i have resolved to avoid any attack though by so doing i must leave a very fine country open to their ravages or a plentiful storehouse from which they will draw voluntary supplies your favor of the   th is just come to hand i approve of your step with respect to the rhode island officers as i am unacquainted with their merits i was obliged to leave the determination of the matter much to genl greene hoping i confess that he would make an arrangement acceptable to his countrymen however i am satisfied with what you have done and must leave it upon that footing with respect to your situation i am very much at a loss what now to determine there is such a change of circumstances since the date of your letter as seems to call for a change of measures your post undoubtedly will answer some important purposes but whether so many or so great as your removal is well worthy of consideration you observe that it prevents a fine fertile country from affording them supplies but now they have one much more so and more contiguous they have already traversed a part of that country leaving little behind them is it probable they will return if not the distance must be too great in winter time to render it effectually serviceable upon the whole therefore i am of opinion and the gentlemen about me concur in it    that the public interest requires your coming over to this side of the hudson with the continental troops leaving fellowss and wadsworths brigades to take care of the stores during their short stay at the expiration of which i suppose they will set out for home  my reasons for this measure which i think must have weight with you are that the enemy are evidently changing the seat of war to this side of the north river that this country therefore will expect the continental army to give them what support they can and failing in this they will cease to depend upon or support a force from which no protection is given to them it is therefore of the utmost importance that at least an appearance of force should be made to keep this province in the connexion with the others if that should not continue it is much to be feared that its influence on pennsylvania would be very considerable and more and more endanger our public interest unless therefore some new event should occur or some more cogent reason present itself to the contrary i would have you move over by the easiest and best passage i am sensible your numbers will not be large and that perhaps it may not be agreeable to the troops as to the first report will exaggerate them and preserve an appearance of an army which will at least have an effect to encourage the desponding here and as to the other you will doubtless represent to them that in duty    and gratitude their service is due wherever the enemy make the greatest impression or seem to intend so to do        george washington    november      aquackenonk bridge governor livingston to governor livingston new jersey aquackenonk bridge    november      sir i have this moment arrivedat this place with general bealls and general heards brigades from maryland and jersey and part of general ewings  from pennsylvania three other regiments left to guard  0 the passes upon hackinsac river and to serve as covering parties are expected up this evening after the unfortunate loss of fort washington it was determined to evacuate fort lee in a great measure as it was in a manner useless in obstructing the passage of the north river without the assistance of fort washington the ammunition and some other stores were accordingly removed but before we could effect our purpose the enemy landed yesterday morning in very considerable numbers about six miles above the fort their intent evidently was to form a line across from the place of their landing to hackinsac bridge and thereby hem in the whole garrison between the north and hackinsac rivers however we were lucky enough to gain the bridge before them by which means we saved all our men but were obliged to leave some hundred barrels of flour most of our cannon and a considerable parcel of tents and baggage finding we were in the same danger of being pent up between hackinsac and passaic rivers that we had been between the north and hackinsac and finding the country from its levelness and openness unfit for making a stand it was determined to draw the whole of our force over to this side of the river where we can watch the operations of the enemy without danger of their surrounding us or making a lodgment in our rear but as our numbers are still very inadequate to that of the enemy i imagine i shall be obliged to fall down towards brunswic and form a junction with the troops already in that    quarter under the command of lord stirling as the term of the enlistment of the flying camp belonging to jersey pennsylvania and maryland is near expiring it will occasion so great a diminution of my army that i submit it to your judgment whether it would not be proper for you to call together such a number of militia as in conjunction with the troops i shall have left will serve to cover the country and stop the progress of the enemy if they should attempt to penetrate if the weather continues favorable i am apprehensive that they will attempt to make amends for the slowness of their operations at the beginning of the campaign i have the honor to be c     george washington    november      newark majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee newark    november      dear sir by the negligent and infamous conduct of the post rider the eastern mail of friday was brought to hackensac and there stopped to fall into the hands of the enemy supposing it may have contained some letters from you of a public nature i have thought it proper to give you the earliest notice that you may guard against any advantages the enemy may expect to derive from the accident i perceive by your letter to col reed that you have entirely mistaken my views in ordering troops from gen heaths division to this quarter the posts and passes in the highlands are of such infinite importance that they should not be subjected to the least possible degree of risk col reeds second letter will have sufficiently explained my intention upon this subject and pointed out to you that it was your division which i wanted and wish to march as the enemy have possessed themselves of the usual route of dobbs ferry and hackensac it will be    necessary for you to choose some back way in which you and your troops may come secure i doubt not they will try to intercept you if this precaution is not used and therefore have been induced to mention it i would also mention the necessity of my hearing frequently from you in the course of your march in order to a due regulation of matters and that i may know how to conduct myself i am c p s i have received your favor of the  0th and feel with you the distresses of the army for want of necessary cloathing and covering i have pointed this out to congress several times how to remedy it i know not from the number of prizes taken at the eastward i should suppose the troops from thence could have been much better provided with necessaries than from the more southern states where they have not the same advantages of an open navigation     george washington    november      newark majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee newark    november      dear sir i last night received the favor of your letter of the   th my former letters were so full and explicit as to the necessity of your marching as early as possible that it is unnecessary to add more on that head i confess i expected you would have been sooner in motion the force here when joined by yours will not be adequate to any great opposition at present it is weak and it has been more owing to the badness of the weather that the enemys progress has been checked than to any resistance we could make they are now pushing this way part of em have passed the passaic their plan is not entirely unfolded but i shall not be surprised if philadelphia should turn out the object of their movement the distress of the troops for want of cloathes i feel much but what can i do having formed an enterprise against rogers c i wish you may have succeeded i am c george washington  0 november      brunswic to the president of congress brunswic  0 november      sir i have been honored with your favor of the   th and with the enclosures by which i perceive the    measures that have been adopted for forwarding a reinforcement of militia their arrival is much to be wished the situation of our affairs being truly alarming and such as demands the earliest aids  as general mifflins presence may have a happy influence on the disposition and temper of many of the associators i shall not direct his return so long as he can be done without and till it becomes indispensably necessary  on thursday morning i left newark and arrived here yesterday with the troops that were there it was the opinion of all the generals who were with me that a retreat to this place was requisite and founded in necessity as our force was by no means sufficient to make a stand with the least probability of success against an enemy much superior in numbers and whose advanced guards were entering the town by the time our rear got out it was the wish of all to have remained there longer and to have halted before we came thus far but upon due consideration of our strength the circumstances attending the enlistment of a great part of our little force and the frequent advices that the enemy were embarking or about to embark another detachment for staten island with a view of landing    at amboy to coöperate with this which seemed to be confirmed by the information of some persons who came from the island that they were collecting and impressing all the wagons they could find it was judged necessary to proceed till we came here not only to prevent their bringing a force to act upon our front and rear but also that we might be more convenient to oppose any troops they might land at south amboy which may be conjectured to be an object they had in view this conjecture too had probability and some advices to support it  i hoped we should meet with large and early succors by this time but as yet no great number of the militia of this state has come in nor have i much reason to expect that any considerable aid will be derived from the counties which lie beyond this river and in which the enemy are their situation will prevent it in a great measure from those parts where they are provided the inclinations of the people were good added to this i have no assurances that more than a very few of the troops composing the flying camp will remain after the time of their engagement is out so far from it i am told that some of general ewings brigade who stand engaged to the  st of january are now going away if those go whose service expires this day our force will be reduced to a mere handful from intelligence received this morning one division of the enemy was    advanced last night as far as elizabethtown and that some of their quartermasters had proceeded about four or five miles on this side to provide barns for their accommodation other accounts say another division composed of hessians are on the road through springfield and are reported to have reached that place last night i do not know how far their views extend but i doubt not that they mean to push every advantage resulting from the small number and state of our troops i early began to forward part of the stores from this place towards philadelphia many are gone the rest we are moving and hope to secure i am c  p s i have wrote to govr livingston who is exerting himself to throw in every assistance and to have guards placed at the ferries to prevent the return of the soldiers who are not discharged     george washington  0 november      brunswic to the board of war headquarters brunswic  0 november      gentlemen i am to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the   th   th and   d instant which from the unsettled situation of our affairs i have not been able to answer before that of the   th incloses a list of stores taken in the hancock and adams continental ship and carried into dartmouth in new england with a resolve of congress to deliver the muskets powder lead and flints to my order as the other articles of the cargo will be full as useful to the army as those included in the resolve i would advise that directions be given to have the whole cargo removed from dartmouth to some secure place in the neighborhood of philadelphia and there deposited till called for it is by no means proper that so great a quantity of military stores should be lodged with the army especially at present as we know not today where we shall be obliged to remove tomorrow and that will in all probability be the case while the enemy continue with a light army on this side of the north river     in answer to that part of yours of the   th in which you ask my advice as to the propriety of enlisting prisoners of war i would just observe that in my opinion it is neither consistent with the rules of war nor politic nor can i think that because our enemies have committed an unjustifiable action by enticing and in some instances intimidating our men into their service we ought to follow their example before i had the honor of yours on this subject i had determined to remonstrate to general howe on this head as to those few who have already enlisted i would not have them again withdrawn and sent in because they might be subjected to punishment but i would have the practice discontinued in future if you will revert to the capitulation of st johns and chamblee you will find an express stipulation against the enlisting of the prisoners taken there i remarked that the enlistment of prisoners was not a politic step my reason is this that in time of danger i have always observed such persons most backward for fear i suppose of falling into the hands of their former masters from whom they expect no mercy and this fear they are apt to communicate to their fellowsoldiers they are also most ready to desert when any action is expected hoping by carrying intelligence to secure their peace  i met captain hesketh on the road and as  0 the situation of his family did not admit of delay i permitted him to go immediately to new york not having the least doubt but general howe will make a return of any officer of equal rank who shall be required i am c george washington   december      brunswic governor livingston to governor livingston brunswic   december      dear sir i wrote to you yesterday but as from every information of the motions of the enemy their intent seems plainly directed through this state and then on to philadelphia i cannot help calling on you in the most urgent manner and begging you to fall upon proper means to draw forth the strength of your province to my support the enemys advanced parties were last night at bonhamtown four miles on this side of woodbridge  they are impressing wagons and horses and collecting cattle and sheep which is a further proof of their intent to march a considerable distance unless my force therefore is considerably augmented it will be impossible for me to make any stand at this place when the enemy advance as i have not including general williamsons militia say  000 more than four thousand men the militia from the counties of morris and    sussex turn out slowly and reluctantly whether from the want of officers of spirit to encourage them or your summons not being regularly sent to them i cannot say but i have reason to believe that there has been a deficiency in both cases designing men have been purposely sent among them to influence some and intimidate others and unless gentlemen of spirit and character will appear among them and rouse them little can be expected i wrote to general williamson last night and pressed him to exert himself but i have reason to believe he has not the confidence of the people so much as could be wished my accounts of the reinforcements to be expected from pennsylvania are very encouraging but from the distance and necessary delays attending a sudden march i cannot look for them under a week or ten days in which time the enemy will have reached the delaware at least if not opposed by more than my present numbers general lee is on his march down to join me but if the enemy should throw in a body of men between us he will be obliged to make a considerable circuit to avoid them the boats and craft all along the delaware side should be secured particularly the durham boats used for the transportation of produce down the river parties should be sent to all the landings to have them removed to the other side hauled up and put under proper guards one such boat would transport a regiment of men i am c     george washington   december      brunswic majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee brunswic   december      dear sir the enemy are advancing and have got as far as woodbridge and amboy and from information not to be doubted they mean to push for philadelphia the force i have with me is infinitely inferior in numbers and such as cannot give or promise the least successful opposition it is greatly reduced by the departure of the maryland flying camp men and by sundry other causes  i must entreat you to hasten your march as much as possible or your arrival may be too late to answer any valuable purpose your    route nor the place to join me i cannot particularize in these respects you must be governed by circumstances and the intelligence you receive let the former be secure i hope to meet a considerable reinforcement of pennsylvania associators it is said they seem spirited upon this occasion i am dear sir yours c george washington   december      princeton to the president of congress princeton   december      sir i arrived here this morning with our troops between eight and nine oclock when i received the honor of your letter of the  st with its inclosures when the enemy first landed on this side the north river i apprehended that they meant to make a push this way and knowing that the force which i had was not sufficient to oppose em i wrote to genl lee to cross with the several continental regiments in his division and hoped he would have arrived before now by some means or other he has been delayed i suppose he has passed the river as his letter of the   th ulto mentioned that he had marched a brigade the day before and should follow the next himself  the remainder of the troops i conceived necessary to guard the several passes thro the highlands nor do i think they can be called from thence their number is very small being reduced to very few by the departure of the troops who stood engaged till the  0th ulto    i have c    george washington   december      trenton to the president of congress headquarters trenton   december       sir i arrived here myself yesterday morning with the main body of the army having left lord stirling with two brigades at princeton and that neighborhood to watch the motions of the enemy and give notice of their approach i am informed that they had not entered brunswic yesterday morning at nine oclock but were on the opposite side of the rariton immediately on my arrival here i ordered the removal of all the military and other stores and baggage over the delaware a great quantity is already got over and as soon as the boats come up from philadelphia we shall load them by which means i hope to have every thing secured this night and tomorrow if we are not disturbed after being disencumbered of my baggage and stores my future situation will depend entirely upon circumstances i have not heard a word from general lee since the   th of last month which surprises me not a little as i have despatched daily expresses to him desiring to know when i might look for him this makes me fearful that my letters have not reached him i am informed by report that general st clair has joined him with three or four regiments from the northward to know the truth of this and also when i may expect him and with what numbers i have this minute despatched colonel stewart general    gatess aiddecamp to meet general lee and bring me an account  i look out earnestly for the reinforcement from philadelphia i am in hopes that if we can draw a good head of men together it will give spirits to the militia of this state who have as yet afforded me little or no assistance nor can i find that they are likely to do much general heard has just informed me that a person on whose veracity he can depend has reported to him that on sunday last he counted a hundred and seventeen sail of ships going out of the hook you may depend upon being advised instantly of any further movement in the enemys army or that of mine i have the honor to be c     george washington   december      trenton to the president of congress trenton   december      sir as nothing but necessity obliged me to retire before the enemy and leave so much of the jerseys unprotected i conceive it my duty and it corresponds with my inclination to make head against them so soon as there shall be the least probability of doing it with propriety that the country might in some measure be covered i left two brigades consisting of the five virginia regiments and that of delaware containing in the whole about twelve hundred men fit for duty under the command of lord stirling and general stephen  at princeton till the baggage and stores could cross the delaware or the troops under their respective commands should be forced from thence i shall now having removed the greatest part of the above articles face about with such troops as are here fit for service and march back to princeton and there govern myself by circumstances and the movements of general lee at any event the enemys progress may be retarded by this means if they intend to come    on and the peoples fears in some measure quieted if they do not sorry i am to observe however that the frequent calls upon the militia of this state the want of exertion in the principal gentlemen of the country or a fatal supineness and insensibility of danger till it is too late to prevent an evil that was not only foreseen but foretold have been the causes of our late disgraces if the militia of this state had stepped forth in season and timely notice they had we might have prevented the enemys crossing the hackinsac although without some previous notice of the time and place it was impossible to have done this at the north river we might with equal probability of success have made a stand at brunswic on the rariton but as both these rivers were fordable in a variety of places being kneedeep only it required many men to defend the passes and these we had not at hackinsac our force was insufficient because a part was at elizabethtown amboy and brunswic guarding a coast which i thought most exposed to danger and at brunswic because i was disappointed in my expectation of militia and because on the day of the enemys approach and probably the occasion of it the term of the jersey and maryland brigades service expired neither of which would consent to stay an hour longer these among ten thousand other instances might be adduced to show the disadvantages of short enlistments and the little dependence upon militia in times of real danger but as yesterday cannot be recalled    i will not dwell upon a subject which no doubt has given much uneasiness to congress as well as extreme pain and anxiety to myself my first wish is that congress may be convinced of the impropriety of relying upon the militia and of the necessity of raising a larger standing army than what they have voted the saving in the article of stores provisions and in a thousand other things by having nothing to do with militia unless in cases of extraordinary exigency and such as could not be expected in the common course of events would amply support a large army which well officered would be daily improving instead of continuing a destructive expensive and disorderly mob i am clear in the opinion that if forty thousand men had been kept in constant pay since the first commencement of hostilities and the militia had been excused from doing duty during that period the continent would have saved money when i reflect on the losses we have sustained for want of good troops the certainty of this is placed beyond a doubt in my mind in such a case the militia who have been harassed and tired by repeated calls upon them and farming and manufactures in a manner suspended would upon any pressing emergency have run with alacrity to arms whereas the cry now is they may be as well ruined in one way as another and with difficulty they are obtained i mention these things to show that in my opinion if any dependence is placed in the militia another year congress will be deceived when danger is a little removed from them they will not turn out at all    when it comes home to them the wellaffected instead of flying to arms to defend themselves are busily employed in removing their families and effects whilst the disaffected are concerting measures to make their submission and spread terror and dismay all around to induce others to follow their example daily experience and abundant proofs warrant this information i shall this day reinforce lord stirling with about twelve hundred men which will make his number about two thousand four hundred tomorrow i mean to repair to princeton myself and shall order the pennsylvania troops who are not yet arrived except part of the german battalion and a company of light infantry to the same place by my last advices the enemy are still at brunswic and the account adds that general howe was expected at elizabethtown with a reinforcement to erect the kings standard and demand a submission of this state i can only give this as a report brought from the enemys camp by some of the country people i have the honor to be c  george washington   december      trenton to the president of congress trenton   december      sir i have not received any intelligence of the enemys movements since my letter of yesterday from every information they still remain at brunswic except some of their parties which are advanced a  0 small distance on this side today i shall set out for princeton myself unless something should occur to prevent me which i do not expect by a letter of the  th inst from a mr caldwell a clergyman and a staunch friend to the cause who has fled from elizabethtown and taken refuge in the mountains about ten miles from hence i am informed that general or lord howe was expected in that town to publish pardon and peace his words are i have not seen his proclamation but can only say he gives sixty days of grace and pardons from the congress down to the committee no one man in the continent is to be denied his mercy in the language of this good man the lord deliver us from his mercy  your letter of the  d by major livingston was duly received before it came to hand i had written to general howe about governor franklins exchange but am not certain whether the letter could not be recovered i despatched a messenger instantly for that purpose  i have the honor to be c     george washington   december      to the president of congress mr berkeleys summerseat   december      sir colonel reed would inform you of the intelligence which i first met with on the road from trenton to princeton yesterday  before i got to the latter i received a second express informing me that as the enemy were advancing by different routes and attempting by one to get in the rear of our troops which were there and whose numbers were small and the place by no means defensible they had judged it prudent to retreat to trenton the retreat was accordingly made and since to this side of the river this information i thought it my duty to communicate as soon as possible as there is not a moments time to be lost in assembling such force as can be collected and as the object of the enemy cannot now be doubted in the smallest degree indeed i shall be out in my conjecture for it is only conjecture if the late embarkation at new york is not for delaware river to coöperate with the army under the immediate command of general howe who i am informed from good authority is with the british troops and his whole force upon this route i have no certain intelligence of general lee although i have sent frequent expresses to him and lately colonel humpton to bring me some accurate accounts of his situation i last night despatched    another gentleman to him major hoops desiring he would hasten his march to the delaware in which i would provide boats near a place called alexandria for the transportation of his troops i cannot account for the slowness of his march  in the disordered and moving state of the army i cannot get returns but from the best accounts we had between three thousand and three thousand five hundred men before the philadelphia militia and german battalion arrived they amount to about two thousand i have c george washington   december      to the president of congress headquarters trenton falls   december      sir i did myself the honor of writing to you yesterday and informing you that i had removed the troops to this side of the delaware soon after the enemy made their appearance and their van entered just as our rear guard quitted we had removed all our stores except a few boards from the best information they are in two bodies    one at and near trenton the other some miles higher up and inclining towards delaware but whether with intent to cross there or throw themselves between general lee and me is yet uncertain i have this morning detached lord stirling and his brigade to take post at the different landing places and prevent them from stealing a march upon us from above for i am informed if they cross at corrils ferry or thereabouts they are as near to philadelphia as we are here from several accounts i am led to think that the enemy are bringing boats with them if so it will be impossible for our small force to give them any considerable opposition in the passage of the river indeed they make a feint at one place and by a sudden removal carry their boats higher or lower before we can bring our cannon to play upon them under these circumstances the security of philadelphia should be our next object from my own remembrance but more from information for i never viewed the ground i should think that a communication of lines and redoubts might soon be formed from the delaware to the schuylkill on the north entrance of the city the lines to begin on the schuylkill side about the heights of springatebury and run eastward to delaware upon the most advantageous and commanding grounds if something of this kind is not done the enemy might in case any misfortune should befall us march directly in and take possession we have ever found that lines however slight are very formidable to them they would at least give a check till the people could recover from the fright and consternation    that naturally attend the first appearance of an enemy in the mean time every step should be taken to collect a force not only from pennsylvania but from the neighboring states if we can keep the enemy from entering philadelphia and keep the communication by water open for supplies we may yet make a stand if the country will come to our assistance till our new levies can be collected if the measure of fortifying the city should be adopted some skilful person should immediately view the grounds and begin to trace out the lines and works i am informed there is a french engineer of eminence in philadelphia at this time if so he will be the most proper  i have the honor to be c p s i have just recd the enclosed from genl heath general mifflin is this moment come up and tells me that all the military stores yet remain in philadelphia this makes the immediate fortifying of the city so necessary that i have desired general mifflin to return to take charge of the stores and have ordered majorgeneral putnam immediately down to superintend the works and give the necessary directions  george washington  0 december      trenton falls majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee trenton falls  0 december      dear sir i last night received your favor by colonel humpton and were it not for the weak and feeble state of    the force i have i should highly approve of your hanging on the rear of the enemy and establishing the post you mention but when my situation is directly the opposite of what you suppose it to be and when general howe is pressing forward with the whole of his army except the troops that were lately embarked and a few besides left at new york to possess himself of philadelphia i cannot but request and entreat you and this too by the advice of all the general officers with me to march and join me with your whole force with all possible expedition the utmost exertions that can be made will not be more than sufficient to save philadelphia without the aid of your force i think there is but little if any prospect of doing it i refer you to the route major hoops would inform you of the enemy are now extended along the delaware at several places by a prisoner who was taken last night i am told that at pennington there are two battalions of infantry three of grenadiers the hessian grenadiers the fortysecond of highlanders and two others their object doubtless is to pass the river above us or to prevent your joining me i mention this that you may avail yourself of the information do come on your arrival may be happy and if it can be effected without delay it may be the means of preserving a city whose loss must prove of the most fatal consequence to the cause of america i am c     p s pray exert your influence and bring with you all the jersey militia you possibly can let them not suppose their state is lost or in any danger because the enemy are pushing through it if you think general st clair or general maxwell would be of service to command them i would send either     george washington  0 december      lund washington to lund washington falls of delaware south side  0 december      dear lund       i wish to heaven it was in my power to give you a more favorable account of our situation than it is our numbers quite inadequate to the task of opposing that part of the army under the command of general howe being reduced by sickness desertion and political deaths on or before the first instant and having no assistance from the militia were obliged to retire before the enemy who were perfectly well informed of our situation till we came to this place where i have no idea of being able to make a stand as my numbers till joined by the    philadelphia militia did not exceed three thousand men fit for duty now we may be about five thousand to oppose howes whole army that part of it excepted which sailed under the command of gen clinton i tremble for philadelphia nothing in my opinion but gen lees speedy arrival who has been long expected though still at a distance with about three thousand men can save it we have brought over and destroyed all the boats we could lay our hands on upon the jersey shore for many miles above and below this place but it is next to impossible to guard a shore for sixty miles with less than half the enemys numbers when by force or strategem they may suddenly attempt a passage in many different places at present they are encamped or quartered along the other shore above and below us rather this place for we are obliged to keep a face towards them for fifteen miles    december    ten miles above the falls    i have since moved up to this place to be more convenient to our great and extensive defences of this river hitherto by our destruction of the boats and vigilance in watching the fords of the river above the falls which are now rather high we have prevented them from crossing but how long we shall be able to do it god only knows as they are still hovering about the river and if every thing else fails will wait till the  st of january when there will be no other men to oppose them but militia none of which but those from philadelphai mentioned    in the first part of the letter are yet come although i am told some are expected from the back counties when i say none but militia i am to except the virginia regiments and the shattered remains of smallwoods which by fatigue want of clothes c are reduced to nothing—weedons which was the strongest not having more than between one hundred and thirty to one hundred and forty men fit for duty the rest being in the hospitals the unhappy policy of short enlistments and a dependence upon militia will i fear prove the downfall of our cause though early pointed out with an almost prophetic spirit our cause has also received a severe blow in the captivity of gen lee unhappy man taken by his own imprudence going three or four miles from his own camp and within twenty of the enemy notice of which by a rascally tory was given a party of light horse seized him in the morning after travelling all night and carried him off in high triumph and with every mark of indignity not even suffering him to get his hat or surtout coat the troops that were under his command are not yet come up with us though they i think may be expected tomorrow a large part of the jerseys have given every proof of disaffection that they can do and this part of pennsylvania are equally inimical in short your imagination can scarce extend to a situation more distressing than mine our only dependence now is upon the speedy enlistment of a new army if this fails i think the game will be pretty well up as from disaffection and want of spirit and fortitude the inhabitants  0 instead of resistance are offering submission and taking protection from gen howe in jersey    i am c  george washington    december      to the president of congress headquarters falls of delaware    december      sir after i had wrote you yesterday i received certain information that the enemy after repairing crosswicks bridge had advanced a party of about five hundred to borden town by their taking this route it confirms me in my opinion that they have an intention to land between this and philadelphia as well as above if they can procure boats for the purpose i last night directed commodore seymour to station all his gallies between bordentown and philadelphia to give the earliest intelligence of any appearance of the enemy on the jersey shore  i yesterday rode up the river about    miles to lord stirlings post where i found a prisoner of the   d regiment who had been just brought in he informs me that lord cornwallis was at penny town with two battalions of grenadiers and three of light infantry all british the hessian grenadiers the   d highland regiment and two other battalions the names of which he did not remember he knew nothing of the reasons of their being assembled    there nor what were their future intentions but i last night received information from my lord stirling which had been brought in by his scouts which in some measure accounts for their being there they had made a forced march from trenton on sunday night to coryells ferry in hopes of surprising a sufficient number of boats to transport them but finding themselves disappointed had marched back to penny town where they remained yesterday from their several attempts to seize boats it does not look as if they had brought any with them as i was at one time informed i last night sent a person over to trenton to learn whether there was any appearance of building any but he could not perceive any preparations for a work of that kind so that i am in hopes if proper care is taken to keep all the craft out of their way they will find the crossing delaware a matter of considerable difficulty i received another letter from general lee last evening it was dated at chatham which i take to be near morris town the  th of this month he had then received my letter sent by major hoops but seemed still inclined to hang upon the enemys rear to which i should have no objection had i a sufficient force to oppose them in front but as i have not at present nor do i see much probability of further reinforcement i have wrote to him in the most pressing terms to join me with all expedition     george washington    december      trenton falls to the president of congress trenton falls    december      sir i last night received the favor of mr thomsons letter enclosing the proceedings of congress of the   th instant as the publication of their resolve in my opinion will not lead to any good end but on the contrary may be attended with some bad consequences i shall take the liberty to decline inserting it in this days orders i am persuaded if the subject is taken up and reconsidered that congress will concur with me in sentiment i doubt not but there are some who have propagated the report but what if they have their remaining in or leaving philadelphia must be governed by circumstances and events if their departure should become necessary it will be right on the other hand if there should not be a necessity for it they will remain and their continuance will show the report to be the production of calumny and falsehood in a word sir i conceive it a matter that may be as well disregarded and that the removal or staying of congress depending entirely upon events should not have been the subject of a resolve     the intelligence we obtain respecting the movements and situation of the enemy is far from being so certain and satisfactory as i could wish though every probable means in my power and that i can devise are adopted for that purpose the latest i have received was from lord stirling last night he says that two grenadiers of the ineskilling regiment who were taken and brought in by some countrymen inform that gens howe cornwallis vaughan c with about  000 of the flying army were at penny town waiting for pontoons to come up with which they mean to pass the river near the blue mounts or at coryells ferry they believe the latter that the two battalions of guards now at brunswick and the hessian grenadiers chasseurs    and a regiment or two of british troops are at trenton captain miller of colonel hands regiment also informs me that a body of the enemy were marching to burlington on yesterday morning he had been sent over with a strong scouting party and at daybreak fell in with their advanced guards consisting of about  00 hessian troops who fired upon him before they were discovered but without any loss and obliged him to retreat with his party and to take boat the number of the whole he could not ascertain but they appeared to be considerable captain millers account is partly confirmed by commodore seymour who reports that four or five hundred of the enemy had entered the town upon the whole there can be no doubt but that philadelphia is their object and that they will pass the delaware as soon as possible happy should i be if i could see the means of preventing them at present i confess i do not all military writers agree that it is a work of great difficulty nay impracticable where there is any extent of coast to guard this is the case with us and we have to do it with a force small and inconsiderable and much inferior to that of the enemy perhaps congress have some hope and prospect of reinforcements i have no intelligence of the sort and wish to be informed on the subject our little handful is daily decreasing by sickness and other causes and without aid without considerable succors and exertions on the part of the people what can we reasonably look for or expect but an event that will be severely felt by    the common cause and that will wound the heart of every virtuous american the loss of philadelphia the subject is disagreeable but yet it is true i will leave it wishing that our situation may become such as to do away the apprehensions which at this time seem to fill the minds of too many and with too much justice by a letter from general heath dated at peekskill the  th i am advised that lieutenantcolonel vose was then there with greatons bonds and porters regiments amounting in the whole to between five and six hundred men who were coming this way he adds that generals gates and arnold would be at goshen that night with starks poors and reads regiments but for what purpose he does not mention the enclosed extract of a letter which i received last night contains intelligence of an agreeable nature i wish to hear its confirmation by the arrival of the several prizes that with clothing and arms will be an invaluable acquisition i shall be glad to be advised of the mode i am to observe in paying the officers whether they are to be allowed to draw the pay lately established and from what time or how long they are to be paid under the old establishment a pay roll which was presented yesterday being made up for the new has given rise to these propositions upon my objecting to it i was told that congress or the board of war had established the precedent by paying the  th regiment of virginia troops commanded by colo buckner agreeable to the latter as they came thro philadelphia i have the honor c    george washington    december      governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters trenton falls    december      sir i was a few days ago favored with yours of the  0th of last month and this is the first opportunity that has afforded me the pleasure of answering it the event has shown that my opinion of general howes intentions to make an excursion into jersey was not ill founded immediately after the reduction of fort washington he threw a body of men consisting of about six thousand over the north river with an intention to surprise the garrison of fort lee but they withdrew before he could accomplish his purpose finding the few troops i had with me insufficient to oppose the enemy and knowing that my numbers would still be diminished by the expiration of the service of the flying camp men from jersey maryland and pennsylvania which would take place on the last day of november it was determined to retreat as far as brunswic where i hoped to receive a reinforcement from the militia of the state of new jersey sufficient to check the further progress of the enemy but in this i was cruelly disappointed the inhabitants of this state either from fear or disaffection almost to a man refused to turn out and i could not bring together above one thousand men and even on these very little dependence was to be put my numbers were now reduced to three thousand men and that of the enemy considerably increased by fresh reinforcements i had sent general mifflin down to philadelphia to raise what    force he could in that province and to send them on with all speed to my assistance i fell down myself to trenton in order to wait for supplies hoping that such numbers would come on from pennsylvania as would enable me to turn upon the enemy and recover most of the ground which they had gained general mifflin was very successful with the militia of philadelphia who turned out in a very spirited manner and he immediately marched about fifteen hundred men up to trenton but the remainder of the province continues in a state of supineness nor do i see any likelihood of their stirring to save their own capital which is undoubtedly general howes great object  the delaware now parts the two armies and nothing hinders the passage of the enemy but the want of boats which we have been lucky enough to secure general lee is still in the rear of the enemy with about four thousand men with whom he is on his march to join me if he can effect this junction our army will again make a respectable appearance and such as i hope will disappoint the enemy in their plan upon philadelphia i sent down general putnam a few days ago to begin upon some works for the defence of that city upon the salvation of which    our cause almost depends i am informed that the enlistment of the new army goes on very successfully to the eastward and southward little or nothing can be expected from new york or jersey which are for the most part in the hands of the enemy every thing must depend upon the regular force we can bring into the field in the spring for i find from fatal experience that militia serve only to delude us as my distance from the eastern governments makes me ignorant of their present circumstances i will not undertake to direct the disposition of the four regiments you have ordered to be raised till the   th of march i would only recommend if they can be spared that they should march and take post at the highlands and at the forts upon the north river as much depends still upon keeping possession of the upper part of that river i highly approve of your plan for supplying your new army with necessaries our old one has suffered considerably for the want of some such wholesome regulations and you may depend upon my giving due countenance to such a commendable scheme i am with great truth and sincerity sir yours c     george washington    december      to the president of congress headquarters trenton falls    december      sir the apparent designs of the enemy being to avoid this ferry and land their troops above and below us have induced me to remove from this place the greater part of the troops and throw them into a different disposition on the river whereby i hope not only to be more able to impede their passage but also to avoid the danger of being inclosed in this angle of the river and notwithstanding the extended appearances of the enemy on the other side made at least in part to divert our attention from any particular point as well as to harrass us by fatigue i cannot divest myself of the opinion that their principal design is to ford the river somewhere above trenton to which design i have had particular respect in the new arrangement wherein i am so far happy as to have the concurrence of the general officers at this place four brigades of the army under generals lord  0 stirling mercer stephen and defermoy extend from yardleys up to coryells ferry posted in such a manner as to guard every suspicious part of the river and to afford assistance to each other in case of attack genl ewing with the flying camp of pennsylvania and a few jersey troops under general dickinson are posted from yardleys ferry down to the ferry opposite bordentown colo cadwalader with the pennsylvania militia occupies the ground above and below the mouth of neshaminy river as far down as dunks ferry at which place colonel nixon is posted with the  d battalion of philadelphia a proper quantity of the artillery is appointed to each brigade and i have ordered small redoubts to be thrown up opposite every place where there is a possibility of fording i shall remove further up the river to be near the main body of my small army with which every possible opposition shall be given to any further approach of the enemy towards philadelphia as genl armstrong has a good deal of influence in this state and our present force is small and inconsiderable i think he cannot be better employed than to repair to the counties where his interest lies to animate the people promote the recruiting service and encourage the militia to come in he will also be able to form a proper judgment of the places suitable for magazines of provision to be collected i have requested him to wait upon congress on this subject and if genl smallwood should go to maryland on the same business i think it would have a    happy effect he is popular and of great influence and i am persuaded would contribute greatly to that states furnishing her quota of men in a little time he is now in philadelphia i have c george washington    december      keiths majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates headquarters at keiths    december      dear sir before this comes to hand you will have heard of the melancholy situation of our affairs i do not mean now to detail our misfortunes with a handful of men compared to the enemys force we have been pushed through the jerseys without being able to make the smallest opposition and compelled to pass the delaware general howe is now on the other side and beyond all question means if possible to possess himself of philadelphia his troops are extended from pennington to burlington the main body from the best advices at the former and within the neighborhood of trenton i wish it were in my power to tell you that appearances were much against him at present i confess they are not but few of the militia of this state have yet come out except those belonging to the city nor have i any great hope of their assistance unless we can collect a respectable force in such case perhaps they will turn out and afford their aid i have heard that you are coming on with seven regiments this may have a happy effect and let me entreat you not to delay a moment in hastening to pittstown you will advise me of    your approaches and of the time you expect to be there that i may meet you with an express and inform you of your destination and such further movements as may be necessary i expect general lee will be there this evening or tomorrow who will be followed by general heath and his division if we can draw our forces together i trust under the smiles of providence we may yet effect an important stroke or at least prevent general howe from executing his plans philadelphia is now the object of our care you know the importance of it and the fatal consequences that must attend its loss i am persuaded no aid which you can give will be withheld a single instant your arrival may be a most happy circumstance the congress have adjourned to baltimore but previously resolved that philadelphia should be defended to the last extremity lord stirling is going over to meet general lee and concert with him a plan of operations i wish you could be there and would advise you not to wait the slow march of your troops i am dear sir yours c george washington    december      keiths lord stirling brigadiergeneral mercer brigadiergeneral stephen brigadiergeneral de fermoy to brigadiergenerals lord stirling mercer stephen and de fermoy instructions headquarters at keiths    december      lest the enemy should in some degree avail themselves of the knowledge for i do not doubt but they are well informed of every thing we do i did not care to be so particular in the general orders of this day as i mean to be in this letter to you as much time then would be lost should the enemy attempt crossing    the river at any pass within your guard in first sending you notice and in the troops to wait for orders what to do i would advise you to examine the whole river from the upper to the lower guard of your district and after forming an opinion of the most probable crossingplaces have those well watched and direct the regiments or companies most convenient to repair as they can be formed immediately to the point of attack and give the enemy all the opposition they possibly can every thing in a manner depends upon the defence at the waters edge in like manner one brigade is to support another without loss of time or waiting for orders from me i would also have you fix upon some central spot convenient to your brigade but in the rear a little and on some road leading into the back road to philadelphia for your unnecessary baggage wagons and stores that in case your opposition should prove ineffectual these things may not fall into the enemys hands but be got off and proceed over neshaminy bridge towards germantown agreeably to the determination of the board of officers the other day let me entreat you to find out some person who can be engaged to cross the river as a spy that we may if possible obtain some knowledge of the enemys situation movements and intention particular inquiry to be made by the person sent if any preparations are making to cross the river whether any boats are building and where whether any are coming over land from brunswic whether any great collection of horses is made and for what purpose expense must not be spared in procuring such intelligence and it will readily be paid by me we are in a neighborhood of very disaffected people equal care therefore should be taken that one of these persons does not undertake the business in order to betray us i am dear sir yours c george washington    december      bucks county governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters bucks county    december      sir i was last night favored with yours of the  th instant in a letter which i did myself the pleasure    to write to you two days ago i gave you a full account of my present situation and of the occurrences which have happened since i left the neighborhood of fort lee the want of the means of transportation has hitherto hindered the enemy from making any attempt to cross the delaware and i hope unless the course of the season entirely changes that the weather will soon prevent their making use of boats if they should build them your situation at the eastward is alarming and i wish it were in my power to afford you that assistance which is requisite  you must be sensible that it is impossible for me to detach any part of my small army when i have an enemy far superior in numbers to oppose but i have immediately countermanded the march of general heaths division who were coming down from peekskill it is ordered to return again to that place and hold itself ready to move as occasion may require general lees division is so necessary to support this part of the army that without its assistance we must inevitably be overpowered and philadelphia lost i have ordered general arnold who was on his way down from ticonderoga immediately to repair to new london or wherever his presence will be most necessary the troops who came down with him and general gates are already from the advices i have received so far advanced towards this army that to countermand    them now would be losing the small remainder of their services entirely as the time of their enlistment would expire before they could possibly reach you whereas by coming on they may in conjunction with my present force and that under general lee enable us to attempt a stroke upon the forces of the enemy who lie a good deal scattered and to all appearances in a state of security a lucky blow in this quarter would be fatal to them and would most certainly rouse the spirits of the people which are quite sunk by our late misfortunes in the interval between the dissolution of the old and the enlistment of the new army we must put our dependence on the public spirit and virtue of the people who i am sorry to say have manifested but too small a regard to their rights and liberties in the states of new jersey and pennsylvania the citizens of philadelphia excepted but i hope such a spirit still exists among your people as will convince these bold invaders that although they may by a superior naval force take possession of your seaport towns yet that they cannot penetrate and overrun your country with impunity i have the honor to be with great respect and esteem sir c p s i have just received a letter from general heath of the  0th instant in which he informs me that his division was to cross the north river on that day so that they must be at morristown by this time which is but fifty miles from hence upon this consideration i have changed my intention of countermanding    him for the same reasons as are given in my letter above respecting the troops under generals gates and arnold george washington    december      keiths majorgeneral lee to majorgeneral lee headquarters at keiths    december      dear sir i last night received your letter of the   th instant by major dehart i am much surprised that you should be in any doubt respecting the route you should take after the information you have had upon that head as well by letter as from major hoops who was despatched for the purpose a large number of boats was procured and is still retained at tinicum under a strong guard to facilitate your passage across the delaware i have so frequently mentioned our situation and the necessity of your aid that it is painful to me to add a word upon the subject let me once more request and entreat you to march immediately for pittstown which lies on the route that has been pointed out and is about eleven miles from tinicum ferry that is more on the flank of the enemy than where you are advise me of the time you will arrive there that a letter may be sent to you about your further destination and such other movements as may be necessary the enclosed for generals gates and arnold you will forward by an officer without delay the former i have requested to come on with the regiments under his command with all possible expedition the latter to go to the eastward in consequence of the intelligence    received from governor trumbull part of the enemy have advanced as far as burlington and their main body from the best information is in the neighborhood of trenton and at pennington the congress have adjourned from philadelphia to meet at baltimore on the  0th instant and sensible of the importance of the former have directed it to be defended to the utmost extremity to prevent the enemy from possessing it the fatal consequences that must attend its loss are but too obvious to every one your arrival may be the means of saving it nothing but a respectable force i am certain from melancholy experience can induce the militia to come in and give their aid the roebuck and a sloop of war have arrived in delaware bay and from the last advices were lying not far within the capes i have wrote to general heath to proceed with his troops to pittstown where i hope to hear of the arrival of general gates with the regiments that are with him in a short time if my information is true i am c  george washington    december      bucks county to the council of safety of pennsylvania headquarters bucks county    december      gentlemen with the utmost regret i must inform you of the loss our army has sustained by the captivity of general    lee who was made a prisoner on the morning of the   th by a party of seventy of the enemys lighthorse near a place called vealtown in the jerseys for the particulars i refer you to the enclosed from general sullivan the spirit of disaffection that appears in this country i think deserves your serious attention instead of giving any assistance in repelling the enemy the militia have not only refused to obey your general summons and that of their commanding officers but i am told exult at the approach of the enemy and on our late misfortunes i beg leave therefore to submit to your consideration whether such people are to be trusted with arms in their hands if they will not use them for us there is the greatest reason to apprehend they will against us if opportunity offers but even supposing they claimed a right of remaining neuter in my opinion we ought not to hesitate a moment in taking their arms which will be so much wanted in furnishing the new levies if such a step meet your approbation i leave to you to determine upon the mode if you think fit to empower me i will undertake to have it done as speedily and effectually as possible you must be sensible that the utmost secrecy is necessary both in your deliberations on and in the execution of a matter of this kind for if the thing should take wind the arms would presently be conveyed beyond our reach or rendered useless your favors of the   th and   th inst are this moment come to my hands i am glad to find from the    latter that the militia of lancaster county are in motion and i am in hopes that general mifflins appearance in the different counties will have as good an effect as it had in philadelphia i have received information that the body of the enemy which lay at pennington under lord cornwallis moved this morning back towards princeton if so it looks as if they were going into winterquarters and this corresponds with the account brought last night by a prisoner a servant belonging to general vaughans family who says that he heard his master talk of going soon into winterquarters the troops who lay at trenton are likewise filing off towards allentown and bordentown with their baggage which makes me conjecture they are taking the road to south amboy i have a number of small parties out to make discoveries and if the motions of the enemy are really such as i have mentioned above i shall soon have information of it in the mean time my troops are so stationed as to prevent them from crossing the river at any place without our knowledge but i am in great hopes that the disappointment in boats and the lateness of the season which now begins to put on the face of winter will prevent their making any attempt on philadelphia till spring this however should not in the least slacken your exertions in making the necessary preparations for the fortification and defence of the city by land and water for you may be assured that will be their first and great object in the spring i have the honor to be c  00 george washington    december      keiths to the president of congress headquarters keiths    december      sir about one oclock today i received a letter from genl sullivan a copy of which you have inclosed i will not comment on the melancholy intelligence which it contains only adding that i sincerely regret genl lees unhappy fate and feel much for the loss of my country in his captivity in respect to the enemy they have been industrious in their attempts to procure boats and small craft but as yet their efforts have not succeeded from the latest advices that i have of their movements by some prisoners and others they appear to be leaving trenton and to be filing off towards princeton and allen town what their designs are whether they mean to retreat or only a feint cannot be determined  i have parties out to watch their motions and to form if possible an accurate opinion of their plans our force since my last has received no augmentation of course by sickness and other causes has diminished but i am advised by a letter from the council of safety which just came to hand that cols burd and galbraeth are marching with their battalion of militia and also that some small parties are assembling in cumberland county   0  george washington    december      keiths to the president of congress headquarters at keiths    december      sir in a late letter which i had the honor of addressing you i took the liberty to recommend that more battalions should be raised for the new army than what had been voted having fully considered the matter i am more and more convinced not only of the propriety but of the necessity of the measure that the enemy will leave nothing unessayed in the course of the next campaign to reduce these states to the rule of a most lawless and insufferable tyranny must be obvious to every one and that the militia are not to be depended on or aid expected from them but in cases of the most pressing emergency is not to be doubted the first of these propositions is unquestionable and fatal experience has given her sanction to the truth of the latter indeed their lethargy of late and backwardness to turn out at this alarming crisis seem to justify an apprehension that  0  nothing can bring them from their homes for want of their assistance a large part of jersey has been exposed to ravage and to plunder nor do i know that pennsylvania would share a better fate could general howe effect a passage across the delaware with a respectable force these considerations have induced me to wish that no reliance except such as may arise from necessity should ever be had in them again and to make further mention to congress of the expediency of increasing their army i trust the measure will meet with their earliest attention had i leisure and were it necessary i could say much upon this head but as i have not and the matter is well understood i will not add much by augmenting the number of your battalions you will augment your force the officers of each will have their interest and influence and upon the whole their numbers will be much greater though they should not be complete added to this from the present confused state of jersey and the improper appointment of officers in many instances i have little or no expectation that she will be able to raise all the troops exacted from her though i think it might be done were suitable spirited gentlemen commissioned who would exert themselves and encourage the people many of whom from a failure in this instance and who are well disposed are making their submission in a word the next will be a trying campaign and as all that is dear and valuable may depend upon the issue of it i would advise that nothing should be omitted that shall seem necessary  0  to our success let us have a respectable army and such as will be competent to every exigency i will also add that the critical situation of our affairs and the dissolution of our present force now at hand require that every nerve and exertion be employed for recruiting the new battalions one part of general howes movements at this time i believe is with a design to distract us and prevent this business if the inclemency of the weather should force him into winterquarters he will not remain there longer than necessity shall oblige him he will commence his operations in a short space of time and in that time our levies must be made up to oppose him or i fear the most melancholy of all events must take place    the cloathing of the troops is a matter of infinite importance and if it could be accomplished would have a happy effect their distresses are extremely great many of em being entirely naked and most so thinly clad as to be unfit for service i must entreat congress to write to the agents and contractors upon this subject that every possible supply may be procured and forwarded with the utmost expedition i cannot attend to the business myself having more than i can possibly do besides   0  george washington    december      lieutenantgeneral howe to lieutenantgeneral howe headquarters    december      sir i would beg leave to recall your attention to the proposition for the exchange of prisoners in the several letters i have lately written on that subject and to inform you that i have not received such officers in exchange as were requested by me i am persuaded sir that this mistake has arisen from mr  0  commissary lorings  zeal to facilitate the business but i would at the same time desire that you would give him orders whenever any of your officers are sent in by me not to send others in exchange till he is furnished with a list from me of such as i would choose to prefer which shall always be done as soon as possible for as the prisoners seldom pass my headquarters on their way it is not in my power to transmit such lists by them without occasioning their delay if this mode is not complied with in future i shall be under the disagreeable necessity of stopping others from going in as my ideas and expectations are by no means answered by what has happened   0  i enclose you a list of   officers who were sent in from bristol on the   th and of two officers and two privates who accompany the present flag as the remainder of all those who were in the state of pennsylvania are on the road and expected here daily i shall defer making a demand of those i would chuse in exchange till the whole come up george washington    december      bucks county majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath headquarters bucks county    december      dear sir by a letter just received from the state of massachusetts copy of which you have enclosed i find that they had ordered six thousand militia to be immediately raised and appointed the place of rendezvous at danbury in connecticut where they are to meet general lincoln who is to take the command  0  you will perceive from the tenor of the letter that the appearance of the men of war and transports off the coast of new england did not seem to alter their intention of sending the militia forward but i am inclined to think if the descent should really be made they will find employ for them nearer home if this considerable reinforcement should arrive with you i do not know how you could better employ them or render more essential service to the cause than after keeping a sufficient force to guard the passes of the highlands by throwing such a number over into jersey as would cover the upper parts of that province and afford such support and assistance to the well affected as would encourage them to join you and keep the enemy within straiter bounds than they are at present you may depend that the great end they have in view is to spread themselves over as much country as they possibly can and thereby strike a damp into the spirits of the people which will effectually put a stop to the new enlistment of the army on which all our hopes depend and which they will most vigorously strive to effect to carry this plan into execution they have already extended themselves as far westward as the delaware and if the whole of your army continues on the east side of hudsons river they will have possession of all the country between that river and the delaware which includes the whole province of jersey and part of new york as soon as you find yourself in a situation to send a force into the upper parts of jersey i would have you immediately communicate your intentions  0  to the people with assurances that you will be ready to back and support them in any movements which they may make in your favor i am certain that the defection of the people in the lower part of jersey has been as much owing to the want of an army to look the enemy in the face as to any other cause though to be sure neither cost nor pains has been spared to influence them against us whatever steps you take in this affair i would wish you to consult and coöperate with general lincoln of whose judgment and abilities i entertain a very high opinion i would just add that your attention should likewise be paid to the country between peekskill and kingsbridge by affording some protection and countenance to the people there from whom you may draw supplies and perhaps some men for the new army particular attention should be paid to the bridge at croton river which secures your front i enclose to you a letter for general lincoln which please to forward to him wherever he may be i am dear sir yours c   0  george washington    december      john augustine washington to john augustine washington camp near the falls of trenton    december      dear brother owing to the number of letters i write the recollection of any particular one is destroyed but i think my last to you was by colonel woodford from hackinsac since that time and a little before our affairs have taken an adverse turn but not more than was to be expected from the unfortunate measures which had been adopted for the establishment of our army the retreat of the enemy from the white plains led me to think that they would turn their thoughts to the jerseys if no farther and induced me to cross the north river with some of the troops in order if possible to oppose them i expected   0 to have met at least five thousand men of the flying camp and militia instead of which i found less than one half of that number and no disposition in the inhabitants to afford the least aid this being perfectly well known to the enemy they threw over a large body of troops which pushed us from place to place till we were obliged to cross the delaware with less than three thousand men fit for duty owing to the dissolution of our force by short enlistments the enemys numbers from the best accounts exceeding ten or twelve thousand men before i removed to the south side of the river i had all the boats and other vessels brought over or destroyed from philadelphia upwards for seventy miles and by guarding the fords i have as yet baffled all their attempts to cross but from some late movement of theirs i am left in doubt whether they are moving off for winterquarters or making a feint to throw us off our guard since i came on this side i have been joined by about two thousand of the city militia and i understand that some of the country militia from the back counties are on their way but we are in a very disaffected part of the province and between you and me i think our affairs are in a very bad situation not so much from the apprehension of general howes army as from the defection of new york jerseys and pennsylvania in short the conduct of the jerseys has been most infamous instead of turning out to defend their country  affording aid to our army they are making their submissions as fast as they can if the jerseys had given us any support we might have made a     stand at hackinsac and after that at brunswic but the few militia that were in arms disbanded themselves  left the poor remains of our army to make the best we could of it i have no doubt but general howe will still make an attempt upon philadelphia this winter i see nothing to oppose him a fortnight hence as the time of all the troops except those of virginia reduced almost to nothing and smallwoods regiment of maryland equally as bad will expire in less than that time in a word my dear sir if every nerve is not strained to recruit the new army with all possible expedition i think the game is pretty near up owing in a great measure to the insidious arts of the enemy and disaffection of the colonies before mentioned but principally to the accursed policy of short enlistments and placing too great a dependence on the militia the evil consequences of which were foretold fifteen months ago with a spirit almost prophetic before this reaches you you will no doubt have heard of the captivity of general lee this is an additional misfortune and the more vexatious as it was by his own folly and imprudence and without a view to answer any good he was taken going three miles out of his own camp and within twenty of the enemy to lodge a rascally tory rid in the night to give notice of it to the enemy who sent a party of lighthorse that seized and carried him with every mark of triumph and indignity you can form no idea of the perplexity of my situation no man i believe ever had a greater choice of difficulties and less means to extricate himself from     them however under a full persuasion of the justice of our cause i cannot entertain an idea that it will finally sink tho it may remain for some time under a cloud my love and sincere regards attend my sister and the family with compliments to all inquiring friends with every sentiment of friendship as well as love i am your most affectionate brother  george washington  0 december      to the president of congress camp above trenton falls  0 december      sir i have waited with much impatience to know the determination of congress on the propositions made some time in october last for augmenting our corps of artillery  and establishing a corps of engineers the time is now come when the first cannot be delayed without the greatest injury to the safety of these states and therefore under the resolution of congress bearing date the   th instant at the repeated instance of colonel knox and by the pressing advice of all the general officers now here i have ventured to order three battalions of artillery to be immediately recruited these are two less than colonel knox recommends as you will see     by his plan enclosed but then this scheme comprehends all the united states whereas some of the states have corps already established and these three battalions are indispensably necessary for the operations in this quarter including the northern department the pay of our artillerists bearing no proportion to that in the english and french service the murmuring and dissatisfaction thereby occasioned the absolute impossibility as i am told of getting them upon the old terms and the unavoidable necessity of obtaining them at all events have induced me also by advice to promise officers and men that their pay shall be augmented twentyfive per cent or that their engagements shall become null and void this may appear to congress premature and unwarrantable but sir if they view our situation in the light it strikes their officers they will be convinced of the utility of the measure and that the execution could not be delayed till after their meeting at baltimore in short the present exigency of our affairs will not admit of delay either in council or the field for well convinced i am that if the enemy go into quarters at all it will be for a short season but i rather think the design of general howe is to possess himself of philadelphia this winter if possible and in truth i do not see what is to prevent him as ten days more will put an end to the existence of our army that one great point is to keep us as much harassed as possible with a view to injure the recruiting service and hinder a collection of stores and other necessaries for     the next campaign i am as clear in as i am of my existence if therefore we have to provide in the short interval and make these great and arduous preparations every matter that in its nature is selfevident is to be referred to congress at the distance of a hundred and thirty or forty miles so much time must necessary elapse as to defeat the end in view in may be said that this is an application for powers that are too dangerous to be entrusted i can only add that desperate diseases require desperate remedies and i with truth declare that i have no lust after power but i wish with as much fervency as any man upon this wideextended continent for an opportunity of turning the sword into the ploughshare but my feelings as an officer and a man have been such as to force me to say that no person ever had a greater choice of difficulties to contend with than i have it is needless to add that short enlistments and a mistaken dependence upon militia have been the origin of all our misfortunes and the great accumulation of our debt we find sir that the enemy are daily gathering strength from the disaffected this strength like a snowball by rolling will increase unless some means can be devised to check effectually the progress of the enemys arms militia may possibly do it for a little while but in a little while also and the militia of those states which have been frequently called upon will not turn out at all or if they do it will be with so much reluctance and sloth as to amount to the same thing instance new jersey witness pennsylvania could     any thing but the river delaware have saved philadelphia can any thing the exigency of the case indeed may justify it be more destructive to the recruiting service than giving ten dollars bounty for six weeks service of the militia who come in you cannot tell how go you cannot tell when and act you cannot tell where consume your provisions exhaust your stores and leave you at last at a critical moment these sir are the men i am to depend upon ten days hence this is the basis on which your cause will and must for ever depend till you get a large standing army sufficient of itself to oppose the enemy i therefore beg leave to give it as my humble opinion that eightyeight battalions are by no means equal to the opposition you are to make and that a moments time is not to be lost in raising a greater number not less in my opinion and the opinion of my officers than a hundred and ten it may be urged that it will be found difficult enough to complete the first number this may be true and yet the officers of a hundred and ten battalions will recruit many more men than those of eightyeight in my judgment this is not a time to stand upon expense our funds are not the only object of consideration the state of new york have added one battalion i wish they had made it two to their quota if any good officers will offer to raise men upon continental pay and establishment in this quarter i shall encourage them to do so and regiment them when they have done it if congress disapprove     of this proceeding they will please to signify it as i mean it for the best it may be thought that i am going a good deal out of the line of my duty to adopt these measures or to advise thus freely a character to lose an estate to forfeit the inestimable blessing of liberty at stake and a life devoted must be my excuse i have heard nothing of the lighthorse from virginia nor of the regiment from the eastern shore  i wish to know what troops are to act in the different departments and to have those from the southward designed for this place ordered on as fast as they shall be raised the route should be pointed out by which they are to march assistant commissaries and quartermasters stationed upon the communication to supply their wants the first or second officer of each battalion should forward them and the other should come on receive and form them at their place of destination unless this is immediately set about the campaign if it should be closed will be opened in the spring before we have any men in the field every exertion should be used to procure tents a clothiergeneral should be appointed without loss of time for supplying the army with every article in that way he should be a man of business and abilities a commissary of prisoners must be appointed to attend the army for want of an officer of this kind the exchange of prisoners has been conducted in a most shameful and injurious manner we have had them from all quarters pushed into our camps at the     most critical junctures and without the least previous notice we have had them travelling through the different states in all directions by certificates from committees without any kind of control and have had instances of some going into the enemys camp without my privity or knowledge after passing in the manner before mentioned there may be other officers necessary whom i do not recollect at this time and who when thought of must be provided for this sir you may rely on that the commanding officer under the present establishment is obliged to attend to the business of so many different departments as to render it impossible to conduct that of his own with the attention necessary than which nothing can be more injurious in a former letter i intimated my opinion of the necessity of having a brigadier for every three regiments and a majorgeneral to every three brigades at most i think no time is to be lost in making the appointments that the arrangements may be consequent this will not only aid the recruiting service but will be the readiest means of forming and disciplining the army afterwards which in the short time we have to do it is of amazing consequence i have labored ever since i have been in the service to discourage all kinds of local attachments and distinctions of country denominating the whole by the greater name of american but i have found it impossible to overcome prejudices and under the new establishment i conceive it best to stir up an emulation in order to do which would it not be     better for each state to furnish though not to appoint their own brigadiers this if known to be part of the establishment might prevent a good deal of contention and jealousy and would i believe be the means of promotions going forward with more satisfaction and quiet the higher officers whilst i am speaking of promotions i cannot help giving it as my opinion that if congress think proper to confirm what i have done with respect to the corps of artillery colonel knox at present at the head of that department but who without promotion will resign ought to be appointed to the command of it with the rank and pay of brigadier i have also to mention that for want of some establishment in the department of engineers agreeably to the plan laid before congress in october last colonel putnam who was at head of it has quitted and taken a regiment in the state of massachusetts i know of no other man tolerably well qualified for the conducting of that business none of the french gentlemen whom i have seen with appointments in that way appear to me to know any thing of the matter there is one in philadelphia who i am told is clever but him i have never seen i must also once more beg leave to mention to congress the expediency of letting promotions be in a regimental line the want of this has already driven some of the best officers that were in your army out of the service from repeated and strict inquiry i am convinced that you can adopt no mode of promotion that will be better received or that will give more general satisfaction i wish therefore to have it announced     the casting of cannon is a matter that ought not to be one moment delayed and therefore i shall send colonel knox to put this in train as also to have travellingcarriages and shot provided and laboratories established one in hartford and another in york magazines of provisions should also be laid in these i shall fix with the commissary as our great loss last year proceeded from a want of teams i shall direct the quartermastergeneral to furnish a certain number to each regiment to answer the common purposes thereof that the army may be enabled to remove from place to place differently from what we have done or could do this campaign ammunitioncarts and proper carts for intrenching tools should also be provided and i shall direct about them accordingly above all a store of small arms should be provided or men will be of little use the consumption and waste of these this year have been great militia and flyingcamp men coming in without them were obliged to be furnished or become useless many of these threw their arms away some lost them whilst others deserted and took them away in a word although i used every precaution to preserve them the loss has been great and this will for ever be the case in such a mixed and irregular army as ours has been if no part of the troops already embarked at new york has appeared in virginia their destination doubtless must be to some other quarter and that state must i should think be freed from any invasion if general howe can be effectually opposed in this i therefore enclose a memorandum given me   0 by brigadier stephen of virginia which congress will please to adopt in the whole in part or reject as may be consistent with their plans and intelligence that division of the army lately under the command of general lee now of general sullivan is just upon the point of joining us a strange kind of fatality has attended it they had orders on the   th of november to join now more than a month general gates with four eastern regiments is also near at hand three others from those states were coming on by his order by the way of peekskill and had joined general heath whom i had ordered on with parsonss brigade to join me leaving clintons brigade and some militia that were at forts montgomery and constitution to guard these important passes of the highlands but the convention of the state of new york seemed to be much alarmed at heaths coming away a fleet appearing off new london and some part of the enemys troops retiring towards brunswic induced me to countermand the order for the march of parsonss brigade and to direct the three regiments from ticonderoga to halt at morristown in new jersey where i understand about eight hundred militia had collected in order to inspirit the inhabitants and as far as possible to cover that part of the country i shall send general maxwell this day to take the command of them and if to be done to harass and annoy the enemy in their quarters and cut off their convoys the care and vigilance which were used in securing the boats on this river have hitherto baffled every attempt of the enemy to cross but from concurring reports and     appearances they are waiting for ice to afford them a passage since writing the foregoing i have received a letter from governor cooke of rhode island of which the enclosed is a copy  previous to this and immediately upon the first intelligence obtained of a fleets going through the sound i despatched orders to generals spencer and arnold to proceed without delay to the eastward the first i presume is gone the latter not getting my letter till he came to a place called easton was by advice of general gates who also met my letter at the same place induced to come on hither before he proceeded to the eastward most of our brigadiers are laid up not one has come on with the division under general sullivan but they are left sick at different places on the road by accounts from the eastward a large body of men had assembled in rhode island from the states of massachusetts and connecticut i presume but i have no advice of it that the militia ordered from the first to rendezvous at danbury six thousand in number under the command of majorgeneral lincoln for supplying the place of the disbanded men of that state in the continental army will now be ordered to rhode island in speaking of general lincoln i should not do him justice were i not to add that he is a gentleman well worthy of notice in     the military line he commanded the militia from massachusetts last summer or fall rather and much to my satisfaction having proved himself on all occasions an active spirited sensible man i do not know whether it is his wish to remain in the military line or whether if he should any thing under the rank he now holds in the state he comes from would satisfy him how far an appointment of this kind might offend the continental brigadiers i cannot undertake to say many there are over whom he ought not to be placed but i know of no way to discriminate brigadier reed of new hampshire does not i presume mean to continue in the service he ought not as i am told by the severity of the smallpox he is become both blind and deaf i have the honor to be c p s generals gates and sullivan have this instant come in by them i learn that few or no men are recruited out of the regiments coming on with them and that there is very little reason to expect that these regiments will be prevailed upon to continue after their term of service expires if militia then do not come in the consequences are but too evident  george washington dec   st      keiths majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath headquarters at keiths dec   st      dear sir i have been favored with yours of the   th inst and wish you may have succeeded in your intended scheme to dislodge the enemy from hackinsac bridge     in my letter of the   th i transmitted you a copy of a letter from the council of the massachusetts bay advising that six thousand men were coming from that state under general lincoln to supply the place of the militia which had returned home and of their troops whose time of service will soon expire at the time of writing i thought it probable that their reinforcement might be ordered to the state of rhode island in case of an invasion and which i find has actually taken place and therefore did not so strenuously urge that it should be sent here indeed i had then hopes from the information i had received that a large proportion of the eastern troops who were marching to join me had reenlisted but to my great distress and mortification i find the report to have been without the least foundation and that in the course of a few days i am to be left with a handful of men i therefore request that if these troops have come on to peekskill and also the four batallions which i am advised by governor trumbull have been raised in connecticut to serve till the   th of march next that after securing the passes and fortifications in the highlands with a sufficient number which i should imagine need not exceed twelve or fifteen hundred men at farthest besides the force which i apprehend will be provided for the purpose by the convention of new york you will forward on all the rest with the utmost expedition to join such troops as i may be able to collect for the defence of philadelphia that city is now the object of the enemys designs let me entreat you     to impress the officers and men with a due sense of its importance in the present contest for our liberty and that without their speedy and early arrival it may be lost i am persuaded these considerations will be duly regarded and urge them on to every possible exertion as yet but few succors belonging to this state have come in nor do i hear that many are in motion  when they have heard that other states     are applied to and pushing in aids for their defence perhaps they will arouse from that lethargy which now keeps them back against the most pressing calls of interest in a word sir my situation and that of our cause is critical and truly alarming without vigorous exertions and early succors i do not see what reasonable hope there will be to preserve philadelphia     from falling into the enemys hands they will attempt to possess it as soon as the delaware is so frozen as to admit of their passage appearances and many concurring reports agree in this i have received yours of the   th and am happy to hear of your success at hackinsac the stores you got will be of great service by a letter just received from general mcdougall i find he has been much indisposed and is now at morristown i intend to write him to return to peekskill to conduct matters in that department with general george clinton requesting you and general james clinton to come on with the eastern troops which i have mentioned if they have arrived at peekskill and it should be necessary for him to come i am sir your most obedient servant george washington    december      joseph reed john cadwalader to colonel joseph reed or colonel john cadwalader  at bristol camp above trenton falls    december      dear sir the bearer is sent down to know whether your plan was attempted last night and if not to inform you that christmasday at night one hour before day is the time fixed upon for our attempt on trenton for heavens sake keep this to yourself as the discovery of it may prove fatal to us our numbers sorry i am to say being less than i had any conception of but necessity dire necessity will nay     must justify any attempt prepare and in concert with griffin attack as many of their posts as you possibly can with a prospect of success the more we can attack at the same instant the more confusion we shall spread and greater good will result from it if i had not been fully convinced before of the enemys designs i have now ample testimony of their intentions to attack philadelphia so soon as the ice will afford the means of conveyance  as the colonels of the continental regiments might kick up some dust about command unless cadwalader is considered by them in the light of a brigadier which i wish him to be i desired general gates who is unwell and applied for leave to go to philadelphia     to endeavor if his health would permit him to call and stay two or three days at bristol in his way i shall not be particular we could not ripen matters for our attack before the time mentioned in the first part of this letter so much out of sorts and so much in want of every thing are the troops under sullivan c let me know by a careful express the plan you are to pursue the letter herewith sent forward on to philadelphia i could wish it to be in time for the southern posts departure which will be i believe by eleven oclock tomorrow i am dear sir c p s i have ordered our men to be provided with three days provisions ready cooked with which and their blankets they are to march for if we are successful which heaven grant and the circumstances favor we may push on i shall direct every ferry and ford to be well guarded and not a soul suffered to pass without an officers going down with the permit do the same with you george washington    december      to the president of congress camp above trenton falls    december      sir that i should dwell upon the subject of our distresses cannot be more disagreeable to congress than it is painful to myself the alarming situation to which our affairs are reduced impels me to the measure inquiry and investigation which in most cases serve to develope and point out a remedy in ours present more and greater difficulties till of     late i was led to hope from report that no inconsiderable part of the troops composing the regiments that were with general lee and those from ticonderoga under general gates had enlisted again this intelligence i confess gave me reason to expect that i should have at the expiration of the present year a force somewhat more respectable than what i find will be the case having examined into the state of those regiments i am authorized to say from the information of their officers that but very few of the men have enlisted those who have are of the troops from ticonderoga and were permitted to visit their friends and homes as part of the terms on which they would reengage in respect to those who marched with general lee i cannot learn that any have their refusal i am told has not proceeded more from an aversion to the service or any fixed determination not to engage again than from their wishes to return home the nonappointment of officers in some instances the turning out of good and appointing of bad in others and the incomplete or rather no arrangement of them a work unhappily committed to the management of their states nor have i the most distant prospect of retaining them a moment longer than the last of this month notwithstanding the most pressing solicitations and the obvious necessity for it by the departure of these regiments i shall be left with five from virginia smallwoods from maryland a small part of rawlingss hands from pennsylvania a part of wards from connecticut   0 and the german battalion comprising in the whole at this time from fourteen to fifteen hundred effective men this handful and such militia as may choose to join me will then compose our army  when i reflect upon these things they fill me with much concern knowing that general howe has a number of troops cantoned in the towns bordering on and near the delaware and his intentions to pass as soon as the ice is sufficiently formed to invade pennsylvania and to possess himself of philadelphia if possible to guard against his designs and the execution of them shall employ my every exertion but how is this to be done as yet but few militia have gone to philadelphia and they are to be our support at this alarming crisis had i entertained a doubt of general howes intentions to pass the delaware on the dissolution of our army and as soon as the ice is made it would now be done away an intercepted letter from a gentleman of philadelphia who has joined the enemy to his friend and partner in the city declares that to be their design that the army would be there in ten or twenty days from the   th instant the time of his writing if the ice should     be made it advises him by no means to remove their stores as they would be safe the obstacles which have arisen to the raising of the new army from the mode of appointing the officers induce me to hope if congress resolve on an additional number of battalions to those already voted that they will devise some other rule by which the officers especially the fieldofficers should be appointed in case an augmentation should be made to the eastern regiments a deviation from the former mode will operate more strongly as to them than to other battalions because there have been many more officers in service from those states than the regiments voted to be raised would admit of by which means several deserving men could not have been provided for had the utmost pains been used for the purpose and many others of merit have been neglected in the late appointments and those of little worth and less experience put in their places or promoted over their heads this has been the case with many of the best officers the enclosed letter from the paymastergeneral will show the state of the military chest and the necessity of a large and immediate supply of cash the advances to the officers for bounty and the recruiting service are great besides the regiments at the expiration of this month will require payment of their claims at the same time it will show the injustice of the clamors made by some of the officers respecting their pay and the abuses that have resulted from an attention to them whenever they     have not been paid it was because their abstracts were not made up i have the honor c p s if the public papers have been removed from philadelphia i hope those which i sent by lieutenant colonel reed  before we left new york have not been forgot if they have not i beg the favor of you to break open the chest and send me the several letter books sealed up having frequent occasion to refer to em george washington    december      newtown to the president of congress headquarters newtown    december      sir i have the pleasure of congratulating you upon the success of an enterprise which i had formed against a detachment of the enemy lying in trenton and which was executed yesterday morning the evening of the   th i ordered the troops intended for this service to parade back of mckonkeys ferry  that they might begin to pass as soon as it grew dark imagining we should be able to throw them all over with the necessary artillery by twelve oclock and that we might easily arrive at trenton by five in the morning the distance being about nine miles but the quantity of ice made that night impeded the passage of the boats so much that it was three oclock before the artillery could all be got over and near four before the troops took up their line of march this made me despair of surprising the town as i     well knew we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke but as i was certain there was no making a retreat without being discovered and harassed on repassing the river i determined to push on at all events i formed my detachment into two divisions one to march by the lower or river road the other by the upper or pennington road as the divisions had nearly the same distance to march i ordered each of them immediately upon forcing the outguards to push directly into the town that they might charge the enemy before they had time to form the upper division arrived at the enemys advanced posts exactly at eight oclock and in three minutes after i found from the fire on the lower road that the division had also got up the outguards made but small opposition though for their numbers they behaved very well keeping up a constant retreating fire from behind houses we presently saw their main body formed but from their motions they seemed undetermined how to act being hard pressed by our troops who had already got possession of their artillery they attempted to file off by a road on their right leading to princeton but perceiving their intention i threw a body of troops in their way which immediately checked them finding from our disposition that they were surrounded and that they must inevitably be cut to pieces if they made any further resistance they agreed to lay down their arms the number that submitted in this manner was twentythree officers and eight hundred and eightysix men colonel rahl the     commanding officer and seven others were found wounded in the town i do not exactly know how many were killed but i fancy not above twenty or thirty as they never made any regular stand our loss is very trifling indeed only two officers and one or two privates wounded i find that the detachment of the enemy consisted of the three hessian regiments of anspach kniphausen and rahl amounting to about fifteen hundred men and a troop of british lighthorse but immediately upon the beginning of the attack all those who were not killed or taken pushed directly down the road towards bordentown these would likewise have fallen into our hands could my plan have been completely carried into execution general ewing was to have crossed before day at trenton ferry and taken possession of the bridge leading out of town but the quantity of ice was so great that though he did every thing in his power to effect it he could not get over this difficulty also hindered general cadwalader from crossing with the pennsylvania militia from bristol he got part of his foot over but finding it impossible to embark his artillery he was obliged to desist i am fully confident that could the troops under generals ewing and cadwalader have passed the river i should have been able with their assistance to drive the enemy from all their posts below trenton but the numbers i had with me being inferior to theirs below me and a strong battalion of light infantry being at princeton above me i thought it most prudent to return the     same evening with the prisoners and the artillery we had taken we found no stores of any consequence in the town  in justice to the officers and men i must add that their behavior upon this occasion reflects the highest honor upon them the difficulty of passing the river in a very severe night and their march through a violent storm of snow and hail did not in the least abate their ardor but when they came to the charge each seemed to vie with the other in pressing forward and were i to give a preference to any particular corps i should do great injustice to the others colonel baylor my first aiddecamp will have the honor of delivering this to you and from him you may be made acquainted with many other particulars his spirited behavior upon every occasion requires me to     recommend him to your particular notice i have the honor to be c  p s inclosed you have a particular list of the prisoners artillery and other stores  george washington    december      newtown to the president of congress newtown    december      sir i am just setting out to attempt a second passage over the delaware with the troops that were with me on the morning of the   th i am determined to effect it if possible but know that it will be attended with much fatigue and difficulty on account of the ice which will neither allow us to cross on foot nor give us an easy passage with boats general cadwalader crossed from bristol on the   th and by his letter of yesterday was at bordentown with about eighteen hundred men  in addition to these general mifflin sent over five hundred from philadelphia on friday three hundred yesterday evening from burlington and will     follow today with seven or eight hundred more i have taken every precaution in my power for subsisting the troops and shall without loss of time and as soon as circumstances will admit of it pursue the enemy in their retreat try to beat up more of their quarters and in a word adopt in every instance such measures as the exigency of our affairs requires and our situation will justify had it not been for the unhappy failure of generals ewing and cadwalader in their attempts to pass on the night of the   th and if the several concerted attacks could have been made i have no doubt that our views would have succeeded to our warmest expectations what was done occasioned the enemy to leave their several posts on the delaware with great precipitation the peculiar distresses to which the troops who were with me were reduced by the severities of cold rain snow and storm the charge of the prisoners they had taken and another reason that might be mentioned and the little prospect of receiving succors on account of the season and situation     of the river would not authorize a further pursuit at that time since transmitting the list of prisoners a few more have been discovered and taken in trenton among them a lieutenantcolonel and a deputyadjutantgeneral the whole amounting to about a thousand i have been honored with your letter of the   d and its several enclosures to which i shall pay due attention a flag goes in this morning with a letter to general howe and another to general lee for the latter mr robert morris has transmitted a bill of exchange drawn by two british officers for a hundred and sixteen pounds nine shillings and three pence on major small for money furnished them in south carolina which i trust will be paid this supply is exclusive of the sum you have resolved to be sent to him and which mr morris will procure in time i have the honor to be c p s i am under great apprehensions about obtaining proper supplies of provisions for our troops i fear it will be extremely difficult if not impracticable as the enemy from every account has taken and collected every thing they could find           george washington   january      trenton to the president of congress trenton   january       sir your resolves of the   th ultimo were transmitted to me last night by messrs clymer morris and walton  the confidence which congress have honored me by with these proceedings has a claim to my warmest acknowledgments at the same time i beg leave to assure them that all my faculties shall be employed to direct properly the powers they have been pleased to vest me with and to advance those objects and only those which gave rise to this honorable   0 mark of distinction if my exertions should not be attended with the desired success i trust the failure will be imputed to the true cause the peculiarly distressed situation of our affairs and the difficulties i have to combat rather than to a want of zeal for my country and the closest attention to her interest to promote which has ever been my study  on monday morning i passed the delaware myself the whole of our troops and artillery not till yesterday owing to the ice which rendered their passage extremely difficult and fatiguing since their arrival we have been parading the regiments whose term of service is now expired in order to     know what force we should have to depend on and how to regulate our views accordingly after much persuasion and the exertions of their officers half or a greater proportion of those from the eastward have consented to stay six weeks on a bounty of ten dollars i feel the inconvenience of this advance and i know the consequences which will result from it but what could be done pennsylvania had allowed the same to her militia the troops felt their importance and would have their price indeed as their aid is so essential and not to be dispensed with it is to be wondered they had not estimated it at a higher rate i perceive that congress apprehensive of this event had made unlimited provision for it      general mifflin is at bordentown with about eighteen hundred men and general cadwalader at crosswicks with about the same number we are now making our arrangements and concerting a plan of operations which i shall attempt to execute as soon as possible and which i hope will be attended with some success as to the number and situation of the enemy i cannot obtain certain intelligence but from the accounts most to be relied on they have collected the principal part of their force from brunswic and the neighboring posts at princeton where they are throwing up some works the number there is reported to be from five to six thousand and it is confidently said they have sent the chief part of their baggage to brunswick it is added that general howe landed at amboy a day or two ago with a thousand light troops and is on his march from thence i have sent into different parts of jersey men of influence to spirit up the militia and i flatter myself that the many injuries they have received will induce some to give their aid if what they have suffered does not rouse their resentment they must not possess the common feelings of humanity to oppression ravage and a deprivation of property they have had the more mortifying circumstance of insult added after being stripped of all they had without the least     compensation protections have been granted them for the free enjoyment of their effects i have the honor to be with due respect c ps i have not been able to procure returns of our force owing to our situation i suppose that about two or three  twenty hundred passed with me which number is now reduced to fifteen or sixteen hundred no estimate of our force can be formed from the number of regiments many of em by reason of sickness cannot turn out more than a hundred men  george washington   january      trenton robert morris george clymer george walton to robert morris george clymer and george walton a committee of congress headquarters trenton   january      gentlemen i have the honor and pleasure of acknowledging your favors of the   th and   st december and mr morriss of the  0th and   st     the messenger delivered me the two parcels of hard money which i suppose will turn out right not having had time to count it the sum that is lodged at ticonderoga shall be ordered down provided the commander in the northern department finds no better use for it there than i can make of it here the accounts you give me in yours of the   th ulto of the good effects that are likely to flow from our success at trenton add not a little to the satisfaction i have felt on that occasion you are pleased to pay me many personal compliments as if the merit of that affair was due solely to me but i assure you the other general officers who assisted me in the plan and execution have full as good right to your encomiums as myself we are devising such measures as i hope if they succeed will add as much or more to the distress of the enemy than their defeat at trenton and i promise myself the greatest advantages from having engaged a number of the eastern troops to stay six weeks beyond their time of enlistment upon giving a bounty of ten dollars this i know is a most extravagant price when compared to the time of service but the example was set by the state of pennsylvania with repect to their militia and i thought it no time to stand upon trifles when a body of firm troops inured to danger was absolutely necessary to lead on the more raw and undisciplined i shall know this day how many of colonel glovers regiment are willing to continue in the land service i dont expect many will be prevailed upon to stay and i will endeavor to procure     the rest for the purpose of fitting out the frigates upon the best terms i can  the future and proper disposition of the hessian prisoners struck me in the same light in which you view it for which reason i advised the council of safety to separate them from their officers and canton them in the german counties if proper pains are taken to convince them how preferable the situation of their countrymen the inhabitants of those counties is to theirs i think they may be sent back in the spring so fraught with a love of liberty and property too that they may create a disgust to the service among the remainder of the foreign troops and widen that breach which is already opened between them and the british yours of the   st of last month enclosed to me sundry resolves of congress by which i find they have done me the honor to entrust me with powers in my military capacity of the highest nature and almost unlimited in extent instead of thinking myself freed from all civil obligations by this mark of their confidence i shall constantly bear in mind that as     the sword was the last resort for the preservation of our liberties so it ought to be the first thing laid aside when those liberties are firmly established i shall instantly set about making the most necessary reforms in the army but it will not be in my power to make so great a progress as if i had a little leisure time upon my hands mr morris has my sincere thanks for the advice and assistance he promises to give commissary wharton and i beg he would remind him that all his exertions will be necessary to support an army in this exhausted country i have the honor to be c  george washington   january      pluckemin to the president of congress pluckemin   january      sir i have the honor to inform you that since the date of my last from trenton i have removed with the army under my command to this place the difficulty of crossing the delaware on account of the ice made our passage over it tedious and gave the enemy an opportunity of drawing in their several cantonments and assembling their whole force at princeton their large pickets advanced towards     trenton their great preparations and some intelligence i had received added to their knowledge that the  st of january brought on a dissolution of the best part of our army gave me the strongest reasons to conclude that an attack upon us was meditating our situation was most critical and our force small to remove immediately was again destroying every dawn of hope which had begun to revive in the breasts of the jersey militia and to bring those troops who had first crossed the delaware and were lying at crosswicks under general cadwalader and those under general mifflin at bordentown amounting in the whole to about three thousand six hundred to trenton was to bring them to an exposed place one or the other however was unavoidable the latter was preferred and they were ordered to join us at trenton which they did by a nightmarch on the  st instant on the  d according to my expectation the enemy began to advance upon us and after some skirmishing the head of their column reached trenton about four oclock whilst their rear was as far back as maidenhead they attempted to pass sanpink creek  which runs through trenton at different places but finding the fords guarded they halted and kindled their fires we were drawn up on the other side of the creek in this situation we remained till dark cannonading the enemy and receiving the fire of their fieldpieces which did us but little damage     having by this time discovered that the enemy were greatly superior in number and that their design was to surround us i ordered all our baggage to be removed silently to burlington soon after dark and at twelve oclock after renewing our fires and leaving guards at the bridge in trenton and other passes on the same stream above marched by a roundabout road to princeton where i knew they could not have much force left and might have stores one thing i was certain of that it would avoid the appearance of a retreat which was of consequence or to run the hazard of the whole army being cut oft whilst we might by a fortunate stroke withdraw general howe from trenton and give some reputation to our arms happily we succeeded we found princeton about sunrise with only three regiments and three troops of lighthorse in it two of which were on their march to trenton these three regiments especially the two first made a gallant resistance and in killed wounded and prisoners must have lost five hundred men upwards of one hundred of them were left dead on the field and with what i have with me and what were taken in the pursuit and carried across the delaware there are near three hundred prisoners fourteen of whom are officers all british this piece of good fortune is counterbalanced by the loss of the brave and worthy general mercer colonels hazlet and potter captain neal of the artillery captain fleming who commanded the first virginian regiment and four or five other valuable     officers who with about twentyfive or thirty privates were slain in the field our whole loss cannot be ascertained as many who were in pursuit of the enemy who were chased three or four miles are not yet come in the rear of the enemys army lying at maidenhead not more than five or six miles from princeton was up with us before our pursuit was over but as i had the precaution to destroy the bridge over stony brook about half a mile from the field of action they were so long retarded there as to give us time to move off in good order for this place we took two brass fieldpieces but for want of horses could not bring them away we also took some blankets shoes and a few other trifling articles burned the hay and destroyed such other things as the shortness of the time would admit of  my original plan when i set out from trenton was to push on to brunswic but the harassed state   0 of our troops many of them having had no rest for two nights and a day and the danger of losing the advantage we had gained by aiming at too much induced me by the advice of my officers to relinquish the attempt but in my judgment six or eight hundred fresh troops upon a forced march would have destroyed all their stores and magazines taken as we have since learned their military chest containing seventy thousand pounds and put an end to the war the enemy from the best intelligence i have been able to get were so much alarmed at the apprehension of this that they marched immediately to brunswic without halting except at the bridges for i also took up those on millstone on the different routes to brunswic and got there before day from the best information i have received general howe has left no men either at trenton or princeton the truth of this i am endeavoring to ascertain that i may regulate my movements accordingly the militia are taking spirits and i am told are coming in fast from this state but i fear those from philadelphia will scarcely submit to the hardships of a winter campaign much longer especially as they very unluckily sent their blankets with their baggage to burlington i must do them the justice however to add that they have undergone more fatigue and hardship than i expected militia especially citizens would have done at this inclement season i am just moving to morristown where i shall endeavor to put them under the best cover i can      hitherto we have been without any and many of our poor soldiers quite barefoot and ill clad in other respects i have the honor to be c  george washington   january      pluckemin majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam pluckemin   january      dear general fortune has favored us in an attack on princeton general howe advanced upon trenton which we evacuated in the evening of the  d of this instant and drew up the troops on the south side of mill creek and continued in that position until dark then marched for princeton which we reached next morning by about nine oclock there were three regiments quartered there of british troops which we attacked and routed the number of the killed wounded and taken prisoners amounts to about five or six hundred we lost several officers and about thirty privates general mercer is badly wounded if not mortally after the action we immediately marched for this place i shall remove from hence to morristown there shall wait a few days and refresh the troops during which time i shall keep a strict     watch upon the enemys motions they appear to be panicstruck and i am in some hopes of driving them out of the jerseys it is thought advisable for you to march the troops under your command to crosswicks and keep a strict watch upon the enemy in that quarter if the enemy continue at brunswic you must act with great circumspection lest you meet with a surprise as we have made two successful attacks upon the enemy by way of surprise they will be pointed with resentment and if there is any possibility of retaliating they will attempt it you will give out your strength to be twice as great as it is forward on all the baggage and scattered troops belonging to this division of the army as soon as may be you will keep as many spies out as you will see proper a number of horsemen in the dress of the country must be constantly kept going backwards and forwards for this purpose and if you discover any motion of the enemy which you can depend upon and which you think of consequence let me be informed thereof as soon as possible by express i am dear general yours c george washington   january      pluckemin majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath pluckemin   january      sir we have made a successful attack upon princeton genl howe advanced upon trenton we evacuated the town and lay on the other side of mill creek     until dark then stole a march and attacked princeton about nine oclock in the morning there was three regiments quartered there the killed wounded and taken prisoners amounts to about  00 the enemy are in great consternation and as the panic affords us a favorable opportunity to drive them out of the jerseys it has been determined in council that you should move down towards new york with a considerable force as if you had a design upon the city that being an object of great importance the enemy will be reduced to the necessity of withdrawing a considerable part of their force from the jerseys if not the whole to secure the city i shall draw the force on this side of the north river together at morristown where i shall watch the motions of the enemy and avail myself of every favorable circumstance you will retain four thousand of the militia coming on from the new england governments for the expedition you will act with great precaution but avail yourself of every favorable opportunity of attacking the enemy when you can do it to advantage general lincoln must cross the north river and come on with the remainder of the militia to morristown leave a sufficient guard at the highlands you will also have so many boats collected together or in such a manner as you may always avail yourself of them if it be found expedient for your troops or any part of them to cross the north river at dobbss ferry or at any other of the landings i am c     george washington   january      morristown to the president of congress morristown   january      sir i am happy to inform you that the account of genl mercers death transmitted in my last was premature tho it was mentioned as certain by many who saw him after he was wounded by intelligence from princeton yesterday evening he was alive and seemed as if he would do well unhappily he is a prisoner had it not been for the information i had of his death i would have tried to have brought him away tho i believe it could not have been effected the enemy have totally evacuated trenton and princeton and are now at brunswic and the several posts on the communication between that and hudsons river but chiefly at brunswic their numbers and movements are variously reported but all agree that their force is great there have been two or three little skirmishes between their parties and some detachments of the militia in which the latter have been successful and made a few prisoners the most considerable was on sunday morning near springfield when eight or ten waldeckers were killed and wounded and the remainder of the party thirtynine or forty made prisoners with two officers by a force not superior in number and without receiving the least damage the severity of the season has made our troops especially the militia extremely impatient and has reduced the number very considerably every day more or less leave us their complaints and the     great fatigue they have undergone induced me to come to this place as the best calculated of any in this quarter to accommodate and refresh them the situation is by no means favorable to our views and as soon as the purposes are answered for which we came i think to remove though i confess i do not know how we shall procure covering for our men elsewhere i am c  george washington   january      morristown majorgeneral lincoln to majorgeneral lincoln morristown   january      dear sir i am glad to hear by yours of the  th instant that you had arrived at peekskill and i hope from the measures you have taken to hasten up your troops that they will soon be all with you general heath will communicate mine of this date to you by which you will find that the greatest part of your troops are to move down towards new york to draw the attention of the enemy to that quarter and if they do not throw a considerable body back again you may in all probability carry the city or at least blockade them in it i believe they are not prepared for the latter for as they have for some time past made themselves sure of holding jersey they have not taken proper precautions to establish large magazines at any one place i leave it entirely to the determination of you and general heath whether you shall continue on the east side of hudsons river or come in with the troops that are to join me i     have only to beg of you to be as expeditious as possible in moving forward for the sooner a panicstruck enemy are followed the better if we can oblige them to evacuate jersey we must drive them to the utmost distress for as i mentioned above they have depended upon the supplies from that province for their winter support i am dear sir yours c  george washington   january      morristown edward antill to lieutenantcolonel edward antill morristown   january      sir i received yours of the  d instant from baltimore in answer to which i have only to desire you to call upon all your officers who are upon recruiting service to exert themselves as much as possible in filling their companies and sending their recruits forward to some general place of rendezvous that they may be armed equipped and got into service with as much expedition as possible as you and colonel hazen had the nomination of your own officers by virtue of your commissions i shall have no objection to any gentleman of good character that you may     think fit to appoint i would only mention to you that mr burwell has already got a company in the virginia artillery and therefore you had better fill up the place you intended for him with some other person if going to virginia yourself will be of any service i certainly shall have no objection to it  i am sir yours c     george washington   january      morristown lieutenantgeneral earl cornwallis to lieutenantgeneral earl cornwallis morristown   january      my lord your lordships favor of yesterday was delivered to me by the officer who met your flag of truce you may be assured that no molestation will be offered to the convoy of money and stores which general de heister means to send to the hessians taken at trenton or to the surgeon with medicines for the wounded at princeton by any part of the regular army under my command but i cannot answer for the militia who are resorting to arms in most parts of this state and exceedingly exasperated at the treatment they have met with from both hessian and british troops i therefore thought it most advisable to direct captain barry the bearer of this to give a safe conduct to the hessian baggage as far as philadelphia and the surgeon and medicines to princeton i have no objection to the hessian sergeant and twelve mens attending their baggage till it is delivered to their countrymen but cannot consent to their carrying their arms as i think none but bad consequences can ensue from such a measure i am with due respect my lord your lordships most obedient servant george washington   january      morristown george baylor to colonel george baylor morristown   january      dear baylor your letter of the  st from baltimore came to my hands this day your desires of commanding a regiment of horse i cheerfully yield to because it is the     recommendation of congress your own wish and my desire as nothing contributes so much to the constitution of a good regiment as a good corps of officers and no method so likely to obtain these as leaving the choice in a great measure to the gentleman who is to reap the honors or share the disgrace arising from their behavior i shall vest you with the power of nominating the officers of your own regiment except the fieldofficers and those of the troop commanded by geo lewis which i shall annex to your regiment instead of sheldons and except a lieutenancy in some troop for starke when i talk of giving you the nomination of the officers i would have it understood that i reserve to myself a negative upon a part or the whole if i have reason to suspect an improper choice i earnestly recommend to you to be circumspect in your choice of officers take none but gentlemen let no local attachments influence you do not suffer your good nature when an application is made to say yes when you ought to say no remember that it is a public not a private cause that is to be injured or benefited by your choice recollect also that no instance has yet happened of good or bad behavior in a corps in our service that has not originated with the officers do not take old men nor yet fill your corps with boys especially for captains colonel landon carter some time ago recommended a grandson of his to me if he still inclines to serve and a lieutenancy would satisfy him make him the offer of it i have wrote to a major clough to accept the majority of your regiment he is an experienced   0 officer in the horse service and a gentlemanlike man as far as i have seen him the lieutenantcolonel i have not yet absolutely fixed on though i have a person in my eye for further instructions refer to mr harrison who will furnish you with a copy of those given to colonel sheldon one hundred and twenty dollars will be allowed you as the average price of the horses the money for these and your accoutrements you must call upon congress for and i have to entreat that you will not delay a moment that can be avoided in preparing to take the field early you must be upon your mettle for others are engaged in the same service and will exert themselves to the utmost to outdo you i am very sincerely yours c i can say nothing respecting your uniform as that will depend upon the cloth to be had mr james mease of philadelphia is appointed clothier general to the army and to him you must apply for this article where you will be able to get proper saddles i know not if maryland and virginia together with lancaster and york could furnish you perhaps it would be better than to depend upon philadelphia as it is likely there may be a run upon that city for more than it can furnish in a short time let me hear frequently from you      george washington  0 january      morris town governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters morris town  0 january      sir i am honored with your favor of the   d last month i hope the congress have in consequence of your application ordered up a supply of money for the county to the new enlisted troops in your state but lest they should not have done it i shall order colonel palfrey to send what cash he can spare to the deputypay master at peekskill to be applied to the use of the recruiting service to the eastward he some little time ago sent a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to peekskill to be distributed by general heath among the recruiting officers if that sum should not be expended some money may be drawn from thence in the mean time i must beg the favor of you to advance the necessary sums out of the treasury of your state assuring you it shall be refunded as early as possible i am very happy to hear that your assembly have it in contemplation to send a body of troops forward to serve till your regular enlistments can be completed nothing can be more distressing to the enemy or serviceable to me than an army hanging     upon the rear of new york to move forward as circumstances may require their wishes and views are certainly towards philadelphia and valuable as the acquisition of that city would be it would be paying too dear a price for it were they to give up new york to a force that might be thrown into it after their army had moved southward our success at trenton has been followed by another lucky blow at princetown on the  d instant i lay with about five thousand men at trenton the enemy advanced a superior force down upon me from princetown on the second not choosing to risk an engagement there i decamped as soon as it was dark and marched along their flank to princetown which lay directly in their rear i arrived there by break of day and found three regiments of british troops ready drawn up to march to trenton we immediately attacked them and in a short time put them completely to the rout we have already taken three hundred prisoners and the country people are daily bringing in stragglers their loss upon the whole will amount to at least five hundred the enemy confounded at this unexpected stroke in their rear and fearing that their baggage at brunswick would fall into our hands marched back in the greatest hurry from trenton to brunswick where their main body now lays they have called in all their outposts so that their late possession of the greatest part of jersey is reduced to the compass of a very few miles they evacuated elizabeth town with so much precipitation that we made one hundred prisoners     and took the baggage of the regiments besides a quantity of provisions these successes though comparatively small have greatly inspirited the inhabitants of this state and pennsylvania and i am in great hopes if we can once put the enemy into winter quarters and get some little leisure that our affairs may be put in such a train and upon such a footing as will insure success the next campaign i have the honor to be c george washington   th day of january      morristown nathaniel gist to colonel nathaniel gist instructions whereas the honorable continental congress by a resolve of the   th ultimo have appointed sixteen battalions more to be raised in addition to eightyeight voted in september last and have authorized me to nominate and commission the officers for the same know you that i reposing the utmost confidence in your abilities and attachment to the united states of america by virtue of the power aforesaid do constitute and appoint you a colonel of one of the said battalions giving and granting you authority by and with the advice of your other fieldofficers to appoint all officers under the rank of fieldofficers necessary for the same nevertheless reserving to myself the right of ratifying or rejecting such appointments and as many good officers may have been overlooked in the new appointments by the committees of the several states assigned for the discharge of that business it is my wish that you give a preference to such of them as you know to be deserving of notice i do hereby require and enjoin you forthwith to take measures for recruiting such battalion in the most expeditious manner to serve for the term of three years or during the continuance of the war with great britain and upon such pay bounties and allowances     as have been resolved on by congress for the eightyeight battalions aforesaid given at headquarters at morristown this   th day of january       george washington    jan      morristown to the president of congress headquarters morristown    jan      sir i am honored with yours of the  th enclosing several resolves of congress respecting an exchange to be proposed between general lee and the hessian fieldofficers taken at trenton colonel rahl died the day after the action and we left one of the majors so ill of his wounds that i am in doubt of his recovery i can however make an offer of all that remain in exchange for general lee except one whom you order to be proposed by colonel allen if the offer is rejected by general howe i shall think myself then at liberty to remonstrate to him on his treatment of general lee if he will not exchange him he should at least admit him to his parole as we     have ever done to their prisoners who have fallen into our hands i understand from undoubted authority that they intend to try the general by a courtmartial as a deserter from their service pretending that his resignation was never accepted but i shall inform general howe that if any such step is taken under so shallow and illegal a pretext and their sentence should extend either to affect his life or liberty they may depend upon the most severe and adequate retaliation upon our part  the enemy have made no move since my last by every account they begin to be distressed particularly for forage of which there is little or none remaining in the small circle they possess except salt hay by letters from general heath of the  th he was beginning to move down towards kingsbridge with the troops from new england this must add to the distress of the enemy who will by this measure be deprived of the subsistence they formerly drew from westchester and the counties to the northward of york island      george washington    january      lord howe to lord howe headquarters    january      my lord i am sorry that i am under the disagreeable necessity of troubling your lordship with a letter almost wholly on the subject of the cruel treatment which our officers and men in the naval department who are unhappy enough to fall into your hands receive on board the prisonships in the harbour of new york without descending to particulars i shall ground my complaint upon the matter contained in the enclosed paper which is an exact copy of an account of the usage of the prisoners delivered to congress by a captain gamble lately a prisoner himself in new york if this account be true of which i have no reason to doubt as captain gamble is said to be a man of veracity i call upon your lordship to say whether any treatment of your officers and seamen has merited so severe a retaliation i am bold to say it has not so far from it that the officers and seamen taken on board armed ships have been treated with the greatest humanity and not forced to enter on board any of our public or private vessels of war and those taken in the merchant service have been immediately set at liberty from the opinion i have ever been taught to entertain of your lordships humanity i will not suppose that you are privy to proceedings of so cruel and unjustifiable a nature and i hope that upon making the proper inquiry you will have the matter so regulated that the unhappy creatures whose lot is captivity     may not in future have the miseries of cold disease and famine added to their other misfortunes you may call us rebels and say that we deserve no better treatment but remember my lord that supposing us rebels we still have feelings equally as keen and sensible as loyalists and will if forced to it most assuredly retaliate upon those upon whom we look as the unjust invaders of our rights liberties and properties i should not have said thus much but my injured countrymen have long called upon me to endeavor to obtain a redress of their grievances and i shall think myself as culpable as those who inflict such severities upon them were i to continue silent i enclose your lordship a list of the captain and crew of an armed boat belonging to georgia taken by the rover a manofwar captain stanhope there are a sufficient number of prisoners in georgia belonging to your navy to make an exchange if the measure meets your approbation it will be very agreeable to both parties i lately sent in lieutenant boger who belonged to the liverpool frigate captain bellew of the same frigate took a captain burke and sent him into new york for the express purpose of having him exchanged for boger i should therefore be glad to have captain burke sent out there are two captains of merchantmen by the name of bell and getshius on board the whitley prisonship if your lordship will grant them their liberty upon parole i will engage to send two british masters in exchange for them i am c     george washington    january      morristown lieutenantgeneral howe to lieutenantgeneral howe headquarters morristown    january      sir i am directed by congress to propose an exchange of five of the hessian fieldofficers taken at trenton for majorgeneral lee or if this proposal should not be acceded to to demand his liberty upon parole within certain bounds as has ever been granted to your officers in our custody i am informed from good authority that your reason for keeping him hitherto in stricter confinement than usual is that you do not look upon him in the light of a common prisoner of war but as a deserter from the british service as his resignation was never accepted of and that you intend to try him by a courtmartial as such i will not undertake to determine how far this doctrine may be justifiable among yourselves but i must give you warning that majorgeneral lee is looked upon as an officer belonging to and under the protection of the united independent states of america and that any violence which you may commit upon his life or liberty will be severely retaliated upon the lives or liberties of the british officers or those of their foreign allies at present in our hands  i am sorry that i am again under the necessity of     remonstrating to you upon the treatment which our prisoners continue to receive in new york those who have lately been sent out give the most shocking account of their barbarous usage which their miserable emaciated countenances confirm how very different was their appearance from that of your soldiers who have been lately returned to you after a captivity of twelve months and whether this difference in appearance was owing to a difference of treatment i leave it to you or any impartial person to determine i would beg that some certain rule of conduct towards prisoners may be settled if you are determined to make captivity as distressing as possible to those whose lot it is to fall into it let me know it that we may be upon equal terms for your conduct must and shall mark mine if a real scarcity of the articles of provisions and fuel at this inclement season is the cause that our prisoners are debarred them common humanity points   0 out a mode which is of suffering them to go home under parole not to serve during the war or until an equal number are released by us for them most of the prisoners who have returned home have informed me that they were offered better treatment provided they would enlist into your service this i believe is unprecedented and what if true makes it still more unnecessary for me to apologize for the freedom of expression which i have used throughout this letter but it would be criminal in me to be silent were such abuses when made known to me left unrepresented by me  i am with due respect sir c george washington jany         morris town joseph reed to joseph reed morris town jany         dear sir i very much approve of your visiting genl putnam as i cannot acct for his remaining at crosswicks     instead of removing to princeton as i have desired in several of my letters i would have him keep nothing at princeton except two or three days provisions but what can be moved off at an hours warning—in that case if good scouting parties are kept constantly out no possible damage can happen to the troops under his command who are to retreat in case they are compelled to leave princeton towards the mountains so as to form a junction with the army under my immediate command this will serve as a direction to him in removing the stores if any yet remain at princeton i would have no time lost in drawing the flour from the mills on millstone least the enemy should attempt  avail themselves of it—i would also have genl putnam draw his forage as much as possible from the vicinity of brunswick that the enemy may thereby be distressed the inhabitants of that district should be compelled to bring it in— the two companies under command of col durkee aided by the militia in that quarter should be constantly harassing the enemy about bound brook and the westroad side of brunswick rariton i mean—i have directed genl sullivan to do the like on the quarter next him particular attention should be paid to the surgeon sent by lord cornwallis by my consent to take charge of their wounded at princeton he will more than probably convey a true account of your numbers which ought to be a good deal magnified at princeton and give other useful knowledge of your situation if therefore the wounded are in a condition     to remove would it not be best to send them to brunswick with the surgeon if any of them or their attendants have been considered and properly were prisoners to us for an equal number to be demanded in lieu i have inclosed genl howe a copy of mr yatess declaration and have remonstrated sharply on the treatment of our prisoners—what have you done with the negro you apprehended the waggon with the ammunition and matchcoats i am obliged to you for taking care of it is not yet arrived—in what manner did col quicks militia leave the rangers—in the field—run away if so they ought to be punished or shamd i recollect of my approving of windway laying off the roads between brunswick and amboy—i must beg the favor of colo cox in your absence to continue the pursuit after intelligence—would it not be well for the militia under colo malcom to unite with the rangers for the purpose of keeping out constant scouts to annoy and harass the enemy in manner before mentioned—i ask for information as i would not suffer a man to stir beyond their lines nor suffer them to have the least intercourse with the country i am dear sir c george washington jan   th      morris town joseph reed to joseph reed morris town jan   th      dear sir the enclosed was intended to have gone by the express who brought me your last letter—he came in the evening of the   th was desired to call early     next morning and i have never seen or heard of him since many days ago i wrote to genl putnam supposing him to be at princeton to have the stores rescued from the hands of the militia who had borne them off and had no doubt but he had done it—what in the name of heaven can he be doing at crosswicks i know not after my repeated wishes to hear of him at princeton surely he is there by this time—in that case desire him from me to use every possible means to recover the stores and bring the authors to punishment especially colo chambers to whom i have written on this subject i will speak to the quarter master genl for a person to be sent on this business but apprehend from what i heard him say yesterday that he has nobody to spare not being able to carry on his business here for want of biddle and mifflin who are both absent and sick if the militia cannot be prevaild upon to restrain the foraging parties and to annoy and harass the enemy in their excursions and upon a march they will be of very little use to us as i am sure they can never be brought fairly up to an attack in any serious matter when you see genl mercer be so good as to present my best wishes to him—and congratulations if the state of his health will admit of it on his recovery from death you may assure him that nothing but the confident assertion to me that he was either dead—or within a few minutes of dying and that he was put into as good a place as i could     remove him to prevented my seeing him after the action and pursuit at princeton my compliments also if you please to colo cox from whom i shall expect a continuation of such intelligence as occurs  he is able to procure yours c p s the letter to colo chambers you will have sent—it is open for your perusal  george washington    jan      morristown general heath to general heath headquarters morristown    jan      dear sir captain bell of philadelphia a very intelligent and credible person made his escape from new york about ten days ago he informs me that there were no troops upon long island but delanceys brigade and not more than one thousand men upon york island all the rest having joined the army now in jersey and that transports were gone up the sound to bring back the troops from rhode island in order to make a junction of their whole army to endeavor to give us a total defeat this i think by     no means improbable now if you could get any certain information of their strength within the island which i think may be done by sending in persons who have taken protections and should not find it to exceed what captain bell reports a stroke might be struck before they are reinforced from rhode island that would ruin them this is a matter of such consequence that i would have you spare neither pains nor expense to gain intelligence we have heard that they were building sleds in new york which i suppose are for drawing wood this winter but it would be well for your spies to learn what use they are really intended for i have directed generals spencer and arnold to follow the enemy if they leave rhode island and fall down the sound again i am dear sir c  george washington    january      morristown majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler headquarters morristown    january      dear sir it is some time since i had the pleasure of writing to or receiving a letter from you the weight of business which has lain upon both our hands has i dare say hindered us from writing letters but when absolutely necessary the enemy by two lucky strokes at trenton and princeton have been obliged to abandon every part of jersey except brunswic and     amboy and the small tract of country between them which is so entirely exhausted of supplies of every kind that i hope by preventing them from sending their foraging parties to any great distance to reduce them to the utmost distress in the course of this winter colonel dayton arrived from the northward a few days ago he informs me that the time of most of his regiment expires in february but that they are extremely anxious to get down to this part of the country where many of them have families and connexions who they suppose must have suffered many hardships as the enemy were for some time in possession of the country and committed every kind of depredation upon the inhabitants he thinks if they were brought down here before they are discharged that most of them might be induced to enlist for the war which would be a thing to be wished for as i am told they are a fine body of men and well acquainted with this country which will in all probability be the scene of action next campaign i would not give colonel dayton any kind of promise to withdraw the regiment from ticonderoga one day before their time expires without consulting you and i do it now only for the reasons before mentioned      i shall be glad to hear from you upon the subject of garrisoning the forts upon the lakes against the next campaign both as to the number of men and the time that they ought to be there i should think that the levies from massachusetts and new hampshire had better be ordered there as it is more convenient for them than the troops of any other state to march to that quarter i wish to be informed of the number and state of the public arms to the northward as i suppose many of the disbanded troops left theirs behind them i am dear sir with great regard c george washington    january      morristown majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath morristown    january      dear sir by this time you must have discovered what effect your movement towards new york has occasioned if the city on the one hand is not left so destitute     of troops as to afford you an easy conquest of it nor so strengthened as to leave the enemy weak in this state the end of your expedition is not answered and the junction of your troops with these under my command after leaving sufficient guards at the forts and passes of the highlands becomes indispensably necessary i have therefore to desire that you will be preparing boats at some convenient place for crossing the north river in order that no time may be lost if it should become as i believe it shortly will absolutely necessary for a junction of the forces i cannot in this place assign you my reasons for this opinion but i desire if your prospects are not such as i hoped for on that side that you will prepare for a remove and pay strict and diligent obedience to the order when you receive it as much may depend on despatch in the mean while continue to procure and give me every possible information of the enemys strength and situation i am sir yours c      george washington    january      morristown to the council of safety of pennsylvania headquarters morristown    january      gentlemen the readiness which the militia of pennsylvania have shown by engaging in the service of their country at an inclement season of the year when my army was reduced to an handful of men and our affairs in the most critical situation does great honor to them and to your state but although they have contributed greatly to the success which has lately attended our arms i must inform you that with pain i hear they have determined to return home most of the city militia have determined to stay some days longer they must then be discharged as i am well informed they are generally in want of almost every necessary i must depend chiefly this winter on the militia to enable me to act offensively or even to make a stand and therefore sincerely wish they could have been prevailed upon to serve till they could have been relieved by the troops now raising by the continent there now is the fairest opportunity of totally destroying the british army or at least of delaying their operations in the spring till we may be prepared to oppose them by regular forces as it is a matter of the highest importance that your militia should be   0 put on such a footing as will fully answer the exigency of our affairs at this time i do most earnestly recommend that such spirited and effectual measures be adopted as will soonest accomplish this great and necessary work as there is not the least doubt at present that the principal object of the enemy is to get possession of the city of philadelphia it is absolutely necessary that every person able to bear arms except such as are conscientiously scrupulous against it in every case should give their personal service and whenever a part of the militia is required only either to join the army or find a man in their place in order to effect this i beg you will order the whole militia of your state to be enrolled and completely equipped that one half at least may proceed to join the army with all possible expedition those who have done their tour of duty already to be excused but those that have not should be obliged to come forth or hire a proper person in their place and to remain till the  st of april unless sooner discharged by the commanderinchief you may be assured that nothing but the united efforts of every state in america can save us from disgrace and too probably from ruin the army is much reduced since we left trenton and the many that will be discharged in a few days will so weaken our force that it will be impossible to oppose the enemy with success should they advance towards us or do any essential service if they should move towards philadelphia as i cannot expect our situation can long be a secret to the enemy there is no doubt but they will avail     themselves of it and take advantage of our weakness when any of your militia are coming forward i beg you will inform them that the time for which they engage to serve is to begin when they join the army the want of a regular wellestablished government in your state has greatly obstructed the public service i therefore recommend that some authority be immediately exerted to draw forth your whole strength i have the honor to be c george washington    january      morristown to the president of congress headquarters morristown    january      sir the fluctuating state of an army composed chiefly of militia bids fair to reduce us to a situation in which we were some little time ago that is of scarce having any army at all except reinforcements speedily arrive one of the battalions from the city of philadelphia goes home today and the other two only remain a few days longer by courtesy the time for which a county brigade under general mifflin came out is expired and they stay from day to day by dint of solicitation their numbers much reduced by desertions we have about eight hundred of the eastern continental troops remaining of twelve or fourteen hundred who at first agreed to stay part engaged to the last of this month and part to the middle of next the five virginia regiments are reduced to a handful of men as are colonel hands smallwoods and the german battalion a few days ago general     warner arrived with about seven hundred massachusetts militia engaged to the   th of march thus you have a sketch of our present army with which we are obliged to keep up appearances before an enemy already double in numbers and who from every account are withdrawing their troops from rhode island to form a junction of their whole army and make another attempt either to break up ours or penetrate towards philadelphia a thing by no means difficult now as the ice affords an easy passage over the delaware i do not yet know what effect general heaths moving down towards new york will have yesterday morning a considerable firing was heard which seemed to be about kingsbridge i am in hopes that his appearance in that quarter with a pretty large force will oblige them to withdraw part of theirs from jersey to secure the city of new york which by late accounts is weakly garrisoned general heath has all the eastern and new york militia with him except the small brigade under general warner that i mentioned before one regiment of connecticut stopped at providence in rhode island and a number how many i do not know requested by general schuyler to be sent to ticonderoga if it should appear that they are regardless of the diversion made by general heath and persist in their plan of drawing their whole army together in jersey i must order him over with all his troops except as many as are necessary to garrison the forts and guard the passes in the highlands i have ordered away every officer that could be spared some to recruit and some to collect the scattered     men of the different regiments who are dispersed almost over the continent for of the vast numbers sent to the hospitals at different times few ever returned after they got well as militia must be our dependence till we can get the new army raised and properly arranged i must entreat you to continue your endeavors with the states of pennsylvania maryland and virginia to turn out every man they possibly can and for some time longer than they have generally stipulated for if they agree for a month or any limited time it should commence from the time they actually join the army and not from the time they leave their homes otherwise the marching backwards and forwards consumes the term of engagement i think these demands of aid should be made as quietly as the nature of the case will admit especially at this time when we are deceiving our enemies with false opinions of our numbers for to boast of our superiority in that respect on one hand and to call publicly on the people for assistance on the other is an impropriety too glaring indeed it has been already noticed in some publications that i have seen from new york i have the honor to be c  george washington  0 january      morristown governor cooke to governor cooke morristown  0 january      sir i am exceedingly sorry to hear that your state have ordered several battalions to be raised for the defence of the state only and this before proper     measures are taken to fill the continental regiments you cannot be insensible how unequal any one state is unconnected with the others to defend itself if the enemy makes a descent against it with any considerable part of their force neither have you the least reason to think you would derive less protection from the troops if they were raised upon the continents account than on that of the state if each state was to prepare for its own defence independent of each other they would all be soon conquered one by one our success must depend upon a firm union and a strict adherence to the general plan other measures may produce a partial relief but never can remove the principal evil you must be sensible the season is fast approaching when a new campaign will open nay the former is not yet closed neither do i intend it shall be unless the enemy quits the jerseys it is of the last importance to the interest of america that the new regiments be speedily levied it would give me an opportunity in the fore part of the campaign before the enemy can collect their force or receive any reinforcement from home to give them a fatal stab such a blow in the fore part of the season might terminate the campaign to great advantage i am sure the necessity of having the continental regiments immediately completed are too obvious to need any further arguments i hope the powers of government are such as to complete the new levies by draft if they cannot be filled seasonably by voluntary enlistments     necessity obliges me to call upon you as i shall upon every other state in the most pressing terms to complete without delay your proportion of the eightyeight battalions i am confident the raising the two regiments at the expense of the state before the continental regiments are complete can answer no valuable purpose if the enemy make a descent upon rhode island with any considerable force the opposition of two regiments will be inconsiderable if they only infest the coast with their ships the militia would answer a much better purpose and at a far less expense i must confess i am ignorant of the reasons that induced the assembly to adopt the measure neither can i conceive of the use and policy of the scheme i wish it may not be productive of more injury than benefit by introducing innovations and changes that must retard the filling the continental regiments and consequently prejudice the general interest which every state must have an eye to and the obligation on you is stronger than on any one else being the most exposed and the least capable of making a separate defence our affairs here are in a very prosperous train within a month past in several engagements with the enemy we have killed wounded and taken prisoners between two and three thousand men i am very confident the enemys loss here will oblige them to recall their force from your state if i am properly supported i hope to close the campaign gloriously for america i have the honor to be c     george washington  0 january      morristown lieutenantgeneral howe to lieutenantgeneral howe headquarters morristown  0 january      sir i take the liberty to propose the establishment of an officer to reside in new york under parole to transmit no intelligence but what belongs to his office whose business it shall be to provide necessaries for such prisoners as fall into your hands perhaps the establishment of such an officer with proper credits may put a stop to the many complaints which i am daily under the necessity of hearing some probably without foundation and others arising from the want of many things which you are not obliged to furnish the prisoners the gentleman i would beg leave to recommend as a proper agent is mr lewis pintard the bearer a person well known in new york and of longestablished reputation as a considerable merchant  the council of safety of pennsylvania have desired liberty when the weather permits of sending a vessel under a flag with a supply of meat and flour for our prisoners in new york i shall be glad to be favored with your answer and am with due respect sir c      george washington january         morris town john parke custis to john parke custis morris town january         dear sir your letter of the seventh came to my hands a few days ago and brought with it the pleasing reflection of your still holding me in remembrance the misfortune of short enlistments and an unhappy dependance upon militia have shown their baneful influence at every period and almost upon every occasion throughout the whole course of this war at no time nor upon no occasion were they ever more exemplified than since christmas for if we could but have got in the militia in time or prevailed upon those troops whose times expired as they generally did on the first of this instant to have continued not more than a thousand or twelve     hundred agreeing to stay we might i am persuaded have cleared the jerseys entirely of the enemy instead of this all our movements have been made with inferior numbers and with a mixed motley crew who were here today gone tomorrow without assigning a reason or even apprizing you of it in a word i believe i may with truth add that i do not think that any officer since the creation ever had such a variety of difficulties and perplexities to encounter as i have how we shall be able to rub along till the new army is raised i know not providence has heretofore saved us in a remarkable manner and on this we must principally rely every person in every state should exert himself to facilitate the raising and marching the new regiments to the army with all possible expedition     i have never seen but heard of the resolve you mentioned nor do i get a paper of purdies  once a month those who want faith to believe the account of the shocking wastes committed by howes army—of their ravaging plundering and abuse of women—may be convinced to their sorrow perhaps if a check can not be put to their progress it is painful to me to hear of such illiberal reflections upon the eastern troops as you say prevails in virginia i always have and always shall say that i do not believe that any of the states produce better men or persons capable of making better soldiers but it is to be acknowledged that they are generally speaking most wretchedly officered to this and this only is to be attributed their demerits the policy of those states has been to level men as much as possible to one standard the distinction therefore between officers and soldiers    and that hunger and thirst after glory which     this is the true secret and we have found that wherever a regiment is well officered their men have behaved well—when otherwise ill—the misconduct or cowardly behavior always originating with the officers who have set the example equal injustice is done them in depriving them of merit in other respects for no people fly to arms readier than they do or come better equipped or with more regularity into the field than they   0 with respect to your inquiries about payments made mr — i cannot answer them with precision but i am exceedingly mistaken if i have not made him two for both you and myself indeed i am as sure of it as i can be of any thing from the badness of my memory i think i made him one payment myself and the treasurer or hill made him the other the book however in which i keep your accounts will show it the parchment covered quarto one as you will i suppose find yourself charged by me with the payments made in my letter to lund washington i have given the late occurrences and to avoid repetition i refer you to him my love to nelly and compliments to mr calverts family and all other inquiring friends leaving me nothing else to add than that i am your affectionate george washington    january      morristown to the president of congress headquarters morristown    january      sir my last to you was on the  0th instant since that i have the pleasure to inform you that general dickinson with about four hundred militia has defeated a foraging party of the enemy of an equal number and has taken forty wagons and upwards of a hundred horses most of them of the english draft breed and a number of sheep and cattle which they had collected the enemy retreated with so much precipitation that general dickinson had only an opportunity of making nine prisoners they were     observed to carry off a good many dead and wounded in light wagons this action happened near somerset courthouse on millstone river general dickinsons behavior reflects the highest honor upon him for though his troops were all raw he led them through the river middledeep and gave the enemy so severe a charge that although supported by three fieldpieces they gave way and left their convoy i have not heard from general heath since the firing near kingsbridge last saturday which i cannot account for unless the north river should have been rendered impassable by the ice but the account of his having surprised and taken fort independence on friday night last comes so well authenticated by different ways that i cannot doubt it it is said that he took  00 prisoners in that fort and that he invested fort washington on saturday which occasioned the firing this is brought out by three of our officers who made their escape from new york on sunday and is confirmed by a spy who went into amboy who says an express had arrived at amboy from new york with an account of the loss of fort independence and calling for a reinforcement to protect the city in consequence of which a number of troops had gone over i have sent in spies to brunswic and amboy to know the truth of this and if it appears that they have weakened themselves to reinforce new york i shall probably make some attempt upon them if we have men enough left to do it     i shall be glad to know what stock of small arms you at present have and what are your expectations shortly the necessity that we have been and are now under of calling in and arming the militia scatters our armory all over the world in a manner their officers are so irregular that they generally suffer their men to carry home every thing that is put into their hands which is forever lost to the public the new raised regiments will call for a great number of arms and i do not at present see how they are to be supplied i would again beg leave to recall the attention of congress to the appointment of general officers i will not suppose the nomination of them is postponed upon a saving principle because the advantage in having proper officers to examine the payrolls of their several regiments and compare them with the returns of their brigades to see that the regiments are provided with what is proper and that no more than a sufficiency is allowed to keep officers to their duty and not while the spirited officer is encountering all the fatigues and hardships of a rigorous campaign suffer a number of others under various frivolous pretences and imaginary sicknesses to enjoy themselves at the public expense at their own firesides—i say if the appointments are withheld upon parsimonious principles the congress are mistaken for i am convinced that by the correction of many abuses which it is impossible for me to attend to the public will be benefited in a great degree in the article of expense but this is not all we have very little     time to do a very great work in the arranging providing for and disciplining a hundred and odd battalions is not to be accomplished in a day nor is it to be done at all with any degree of propriety when we have once entered upon the active part of the campaign these duties must be branched out or they will be neglected and the public injured besides were the brigadiers appointed they might be facilitating the recruiting service they would have time to get a little acquainted with their brigades and the wants of them and ease me of the great weight and burden which i at present feel on whom the choice will or ought to light i cannot undertake to say in a former letter i took the liberty of submitting to the consideration of congress the propriety of appointing out of each state brigadiers to command the troops of that state thinking as a distinction is now fixed a spirit of emulation might arise by this means at any rate i shall take the liberty of recommending general cadwalader as one of the first for the new appointments i have found him a man of ability a good disciplinarian firm in his principles and of intrepid bravery i shall also beg leave to recommend colonel reed to the command of the horse as a person in my opinion every way qualified for he is extremely active and enterprising many signal proofs of which he has given this campaign for the rest the members of congress can judge better than i can i can only say that as the army will probably be divided in the course of the next campaign there ought in my     opinion to be three lieutenantgenerals nine majorgenerals and twentyseven brigadiers in other words there ought at least to be a brigadier to every four regiments and a majorgeneral to every three brigades the lieutenantgenerals will i presume be appointed out of the oldest majorgenerals and the majorgenerals from the oldest brigadiers new brigadiers will then be to nominate i forgot before this to inform congress that including the regiment of light dragoons from virginia and colonel sheldons to be raised in connecticut i have only commissioned officers for four regiments i was willing to try how these could be equipped before i put more officers into commission it is apprehended we shall find difficulty in providing necessaries or even horses for these four regiments if we should not i shall immediately set about the residue colonel baylor colonel moylan who as volunteer has remained constantly with the army since his discontinuance in the quartermasters department and colonel sheldon command the three new regiments of light dragoons the treasury has been for some time empty and the army has labored under the greatest inconvenience for want of money the recruiting service is particularly injured by this as many officers are now waiting only for bountymoney i have also complaints from the eastward of the want of money to carry on their recruiting service if we are not supplied with that necessary article all matters must be at a stand i must therefore beg that if mr palfrey has not been already     supplied with a large sum it may be done with the utmost expedition and that you will endeavor to keep up the supply by constantly sending on smaller parcels i am c p s i did not recollect majorgeneral lincoln in the provincial service of massachusetts he is an excellent officer and worthy of your notice in the continental line george washington    january      middlebrook joseph reed to joseph reed middlebrook    january      dear sir your favors of the   th and   th inst are both before me and on two accounts have given me pain first because i much wished to see you at the head of the cavalry and secondly by refusing of it my arrangements have been a good deal disconcerted as your notions for refusing the appointment are no doubt satisfactory to yourself and your determination fixed it is unnecessary to enter upon a discussion of the point i can only add i wish it had been otherwise especially as i flatter myself that my last would convince you that you still held the same place in my affection that you ever did if inclination or a desire of rendering those aids to the service which your abilities enable you to do should lead you to the camp it is unnecessary for me i hope to add that i should be extremely happy in seeing you one of my family whilst you remain in it the late coalition of parties in pennsylvania is a most fortunate circumstance that and the spirited     manner in which the militia of this state turned out upon the late manœuvre of the enemy has in my opinion given a greater shock to the enemy than any event which has happened in the course of this dispute because it was altogether unexpected and gave the decisive stroke to their enterprise on philadelphia the hint you have given respecting the compliment due to the executive powers of pennsylvania i thank you for but can assure you i gave general mifflin no direction respecting the militia that i did not conceive nay that i had not been told by congress he was vested with before for you must know that general mifflin at the particular instance and by a resolve of congress had been detained from his duty in this camp near a month to be in readiness to have out the militia if the occasion should require it and only got here the day before i received such intelligence as convinced me that the enemy were upon the point of moving in consequence of which i requested him to return and without defining his duty desired he would use his utmost endeavors to carry the designed opposition into effect conceiving that a previous plan had been laid by congress or the state of pennsylvania so far as respected the mode of drawing the militia out the action of them afterward circumstances alone could direct i did not pretend to give any order about it it gives me pleasure to learn from your letter that the reasons assigned by me to general arnold for not attacking the enemy in their situation between the raritan and millstone met with the approbation     of those who were acquainted with them we have some amongst us and i dare say generals who wish to make themselves popular at the expense of others or who think the cause is not to be advanced otherwise than by fighting—the peculiar circumstances under which it is to be done and the consequences which may follow are objects too trivial for their attention—but as i have one great end in view i shall maugre all the illegible of this kind steadily pursue the means which in my judgment leads to the accomplishment of it not doubting but that the candid part of mankind if they are convinced of my integrity will make proper allowance for my inexperience and frailties i will agree to be loaded with all the obloquy they can bestow if i commit a wilful error if general howe has not manœuvred much deeper than most people seem disposed to think him capable of his army is absolutely gone off panic struck but as i cannot persuade myself into a belief of the latter notwithstanding it is the prevailing opinion of my officers i cannot say that the move i am about to make towards amboy accords altogether with my opinion not that i am under any other apprehension than that of being obliged to lose ground again which would indeed be no small misfortune as the spirits of our troops and the country is greatly revived and i presume the enemys not a little depressed by their late retrograde motions by some late accounts i fancy the british grenadiers got a pretty severe peppering yesterday by     morgans rifle corps they fought it seems a considerable time within the distance of from twenty to forty yards and from the concurring accounts of several of the officers more than a hundred of them must have fallen had there not been some mistake in point of time for marching the several brigades that were ordered upon that service and particularly in delivering an order to general varnum i believe the rear of general howes troops might have been a little rougher handled than they were for if an express who went to general maxwell the evening before had reached him in time to cooperate upon the enemys flank for which purpose he was sent down the day before with a respectable force very good consequences might have resulted from it however it is too late to remedy these mistakes and my paper tells me i can add no more than to assure you that i am c  george washington    january      morristown governor trumbull to governor trumbull  morristown    january      sir the situation to which i am reduced for want of a regular body of troops on whom i can depend for a length of time makes it indispensably necessary for me to call upon you and entreat you to exert yourself in levying and equipping the number of battalions allotted to your state by the resolution of congress     in september last you must be fully sensible of the hardship imposed upon individuals and how detrimental it must be to the public to have her farmers and her tradesmen frequently called into the field as militiamen whereby a total stop is put to arts and agriculture without which we cannot possibly long subsist but great as this inconvenience is we must put up with it or submit to a greater the total loss of our liberties until our regular continental army can be brought into the field the above reasons alone i hope will be sufficient to induce you to exert yourselves for if our new army are not ready to take the field early in the spring we shall lose all the advantages which i may say we have providentially gained this winter while our dependence is upon militia we have a full army one day and scarce any the next and i am much afraid that the enemy one day or other taking advantage of one of these temporary weaknesses will make themselves masters of our magazines of stores arms and artillery nothing but their ignorance of our numbers protects us at this very time when on the contrary had we six or eight thousand regular troops or could the militia who were with me a few days ago have been prevailed upon to stay we could have struck such a stroke as would have inevitably ruined the army of the enemy in their divided state i am not without hopes that by creating a powerful diversion on the side of new york we may still keep their force divided between that province and this if so and a good body of regular troops could  00 be thrown in to me before the roads will be in a condition for the enemy with their reduced wagon and artillery horses to move out it perhaps may not be out of my power to strike a decisive blow before spring this is another and a forcible reason to induce you to send your new levies forward with all expedition while the men are raising i beg you will spare no pains to make a collection of all things necessary for their equipment not only with such as they can carry with them into the field but for their use and convenience while they are there such as spare shoes stockings and shirts the want of which has been the ruin of the old army if these articles are provided and put into the hands of the regimental quartermaster they can always be delivered out when wanted and stoppages made by the paymasters i expect the clothiergeneral will be with the army in a few days when i shall give him directions to allot a proportion of the clothing lately taken and purchased for the public to each state i have the honor to be c george washington    january      morristown governor livingston to governor livingston morristown    january      sir the irregular and disjointed state of the militia of this province makes it necessary for me to inform you that unless a law is immediately passed by your legislature to reduce them to some order and oblige them to turn out in a different manner from what they  0  have hitherto done we shall bring very few into the field and even those few will render little or no service their officers are generally of the lowest class of the people and instead of setting a good example to their men are leading them into every kind of mischief one species of which is plundering the inhabitants under the pretence of their being tories a law should in my opinion be passed to put a stop to this kind of lawless rapine for unless there is something done to prevent it the people will throw themselves of choice into the hands of the british troops but your first object should be a wellregulated militia law the people put under good officers would behave in quite another manner and not only render real service as soldiers but would protect instead of distressing the inhabitants what i would wish to have particularly insisted upon in the new law should be that every man capable of bearing arms should be obliged to turn out and not buy off his service by a trifling fine we want men and not money i am c general washingtons proclamation whereas several persons inhabitants of the united states of america influenced by inimical motives intimidated by the threats of the enemy or deluded by a proclamation issued the  0th of november last by lord and general howe styled the kings commissioners for granting pardons c now at open war and invading these states have been so lost to the interest and welfare of their country as to repair to the enemy sign a declaration of fidelity and in some instances have been compelled to take the oath of allegiance and engaged not to take up arms  0  or encourage others so to do against the king of great britain and whereas it has become necessary to distinguish between the friends of america and those of great britain inhabitants of these states and that every man who receives protection from and as a subject of any state not being conscientiously scrupulous against bearing arms should stand ready to defend the same against hostile invasion i do therefore in behalf of the united states by virtue of the powers committed to me by congress hereby strictly command and require every person having subscribed such declaration taken such oath and accepted such protection and certificate to repair to headquarters or to the quarters of the nearest general officer of the continental army or militia until further provision can be made by the civil authority and there deliver up such protection certificate and passports and take the oath of allegiance to the united states of america nevertheless hereby granting full liberty to all such as prefer the interest and protection of great britain to the freedom and happiness of their country forthwith to withdraw themselves and families within the enemys lines and i do hereby declare that all and every person who may neglect or refuse to comply with this order within thirty days from the date hereof will be deemed adherents to the king of great britain and treated as common enemies to these american states given at headquarters morristown this   th day of january        0  george washington    january      morristown to the president of congress headquarters morristown    january      sir i was last night honored with yours of the   th instant enclosing a letter from the state of new york to congress from the particular situation of that state in regard to their being totally deprived of commerce they certainly must stand in need of the assistance of the other states to provide them with clothing and every thing necessary for the equipment of their forces and it ever was my intention to allow them a full proportion of the clothing purchased to the eastward whenever it came to hand little or none of it has yet reached this army though in the greatest want and exposed to the severities of a winter campaign the convention have in one instance already provided for themselves out of the public stock by stopping and making use of twentysix bales of clothing coming on from the eastward to the army here as this was done without consulting me i took the liberty of desiring them not to do the like in future not that i meant to deprive them of their share but because it disappointed me of many  0  articles which i stood in immediate want of and had not provided from other quarters but you may be assured that whenever returns are made of the whole stock of clothing they shall have their proportion and more than that allowance for their peculiar situation i am amazed to hear the complaints of the hospital on the east side of hudsons river dr morgan with most of his mates has been constantly there since i left it with the main body of the army it is in vain however to look back upon past misfortunes i will not pretend to point out the causes but i know matters have been strangely conducted in the medical line i hope your new appointment when it is made will make the necessary reform in the hospital and that i shall not the next campaign have my ears and eyes too shocked with the complaints and looks of poor creatures perishing for want of proper care either in the regimental or hospital surgeons i agree with the convention in the expediency of obstructing the passage of the north river in some place between the mouth and the highlands we have found that our labor and expense have been thrown away in endeavoring to do it below where the channel is amazingly wide and deep but from the slight view i have had of the river above i think the passage may be easily obstructed and defended by proper fortifications as the river is so narrow that no vessel going up could possibly escape the fire i am no judge of what can be done towards fitting out the frigates at poughkeepsie that must be left to the gentlemen of the marine committee  0  the hint given by the convention of new york of the necessity and utility of a commissary of forage had struck me before and had been mentioned by general mifflin whose department of quartermastergeneral must be eased of part of the load which is at present thrown upon it he is obliged in many instances to act entirely out of his proper line and instead of being confined to the duty of quartermastergeneral is also wagonmaster and foragemaster general i have written to two persons that i think qualified to fill the office of wagonmaster and i hope one of them will accept that of commissary of forage shall be attended to the want of accurate maps of the country which has hitherto been the scene of war has been of great disadvantage to me i have in vain endeavored to procure them and have been obliged to make shift with such sketches as i could trace out from my own observation and that of gentlemen around me i really think if gentlemen of known character and probity could be employed in making maps from actual survey of the roads of the rivers and bridges and fords over them and of the mountains and passes through them it would be of the greatest advantage i had previous to the receipt of your letter written to general howe and proposed the fixing of an agent for prisoners at new york i have not received an answer but if he accedes to the proposal i shall appoint mr lewis pintard i am sorry that i am obliged to contradict the report of the taking of fort independence as mentioned in my last i  0  believe the evacuation of some detatched redoubts gave rise to the report i have not heard from genl heath since the   th instant which i am amazed at i am quite in the dark as to his numbers and what progress he has made  on the   d a party of four hundred of our men under colonel buckner fell in with two regiments of the enemy convoying a number of wagons from brunswic to amboy our advanced party under colonel parker engaged them with great bravery upwards of twenty minutes during which time the colonelcommandant was killed and the second in command mortally wounded the people living near the field of action say their killed and wounded were considerable we lost only two men who were made prisoners had colonel buckner come up with the main body colonel parker and the other officers think we should have put them to rout as their confusion was very great and their ground disadvantageous i have ordered buckner under arrest and shall bring him to trial to answer for so extraordinary a piece of conduct reinforcements come up so extremely slow that i am afraid i shall be left without any men before they arrive the enemy must be ignorant of our numbers  0  or they have not horses to move their artillery or they would not suffer us to remain undisturbed i have repeatedly written to all the recruiting officers to forward on their men as fast as they could arm and clothe them but they are so extremely averse to turning out of comfortable quarters that i cannot get a man to come near me though i hear from all parts that the recruiting service goes on with great success it would be well if the board of war in whose department it is would issue orders for all officers to equip and forward their recruits to headquarters with the greatest expedition by a resolve congress passed some time ago general schuyler is directed to apply to me for ninetyfour tons of powder a quantity which it is impossible i should have by me and for which i do not know where to direct him to apply i could wish that returns were made to me of the quantity of powder on hand and where it is to be found that i may not be at a loss at any time of emergency since the resignation of colonel reed the important office of adjutantgeneral has been left unfilled i mean as to a principal and i am much at a loss how or where to find a person in every way capable and proper to execute the office my inclinations lead me to confer the appointment upon a major morris  but ample testimonials should be produced and full proof of fidelity ought to be made before an office of so high trust should be conferred upon a person in a manner a stranger to me i only know major morris from a short personal acquaintance  0  and from report he never even brought a letter of recommendation to me from his conversation and from the accounts i have received from others he is a man of considerable military abilities and from his behavior in two instances he is a man of bravery and conduct his story is simply this that he left the british service in disgust upon not receiving a promotion to which he was justly entitled perhaps some gentleman of congress may know more about him or may be able to make such inquiries as might satisfy them as to the safety and propriety of appointing him i have no other motive for wishing him a preference than that i think him the properest person that has come under my notice provided all matters before mentioned were cleared up i shall wait the result of a determination of congress before i proceed further in this appointment and i wish to be favored with their advice as speedily as possible for the remains of the old army are much disarranged for want of a good adjutantgeneral and the formation of the new one in a great measure depends upon an able officer in that line i have the honor to be c  george washington    january      morristown majorgeneral sullivan to majorgeneral sullivan morristown    january      dear sir the express delivered to me your favor this evening ignorant as i am of the ground which you occupy at the scotch plains i cannot positively determine  0  whether it is tenable or not however let me recommend to you to consider maturely whether the advantages that may accrue from your neighborhood to the enemy can balance the consequences that must result from your being driven from it its true your being posted so near them will save your scouts a few miles marching you have also a better chance of receiving good and early intelligence of their movements butt is as true that they may and will most certainly very soon discover your real numbers and what will follow your being attacked i have already mentioned in mine of this date  consult generals maxwell and stephen lay my letters to you on this head before them view your continuance there in every point of light and if you determine that the service may be benefited by remaining where you are i have no objections to your stay upon my word i think it a manœuvre of the last consequence and am not without my fears about its success you will assuredly be attacked in a few days if they have any spirit left knowing your strength they will do it with a force that will command success for it will be out of my power to relieve you in time   0 should you determine to remove remember to give it the air of some manœuvre that the enemy may be at a loss what to think of it i am c george washington    january      morristown to the governor of north carolina  morristown    january      sir the great countenance and protection shown and given to deserters by persons in the different neighborhoods from whence they originally came has made that vice so prevalent in the army that unless some very effectual measures are fallen upon to prevent it our new army will scarcely be raised before it will again dwindle and waste away from that cause alone i know of no remedy so effectual as for the different states immediately to pass laws laying a very severe penalty upon those who harbor or fail to give information against deserters knowing them to be such and strictly enjoining all justices of the peace and officers of militia to keep a watchful eye over and apprehend all such persons as shall return from the army without a discharge in order that this most salutary measure may be carried speedily into execution i have not only desired congress to recommend it to the different states but have myself wrote circular letters to them all pressing their compliance with my request desertion must cease of course when the offenders find that they have no shelter i have the honor to be c      george washington   february      morris town governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters morris town   february      sir i have the pleasure of yours of the   d january by major wyllys and thank you for your congratulations upon our late successes which have been attended with very happy consequences as the enemy have remained very quiet at brunswick and amboy since the affair at princetown i have wrote to congress in a very pressing manner not only to send on a present supply of money but to forward the checkbooks and loantickets with the greatest expedition i most sincerely wish it were in my power to procure the immediate release of all our officers and soldiers who have been so unfortunate as to fall into the hands of our enemies but when the chance of war has turned the scale against us in point of numbers what more can be done than to give those a preference who have longest endured captivity that i might avoid every imputation of partiality for     the officers of any particular state i have in all my letters to general howe and to mr loring the commissary of prisoners directed that an equal proportion of officers of the eastern and southern states be sent out but without paying any regard to my request they have given pennsylvania more than her proportion having never discharged one of the maryland officers taken on long island major meigs and captain hanchet are already released we have no general officer to propose for colonel waterbury and if we had general thompson who was taken long before has a preference if general howe does not accede to the proposal of congress for giving up all the hessian field officers taken at trenton for general lee lieutenant colonel hart and major wells will probably come in for their turn of exchange you by your return have sent in but three captains and i have convinced major wyllys who ranks as captain that i cannot consent to propose him for one of those without doing injustice to captain dearborn who was taken at quebec   st december      and captains trowbridge and percival taken the   th august last upon long island by my state of the exchange of prisoners a captain is still due us if there should be i have desired major wyllys may be accepted for him you mention the names of several subalterns who were taken upon long island and york island whose release you would wish but there are yet eight gentlemen taken at quebec who have a right to a     preference i have made a proposition to general howe which if he accepts will give great relief to our prisoners it is the establishment of an agent to reside in new york to see that the prisoners are well used and to supply them with necessaries i should have had no objection to appointing colonel root to the command of a regiment could it possibly be raised upon the terms allowed by congress which is a bounty of  0 dollars but by your state and that of massachusetts having given an additional bounty of   ⅓ dollars not a man can be raised till the eight regiments allotted to your state are full i have i may say unfortunately given seven of the additional regiments to gentlemen of new england and i was under the strongest hopes that they from their influence would have soon filled their regiments but i cannot suppose that men will enlist for a bounty of  0 dollars with them when they can get   ⅓ dollars from this state i have the honor c  george washington   february      morristown majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath morristown   february      dear sir your two favors of the  0th last month reached me last night i cannot say but i was a good deal surprised     and disappointed at the contents i never was very sanguine as to any thing more being effected than to oblige the garrison either to surrender or evacuate fort independence and retire within the island as neither has been done i wish your summons had never been sent as i am fearful it will expose us to the ridicule of our enemies by falling back as far as you have done one valuable purpose of your going down is lost and that is depriving the enemy of the forage of which they are in extreme want and collecting it for our own use  if my accounts from brunswic are true the enemy have notwithstanding your being upon their backs drawn considerable reinforcements from new york if so and you think that nothing of consequence can be effected by you in the neighborhood of kingsbridge i would have you leave a sufficient force at     peekskill to make the passes secure and throw the remainder over the river with orders to march immediately down here for if the troops return from rhode island and do not find you in westchester county they will certainly join their main body at brunswic and the garrison of york island may likewise be much reduced and the troops drawn from thence be likewise sent here we must in that case collect all our force to oppose theirs i wish we could possibly have foreseen that the diversion upon your side would not have had the desired effect for with the additions of the three thousand four hundred men that have been with you we could have distracted the enemy with a variety of attacks and made some considerable advantages the report of carletons army having joined howes is certainly without foundation     the securing the forage in west chester county for our own use or depriving the enemy from carrying it off for theirs is an object of so much moment that i desire some measures may yet be fallen upon to effect one or the other suppose a light body of troops under an active officer sufficient to repel any foraging parties of the enemy except they came out in very large bodies should be left behind and stationed as near kingsbridge as possible while they kept a good lookout they never could be surprised for not being encumbered with any baggage they could always move at a moments warning if the enemy came out with a superior force and move back when they returned this would oblige them to forage with such large covering parties that it would in a manner harrass their troops to death we have found the advantage of such practices with us for by keeping four or five hundred men far advanced we not only oblige them to forage with parties of   00 and  000 to cover but every now and then give them a smart brush your waggons might always safely be at work in the rear of your party for at this season of the year kingsbridge is the only point from whence the enemy can issue as to the number necessary for the above purpose i would have you consult mr duer and the gentlemen who best know the country after fixing that matter you will next determine what number are to be left at peekskill and i would have the remainder immediately marched forward to join me one thing i would wish you to observe that is that the     troops that come over should be those who have the longest time to serve in one of your former letters you desired leave to return for a while to new england when the service would admit of it i have no objection to your doing it after you have made the arrangements recommended above i must only wish that you will return as soon as your private affairs will admit for several of the general officers are desirous of making a visit to their respective homes before the campaign opens in the spring i am dear sir yours c george washington   february      morristown majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath morristown   february      dear sir this letter is in addition to my public one of this date it is to hint to you and i do it with concern that your conduct is censured and by men of sense and judgment who have been with you on the expedition to fort independence as being fraught with too much caution by which the army has been disappointed and in some degree disgraced your summons as you did not attempt to fulfil your threats was not only idle but farcical and will not fail of turning the laugh exceedingly upon us these things i mention to you as a friend for you will perceive that they have composed no part of my public letter why you should be so apprehensive of being surrounded even if lord percy had landed i cannot conceive you know that landing men and procuring     horses are not the work of an hour a day or even a week upon the whole it appears to me from information that if you had pushed vigorously upon your first going to fort independence the post would have been carried and query may it not yet be taken by surprise it is nothing for a party of light troops to march twelve or fourteen miles in the course of five or six hours an expedition therefore undertaken with precaution and conducted with secrecy in a dark night may be attended with fortunate consequences i drop this hint you may improve or reject it as circumstances will justify too large a body for such an enterprise might be unwieldy and expose the measure to discovery i am dear sir c  george washington   february      morristown to the president of congress morristown   february      sir i am honored with yours of the    january with sundry resolves of congress and a petition of monsr pellisiers inclosed i am not the proper person to refer the petition to as i am no judge of his merit as an engineer having never had an opportunity of     seeing any of his performances at any rate i do not see the necessity of appointing him or any other person principal engineer at ticonderoga for that would exclude any other tho of superior abilities from being sent there besides as a corps of engineers will in all probability be soon established monsr pellisiers rank can then be settled with more propriety i forgot to mention in any of my former letters that i had appointed capt nathaniel guest  of virginia to the command of a regiment to be raised upon the frontiers of virginia and carolina and i have directed him if possible to bring a company or two of cherokee indians if they can be procured they will answer two valuable purposes one as excellent scouts the other that they will be in fact hostages and will secure the good behavior of their nation major bland commandant of the virginia horse has desired to know whether there is not a necessity of giving a bounty and reinlisting his regiment as continental troops they were inlisted to serve in the colony and the men were with some difficulty prevailed upon to march hither but the major thinks they would be entirely reconciled upon receiving the bounty i received a letter from mr chase desiring i would appoint proper persons to make enquiry into and take depositions concerning the behavior of the british and foreign troops in jersey this would   0 be an endless task as their line of march is marked with devastation and is a thing of such public notoriety that it demands no further proof i remonstrated with genl howe upon the treatment of our wounded at princetown you will see by the enclosed letter from him that he disavows and detests the proceeding but i fear that too much encouragement is given to such barbarous behavior by the british officers for in a late skirmish in which sir william erskine commanded lieut kelly of the  th virginia regiment was slightly wounded in the thigh but before he could get off the field he was overtaken and murthered in a most cruel manner general stephen informed me that he would write to sir william and inform him that unless such practices were put a stop to our soldiers would not be restrained from making retaliation  by a letter from general heath of the  0th of last month i find that he had decamped from the neighborhood of kingsbridge and removed back towards the white plains his reasons for doing so were that the troops could not stand the inclemency of the weather and that he feared the troops expected from rhode island would land upon his back i have however directed him to have a body of light     troops under an active officer in order to harass their foraging parties and to cover our own who are to remove as much of the forage from westchester county as they can and after leaving as many men as will secure the passes in the highlands the remainder are to be sent over here to join me for i am apprehensive that the enemy are reinforcing themselves at brunswic i shall tomorrow send out parties from every quarter to remove all the wagons horses cattle and sheep or as many as possible from the neighborhood of the enemys lines they are to attend particularly to the horses for if we can reduce those that they at present have and can hinder them from getting fresh ones from the adjacent country it will be impossible for them to move their artillery and wagons forward should they incline to make another push towards philadelphia       nothing of consequence has happened since i wrote to you last except a skirmish on the  st of this month five or six miles from brunswic landing between our advanced parties about seven hundred in the whole and upwards of two thousand of the enemy under sir william erskine the heat of the engagement was between colo scott of the  th virginia regiment who with about one hundred men beat back two hundred of the british grenadiers several other officers behaved with great spirit but there is some reason to suspect that colo andrew ward who commanded our main body did not behave altogether as he ought     i have ordered a court upon him that the matter may be fairly canvassed and that he may stand condemned or acquitted by the evidence of those who were present colo buckner of the  th virginia regiment who was under arrest upon a charge of cowardice broke his parole and went over to bucks county i suppose with an intent to make his escape but i dispatched a troop of light horse after him who brought him back yesterday and he is to take his tryal on friday the smallpox has made such head in every quarter that i find it impossible to keep it from spreading through the whole army in the natural way i have therefore determined not only to inoculate all the troops now here that have not had it but shall order dr shippen to inoculate the recruits as fast as they come to philadelphia they will lose no time because they will go through the disorder while their clothing arms and accoutrements are getting ready from the first institution of civil government it has been the national policy of every precedent state to endeavor to engage its members to the discharge of their duty by the obligation of some oath its force and happy influence have been felt in too many instances to need any arguments to support the policy or prove its utility i have often thought the states have been too negligent in this particular and am more fully convinced of it from the effect general howes excursion has produced in new jersey an oath is the only substitute that can be adopted to supply the defect of principle by our inattention in this article we lose a considerable cement to our own force and     give the enemy an opportunity to make the first tender of the oath of allegiance to the king its baneful influence is but too severely felt at this time the people generally confess they were compelled to take protection and subscribe the declaration yet it furnishes many with arguments to refuse taking any active part and further they allege themselves bound to a neutrality at least many conscientious people who were wellwishers to the cause had they been bound to the states by an oath would have suffered any punishment rather than have taken the oath of allegiance to the king and are now lost to our interest for want of this necessary tie notwithstanding the obligations of the association they do not conceive it to have the same effect as an oath the more united the inhabitants appear the greater difficulty general howe will have in reconciling them to regal government and consequently the less hope of conquering them for these reasons and many more that might be urged i should strongly recommend to every state to fix upon some oath or affirmation of allegiance to be tendered to all the inhabitants without exception and to outlaw those that refuse it i have the honor to be c  george washington   february      morristown brigadiergeneral arnold to brigadiergeneral arnold morristown   february      dear sir i was this evening favored with your letter of the  0th ultimo and am sorry to find the forces now assembled in rhode island are not competent to the     projects you have in view  the propriety of the attack or of the plan i cannot determine the map you sent and for which i return you my thanks gives me an idea of the situation of the island but not so accurately as to pronounce upon the matter with precision if the attack can be made with a strong probability almost amounting to a certainty of success it is much to be desired otherwise i would not advise it for as a favorable issue would be productive of the most valuable and important consequences so on the other a miscarriage would lead to those of the most melancholy nature i have wrote general spencer on the subject wishing every     thing respecting the measure to be duly weighed previous to an attempt and consented that if after mature deliberation had of all circumstances the officers esteem the enterprise advisable that four or five continental regiments may be called in aid i suggested to him the difficulty of passing a river to attack an enemy and of making a good retreat in case of repulse this is obvious and i am satisfied will not escape your attention whatever may be determined on i trust will be founded in prudence and i hope crowned with success     george washington   february      morristown brigadiergeneral parsons to brigadiergeneral parsons  morristown   february      dear sir yesterday i received yours of the  d inst since general heath by his retreat to white plains has     given the enemy time to recover themselves i do not know at this time what can be better done in that quarter than adopting the plan you propose of crossing over to the east end of long island and destroying the forage i am so fully convinced of the good effects of this enterprise that i have ordered it to be done generally in the neighborhood of the enemy here in which success has attended us to our utmost wish you will endeavor at the same time to bring off all the drafthorses fit for service colonel henry livingston of the new york state was lately with me and has my orders to this purport with him you will please to concert a good plan from the enclosed proclamation you will be able to regulate your conduct with regard to the tories no form of an oath of allegiance is yet drawn up but you can easily strike off one that will answer the end designed they have permission to carry in with them their necessary wearing apparel but nothing that can possibly be useful to the enemy their estates must be secured till the civil power determine what shall be done i have written to the new england states on the subject of arming the troops they are to raise you will get their answer you will     please to publish the enclosed general order  i am c  george washington   february      morristown majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler morristown   february      dear sir i have now before me your several favors of the   th   0th ulto and of the  st instant for which i return you my thanks    i should hope that general carleton will not attempt to pass the lakes before we can get a sufficient force to oppose him the enterprise i think will be dangerous and attended with many difficulties however as the defence and security of our posts in that quarter is an object of the first importance i have written in the most urgent manner     to the states of massachusetts and new hampshire to forward on their regiments with all possible expedition desiring that they may not wait till they are complete but that suitable officers may be left to recruit for the deficiencies as to forming the northern army of a mixture of troops i think it cannot be done under the peculiar situation of our affairs the posts on the lakes are much more convenient to the eastern forces than to any other and they can be there sooner than to other places where the aid of the rest is indispensably necessary and loudly called for another objection to the measure is that prejudices and jealousies have prevailed where those of different states have acted together notwithstanding every possible exertion on my part to get them to harmonize consider themselves as the same people engaged in the same noble struggle and having one common and general interest to defend to bury and lay aside all attachments and distinctions of a local and provincial nature these i think are not likely to be entirely done away especially if general officers should be appointed by congress from each state for their respective troops indeed as their difficulties have not been reconcilable heretofore i hope their acting separately will produce a laudable spirit of emulation to excel and raise the reputation of their respective states tending in the end to advance the interest and weal of the whole i have wrote to brigr genl knox upon the subject of an artillerist and to send you an officer that he esteems good i could not order up major lamb or any particular officer lest i should break in upon the     general arrangement which comes more immediately under his direction i am c george washington  0 february      morris town governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters morris town  0 february      sir the impossibility of keeping the smallpox from spreading through the army in the natural way has determined us upon the most mature deliberation to inoculate all the new troops that have not had this disorder i have wrote to general parsons to fix upon some proper place and to superintend the inoculation of the troops of your state taking it for granted that you would have no objection to so salutary a measure upon which depends not only the lives of all the men who have not had the smallpox but also the health of the whole army which would otherwise soon become a hospital of the most loathsome kind proper steps are taking to inoculate the troops already here and all the southern levies will undergo the operation as they pass philadelphia i have wrote to the states of new york and rhode island to have their troops also inoculated and i hope our army will by these precautions be entirely free of that terrible disorder the ensuing campaign as the troops from massachusetts and new hampshire are ordered immediately up to ticonderoga they can as was the case last year be inoculated there i am c    0 george washington    february      morristown brigadiergeneral knox to brigadiergeneral knox morristown    february      dear sir i have yours of the  st instant enclosing a copy of a memorial which you had presented to the council and house of representatives of the state of massachusetts  i most sincerely wish that your representation may be attended with the success it deserves and that i could with propriety press the subject of it upon them in the manner you desire to advise them to give the bounty of twenty     pounds to the additional battalions as well as to their quota of the eightyeight would be giving my sanction to and approbation of a measure which i have ever reprobated as an indirect breach of the union and of the agreement entered into by their delegates in congress to give a continental bounty of twenty dollars per man and no more but thus much i have done i have wrote to the council and assembly and have given it as my opinion that they ought to furnish the three additional regiments of infantry and one of artillery because when the congress     voted an addition of sixteen battalions of foot four battalions of artillery and three thousand lighthorse and gave the appointment of them to me they certainly expected though it was not expressed that i should observe some rule of proportion in allotting them to the different states and a better i thought i could not follow than the proportion settled by congress themselves in fixing the quotas of the eightyeight battalions upon this scale three battalions of infantry and one of artillery was but a moderate demand upon the state of massachusetts for there has been raised and are now raising in the other colonies exclusive of the eightyeight battalions the german battalion a battalion of riflemen lately under the command of colonel stephenson and the regiment called hazens or the congresss own which is to consist when compleat of two thousand men each state is bound by every principle of justice and equity to furnish their proportion of the additional battalions as much as they are of the eightyeight and i dare to say if i had not distributed the commissions among the officers of the different states those who had been neglected would have charged me with partiality if the state of massachusetts will not consent to give their assistance towards raising the three additional regiments of infantry i have urged to them the necessity of raising the battalion of artillery at least in that state because most of the artillerymen who served in your regiment last campaign came from thence and will be immediately useful        congress had resolved to adhere to carlisle in pennsylvania and brookfield in massachusetts for the places of erecting the laboratories c i do not think the odds between carlisle and york anywise material and therefore the works will be built at the former but upon your representation of the delay that will be occasioned if brookfield is preferred to springfield i desire you may proceed with the works at the latter and i will inform congress of the necessity of this variation from their resolve    i am dear sir yours c  george washington    february      morristown brigadiergeneral maxwell to brigadiergeneral maxwell  morristown    february      sir in answer to your letter of the  th instant respecting the case of the young men of eliza town who     refuse to take the oath of allegiance to the states or to withdraw within the enemys lines and discourage all the militia about them i would observe that though it is my desire to have the terms and conditions of my proclamation religiously complied with yet i do not intend that it shall be made a shelter for our enemies to injure us under with impunity these fellows at elizabethtown as well as all others who wish to remain with us till the expiration of the thirty days for no other purpose than to convey intelligence to the enemy and poison our peoples minds must and shall be compelled to withdraw immediately within the enemys lines others who are hesitating which side to take and behave friendly to us till they determine must be treated with lenity such as go over to the enemy are not to take with them any thing but their clothing and furniture     their horses cattle and forage must be left behind such as incline to share our fate are to have every assistance afforded them that can be granted with safety neither wagons nor horses must be too much hazarded in doing this business maj morris will secure fosters cattle and sheep bring off all the corn hay and oats he speaks of for the quarter master who will take an account of it and settle with the owners if friendly the effects of all persons in arms against us must be seized and secured i wish this line of conduct to be observed by our parties for which purpose you will make them all acquainted with my determination on this head the returns of your brigade alarm me i fear there is some mistake for which purpose i have directed col bedford the muster master general to repair thither and examine into the matter you will be so good as to assist him in discovering the true cause why so many are kept in pay and so few perform service i am c      george washington    february      morristown to the president of congress morristown    february      sir since i had the honor of addressing you on the  th instt no event of an important and interesting nature has occurred unless the successes of our parties in foraging and bringing off several horses waggons and some fat cattle and sheep which were contiguous to and around the enemys lines are considered as such i then mentioned that i had such a scheme in contemplation which was happily accomplished the next day without any loss the enemy in turn have made frequent efforts in that way but with little success whenever they made the attempt it never failed to produce a skirmish they have been common of late but with little damage to either side we have certain intelligence that they have drawn the greatest part of their troops from r island and are told that part of them have landed on staten island and at amboy with a view of augmenting their force at brunswic colo buckner agreable to the information contained in my last has been tried by a court martial and cashiered the proceedings and sentence i directed to be transmitted to the secretary of the war office and to the printer of this state and virginia to be published general lincoln is just arrived with a regiment of massachusetts militia about two hundred and fifty     this he says is succeeded by three more which will make in the whole near eighteen hundred but in this i think he must be mistaken unless those on the march are much fuller and larger than what they usually are the whole are of the troops that were with general heath general knox by a letter of the  st instant informs me that on mature inquiry and examination he finds springfield to be more convenient and much better calculated for a laboratory and cannonfoundery than any other part of the new england states he adds that a quantity of copper tin and other useful materials can be had there and that the necessary works and preparations from these and other advantages can be accomplished at least three or four months sooner there than any where else in consequence of his opinion which i esteem of weight particularly in this instance and knowing the importance of these establishments and how essential they are i have ventured to order the works to be begun there without regard to what had been done at brookfield which was of but little consequence the former besides the many advantages mentioned by general knox stands on connecticut river and has a good navigation yet is entirely secure against any attempts of the enemy being twenty miles above hartford where the river is narrow and too shoal to admit vessels that can give the least annoyance as nothing but the good of the service could have led to this measure i trust it will be approved i have wrote the assembly of massachusetts state and the convention of new hampshire requesting     their good offices and exertions to promote the raising of their regiments as expeditiously as possible and to forward the whole of the quotas first exacted from them to ticonderoga their contiguity to that post more than to any other the importance of it and general schuylers apprehensions that the enemy may attempt to pass the lake if not on the ice as soon as it is open added to the great trouble expense and loss of time it will save in marching them elsewhere and others there who are much more distant and remote induced me to determine so i find the council of the former on general schuylers earnest application before my letter reached them had determined to send four regiments as soon as they could be completed i only wish the whole may be made up in a short time and that their arrival may be early enough to prevent those inconveniences and fatal consequences which the want of a sufficient force in that quarter would subject us to were the enemy to pass the lake at this time mr james mease is now here in consequence of being appointed clothiergeneral he is adjusting a plan for answering the end of his appointment and making an estimate to be laid before congress or their secret committee of such clothes as may be necessary to import for the army it is with much concern that the situation of our affairs obliges me to mention so frequently the want of money especially when i am persuaded every means are used to furnish it our distress on this account is great indeed and the injury the service receives almost inconceivable not     a day an hour or scarcely a minute passes without complaints and applications on this head the recruiting of the regiments is most materially retarded by it ten o clock p m just now a flag returned that went to brunswic today who brought the enclosed letters from general lee which i do myself the honor to transmit you with a copy of one to myself  i have the honor to be c   0 george washington  0 february      morristown to the president of congress morristown  0 february      sir the principal design of this is to inform you that we have strong reasons to believe that the enemy are on the point of making some push what their object is whether to beat up our quarters and to extend     their own to make a large forage and collection of provender of what they are in great want or to turn their views towards the delaware is a matter of uncertainty but it seems probable that one of these things they have in contemplation such of their troops as have returned from rhode island have     landed at amboy and with them several pieces of heavy artillery general howe is come over too and it is said lord percy their number at brunswic and the landingplace before the arrival of this last reinforcement was estimated from seven to eight thousand i have ordered the utmost vigilance and attention to be observed at our several posts to guard against surprises and every preparation to be made that the weak and feeble state of our little army will admit of at this time we are only about four thousand strong a force you will suppose unequal to a successful opposition if they were not militia and far too small for the exigencies of our affairs it is impossible to obtain exact returns though they are daily called for owing to the frequent and almost constant departure of some of the corps  colonel john nielson of brunswic with a detachment of militia on the morning of the   th surprised major richard v stockton on lawrences island whom he took with fiftynine privates of general skinners corps killing four and bringing away the arms of the whole with some blankets  this about balances the loss of a militia guard which a party of british troops took last week in monmouth     near the hook i wish to be informed how the regiments that are raising are to be armed and of the provision that has been made for the same i have reason to fear indeed i am convinced that there is a great deficiency in many if not in the whole of the states in this article every letter that i receive from them mentions their want and calls for supplies  i have the honor to be c  george washington february  0      morris town governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters morris town february  0      sir a letter from you to general heath inclosing a petition from the officers taken at princetown for liberty to send one of the party into new york for their baggage was transmitted to me by general mcdougall general heath having gone to massachusetts     i am so sensible that these people by remaining any length of time in the country not only acquire a knowledge of our affairs but spread a very pernicious influence among the people that i think it will be best to send them immediately in and obtain an equal number of our officers in exchange i therefore desire that they may be sent towards providence with orders to halt within eight or ten miles till general spencer or general arnold is informed of their being there that they may direct in what manner they may be sent in so as not to see any thing of the disposition of our troops be pleased to make the eldest officer sign a return specifying their names and rank and transmit it to me in a letter of the  th february you desire to know what will be the best manner of disposing of the privates i think they had better be cantoned in the country as near together as convenient and if any of them are tradesmen and are willing to work at their occupations they may be usefully employed i have the honor to be sir c p s if you can think of any more convenient way of sending in the prisoners than to providence i leave it to you george washington  0 february      morristown to the president of congress morristown  0 february      sir monsieur faneuil who some time ago laid a plan before you for raising and officering a corps of frenchmen waited upon me yesterday his success     as i expected has been small in enlisting or rather engaging canadians i cannot find that he has met with more than thirty or forty who would be willing to serve with him he is now upon another scheme that of raising arming and clothing a number of men in the french islands to grant a commission of that kind is without the extent of my powers and i have therefore desired him to go forward and lay his proposals before congress if they appear feasible they may be adopted but i would beg leave to observe that one precaution will be necessary that is that the commissions of monsieur faneuil and his officers should depend upon the performance of their agreement for raising any certain number of men i have often mentioned to you the distress i am every now and then laid under by the application of french officers for commissions in our service this evil if i may call it so is a growing one for from what i learn they are coming in swarms from old france and the islands there will therefore be a necessity of providing for them or discountenancing them to do the first is difficult and the last disagreeable and perhaps impolitic if they are men of merit and it is impossible to distinguish these from mere adventurers of whom i am convinced there is the greater number they seldom bring more than a commission and passport which we know may belong to a bad as well as a good officer their ignorance of our language and their inability to recruit men are insurmountable obstacles to their being ingrafted     into our continental battalions for our officers who have raised their men and have served through the war upon pay that has hitherto not borne their expenses would be disgusted if foreigners were put over their heads and i assure you few or none of these gentlemen look lower than fieldofficers commissions to give them all brevets by which they have rank and draw pay without doing any service is saddling the continent with a vast expense and to form them into corps would be only establishing a corps of officers for as i stated before they cannot possibly raise any men some general mode of disposing of them must be adopted for it is ungenerous to keep them in suspense and at great charge to themselves but i am at a loss how to point out this mode suppose they were told in general that no man could obtain a commission except he could raise a number of men in proportion to his rank this would effectually stop the mouths of common appliers and leave us at liberty to make provisions for gentlemen of undoubted military character and merit who would be very useful to us as soon as they acquired our language if you approve of this or can think of any better method be pleased to inform me as soon as you possibly can for if i had a decisive answer to give them it would not only save me much trouble but much time which i am now obliged to bestow in hearing their different pretentions to merit and their expectations thereupon i inclose you the papers which monsieur faneuil originally laid before the council of massachusetts     they may be of use if you enter into negotiation with him  i have the honor to be c  george washington    february      morristown joseph reed to joseph reed morristown    february      dear sir your letters of the   th and   th inst are both to hand the last in date arrived first—the first this morning only     i am sorry upon the footing you have put it and under the apprehensions you seem to be that i did not accept your commission as adjt genl when you offered it tho your fears cannot be realized because at that time it was mentioned in genl orders that you having resigned colo weedon was appointed pro tem your having the comn in possession therefore can be no argument against your resignation—but i am to accept it at any time i am sorry the cartel settlmt by genl conway with the french cant be found—i have lately wrote to genl gates for it who i think told me he had it i would by no means wish you to come up merely on that acct especially as i have not as yet got any answer from congress relative to my recommendation of you to the command of the horse if they should listen to my wishes in this appointment—if a separate quarter master is necessary for the horse and colo coxe inclines to accept it i can have no possible objection to it but how far the rank of colo can be annexed to the office i cannot undertake to say i would wish to think of it a little i believe all the prisoners from the eastern states are now gone in—that they did not do it long ago is not my fault—this i thought colo miles had been satisfied of when he was out—and what method i could devise to furnish their pay except in a currency that would not pass i am sure i know not—all the hard money that could be had he must know was sent in— i am not a little surprised at what you mention     concerning colo griffin before christmas i offered him a regiment and the nomination of his own officers—this he refused—since that he has been offered the lieutenant colonelcy of a regiment of horse and this he has refused if his expectations are higher than that of a regiment which he was offered even before i was vested with full powers to do it the congress are alone competent to the gratification of them as i have no authority to go beyond what i have already offered him if you should have the command of the horse it will be quite agreeable to me that you should have one of those that was bought at boston—if you have not as they were got for that particular service by express order of congress and i have already refused genl green i could not with propriety consent to it as i mean after choosing a couple or three for my own use to throw the rest into some of the troop or let them go among the officers i wish your leisure would permit you to digest a proper plan for the prevention of desertion and apprehension of deserters that would have a general operation throughout all the united states i have in general terms recommended to congress and to all the states individually the absolute necessity of adopting some efficacious mode to accomplish the latter but each will unless some method can be adopted by or recommended from congress or the commander of the army have some newfangled or inadequate schemes of their own—in like manner if you can give any assistance to genl mifflin in an   0 arrangement of waggons i shall be glad of it one snickers a gentleman on or near shanandoah in fredk county virginia has offered to buy a number he is a person well acquainted in this business and may be depended on i think the congress ought not under the present appearance of things by any means to return to philadelphia i think we are now in one of the most critical periods which america ever saw and because the enemy are not in actual motion by the by i believe they are not far from it every body seems to be lulled into ease and security—  would colo coxe accept the appointment of commissary of prisoners—if he will i wish to god he would repair hither immediately—i want a shrewd sensible man exceedingly for this business—and obtaining intelligence which offices are very correspondent—let me hear from you on this point as quick as possible—the pay may i presume be equal to that of colonel i am dr sir c     george washington    february      morristown john augustine washington to john augustine washington morristown    february      dear brother your letter of the   th ulto from mount vernon came duly to hand and i thank you for the visit to mrs washington i do not recollect the date of my last to you but nothing of any great importance has occurd of late—i believe there soon will as genl howe has withdrawn great part of the troops from rhode island in order to strengthen those of this state for i should think considering the situation of our army some offensive operation—if he does not there can be no impropriety i conceive in pronouncing him a man of no enterprize as circumstances never will i hope favor him so much as at present—but—as this is too delicate a subject for a letter liable to miscarriage i will hold my tongue—whether his designs are against the militia i at present command—another attempt against philadelphia—or     which i cannot believe to make his own defences more secure time only can tell—and a little of it i believe will do it our scouts and the enemys foraging parties have frequent skirmishes in which they always sustain the greatest loss in killed and wounded owing to our superior skill in fire arms—these and frequent desertions tho not of any great magnitude serves to waste their army but this is counterbalancd by a set of parracides who have engaged in their service and inlist all our countrymen they can seduce your remark that you cannot depend upon the reports of our strength is most litterally true— it is morally impossible that any body at a distance should know it with precision and certainty because while it depends upon militia who are here today and gone tomorrow—whose way like the ways of providence are almost inscrutable—and when it is our interest however much our characters may suffer by it to make small numbers appear large it is impossible you should for in order to deceive the enemy effectually we must not communicate our weakness to any body it becomes every friend in every state to hasten the recruiting service it behooves them to forward the levies on by companies or otherwise as soon as possible and believe me it behooves every friend to the american cause to exert his utmost endeavors to apprehend deserters—desertion is a growing evil—it is become a kind of business under the present bounty—to desert one corps to enlist     in another—in a word if vigorous measures to apprehend and rigorous in punishing are not pursued the cause will be exceedingly injured if we can once get the new army compleat and the congress will take care to have it properly supplied i think we may thereafter bid defiance to great britain and her foreign auxiliaries my warmest affections i make a tender of to my sister and the family—my compliments present to all enquiring friends—and with strongest assurances of unalterable love to yourself i remain yr affecte brother p s yesterday a skirmish happend between a foraging party of the enemy and a party collected from our out posts in wch it is said from what accts we have been yet able to get that the enemy in killed and wounded must have lost upwards of an hundred men—seven prisoners were taken and brought in—our loss was three killed—eight wounded george washington    february      morristown patrick henry to patrick henry governor of virginia morristown    february      dear sir mr walker has i doubt not informed you of the situation in which i have placed him in order that he may obtain the best information and at the same time have his real design hid from the world thereby avoiding the evils which might otherwise result from such appointments if adopted by other states it will naturally occur to you sir that there are some     secrets on the keeping of which depends oftentimes the salvation of an army secrets which cannot or at least ought not to be intrusted to paper nay which none but the commanderinchief at the time should be acquainted with if mr walkers commission therefore from the commonwealth of virginia should be known it would i am persuaded be followed by others of the like nature from other states which would be no better than so many marplots to avoid the precedent therefore and from your character of mr walker and the high opinion i myself entertain of his abilities honor and prudence i have taken him into my family as an extra aiddecamp and shall be happy if in this character he can answer your expectations i sincerely thank you sir for your kind congratulations on the late success of the continental arms would to god it may continue and for your polite mention of me let me earnestly entreat that the troops raised in virginia for this army be forwared on by companies or otherwise without delay and as well equipped as possible for the field or we shall be in no condition to open the campaign with every sentiment of respect and regard i am dear sir c george washington    february      morristown to the council of massachusetts bay morristown    february      gentlemen i yesterday received a letter from lieutenantcolonel campbell of the   st regiment dated in concord gaol on the  th of this month  the colonel in this     letter gives me an account of such severity of his confinement as is scarcely ever inflicted upon the most atrocious criminals the following extract from his letter shows the reasons that were given to him upon his being confined—the first of this month i was carried and lodged in the common gaol of concord by an order of congress through the council of boston intimating for a reason that a refusal of general howe to give up general lee for six fieldofficers of whom i was one and the placing of that gentleman under the charge of the provost of new york were the motives of their particular ill treatment to me he then proceeds to give a description of the place in which he is confined which if true is shocking to humanity and not to be justified upon the most strict interpretation of the resolve of congress which is as follows should the proffered exchange of general lee for six hessian fieldofficers not be accepted and the treatment of him as above mentioned be continued then the principles of retaliation shall occasion five of the said hessian fieldofficers together with lieutenantcolonel archibald campbell or any other officers that are or may be in our possession equivalent in number or quality to be detained in order that the same treatment which general lee shall receive may be exactly inflicted upon their persons  by this you will observe that exactly the same treatment is to be shown to colonel campbell and the hessian officers that     general howe shows to general lee and as he is only confined to a commodious house with genteel accommodations we have no right or reason to be more severe upon colonel campbell who i would wish should immediately upon the receipt of this be removed from his present situation and put into a house where he may live comfortably colonel campbell mentions the case of captain john walker of colonel gorhams corps who he says is confined in the same gaol and in the apartment with the common men i know not what crime is alleged against captain walker but i will only observe that unless there is a very good foundation such treatment is impolitic for the enemy have three hundred of our officers whom we have little chance of exchanging and upon whom they may retaliate before i had closed my letter i was honored with your favors of the   th and   th instant nothing distresses me more than the universal call that is upon me from all quarters for firearms which i am totally unable to supply the scandalous loss waste and private appropriation of public arms during the last campaign are beyond all conception every state must exert itself and call upon its colonels to produce receipts or to account for its arms that were delivered out to them last year i beg you will not only do this but purchase all fit for the field that that can be procured from private persons of which there must be a vast number in the government i am c     p s i omitted to mention above that the commissions of all the officers upon the new establishment are to bear date upon the  st of january      and the precedency to be settled by a board of officers  i desire for particular reasons that the contents of the above letter may not be suffered to go beyond the council for the present colonel campbells confinement may be enlarged without assigning the reasons publicly  george washington   march      morristown to the president of congress morristown   march      sir i was this evening honored with your favor of the   d ultimo accompanied by sundry proceedings of congress those respecting general lee which prescribe the treatment of lieutenantcolonel campbell and the five hessian fieldofficers are the cause     of this letter  though i sincerely commiserate the misfortunes of general lee and feel much for his present unhappy situation yet with all possible deference to the opinion of congress i fear that these resolutions would not have the desired effect are formed in impolicy and will if adhered to produce consequences of an extensive and melancholy nature retaliation is certainly just and sometimes necessary even where attended with the severest penalties but when the evils which may and must result from it exceed those intended to be redressed prudence and policy require that it should be avoided having premised thus much i beg leave to examine the justice and expediency of it in the instances now before us from the best information i have been able to obtain general lees usage has not been so disgraceful and dishonorable as to authorize the treatment decreed to those gentlemen were it not prohibited by many other important considerations his confinement i believe has been more rigorous than has been generally experienced by the rest of our officers     or those of the enemy who have been in our possession but if the reports be true received on that head he has been provided with a decent apartment and with most things necessary to render him comfortable this is not the case with one of the officers comprehended in the resolves if his letter of which a copy is transmitted deserves your credit here retaliation seems to have been prematurely begun or to speak with more propriety severities have been and are exercised towards colonel campbell not justified by any that general lee has yet received in point of policy under the present situation of our affairs this doctrine cannot be supported the balance of prisoners is greatly against us and a general regard to the happiness of the whole should mark our conduct can we imagine that our enemies will not mete the same punishments the same indignities the same cruelties to those belonging to us in their possession that we impose on theirs in our power why should we suppose them to possess more humanity than we have ourselves or why should an ineffectual attempt to relieve the distresses of one brave unfortunate man involve many more in the same calamities however disagreeable the fact may be the enemy may at this time have in their power and subject to their call near three hundred officers belonging to the army of the united states in this number there are some of high rank the most of them are men of bravery and of merit the quota of theirs in our hands bears no proportion being not more than fifty at most under these circumstances   0 we should certainly do no act to draw upon the gentlemen belonging to us and who have already suffered a long captivity greater punishments than they have experienced and now experience if we should what will their feelings be and those of their numerous and extensive connexions suppose the treatment prescribed for the hessians should be pursued will it not establish what the enemy have been aiming to effect by every artifice and the grossest misrepresentations i mean an opinion of our enmity towards them and of the cruel conduct they experience when they fall into our hands a prejudice which we on our part have heretofore thought it politic to suppress and to root out by every act of lenity and kindness it certainly will the hessians would hear of the punishment with all the circumstances of heightened exaggeration would feel the injury without investigating the cause or reasoning upon the justice or necessity of it the mischiefs which may and must inevitably flow from the execution of ourselves appear to be endless and innumerable on my own part i have been much embarrassed on the subject of exchanges already applications are daily made by both friends and enemies to complete them as far as circumstances of number and rank will apply some of the former have complained that a discrimination is about to be adopted perhaps injurious to their reputation and certainly depriving them of their right of exchange in due course as established upon the principles of equality proposed last year acceded to by both parties and     now subsisting the latter charge me with a breach of faith and call on me to perform the agreement many more objections might be subjoined were they material i shall only observe that the present state of our army if it deserves that name will not authorize the language of retaliation or the style of menace this will be conceded by all who know that the whole of our force is weak and trifling and composed of militia very few regular troops excepted whose service is on the eve of expiring there are several other matters which might be mentioned upon this subject would time and opportunity permit but as they will not i beg leave to refer you to colonel walker who will deliver this and give satisfaction to any inquiries that may be deemed necessary persuading myself that congress will indulge the liberty i have taken upon this occasion i have only to wish for the result of their deliberations after they have reconsidered the resolves and to assure them that i have the honor to be c      george washington   march      morristown robert morris to robert morris morristown   march      dear sir your favour of the   th ultimo came to my hands last night the freedom with which you have communicated your sentiments on several matters therein contained is highly pleasing to me for be assured sir that nothing would add more to my satisfaction than an unreserved correspondence with a gentleman of whose abilities and attachment to the cause we are contending for i entertain so high an opinion as     i do of yours letters however being liable to various accidents make a communication of thoughts that way rather unsafe but as this will be conveyed by a gentleman on whom i can depend i shall not scruple to disclose my mind and situation more freely than i otherwise should do      the reasons my good sir which you assign for thinking general howe cannot move forward with his army are good but not conclusive it is a descriptive evidence of the difficulties he has to contend with but no proof that they cannot be surmounted it is a view of one side of the picture against which let me enumerate the advantages on the other and then determine how we would act in his situation general howe cannot by the best intelligence i have been able to get have less than ten thousand men in the jerseys and on board of transports at amboy ours does not exceed four thousand his are well disciplined well officered and well appointed ours raw militia badly officered and under no government his numbers cannot in any short time be augmented ours must be very considerably and by such troops as we can have some reliance on or the game is at an end his situation with respect to horses and forage is bad very bad i believe but will it be better no on the contrary worse and therefore an inducement if no other to shift quarters general howes informants are too numerous and too well acquainted with all these circumstances to suffer him to remain in ignorance of them with what propriety then can he miss so favorable an opportunity of striking a capital stroke against a city from whence we derive so many advantages the carrying of which would give such eclat to his arms and strike such a damp upon ours nor is his difficulty of moving so great as is imagined all the heavy baggage of the army their salt provisions and flour their stores c     might go round by water whilst their superior numbers would enable them to make a sweep of the horses for many miles around about them not already taken off by us in addition to all this his coming himself to brunswic his bringing troops which cannot be quartered and keeping them on shipboard at amboy with some other corroborating circumstances did induce a firm belief in me that he would move and towards philadelphia i candidly own that i expected it would happen before the expiration of my proclamation the longer it is delayed the better for us and happy shall i be if i am deceived my opinions upon these several matters are only known to those who have a right to be informed as much as possible i have endeavored to conceal them from every one else and that no hasty removal of the public stores should take place thereby communicating an alarm it was that i early recommended this measure and have since been urging it well knowing that a measure of this kind set hastily about when the enemy were advancing would give unfavorable impressions and be attended with bad consequences to deceive congress or you through whose hands my letters to them are to pass with false appearances and assurances would in my judgment be criminal and make me responsible for the consequences i endeavor in all these letters to state matters as they appear to my judgment without adding to or diminishing aught from the picture from others my sentiments are pretty much hid     i wish with all my heart that congress had gratified general lee in his request if not too late i wish they would do it still i can see no possible evil that can result from it some good i think might the request to see a gentleman or two came from the general not from the commissioners there could have been no harm therefore in hearing what he had to say on any subject especially as he had declared that his own personal interest was deeply concerned the resolve to put in close confinement lieutenantcolonel campbell and the hessian fieldofficers in order to retaliate general lees punishment upon them is in my opinion injurious in every point of view and must have been entered into without due attention to the consequences does congress know how much the balance of prisoners is against us that the enemy have at least three hundred officers of ours in their possession and we not fifty of theirs that generals thompson and waterbury are subject to be recalled at any time do they imagine that these officers will not share the fate of campbell c or possibly by receiving very different treatment mixed with artful insinuations have their resentments roused to acts highly injurious to our cause it is much easier to raise a ferment of this kind than to allay it do they know that every artifice is now practising to prepossess the hessians with an idea of our maltreatment of their countrymen in our possession that we are treating them as slaves nay that we mean to sell them and will not the close confinement of their first officers be adduced as     strong evidence of this congress therefore should be cautious how they adopt measures which cannot be carried into execution without involving a train of evils that may be fatal in their consequences in a word common prudence dictates the necessity of duly attending to the circumstances of both armies before the style of conquerors is assumed by either and sorry i am to add that this does not appear to be the case with us nor is it in my power to make congress fully sensible of the real situation of our affairs and that it is with difficulty if i may use the expression that i can by every means in my power keep the life and soul of this army together in a word when they are at a distance they think it is but to say presto begone and every thing is done they seem not to have any conception of the difficulty and perplexity attending those who are to execute indeed sir your observations on the want of many capital characters in the senate are but too just however our cause is good and i hope providence will support it if the resolve of congress respecting general lee strikes you in the same point of view it has done me i could wish you would signify as much to that body as i really think they are fraught with every evil we know that the meeting of a committee of congress and lord howe stopped the mouths of many disaffected people i believe the meeting solicited by general lee would have the same effect  but     the other matter relative to the confinement of the officers is what i am particularly anxious about as i think it will involve much more than congress has an idea of and that they surely will repent adhering to their unalterable resolution i have wrote you a much longer letter than i expected to have done when i sat down and yet if time would permit i could enlarge greatly on the subject of it but at present shall beg pardon for taking up so much of your time and only assure you that i am most sincerely dear sir c george washington   march      morris town governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters morris town   march      sir       it gives me pleasure to hear that your state has come to the resolution of granting the colonial bounty to colonel webbs additional regiment and if the other states will do the same it will in a great measure obviate the objection which i made to their granting a higher bounty than was allowed by the resolves of congress the reasons which you gave     for a deviation from the resolve carry weight with them but i assure you you are mistaken when you think that the necessaries of life are cheaper to the southward than the northward it is true that less clothing is sufficient for them but as they manufacture little among themselves they are obliged to pay most extravagantly for what they wear i have ordered the clothier general to supply each state with their proportion of what clothing of different kinds are in the public stores but you must be sensible that a very full proportion of the clothing purchased for the use of the continent out of the prize vessels must be brought on for the use of the southern continental troops as the country from whence they come furnishes scarce any woollen goods to prevent confusion and disappointment in future i beg that no clothing may be stopped upon the way without a particular order from the clothiergeneral or myself    inoculation at philadelphia and in this neighborhood has been attended with amazing success and i have not the least doubt but your troops will meet the same as i have in many of my late letters mentioned the distress that the continent in general is under for the want of arms i need only repeat to you the necessity that there is for making a strict collection of the public arms and purchasing such as can be obtained from private persons some time ago general schuyler wrote to me and informed me that there were a great number of arms   0 at albany wanting repair i directed that they should be sent down to the most convenient place for that purpose but perhaps that may not yet be done you will therefore please to make inquiry into the matter and if they remain there have them repaired and put into the hands of the troops all the arms fit for the field have been constantly repaired as fast as it could be done what i call useless are such as are so light and thin in the barrel that they would not bear a charge with safety at the best much less after being eat up with rust       george washington   march      morristown andrew lewis to brigadiergeneral andrew lewis morristown   march      dear sir i was much disappointed at not perceiving your name in the list of majorgenerals lately made by congress and most sincerely wish that the neglect may not induce you to abandon the service  let me     beseech you to reflect that the period is now arrived when our most vigorous exertions are wanted when it is highly and indispensably necessary for gentlemen of abilities in any line but more especially in the military not to withhold themselves from public employment or suffer any small punctilios to persuade them to retire from their countrys service the cause requires your aid no one more sincerely wishes it than i do a candid reflection on the rank     you held in the last war added to a decent respect for the congresss resolve not to be confined in making or promoting general officers to any regular line to the propriety of which all america submitted may remove any uneasiness arising in your mind on the score of neglect upon my honor i think it ought a steady perseverance in promoting the public good and regular discharge of the duties of your office which in my opinion you can eminently perform must and will in the course of the approaching campaign secure to you the unfeigned thanks of all good men and obtain from congress that rank which perhaps you may think is now your undoubted right the present exigency requiring all the continental troops at and near this place and consequently a number of general officers to command them you will please to repair hither so soon as you can possibly make it convenient i acknowledge the receipt of several favors from you the last campaign the multiplicity of business engaging my whole attention as it prevented my answering them must plead my excuse in hopes of seeing you soon i am dear sir c      george washington  th day of march      morristown robert h harrison to lieutenantcolonel robert h harrison instructions differences in opinion having arisen between general howe and myself respecting the construction of a proposition made the  0th of july and acceded to the  st of august last for the exchange of prisoners whereby it was stipulated that officers should be given for officers of equal rank soldier for soldier and citizen for citizen—for the accommodation of these differences and to remove every just cause of complaint on the part of the enemy if such there be you are to meet any officer not of inferior rank to yourself who shall come properly authorized to treat upon the subject and to adopt such measures as you shall deem adequate to that end experience having also shown that the agreement above recited is not sufficiently definite to answer all the salutary purposes intended by it nor sufficiently comprehensive to include the various cases incident to the state of prisoners you are hereby vested with full power and authority to devise and conclude upon such improvements in aid of the same as shall appear necessary for establishing a more regular and explicit mode of exchange as well with respect to the prisoners who have been as those who shall be hereafter taken making mutual provision for such an allowance to pay all necessaries as their comfort and welfare during their captivity may require and finally to treat determine and agree upon all matters whatsoever relative to prisoners of war     on the principles of justice and humanity and conformable to the most civilized customs and usages for the greater ease convenience and security of all captives belonging to the armies under our respective commands for all which this shall be your sufficient warrant and your engagements being mutually interchanged shall be ratified and confirmed by me given under my hand and seal at headquarters in morristown this  th day of march      george washington   march      morristown to the president of congress morristown   march      sir i do myself the honor to transmit to you the enclosed copy of a letter from general lee received by a flag on tuesday last you will perceive from thence his wishes and expectations of seeing some members of congress in consequence of his letter upon that subject none of the passports which he mentions were sent out though the letter came by general howes permission as the others did i should be happy to relieve his anxiety as far as i can by sending in major morris but this i cannot do till a safeconduct is granted  the more i consider the resolves respecting lieutenantcolonel campbell and the hessian officers the more convinced i am of their impolicy the proposition made by congress for the exchange of prisoners and which by their direction was transmitted to general howe was founded on principles     of equality in number and in rank from hence no demand as a matter of right can be made of general lees releasement for any officer or number of officers of inferior rank whatever is or might be done in such instances would be of favor and indulgence the only cartel that now subsists is the one i have mentioned this so far as it goes is a beneficial one it recognizes the rank of our officers and insures their discharge from captivity whenever we are possessed of a like number belonging to them and of the same rank if on our part it should be violated if it is not observed surely it will and must cease to be obligatory on general howe what consequences may then ensue i leave to your conjecture if it be objected that the above observations and what i said in my former letter prove that no treatment received by our officers should be retaliated on theirs my answer is that the proportion of officers in their hands is at least six to one in ours this consideration supposing we had a right to demand general lees liberty would be of great weight and sufficient to prevent in my opinion the execution of the resolves i have the honor to be in haste your most obedient servant  george washington   march      morristown governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters morristown   march      sir i flattered myself that i should never again be under the necessity of trespassing upon the public spirit of your state by calling upon her for another     supply of militia but such has been the unaccountable delay in the recruiting of the continental battalions chiefly owing to the long time which unhappily elapsed before the officers were appointed that i see no prospect of keeping the field till the new levies can be brought into it but by a reinforcement of militia for want of proper laws in the southern governments their militia never were well regulated and since the late troubles in which the old governments have been unhinged and new ones not yet firmly established the people have adopted a mode of thinking and acting for themselves it is owing to this that when a summons is issued for militia those only turn out that please and they for what time they please by which means they sometimes set off for their homes in a few days after they join the army from this state of facts you will perceive that i put no great dependence on the militia from the southward and i must therefore once more entreat you to endeavor to prevail upon two thousand of the militia of your state to march immediately to peekskill and there wait for further orders their time of service to continue at least six weeks after they arrive there i am persuaded from the readiness with which you have ever complied with all my demands that you will exert yourself in forwarding the aforementioned number of men upon my bare request but i hope you will be convinced of the necessity of the demand when i tell you in confidence that after the   th of this month when the time of general lincolns militia expires i shall be left with the remains of five     virginia regiments not amounting to more than as many hundred men and parts of two or three other continental battalions all very weak the remainder of the army will be composed of small parties of militia from this state and pennsylvania on which little dependence can be put as they come and go when they please  i have issued peremptory orders to every colonel in the regular service to send in what men he has recruited even if they amount to but one hundred to a regiment if they would do this it would make a considerable force upon the whole the enemy must be ignorant of our numbers and situation or they would never suffer us to remain unmolested and i almost tax myself with imprudence in committing the secret to paper not that i distrust you of whose inviolable attachment i have so many proofs but for fear the letter should by any accident fall into other hands than those for which it is intended if your militia should make any objection to coming this way on account of the smallpox you may assure them that if there is the least danger of taking that disorder here they shall come no farther than peekskill i mean those that have not had it where they may take the places of the continental yorkers who i am obliged to keep in garrison there having no other troops to secure the forts and passes upon the north river i am c      george washington  0 march      morristown majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates morristown  0 march      dear sir i have the pleasure of yours of the  th instant and am sorry to find that general cadwalader has declined a commission in the continental service although i often wished in secret that you could be brought to resume the office of adjutantgeneral i never even hinted it because i thought it might be disagreeable to you for the reason which you yourself mentioned that you commanded last campaign at the second post upon this continent and that therefore it might be looked upon by you as a degradation     but you cannot conceive the pleasure i feel when you tell me that if it is my desire that you should resume your former office you will with cheerfulness and alacrity proceed to morristown give me leave to return you my sincere thanks for this mark of your attention to a request of mine which now you give me an opening i make and at the same time assure you that i look upon your resumption of the office of adjutantgeneral as the only means of giving form and regularity to our new army i had in vain cast my eyes upon every person within my knowledge and found none that i thought equal to the task except one gentleman major apollos morris but his character and his intentions are of too dubious a nature to intrust with an office of such high importance i shall be glad to receive a line from you mentioning the time that you will leave philadelphia because i intend sending general st clair down to take your command  i am informed that general putnam sent down to philadelphia in irons major stockton taken upon the rariton and that he continues in strict confinement i think we ought to avoid putting in practice what we have so loudly complained of the cruel treatment of prisoners i therefore desire that if there is a necessity   0 for confinement it may be made as easy and comfortable as possible to major stockton and his officers this man i believe has been very active and mischievous but we took him in arms as an officer of the enemy and by the rules of war we are obliged to treat him as such and not as a felon i shall be glad if you will bring with you as exact a return as possible of the number of troops in philadelphia and try to form some opinion of the time in which they will be able to come forward i am dear sir yours c george washington    march      morristown brigadiergeneral wooster to brigadiergeneral wooster  morristown    march      sir i was a good deal surprised to find yours of the  d dated from rye supposing there was a real necessity of your retreating from new rochelle you certainly ought to have returned immediately upon the enemys dropping their design if they ever had any of attacking you all accounts from your quarters complain loudly of this retreat as a most injudicious step as it gave fresh spirits to the disaffected and retarded the removal of forage by the convention of new york the very end that your troops were principally intended to answer as there is now a certainty that the enemy have drawn the greatest part of their force from new york and long island you may safely fall down again towards kingsbridge     which i desire may be done immediately and that you may do all in your power to keep the enemy as strictly confined as possible to the island of new york it appears to me that the fault was more in your officers than in stanton for they should not have suffered him to come on shore farther than was necessary for his business i therefore desire that he may be suffered to depart with his flag of truce and told never to return again without giving proper notice to an officer  i am sir yours c george washington    march      morristown majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler morristown    march      sir it is of the greatest importance to the safety of a country involved in a defensive war to endeavor to draw their troops together at some post at the opening of a campaign so central to the theatre of war that they may be sent to the support of any part of the country which the enemy may direct their motions against it is a military observation strongly supported by experience that a superior army may fall a sacrifice to an inferior by an injudicious division it is impossible without knowing the enemys intentions to guard against every sudden incursion     or give protection to all the inhabitants some principal object should be had in view in taking post to cover the most important part of the country instead of dividing our force to give shelter to the whole to attempt which cannot fail to give the enemy an opportunity of beating us in detachments as we are under the necessity of guessing at the enemys intentions and further operations the great object of attention ought to be where the most proper place is to draw our force together from the eastward and westward to cover the country prevent the enemys penetration and annoy them in turn should our strength be equal to the attempt there is not a state upon the continent but thinks itself in danger and scarcely an officer at any one post but conceives a reinforcement necessary to comply with the demands of the whole is utterly impossible and if attempted would prove our inevitable ruin from the enemys situation in jersey collecting their force at amboy and brunswic and from their intentions last fall confirmed by every piece of intelligence we obtain this spring it scarce admits a doubt of philadelphia being an object in view at the opening of this campaign if this be their aim it appears to me highly probable their army being greatly reduced since the commencement of the last campaign that they will bring round all the troops from canada to reinforce em here what serves to confirm me in this opinion is the facility with which a junction can be made this way the necessity they are under of a reinforcement and the great security the     command of the lakes gives them against our incursions into canada under these considerations i cannot help thinking much too large a part of our force is directed to ticonderoga peekskill appears to me a much more proper place where if the troops are drawn together they will be advantageously situated to give a support to any of the eastern or middle states should the enemys designs be to penetrate the country up the north river they will be well posted to oppose them should they attempt to penetrate into new england they are well stationed to cover it if they move westward the eastern and southern troops can easily form a junction and besides it will oblige the enemy to leave a much stronger garrison at new york but even admitting the enemy pursue their first plan they will be by no means disadvantageously posted to reinforce ticonderoga and cover the country of albany i am very sure the operations of this army will in a great degree govern the motions of that in canada if this is held at bay curbed and confined the northern army dare not to attempt to penetrate it appears to me of great importance to the success to the next campaign to give this army some capital stroke in the early part of the season nothing can enable me to do this but a junction of the eastern and southern forces the recruiting service to the southward has been so protracted for want of a regular arrangement amongst the recruiting officers that with the difficulty of clothing and arming the troops it must unavoidably be late in the     season before a sufficient force can be drawn together to check their progress without the assistance of a very considerable part of the eastern troops the ruin of this army is desirable for many reasons it will free the country from their present distress and prevent the army in canada if it continues there from making any movements but above all should the enemy be coming from england with a strong reinforcement to destroy this division of their force will totally ruin their plan of operations for the next campaign and perhaps discourage them from any further attempts but suppose the enemy should contrary to our expectations which i cannot help thinking is against all probability attempt to penetrate the country by the way of the lakes the forts being properly garrisoned and supplied with provisions the cattle and carriages drove off it will be impossible for them to effect it if we should draw a large force together at ticonderoga and the enemy make no movement upon the lakes but collect their whole strength here they would be an useless body of troops there while the service here might suffer an irreparable injury for want of em the disaffection of pennsylvania which i fear is much beyond anything you have conceived and the depression of the people of this state render a strong support necessary to prevent a systematical submission besides the loss of philadelphia would prove a very great and irreparable injury as we draw from thence almost all our supplies it will signify nothing to have our frontiers strongly guarded while     the enemy are ranging at large in the heart of the country for these and many other reasons that will readily occur to you upon reflection i have come to a resolution to alter the route of some part of the bay forces and to draw eight regiments of them to peekskill from whence by water they can soon proceed to albany if occasion shall require or move elsewhere according to circumstances this measure i have been more inclined to adopt as i find part of the york regiments are gone to ticonderoga contrary to my expectation or design    i am dear sir yours c  george washington    march      morristown to the president of congress morristown    march      sir i was honored several days ago with your letter of the   th ulto with its inclosures the receipt of which was omitted to be acknowledged in my last—could i accomplish the important objects so eagerly wished by congress—confining the enemy within their present quarters preventing their getting supplies from the country and totally subduing them before they are reinforced—i should be happy indeed but what prospect or hope can there be of my effecting so desirable a work at this time the enclosed return to which i solicit the most serious attention     of congress comprehends the whole force i have in jersey it is but a handful and bears no proportion in the scale of numbers to that of the enemy added to this the major part is made up of militia the most sanguine in speculation cannot deem it more than adequate to the least valuable purposes of war the reinforcements mentioned to be drawn from general heath were merely ideal nearly the whole of the eastern troops who were with him being here before they were only engaged till today and today they leave the camp their service has been of pretty long continuance and almost the whole of the winter months what prospect there may be of immediate succors from other quarters i know not but from the militia of this state i cannot expect to derive much more aid those who are well affected have been so frequently called from their homes that they are tired out and almost profess an abhorrence of the service nor have i heard as yet that any continental troops are on their way i have written to the brigadiergenerals in most of the states upon the subject and also to the colonels urging them by every motive to exert themselves in filling the regiments and to forward them on i confess sir i feel the most painful anxiety when i reflect on our situation and that of the enemy unless the levies arrive soon we must before long experience some interesting and melancholy event i believe the enemy have fixed on their object and the execution will surely be attempted as soon as the roads are passable the unprepared state in which     we are favors all their designs and it is much to be wished that they may not succeed to their warmest expectations on recurring to the last promotions of brigadiers i find the number appointed to be short of what i took the liberty to recommend and not competent to the exigences of the service supposing the whole in office before and those lately created consent to act which i have reason to believe will not be the case i shall only beg leave to refer you to my former letters upon this subject and to assure you that many disadvantages will result from not having a sufficient number of officers of this rank we have always been deficient in this instance and certain i am that the service has been greatly injured by it the proportion i mentioned was full small and in my opinion should not be dispensed with i would also take the liberty of mentioning again having received no answer upon the subject that settling the hospital plan and establishment becomes more and more necessary it is an object of infinite importance and the difficulties of doing it on a proper foundation will be great if not almost insurmountable should it be deferred till the campaign opens and the enemy begin their operations the benefits of the institution will soon be known—the want was severely felt in the course of the last year there is one thing now which claims in my opinion the earliest attention of congress i mean the pay of the regimental surgeons and that of the mates these appointments are so essential that they cannot be done without the pay in the first instance is so     low—so inadequate to the services which should be performed that no man sustaining the character of a gentleman and who has the least medical abilities or skill in the profession can think of accepting it that in the latter is so paltry and trifling that none of the least generosity of sentiment or pretensions to merit can consent to act for it in a word these are inconveniences of an interesting nature—they amount to an exclusion of persons who could discharge the duties of these offices and if not redressed there is not the smallest probability that any can be prevailed on to enter them again there are several matters also which i referred to congress some time since and upon which i have not received the result of their deliberations one inquiry about the state of arms and ammunition i am peculiarly anxious to be satisfied in from the inconveniences and injuries to the service of late for want of money i am induced to request that the strictest regard should be had to furnishing the paymaster with constant and sufficient supplies on sunday he received  00000 dollars half of which is already expended and the ballance in a day or two will be entirely swept away without discharging the several claims by his report the commissary here requires an immediate draft for  00000 and the militia returning and about to leave the camp   0000 more the expence incurred by calling on them so frequently is almost incredible besides these there are several arrears due the old troops and to most of the general  staff officers     p s i fully intended to transmit to you a general return but i am not able to make it out with precision however from the most accurate estimate that i can form the whole of our numbers in jersey fit for duty at this time is under three thousand these nine hundred and eightyone excepted are militia and stand engaged only till the last of this month the troops under inoculation including their attendants amount to about one thousand  george washington    march      morristown majorgeneral sullivan to majorgeneral sullivan morristown    march      do not my dear general sullivan torment yourself any longer with imaginary slights and involve others in the perplexities you feel on that score no other officer of rank in the whole army has so often conceived himself neglected slighted and ill treated as you have done and none i am sure has had less cause than yourself to entertain such ideas mere accidents things which have occurred in the common course of service have been considered by you as designed affronts but pray sir in what respect did general greenes late command at fort lee differ from his present command at baskenridge or from yours at chatham and what kind of separate command had general putnam at new york i never heard of any except his commanding there ten days before my arrival from boston and one day after i had left it for haerlem heights as senior officer in like manner at philadelphia how did his   0 command there differ from the one he has at princeton and wherein does either vary from yours at chatham are there any peculiar emoluments or honors to be reaped in the one case and not in the other no why then these unreasonable these unjustifiable suspicions suspicions which can answer no other end than to poison your own happiness and add vexation to that of others general heath it is true was ordered to peekskill so was general spencer by the mere chapter of accidents being almost in the country to providence to watch the motions of the fleet then hovering in the sound what followed after to either or both was more the effect of chance than design your ideas and mine respecting separate commands have but little analogy i know of but one separate command properly so called and that is in the northern department and general sullivan general st clair or any other general officer at ticonderoga will be considered in no other light whilst there is a superior officer in the department than if they were placed at chatham baskenridge or princeton but i have not time to dwell upon subjects of this kind in quiting it i shall do it with an earnest exhortation that you will not suffer yourself to be teased with evils that only exist in the imagination and with slights that have no existence at all keeping in mind at the same time that if distant armies are to be formed there are several gentlemen before you in point of rank who have a right to claim a preference i am with regard dear sir your most obedient c     george washington   th day of mar      morristown majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene instructions sir the necessity of having the congress well informd of many matters essential to the well being of this army and the impracticability of doing this fully by letter have induced me to request you who intimately know our circumstances to repair immediately to philadelphia for this purpose—at the same time to know how we are to be supplied with arms and many other articles of wch we are exceedingly deficient—to enumerate the several matters of information necessary to be given and the inquiries proper to be made would be as needless as endless—your own good sense assisted by such hints as you have recd will be abundly suffit but i would have you enquire of the quartermaster genl how he stands provided with tents—ammunition carts or wagons for intrenching tools and hatchets or tomahawks—also of the comy of stores how he goes on with his castings of cannon—making cartridges of which numbers should be in readiness and in general what forwardness the business of the elaboratory is in  urge him to the most diligent discharge of the duties thereof   as the establishment of the horse with respect to the pay seems to be upon an unstable footing and it is indispensably necessary that both officers and men should know what they have to depend upon—i should be glad if the pay could be settled upon such a just and liberal footing as to give satisfaction to the parties   one thing in particular i beg of you to impress strongly upon congress and that is the necessity of keeping the paymaster regularly supplied with the article of cash—without it every thing moves slowly on and many and great disadvantages flow from the want of it as we have most wofully experienced of late in numberless instances given at headquarters morristown this   th day of mar      two or three things however i must in a more particular manner recomd to your attention—the one is the embarrassment     i am laid under with respect to carrying the exchange of prisoners into execution agreeable to the cartel settled with genl howe on account of the confinement of ltcolo campbell  the hessian fieldofficers another see   another see    george washington    march      morristown majorgeneral mifflin to majorgeneral mifflin morristown    march      dear sir i very sincerely congratulate you upon your late promotion the purport of this letter is private your design in restraining the waggon master from buying and selling horses i highly approve because i am well assured that a contrary practice would be introductory of a great deal of fraud and imposition upon the public but as it is more than probable that in the course of service many horses will be so worn down as to render it beneficial to the public to have them sold i should be glad in that case and no other to come in as a common purchaser of a parcel of mares to the number of even fifty or hundred     i have many large farms and am improving a great deal of land into meadow and pasture which cannot fail of being profited by a number of brood mares the getting of which may perhaps come easier and readier in this way than any other i again repeat that it is upon the presumption the good of the service requires such sales that i mean to become as another person a purchaser but could wish nevertheless that it might be done without any mention of my name well knowing that the most innocent and upright actions are often misconstrued  that it would not be surprising if it should be said that i was defrauding the public of these mares by some collusion or other i should not care how low in flesh or even crippled they are provided i could get them home but i should not like to have them old and would prefer bays though i shall not object to any color if such sales are found necessary you can i dare say easily manage the matter so in my behalf as to keep my name out of the question my best respects to mrs mifflin with truth and sincerity—i am c george washington  0 march      morristown robert alexander to robert alexander morristown  0 march      dear sir i have waited as i think you must do me the justice to acknowledge with a good deal of patience to see if you were disposed to fulfil your agreement with me respecting the land i purchased of you in maryland as i hear nothing of your intentions of carrying this matter into execution and see no     greater prospect of its being done now than when the bargain was first made i cannot help considering the affair in a point of view very unfavorable i think any gentleman possessed of but a very moderate degree of influence with his wife might in the course of five or six years for i think it is at least that time have prevailed upon her to do an act of justice in fulfilling his bargains and complying with his wishes if he had been really in earnest in requesting the matter of her especially as the inducement which you thought would have a powerful operation on mrs alexander namely the birth of a child has been doubled and tripled it is not a very favorable time i acknowledge to purchase lands upon the water but as this purchase still corresponds with the views i first set out upon and i have waited your time for the completion of it with a degree of patience which few others in my situation would have done i hope you will give me no further cause to complain of your delays for i cannot help repeating and the world will believe that the fault is not in mrs alexander but yourself if matters are procrastinated any longer i am sir c george washington   d march      morris town governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters morris town   d march      sir i am honored with yours of the  th and  0th instant the first accompanying an account of the committee of simsbury against prisoners who were sent there by my order there is no part of the charge to be objected against but that of £  0 said to be     for the expense and trouble of the committee themselves i cannot see how either could have been incurred in so trivial a matter or if any that it could have been so large a proportion however i think the state had better pay what is reasonable and right and make a continental charge of it i wish you may not have been deceived in the forwardness of your regiments for i can assure you the returns fall far short of what was given out chandlers swifts and charles webbs by general parsons letter of the  th instant had only eighty men each though the latter sent his son down some weeks ago and drew four hundred stand of arms assuring me that his father had as many men ready none of the other regiments were half full durkees had only one hundred and forty men from this state of facts it is evident that if the most spirited exertions are not made the enemy will take the field before we can draw a sufficient head of men together to oppose them i am informed that the state of massachusetts have called upon their different districts to furnish as many men as are sufficient to make up their quota of eightyeight battalions and that they have succeeded by this mode far better than if they had proceeded in their usual line of enlistment i dont know whether your state can exercise such powers but if you can you could never make use of them at a better time from the present appearance of the weather the spring promises to be a forward one and from every account the enemy only wait for good weather and good roads to take the field     the reinforcement of russians spoke of by governor wentworth is mentioned in several letters that have been thrown out i believe with an intent to divide and intimidate for although i do not doubt but they would employ russians or any other barbarians to accomplish their designs i do not think there is a probability that they can be here shortly if at all governor livingston informed me a few days ago that he understood that governor franklin by some means or other continued to carry on a correspondence with mr hugh wallace of new york and a gentleman of the name of livingston who went into new york and took protection but not liking his situation returned again informed upon oath that he heard that governor franklin granted protections to such as would take them in connecticut and that one shackles of middletown carried on a correspondence with miles sherbrook of new york this livingston says he had from sherbrooks clerk i dont know that the foregoing amounts to positive proof against governor franklin but it ought at least to put you on your guard and have him narrowly watched i have the honor to be sir your most obedient servant george washington    march      morristown to the president of congress morristown    march      sir i last night had the honor to receive your letter of the   th instt accompanied by sundry resolves of congress and some other papers     the arrival of the arms—locks and flints you have been pleased to mention is a most fortunate and happy event—i join you most sincerely in congratulations upon the occasion i have not yet obtained a certain account of the expedition against and destruction of peekskill information of those events has not been yet transmitted by generals mcdougall clinton or the convention of the state  there is no doubt but that the town is destroyed and with it some stores neither the quality nor amount of them is known it is said that it was done in part by our own people when they found that they could not prevent them from falling into the enemys hands the ships and troops have gone down the river again      mr kirkland the oneida missionary arrived here this week with a chief warrior and five other indians of that nation they had been to boston and came from thence to this place to inquire into the true state of matters that they might report them to a grand council to be shortly held they said things were so falsely and variously represented by our enemies through their agents that they did not know what to depend on i invited them to go to philadelphia but they declined it declaring they were     well satisfied with what they had seen and that they were authorized to tell their nation all they had heard from the enemy was false being told that france was assisting us and about to join in the war they seemed highly pleased and mr kirkland said he was persuaded it would have a considerable effect on the minds of several of the nations and secure to us their neutrality if not a declaration and commencement of hostilities in our favor i showed them every civility in my power and every thing that i thought material to excite in them an idea of our strength and independence after staying two days they set off for their nation expressing their desire of the most speedy return to the council and professing the most friendly sentiments towards us i have the honor to be c  george washington   april      morristown elias boudinot to elias boudinot morristown   april      sir i am authorized by congress to appoint a commissary of prisoners the pay will i expect be about sixty dollars a month the duty except as to confinement  00 not hard at least after the business is once put into a proper train close attendance on the army will be requisite in order to receive and distribute the prisoners to places assigned for their confinement at each of which some person should be stationed to see that they are taken care of that they receive what is allowed them and that proper accounts are kept of the expenses the most troublesome part of this office will be to obtain accounts of the expenses already incurred for after this is once done the business may be put upon such a footing as to be managed with regularity and ease i intend to annex another duty to this office and that is the procuring of intelligence the person engaged in the department of commissary of prisoners will have as much leisure and better opportunities than most officers in the army to obtain knowledge of the enemys situation motions and as far as may be designs thus sir in concise terms have i given you a sketch of the duties of a commissary of prisoners and my expectations from him and now give me leave to ask if you will accept the appointment with very great esteem and regard i am sir yours etc   0  george washington   april      morristown governor cooke to governor cooke morristown   april      sir i am honord with yours of the   th of last month the late ample arrivals of arms at philadelphia and at portsmouth added to those which we before had puts us out of all further uneasiness on account of that necessary article the eleven hundred and seventysix stand which you received from the continental agent at boston will be very near the number wanted for your two continental battalions when complete and i desire that they may be carefully collected from the militia to whom any part of them were lent and applied to that purpose the effects of granting extravagant bounties and of raising bodies of men upon colonial establishments now appear from the returns of the low state of your continental battalions from the first cause the men are taught to set a price upon themselves and refuse  0  to turn out except that price is paid and i am informed in some instances in massachusetts one hundred pounds lawful money per man has been paid it is also evident that the raising of the colonial brigade for fifteen months retards the continental enlistments for general spencer in a letter of the   th of march writes to me that the first has five hundred men and the last but three hundred and eighty about half of whom have had the smallpox and he adds that general varnum was only then preparing hospitals for the inoculation of the remainder strange that this should have been neglected so long when my orders were given on the  d of march to provide quarters and to inoculate immediately you certainly overrate the number of the enemy upon rhode island if they consist of only six hessian and two british regiments the hessian regiments when they came out complete did not exceed six hundred men each and the british two hundred and fifty each now if they have decreased by casualties in proportion to the other troops in the british army they are scarcely more than three thousand a number too small to make any attempt upon the main i am convinced from every appearance that they intend to leave rhode island where they have wintered comfortably and kept up a considerable diversion and join their main body in this province how i am to oppose them god knows for except a few hundred from jersey pennsylvania and virginia i have not yet received a man of the  0  new continental levies so far from being able to consent that your continental battalions should remain at home supposing the enemy should continue upon the island that i am obliged in the most positive terms to order every man who has had the smallpox to come immediately forward and those who have not so soon as they are recovered i have written to general varnum to the same effect as it is my duty to afford equal protection to every part of the continent you may be assured if i thought there was any real danger to be apprehended from the enemy at rhode island that instead of drawing the continental troops from that quarter i would add to their numbers but when there is every probability of their coming away and supposing they should stay as the internal strength of the country would hinder them from setting foot upon the main i think i am excusable in drawing every man in the continental service except those intended for the northern department to this point to give opposition to the grand army of the enemy who unless they are checked will in turn overrun every state in the union as the safety of the whole confederacy depends upon each states furnishing the quota of men allotted to it i must call upon you in the most pressing manner first to endeavor to complete your allotment by the usual methods but if your men will not turn out voluntarily notwithstanding the great encouragement given by the state i beg you will if your powers are adequate insist upon each districts  0  furnishing a certain number as they have done in massachusetts if neither of these modes can be fallen upon to good effect we may as well give up the cause i have the honor to be c george washington   april      morristown brigadiergeneral arnold to brigadiergeneral arnold morristown   april      dear sir i am this day favd with yours of the   th last month and a few days ago with that of the   th it is needless for me to say much upon a subject which must undoubtedly give you a good deal of uneasiness i confess i was surprised when i did not see your name in the list of majorgenerals and was so fully of opinion that there was some mistake in the matter that i as you may recollect desired you not to take any hasty step before the intention of congress was fully known  the point does not now admit of a doubt and is of so delicate a nature that i will not even undertake to advise your own feelings must be your guide as no particular charge is allegd against you i do not see upon what ground you can demand a court of inquiry besides  0  public bodies are not amenable for their actions they place and displace at pleasure and all the satisfaction that an individual can obtain when he is overlooked is if innocent a consciousness that he has not deserved such treatment for his honest exertions your determination not to quit your present command while any danger to the public might ensue from your leaving it deserves my thanks and justly entitles you to the thanks of your country general greene who has lately been at philadelphia took occasion to inquire upon what principle the congress proceeded in their late promotion of general officers he was informed that the members from each state seemed to insist upon having a proportion of general officers adequate to the number of men which they furnish and that as connecticut had already two majorgenerals it was their full share i confess this is a strange mode of reasoning but it may serve to show you that a promotion which was due to your seniority was not overlooked for want of merit in you i am dear sir yours c george washington   april      morristown brigadiergeneral parsons to brigadiergeneral parsons morristown   april      dear sir my letters of the  0th and   th ulto will convey evident proofs to you of my extreme sollicitude respecting the assembling of our troops and yet as i have but too much reason to believe that dissipation in some and the comfortable enjoyment of domestick pleasures in others have had an unhappy influence  0  upon the conduct of the recruiting officers i must again repeat the urgent necessity there is for the officers of every denomination exerting themselves to the utmost in bringing forward the new levies genl howe is vigorous in his preparations the troops at rhode island from the best intelligence i have been able to get were about to imbark a number to the amount it is said of  000 have actually imbarkd from new york and amboy and are now at the watering place near the narrows—in short the campaign is opening and we have no men for the field—if this is owing to the causes above mentioned the officers imployed in the recruiting service must expect to be answerable for the consequences if they have done their duty and it proceeds from unwillingness in the men to inlist the government must have recourse to coercive measures for if the quotas required of each state cannot be had by voluntary inlistment in time and the powers of government are not adequate to drafting there is an end of the contest and opposition becomes vain—i therefore wish you to see govr trumbull and converse with him on the importance of this subject for delay in obtaining the men falls very little short of not getting them at all—if the enemy for want of men to oppose them can march through the country in triumph or if the opposition is so feeble as to become ineffectual and our army thereby destroyed by piecemeals the bad effects of either is much easier to be conceived than described and should be avoided if possible—  0  the eight regiments of your state i would have divided into two brigades as follows— first second   colo chas webb   colo huntington   colo wyllys   colo bradley   colo douglas   colo chandler   colo durkee   colo swift the first brigade to be under your immediate command—the second to be under the care of the eldest colo superintended by you till genl spencer arrives or a brigadier is appointed to it—all the officers and men of these brigades to march immediately to peekskill except such as have not had the small pox and are now under inoculation—and except such officers as are necessary for the care of the sick and for recruiting which ought to be attended to and prosecuted with all possible vigor—take care to give me previous notice of the arrival of these troops at the kills that if the exigencies of affairs require it they may be immediately ordered on to head quarters without loss of time i am c proclamation respecting deserters whereas many soldiers lately enlisted in the continental army not content with the generous bounties and encouragements granted to them by congress but influenced by a base regard to their interest have reenlisted with and received bounties from other officers and then deserted and whereas it is presumed that many fully sensible of the enormity of their crimes would return to their duty were they not deterred by an apprehension of suffering the severe punishment lately inflicted on those found  0  guilty of desertion i have thought proper to issue this my proclamation offering free pardon to all those above described as well as to those who have deserted from other motives who shall voluntarily surrender themselves to any officer in the continental army or join their respective corps before the   th day of may next and i do strictly enjoin all officers in the army under my command and entreat the good people of these states to use their utmost endeavors to apprehend and secure such deserters as shall not avail themselves of the indulgence offered by this proclamation given under my hand at headquarters at morristown this  th day of april       george washington   april      morristown general heard to general heard morristown   april      sir inclosed i transmit you a copy of a late resolve of congress by which you will perceive that in bringing the militia into the field strict regard is to be had to  0  the number of men and only a due proportion of officers both with respect to rank and number is to be called out to command them more than these will not be paid as it would impose an unreasonable burthen on the public there have been horrid abuses in this way it has been heretofore customary to see almost as many officers as men in the pay abstracts that have been brought before me and what is if possible a still greater enormity i have reason to believe it is too often a practice for officers who command parties to assume the rank of their superior officers who happen to be absent and to draw pay equivalent to it under the absurd idea of their acting in their stead  capacity i desire your careful attention to the remedying these things in future as the tenor of the before mentioned resolve will berigidly adhered to and supernumerary officers may expect to receive no pay for their unnecessary services and those who are guilty of such an assumption of rank will make themselves liable to punishment i find that the brigadiers of this state have each a particular power only to call out the militia of a particular district on this account unless the governor should have regulated the matter himself it will be necessary that the brigadiers should agree among themselves on one of their number to take the actual command of the troops in the field more than one will not be wanted for the purpose i shall deem it indispensably incumbent on the acting brigadier to enforce upon all the officers   0 under him the necessary practice of making exact returns to him of their several parties and to impress it upon them in explicit terms that no abstracts they shall present will be paid unless they are first certified under his hand in doing which his duty and reputation demand he should accurately compare the abstracts with the returns that have been previously made any neglect or want of care in this particular will manifest an unpardonable disregard to the public good i am c george washington   april      morristown joseph reed john cox to colonel reed or colonel cox head quarters morristown   april      dear sir i am informed there is a certain mr smith who has been lately taken up by general lincoln as a spy and sent to philadelphia under that character i believe for several reasons that he is the man who was imployed by you to act for us in that capacity and that the apprehending him is a mistake which may be attended with ill consequences lest he should be precipitately tried and punished i must beg you will interpose in the affair without delay and if you find him to be the person i suspect he is take measures to have him released i should be glad indeed that some management might be used in the matter in order to turn the circumstance of his being apprehended to a good account it would be well to make him a handsome present in money to secure     his fidelity to us and contrive his releasement in such a manner as to give it the appearance of an accidental escape from confinement after concerting a plan with him by which he will be enabled to be serviceable to us in communicating intelligence from time to time let him make the best of his way to the enemy under the idea above intimated—that is as a fugitive from the persecution and danger he incurred among us for his known friendship to the enemy great care must be taken so to conduct the scheme as to make the escape appear natural and real—there must be neither too much facility nor too much refinement for doing too little or overacting the part would alike beget a suspicion of the true state of the case i am c george washington   april      morristown lieutenantgeneral howe to lieutenantgeneral howe morristown   april      sir i take the liberty of transmitting you a copy of a paper addressed to me by lieutenantcolonel walcott of your army which came enclosed in a letter from lieutenantgeneral lord cornwallis it is with peculiar regret i am constrained to observe that this illiberal performance of colonel walcotts is obviously calculated to answer a less generous purpose than that of merely effecting an exchange contains a gross misrepresentation of facts and is a palpable deviation from that delicate line which i expected would mark his conduct as a man of candor     and ingenuity  that gentleman has censured two articles insisted on by me through lieutenantcolonel harrison at their meeting of the  0th ultimo as groundless unprecedented and inconsistent with any degree of reason or common sense though founded as i conceive in the clearest principles of equity and justice not contenting himself with this which would have given me no concern he has assumed the privilege of mutilating and misstating those articles in such a manner as to change their meaning and to adapt them to the unfair conclusions he wished to establish having premised these things and being charged in direct and positive terms by colonel walcott who acted under your authority with a violation of the agreement made between us for the exchange of prisoners and called upon for a performance of the same i think it necessary to explain the motives of my conduct and the grounds on which those articles or objections stand in respect to the first i freely repeat that i do not hold myself bound either by the     spirit of the agreement or by the principles of justice to account for those prisoners who from the rigor and severity of their treatment were in so emaciated and languishing a state at the time they came out as to render their death almost certain and inevitable and which in many instances happened while they were returning to their homes and in many others immediately after their arrival you must be sensible that our engagement as well as all others of the kind though in the letter it expresses only an equality of rank and number as the rule of exchange yet it necessarily implies a regard to the general principles of mutual compensation and advantage this is inherent in its nature is the voice of reason and no stipulation as to the condition in which prisoners should be returned was requisite humanity dictated that their treatment should be such as their health and comfort demanded and where her laws have been duly respected their condition has been generally good nor is this the language of humanity alone justice declares the same the object of every cartel or similar agreement is the benefit of the prisoners themselves and that of the contending powers on this footing it equally exacts that they should be well treated as that they should be exchanged the reverse is therefore an evident infraction and ought to subject the party on whom it is chargeable to all the damage and ill consequences resulting from it nor can it be expected that those unfitted for future service by acts of severity in direct violation of a compact are     proper subjects for an exchange in such case to return others not in the same predicament would be to give without receiving an equivalent and would afford the greatest encouragement to cruelty and inhumanity the argument drawn from the mere circumstance of the prisoners having been received is of no validity though from their wretched situation they could not at that time be deemed proper for an exchange yet our humanity required that they should be permitted to return among us it may perhaps be fairly doubted whether an apprehension of their death or that of a great part of them did not contribute somewhat to their being sent out when they were such an event whilst they remained with you would have been truly interesting because it would have destroyed every shadow of claim for a return of the prisoners in our hands and therefore policy concurring with humanity dictated that the measure should be adopted happy had it been if the expedient had been thought of before these illfated men were reduced to such extremity it is confessed however on all sides that after their delivery they still continued your prisoners and would be so till regularly exchanged i acknowledge that i should and i have been always willing notwithstanding this concession to account for every man who was in a proper condition and fit to be exchanged at the time they came out so far as the proportion of prisoners with us would extend with what propriety or upon what foundation of justice can more be demanded this has     been proposed or what is the same was most clearly implied in the first article or objection made by lieutenantcolonel harrison and illiberally rejected since as inconsistent with any degree of reason or common sense painful as it is i am compelled to consider it as a fact not to be questioned that the usage of our prisoners whilst in your possession the privates at least was such as could not be justified this was proclaimed by the concurrent testimony of all who came out their appearance sanctified the assertion and melancholy experience in the speedy death of a large part of them stamped it with infallible certainty in respect to the second article insisted on your discriminating majorgeneral lee from other captive officers belonging to the american army demanded my particular attention i was authorized to conclude from your laying him under peculiar restraints and from your letter of the   d of january last that you considered him in a singular point of view and meant to exclude him from the common right of exchange stipulated for all officers in general terms this distinction the more injurious and unwarrantable as you never excepted him though you knew him to be an officer in our army at the time and long before the agreement was entered into made it my duty to assert his right in an explicit manner and to endeavor to put the matter upon so unequivocal a footing as to insure his enlargement whenever an officer of equal rank belonging to your army should be in our power this was attempted by the article     and nothing more nor is any other inference to be drawn from it it is true a proposition was made since his captivity to give a certain number of officers of inferior rank in exchange for him but it was not claimed as a matter of right what name then does that proceeding merit by which it is suggested that the immediate release of general lee had been demanded without having an officer of equal rank to give for him the suggestion cannot be supported by the most tortured exposition nor will it have credit where candor is deemed a virtue and words preserve their form and meaning as to the charge of delay in not returning the prisoners in our hands the dispersed situation of those taken at a more early period of the war through the different states arising from the circumstances of their captivity and a regard to their better accommodation made their detention for a considerable time unavoidable when the agreement subsisting between us took place the speediest directions were given to have them collected that an exchange might be effected this was done in part and at a juncture when motives of policy opposed the measure but were made to yield to the rigid maxims of good faith  we were pursuing the exchange and continued our exertions to accomplish it till the miserable appearance indicating an approaching catastrophe of those sent out by you made it improper     foreseeing that a difficulty might arise and that it might be expected that i should account for the whole of them which i by no means thought it equitable to do it became necessary that the matter should be adjusted and the due proportion settled for which i ought to be responsible before any thing further could be done on my part upon this ground stands also the detention of those who have been since captured added to these considerations the discrimination set up in the instance of general lee is to be regarded as utterly irreconcilable with the tenor of our agreement and an insurmountable obstacle to a compliance with your demands thus sir have i explained the motives of my conduct and i trust vindicated myself in the eye of impartiality from the improper and groundless charge which you and the gentleman acting by your authority have been pleased to allege against me if in doing this i have departed in the smallest degree from that delicacy which i always wished should form a part of my character you will remember i have been forced into recrimination and that it has become an act of necessary justice i shall now declare it to be my ardent wish that a general exchange may take place on generous and liberal principles so far as it can be effected and that the agreement subsisting between us for that purpose should be inviolably observed and i call upon you by every obligation of good faith to remove all impediments on your part to the accomplishment of it if however you do not i console myself with a hope     that those unfortunate men whose lot it is to be your prisoners will bear their sufferings with becoming fortitude and magnanimity i am sir with due respect c  george washington  0 april      morristown majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath morristown  0 april      dr sir i have within these few days received an application from the honble messrs sever and cushing for arms and blankets for the use of the massachusetts regim destined for tyconderoga—surely these troops are not at this day to begin their march for that post—and sorry i am to observe that nothing now will content that government but the new arms lately arrived there which will be greatly wanted for troops that cannot otherwise be provided when     i have abundant reason to believe that no state upon the continent has it so much in her power to furnish these articles as that of massachusetts bay indeed i am informed that arms and other military stores are hoarding up in that government which makes every thing of the kind exceedingly difficult to be had for continental use and has the appearance of a separate provision that no delay however may happen i have informed those gentlemen that you would be instructed to issue orders for such a number of arms as shall appear to you absolutely necessary—and this power i now give you requesting at the same time that it may be used with a regard to the general good—the means of procuring them through other channels should still be pursued    let me have the names of the several colonels commanding the    regiments from the state of massachusetts—mention them in their order of seniority  whether the regiments are numberd from the rank of the officers commanding them or not    the brigade majors for these new corps are not to be appointed till there is duty for them to perform then if the brigadiers will make choice of officers properly qualified i will confirm them in office if they do not i shall exert the powers given me by congress to appoint all officers under the rank of brigadier to put in such as are as i will not have any gentn introduced from family connexions or local attachments to the prejudice of the service—of   0 this you will please without loss of time to give each brigadier in your state notice—they will excuse me for this intimation which may imply a reflection when i add that some very improper choices were made last year and when it is evident to every gentleman in the smallest degree acquainted with service that nothing can contribute more to good order and regularity in an army than having brigade majors of knowledge activity and diligence    i am sir c george washington  0 april      morris town brigadiergeneral mifflin to brigadiergeneral mifflin headquarters morris town  0 april      dear sir from every piece of intelligence which we have lately recd it appears that the enemy are making hasty preparations to open the campaign and philadelphia seems generally agreed upon as their object whether the expedition will be by land or water is yet a matter of uncertainty but it is more than probable that it will be by both wherever their army lies it will be of the greatest advantage to us to have spies among them on whom we may depend for intelligence i would therefore have you look out for proper persons for this purpose who are to remain among them under the mask of friendship i would have some of those in bucks county some in philad and others below philada about chester for if any part of their force goes round by water they will probably land some where thereabouts i     have directed genl putnam to procure similar persons to wait upon them in their way thro jersey i hope we may prevent them from crossing the delaware but if that event should happen we should be provided i would therefore have you set about this work immediately and give the persons you pitch upon proper lessons some in the quaker line who have never taken an active part would be least liable to suspicion from either party    george washington    april      morris town to the president of congress headquarters morris town    april      sir i am honored with yours of the  0th accompanied with one from the committee of congress to whom i have wrote very fully upon the subject of the resolve for forming an army upon the west side of delaware and to which i refer you i wish i could see any prospect of an army fit to make proper opposition formed any where you will perhaps be surprized at this after the public reports of the great success of recruiting in all the states but to convince you that these have been but bare reports i will give you the best information i have been able to collect from actual returns and other accounts new hampshire no returns but a letter from genl heath says they are tolerably forward all their regiments go to the northward massachusetts—about  00 men raised to a regt many of those yet to undergo innoculation seven of their regiments go     to the northward and eight are to come to peekskill for the present rhode island—only   0 men inlisted in both regiments the  st april— 00 of those are yet to be innoculated genl varnum writes me that he despairs of filling up the regiments connecticut—by a return from genl parsons of the  th april—about   00 men were recruited thro the whole state they much dispersed many to have the small pox and recruiting at a stand new york—about  00 men to a regiment and from the peculiar situation of that province it will be almost impossible for them to fill up their regiments tho they exert themselves very much new jersey between  00 and  00 to a regt—they also lay under many difficulties on account of the disaffection of their state but their officers are active and diligent pennsylvania most of the regiments are very backward those most so who have been longest recruiting delaware state no return of their regiment maryland i have only the return of one regiment which consists of  00 men but i do not believe the others are in more forwardness the disputes about the rank of officers has prevailed so much that the recruiting service has been in a manner neglected  virginia the nine old regiments will not exceed   00 effective men and govr henry in a letter which i received yesterday informs me that he did not think that more than four of the six new ones would be filled he proposes the expediency of raising volunteer companies to serve seven or eight months to make up the deficiency but this i shall object to on many     accounts particularly that it would be introducing a body of men who would look upon themselves at liberty to do what they pleased and the moment their time expired would leave us tho at the most critical juncture if the men that are raised few as they are could be got into the field it would be a matter of some consolation that every method that i have been able to devise has proved ineffectual if i send an officer to collect the sick or scattered of his regiment it is ten to one that he neglects his duty—goes home on pleasure or business and the next that i hear of him is that he has resigned furloughs are no more attended to than if there was no limitation of time and in short sir there is such a total depression of that military ardor which i hoped would have inspired every officer when he found his pay genteely augmented and the army put upon a respectable footing that it seems to me as if all public spirit was sunk into the means of making money by the service or quarrelling upon the most trivial points of rank  i shall as soon as possible transmit to the board of war a list of the appointments i have made in consequence of the powers vested in me     if the appointments in the hospitals are filled up before the receipt of this i would take the liberty of mentioning a gentleman who i think highly deserving of notice not only on account of his abilities but for the very great assistance which he has afforded in the course of this winter merely in the nature of a volunteer the gentleman is doctr john cochran well known to all the faculty and particularly to doctor shippen who i suppose has mentioned him among the candidates the place for which the doctor is well fitted and which would be most agreeable to him is surgeon general to the middle department in this line he served all the last war in the british service and has distinguished himself this winter particularly in his attention to the small pox patients and the wounded which but for him and doctr bond must have suffered much if not been totally neglected as there were no other medical gentlemen to be found if the appointment of surgeon general is filled up that of deputy director of the middle department would be acceptable i have been thus full in my recommendation because doctr cochran in a manner had my promise of one of the capital appointments     in the hospital upon a presumption that i should have had some hand in the nomination by the resolution of congress empowering me to fill all commissions under the rank of brigadiers general   th—i have this moment received a line from genl lincoln informing me that the enemy attempted to surprize him early this morning at his post at bound brook but he made good his retreat to the pass of the mountains just in his rear with trifling loss i have c george washington    april      morris town governor trumbull to governor trumbull morris town    april      sir as mr fornandez an officer just released from captivity by an exchange informs me that large and weekly supplies of fresh provisions are brought into york—which he was informed by a friend of ours came from connecticut but whether by water or by land he does not know—this information i have thought proper to transmit to your honor by the earliest opportunity that you may adopt such measures as its importance demands and which shall seem most likely to prevent a practice so wicked and so injurious in its consequences it is probable the most common mode of conveyance is by water and that the supplies are from those who live on the sound however it will be well to have the disaffected bordering on the state of york watched with a scrupulous care as well as those contiguous to the sound     mr fornandez adds that colonel rogers and other officers whose names he does not recollect have left york on the recruiting service and gone into connecticut as he was advised it is also said by a mr deputy commissary frink who has been just exchanged too that selleck of stamford is frequently in the city of york and that one john hart is gone to rhode island to pass counterfeit money it highly imports us to detect and apprehend these villains whose crimes are of great enormity and i should hope if this intelligence is communicated to some of our prudent trusty friends in different parts of the state in those most favorable to their views that it might be effected rogers is an active instrument in the enemys hands and his conduct has a peculiar claim to our notice  i have nothing special to mention respecting the enemy as yet they have made no movement but from our advices of their preparations there are strong reasons to believe that they are upon the eve of doing it and from a variety of combining circumstances it appears that philadelphia will be the first object of their attention i only regret that i have     not the means the exigency of our affairs requires and that a strange unaccountable languor seems but too generally to prevail at a time when the preservation of our rights and of all that is dear calls loudly for the most vigorous and active exertions i have the honor c george washington    april      morristown patrick henry to patrick henry governor of virginia morristown    april      sir it gives me much concern to hear that the recruiting service proceeds so slowly in most of the states that it is the case in virginia affects me in a peculiar manner i feel myself much obliged by the polite respect your honorable board of council are pleased to show to my opinion and am under the necessity of observing that the volunteer plan which you mention will never answer any valuable purposes and that i cannot but disapprove the measure to the short engagements of our troops may be fairly and justly ascribed almost every misfortune that we have experienced to that cause and that alone have the liberties of our country been put in question and the most obvious advantages lost this i speak from painful experience and assured of the facts i cannot countenance in the smallest degree what i know to be pernicious in the extreme short enlistments when founded on the best plan are repugnant to order and subversive of discipline and men held upon such terms will never be equal to the important     ends of war but when they are of the volunteer kind they are still more destructive those who engage in arms under that denomination let them agree upon what conditions they may are uneasy impatient of command ungovernable and claiming to themselves a sort of superior merit generally assume not only the privilege of thinking but to do as they please added to these considerations such corps are long in forming and half of their time is taken up in marching to and from camp at a most amazing expense nor are the injuries to which a country is exposed by the frequent marching and countermarching of men to be disregarded further whilst they are in service the states to which they belong have but little if any chance to engage them for a longer term when that is out they will return though the exigency of affairs should be ever so pressing and though you should be on the point of action or perhaps of grasping a victory their departure has a most baneful and unhappy influence on those who remain who consider themselves notwithstanding their engagements as subjected to peculiar hardships become uneasy and discontented and many desert their return too having seen only service sufficient to create disgust and experienced in the course of it a few difficulties produces the same disposition through the circle of their connexions in a word sir i cannot advise the volunteer plan as i conceive the adoption of it would have the most fatal and pernicious tendency and in my opinion the interest of the states would be more advanced     by regular enlistments during the war though it should take a considerable time to complete them  the apologies you offer for your deficiency of troops are not without some weight i am induced to believe that the apprehension of the smallpox and its calamitous consequences have greatly retarded the enlistments but may not those objections be easily done away by introducing inoculation into the state or shall we adhere to a regulation preventing it reprobated at this time not only by the consent and usage of the greater part of the civilized world but by our interest and own experience of its utility you will pardon my observations upon the smallpox because i know it is more destructive to an army in the natural way than the enemys sword and because i shudder whenever i reflect upon the difficulties of keeping it out and that in the vicissitudes of   0 war the scene may be transferred to some southern state should it not be the case their quota of men must come to the field     i have the honor to be c george washington    april      morristown to the president of congress headqrs morristown    april      sir i have nothing of importance to transmit congress no event in the military line having happened since my last except the surprizing a small picquet guard of     the enemy on monday night at bonam town and bringing off thirteen prisoners by one of our parties an enterprize of a similar nature was formed against that at amboy in which the party sent to effect it did not succeed so well tho the most advanced of them seized and secured three of their out sentries without giving an alarm by a letter from genl mcdougall of yesterday i am informed that he had received accounts of thirtysix sail of transports having left newport on friday last with troops on board—other reports he had were that a number of ships were coming up the sound so that we may reasonably conclude genl howe is drawing his forces from the eastward genl arnold in a letter of the  th mentioned that from the preparation of transports  other circumstances he thought it probable an embarkation was about to take place there are grounds to suspect from information received that some unfair practices have been and are meant to be used in certain exports from philadelphia it is said that a vessel navigated by frenchmen loaded there belonging to the murrays of new york which carried her cargo to genl howe also that hartshorne  bowne of monmouth county intend to load one or more for the same purpose under the idea of sending them to foreign markets i have written to the board of war for pennsylvania upon the subject and doubt not but these hints will be properly improved and such frauds guarded against as well as circumstances will admit     i have inclosed a copy of an advertisement published in gaines paper of the   th which shews that no artifices are left untried by the enemy to injure us before the appearance of this unparallelled piece i had heard that a person was gone from york to rhode island with a quantity of counterfeit money there is one thing which i beg leave to mention to congress and which i think highly deserving their attention that is that supplies of hard money or bills of exchange to procure it should if possible be sent to our prisoners in the hands of the enemy at least to the officers to relieve their wants—by letters which i have received from them of late i find they are in great distress and such as ought to be removed if it can be done no inconvenience will result to the public from such supplies if they can be furnished as proper stoppages and deductions can be made from their pay i was honored with your letter of the   th between twelve and one oclock yesterday accompanied by sundry resolutions i hope the measures congress have adopted will produce the salutary consequences they had in view but i fear that the states unless they are delicate in exercising powers they are invested with for filling vacancies in instances of removal from office and pay strict attention to a proper line of succession where there are no capital objections will renew much of that confusion and disorder we have been endeavoring to extricate ourselves from nor will this be of small difficulty if they displace many officers for supposing them to     have kept the most accurate lists of their original appointments changes have taken place in several instances from various causes unknown to them and of which they cannot be apprized i can assure congress the appellation given to the regiments officered by me was without my consent or privity as soon as i heard it i wrote to several of the officers in terms of severe reprehension and expressly charged them to suppress the distinction adding that all the battalions were on the same footing and all under the general name of continental  an attack upon the kings troops at rhode island was certainly a desirable event could it have been conducted with success or upon equal terms it being an object of great moment and involving in its issue many important consequences i am led to believe the practicability of it has had much consideration and the measure found to be unadvisable under the circumstances of the troops collected for the purpose if the enemy have not evacuated the island i suppose the matter will be further weighed i do not find in the medical arrangement any mention of regimental surgeons mates or provision made for their payment whether congress mean to dispense with such officers or not i cannot tell i have heard that they do but they appear to me to be absolutely necessary we are often obliged to divide regiments and to send a part to a distant     post—when this is the case it is essential that there should be some person with them to take charge of the sick or wounded if such there should be i have only mentioned this for many reasons that might be urged to shew the expediency of such appointments notwithstanding the many circumstances inducing a belief that philadelphia will be the first object of the enemys attention yet as the stratagems of war are various and may be easily changed especially when they have the entire command of the water i cannot but consider the detention of the troops at philadelphia farther than mentioned in my letter in answer to that from the board of war as inexpedient and subject to great inconvenience and injury in the present divided separated state of the army we are weak at all points and not able to make the least opposition promising success supposing they were collected here they would be ready to act as necessity and circumstances might require if the enemy pushed for philadelphia we should have notice of it and could hang upon their flank and rear nor is it likely they would undertake such an expedition without attempting the destruction or dispersion of the army first if they embarked and should go by sea we should have information of it and could be there in time on the other hand should all they have done prove a feint and they should turn their views to the north river we should be in a much better situation to counteract their designs and to check the progress of their arms in that quarter added     to this several of the regiments especially those which came first from virginia and pennsylvania are so broken that it is impossible to do any thing with the parts that are here and that spirit which is always derived from a corps being full or as much so as circumstances of number will admit of is entirely done away i have the honor to be c  george washington    april      morristown richard henry lee to richard henry lee morristown    april      dear sir i have been favored with two or three letters from you lately the last that came to hand was without date but contained an extract from doctor lees letter to the secret committee and the french generals ideas of the measures necessary for us to pursue     in prosecuting the war with great britain for both of which i sincerely thank you as the communication of such matters cannot fail of having a proper tendency  the complexion of affairs in europe seems to indicate an approaching storm but where when or on whom it may break is not quite so clear and ought not in my judgment to occasion the smallest relaxation in our preparations for i profess myself to be of that class who never built sanguinely upon the assistance of france further than her winking at our supplies from thence for the benefits derived from our trade and how far the measures and offers of great britain may contravene this time only can discover and is somewhat to be feared the plan drawn by the french general is of such a nature that it is impracticable to carry it into execution this campaign it may however be kept in view and the whole or such parts of it adopted as our circumstances upon a full consideration of the matter may hereafter admit the great delay in appointing the general     officers the resignation of some of them the nonacceptance of others and i might add the unfitness of a few joined to the amazing delay in assembling the troops and the abuses which i am satisfied have been committed by the recruiting officers both of which being consequences of the want of officers in that line to superintend those duties in the respective states have distressed me and the service exceedingly and they will amply prove what i foretold to congress that the pay of these officers for i could account for the delay of appointing them on no other principle would be an illtimed saving convinced i am that thousands of pounds would have been saved to the public if the measure had been adopted upon my first recommendation of it but the extra expense is the smallest part of the evil the backwardness in assembling the troops is truly alarming this however is not a singular instance of our suffering by delay in the adoption of measures which were early recommended you are not aware of the evil consequences that would follow a general exemption of all persons concerned in ironworks from military duty they are very numerous and in this part of the country form a great majority of the people besides why should the ironmaster carry on his trade without restriction when the farmer equally useful for the support of the war the shoemaker and other manufacturers absolutely necessary to the equipment of an army may have their servants and apprentices taken from them at pleasure one thing i have ever done and     it has i believe answered the end proposed by you whenever an ironwork has been employed for the public i have desired the owner to give me a return of the number of men and the names of those necessarily employed therein and have exempted them from the duties of militiamen in this state this i have found necessary on two accounts first to secure such articles of manufacture as the army wanted and next to prevent numbers under this pretext from withholding their services in the military line there being in this county morris alone between eighty and a hundred ironworks large and small doctor lees opinion on the propriety of attacking the enemy upon their first arrival under a supposition of their being raw and undisciplined is certainly well founded if our own circumstances will admit of it but the doctor little apprehended i believe that we ourselves should have an army to raise at this late hour of men equally raw and officers probably much more so please to make a tender of my compliments to your brother and other delegates from virginia i have the honor to be c      george washington    april      morristown brigadiergeneral glover to brigadiergeneral glover morristown    april      sir after the conversations i had with you before you left the army last winter i was not a little surprised at the contents of yours of the  st instant as i had not the least doubt but you would accept of the commission of brigadier if conferred upon you by congress i put your name down in the list of those whom i thought proper for the command and whom i wished to see preferred diffidence in an officer is a good mark because he will always endeavor to bring himself up to what he conceives to be the full line of his duty but i think i may tell you without flattery that i know of no man better qualified than yourself to conduct a brigade you have activity and industry and as you very well know the duty of a colonel you know how to exact that duty from others i have with great concern observed the almost universal listlessness that prevails throughout the continent and i believe that nothing has contributed to it more than the resignation of officers who stepped early forward and led the people into the great cause in which we are too deeply embarked to look back or to hope for any other terms than those we can gain by the sword can any resistance be expected from the people when deserted by their leaders our enemies count upon the resignation of every officer of rank at this time as a distrust of and desertion from the cause and rejoice   0 accordingly when you consider these matters i hope you will think no more of private inconveniences but that you will with all expedition come forward and take that command which has been assigned to you as i fully depend upon seeing you i shall not mention any thing that has passed between us upon this subject to the congress i am sir c  george washington    april      morristown james craik to doctor james craik  morristown    april      dear doctor i am going to address you on a subject which may lay some claim to your attention as i do to your candor in deciding on the proposition in the hospital department for the middle district which district includes the states between the north or hudsons     river and the potomac there are at present two places vacant either of which i can obtain for you the one is senior physician and surgeon of the hospital with the pay of four dollars and six rations per day and forage for one horse the other is assistant directorgeneral with the pay of three dollars and six rations per day and two horses and travelling expenses found according to doctor shippen the directorgenerals account who also adds that he thinks this latter the more honorable and desirable of the two had i expected that congress would proceed to the appointments in this department at the time they did i have no doubt but that it might have been in my power to get you any other place except that of directorgeneral but that is now over and the matter in which i claim your candor is that you will not let my introducing the present proposition to you have any undue influence you know the extent and profit of your present practice you know what prospects are before you you know how far you may be benefited or injured by such an appointment and you must know whether it is advisable or practicable for you to quit your family and practice at this time all these matters i am ignorant of and request as a friend that my proposing this matter to you may have no influence upon your acceptance of it i have no other end in view than to serve you consequently if you are not benefited by the appointment my end is not answered i have only to add therefore a request that you will let me know the result of your determination     by the return of the post or as soon as possible as the places will be kept vacant till i hear from you my best respects to mrs craik and your family and believe me to be with the sincerest regard and esteem dear doctor your affectionate and obedient servant  george washington    april      morristown majorgeneral lincoln to majorgeneral lincoln morristown    april      sir i am well convinced that the amazing desertions which have of late prevailed among our troops proceed entirely from their not being regularly paid for it is not to be supposed that the bare encouragement of receiving a few dollars from the enemy for their arms could operate so forcibly upon them i have in vain endeavored to make the officers bring in their payrolls and draw their money they plead in excuse that as they are so detached they cannot possibly make up regular rolls and there may be something in this but there is a cause which i fear will be found upon examination too true and that is that the officers have drawn large sums under pretence of paying their men but have been obliged from extravagance and for other purposes to appropriate this money to their own use there is a necessity at this time for the mens being paid up as nearly as possible i therefore desire that you will have the different corps under your command     paraded inquire of them what pay is due to them order the paymaster or commanding officer to draw as much as will be necessary and when it is drawn see that the soldiers have their proportion it would be well to let the soldiers know that this irregularity of pay has been owing to the hurry in which they have been detached into the field but that their wants shall be fully supplied i also desire that you will inform the officers that as soon as the regiments are drawn together i shall cause an exact scrutiny to be made into their accounts and inquire how these complaints of the soldiers arise for want of pay when large sums have been advanced for that purpose i am c  george washington    april      morristown brigadiergeneral mcdougall to brigadiergeneral mcdougall morristown    april      dear sir at three oclock this morning i received your favor of the   th the intelligence it contains is interesting and truly distressing by this time i fear the     enemy have effected their purpose and destroyed all the stores at danbury i wish those at fredericksburg may not have shared the same fate after accomplishing this enterprise it is probable they will return to their ships with expedition if they have not done it it is most devoutly to be wished that their retreat could be cut off you i am certain will act for the best and as circumstances shall point out however i am induced to believe that the ships sent up the north river have but few troops on board and the design of their being there was to amuse and call your attention with the troops to peekskill and the other posts till the detachment from the sound executed their plans or they would have disembarked at the same time and made some other different attempt under this persuasion i could wish you unless some facts within your own knowledge or which appear to be tolerably well founded from the information you have received contradict the measure to try to cut off their retreat by detaching all the force you can spare and which shall not be absolutely necessary to guard the passes in the mountains and to maintain the forts i cannot nor do i mean to prescribe any line of duty i have only mentioned my ideas of the north river shipping and the view with which they were sent and     my wishes to make the detachments from the sound pay for the enterprise if circumstances will allow it i am c  george washington    april      morristown to the president of congress morristown    april      sir i last night received the favor of your letter of the   th with the resolves to which it alludes the views of congress in sending general officers to the eastward to hasten on the troops have been long anticipated general poor is in new hampshire for the purpose general heath in massachusets bay with brigadiers nixon glover and patterson general varnum in rhode island and general parsons in connecticut—generals spencer and arnold too have been desired to attend to the business to those gentlemen i have wrote repeatedly in the most pressing terms upon the subject and i have no reason to doubt but every exertion on their part has been employed to promote the end the delay of those who have enlisted has arisen from the late period when they engaged and from their being inoculated since which could not be dispensed with without subjecting them to the calamities  ravages of the smallpox in the natural way     at three oclock this morning i received a letter from general mcdougall enclosing three from colonel huntington copies of the whole of which i have transmitted by these you will perceive the impression which a part of general howes army has made into connecticut and the prospect they had of destroying such of our stores as were deposited in danbury which unfortunately were but too large and considerable if the event has taken place a circumstance perhaps more to be regretted is that the enemy marched through a strong and rough country and were near that place without the smallest opposition i have no other information upon the subject than what these papers contain but we have little ground to expect that they have not accomplished their purpose further intelligence will be probably received today or tomorrow when i shall be happy to hear that they have paid for their enterprise of this i confess however i am not very sanguine in my expectations      this post had been considered as a proper depository for stores by gentlemen acquainted with it and its security not thought questionable whilst troops were passing through it i had also directed that as many of the drafts in connecticut as the place was capable of accommodating should be collected there and inoculated to answer the purpose of a guard     hoping by the time of their recovery that the situation of the army would be such as to admit a strong one to be stationed there and continued but unhappily for us such languor and supineness prevails everywhere that we seem unable to effect any point we wish though never so important and interesting so early as the  th of march i wrote governor trumbull earnestly requesting two thousand militia to be sent to general mcdougall to be employed at peekskill and on the communication in westchester county for six weeks with this requisition he most readily complied so far as his orders were necessary and i am certain his influence would extend this i have repeated and this supply he has exerted himself to furnish yet so ineffectual have his endeavors been that not more than eight hundred had come out by general mcdougalls return on the   th instant nor did he expect more from the accounts he had in a word sir no expedient or pains have been unattempted by me to bring on troops and to keep our affairs on a favorable footing i would again mention the case of our prisoners with the enemy and pray that the secret committee would send to mr boudinot supplies of money for them as early as possible they are in great distress and many officers have lately escaped contrary to the tenor of their parole some of whom are now here urging that necessity compelled them to the measure i have the honor to be c      george washington  0 april      morristown alexander spotswood to colonel alexander spotswood morristown  0 april      sir i want to form a company for my guard in doing this i wish to be extremely cautious because it is more than probable that in the course of the campaign my baggage papers and other matters of great public import may be committed to the sole care of these men this being premised in order to impress you with proper attention in the choice i have to request that you will immediately furnish me with four men of your regiment and as it is my farther wish that this company should look well and be nearly of a size i desire that none of the men may exceed in stature five feet ten inches nor fall short of five feet nine inches sober young active and well made when i recommend care in yr choice i would be understood to mean men of good character in the regiment that possess the pride of appearing clean and soldierlike i am satisfied there can be no absolute security for the fidelity of this class of people but yet i think it most likely to be found in those who have family connexions in the country you will therefore send me none but natives and men of some property if you have them i must insist that in making this choice you give no intimation of my preference of natives as i do not want to create any invidious distinction between them and the foreigners i am yours c    0 george washington   may      morristown to the president of congress morristown   may      sir i was this morning honored with your letter of the  d instant with its enclosures general arnolds promotion gives me much pleasure he has certainly discovered in every instance where he has had an opportunity much bravery activity and enterprise but what will be done about his rank he will not act most probably under those he commanded but a few weeks ago  by major troup one of general gatess aids and who left albany on tuesday last i am informed the accounts of general carletons approach towards ticonderoga were premature he says general gates received a letter before he came away from brigadiergeneral wayne of the   th ultimo in which he mentioned nothing of it that three thousand troops had arrived there all in high spirits and health except nine and that that post could never be carried without the loss of much blood the proceedings of congress and your letter of the   th ultimo were the first and only information i had of mr carletons being on the lake     having heard nothing upon the subject from general gates or any other person in my last i mentioned that sixteen dollars bounty was given by general howe to deserters with arms i have reason to believe from information received since and which seems to be generally credited that he has advanced the bounty to twentyfour dollars it is much to be wished that our printers were more discreet in many of their publications we see almost in every paper proclamations or accounts transmitted by the enemy of an injurious nature if some hint or caution could be given to them on the subject it might be of material service by a person who has just arrived here it is reported that general wooster is dead of his wounds i would mention to congress that in a day or two our military chest will be exhausted i beg that a supply may be forwarded as soon as possible if there should be a failure we shall have many things to apprehend i have the honor to be c p s i have inclosed a list of stores lost at danbury you will also receive a new york paper by which you will see the enemys account of that affair  how little they have regarded a true state we are told certainly they had    men killed  from the accounts that have been received i think it may be fairly concluded that their loss was much more considerable than they make it      george washington   may      morristown brigadiergeneral mcdougall to brigadiergeneral mcdougall morristown   may      dear sir the imperfect state of the fortifications of fort montgomery gives me great uneasiness because i think from a concurrence of circumstances that it begins to look as if the enemy intended to turn their view towards the north river instead of the delaware i therefore desire that general george clinton and yourself will fall upon every measure to put the fortifications in such a state that they may at least resist a sudden attack and keep the enemy employed till reinforcements may arrive if the north river is their object they cannot accomplish it unless they withdraw their forces from jersey and that they cannot do unknown to us your present force is fully sufficient to oppose any body of men that can be sent against you previous to the calling the detachments from jersey and rhode island as congress have lately appointed general arnold to the rank of majorgeneral i have written to him and desired him to come immediately forward to peekskill not but that i place entire confidence in you and should not have thought of superseding you but upon your own request i think you will find him a man of judgment and particularly serviceable in giving directions for the armament of the galleys or making any kind of water opposition by what rule or by what right the state of massachusetts undertook to make their soldiers pay for the public arms i cannot conceive to give the soldier     the least pretence to a property in his arms except so far as to pay for them if he lost or destroyed them was what i had been laboring to put a stop to and to admit this would be to put things upon the same bad footing on which they had been i therefore desire that all the arms and accoutrements without exception may be branded and if any thing has been stopped from the soldiers for their arms i will order it to be returned i look upon the several pieces of intelligence communicated by general arnold of the intentions of the enemy as mere report or only thrown out to amuse for you may be assured that when they mean to move in earnest it will not be in detachments as generals arnold and parsons may not be at new haven for which place their letters are directed i beg you will send them on by a person who will see to the delivery of them as they are of consequence i am c      george washington    may      morristown governor trumbull to governor trumbull morristown    may      sir i was yesterday evening honored with your letter of the  th inst i regret our loss of stores at danbury and the misfortunes of our brave men who fell and of those who were wounded however from these latter events we derive this consolation that the sentiments of the people are still powerfully directed     to liberty and that no impression of the enemy be it ever so sudden and unexpected will pass with impunity we cannot ascertain what the enemys loss was but from our own when our men fought in parties and theirs in a compact body and other circumstances of information from new york i think it must have been pretty considerable another happy consequence which must necessarily result from this affair is that the enemy will engage in such enterprises in future with much caution and circumspection for though they should be able to accomplish their end in destroying stores yet the means attending it will be disagreeable that the enemy will harass our coasts and injure the maritime towns with their shipping and by sudden debarkations of small parties of men is not improbable and what we cannot prevent whilst they have the entire command of the water this we laid our account in when we first engaged in the contest but i have no idea that they will penetrate into your state to form the junction you mention nor is it likely that those who have escaped from them know the generals design it is much to be wished that they would make that their plan of war i should then expect most sanguinely that we should bring the matter to a speedy and glorious conclusion i should be happy were it in my power to station guards of continental troops at every place subject to the depredations of the enemy but this cannot be done if we divide and detach our forces to every part where the enemy may possibly attempt     an impression we shall effect no one good purpose in the end destroy ourselves and subjugate our country the enemy have certainly some capital object in view either philadelphia or hudsons river till their designs are unfolded all the troops from this and the more southern states must assemble in this quarter to prevent their possessing the former those raised in the eastern states except such as were ordered immediately to ticonderoga must march to peekskill to prevent them from possessing the latter and the important passes through the highlands should they be able to carry those and the fortifications for the defence of the river we all know the important and fatal consequences that would follow i confess myself and so do all who have reasoned about their operations that the latter from its importance and a variety of circumstances which have occurred of late seems to be the object of their attention for these reasons and because the battalions which are in service from inoculation that languor which has but too generally prevailed in enlisting and from other causes are extremely weak and deficient and totally inadequate to check the progress of the enemy i cannot comply with your request for two regiments to remain in the state at this time i heartily wish congress would inform me of the dispositions they make of the troops their not doing it disconcerts my arrangements and involves me in difficulties till the favor of your letter i never had the least intimation that i recollect that any of the regiments exacted from the states     were to remain in them nor do i know an instance whose continental troops are stationed in any state where the enemy have not a post i have the honor to be c  george washington    may      morristown majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene instructions morristown    may      in your ride to and from peekskill i would have you make the best observations that time and circumstances will admit upon the country and point out at your return such places for posts of communication as you shall conceive necessary determine upon the propriety of having a post at pompton examine the works throwing up at that place and give such directions to general heard or the officer commanding the militia there respecting them as shall appear to you proper     after examining the state and condition of the forts in the highlands especially fort montgomery the probability of an attack by water and the practicability of approaching them by land after seeing where and how this is to be effected viewing the eminences from whence these forts can be annoyed and hearing the sentiments of the general officers present you will give such orders for further defence as shall appear to you necessary for the greater security of the passes by land and water through the highlands and moreover dispose of the troops in such a manner as you shall judge most likely to answer the end in view the pass through the highlands on the west side of the north river should also be attended to lest the enemy by a coup de main should possess themselves of it before a sufficient force can be assembled to oppose them this however may be the work of militia if to be had if not the detachments of eastern troops under colonels butler and olney upon giving me notice shall be sent thither turn your attention also to the boats and direct them to be removed to the place or places of greatest safety and where they can be had for the transportation of our troops over the north river if occasion should require it examine into the state of the military stores and stock of provisions at the forts and direct a sufficiency having an eye to circumstances for if the works are not tenable or the passage of the river defensible a large stock of either would only add to our losses if they are supplies can easily be brought to them if the enemy can be kept below the highlands and carleton from our backs inquire what has been or can be done towards removing the stores from derby and other places to the west side of the north river and learn if possible how the country on this side is stored with provisions and forage for the support of troops if any should be marched thither keep the precise time of your return secret lest the disaffected should avail themselves of the knowledge to offer you an insult i am dear sir c      george washington    may      morristown to the president of congress morristown    may      sir i was this morning honored by your letter of the  0th inst accompanied by the proceedings of congress of the day before the conduct of too many officers in withholding the pay of their soldiers i am persuaded is reprehensible and has been the cause of uneasiness  of many desertions every measure in my power will be exerted to prevent such abuses in future and every aid given to punish the offenders in an exemplary manner but congress will excuse me when i tell them it will be impossible to comply with their recommendation upon this subject unless the genl officers withdraw their attention from matters of the   0 utmost importance and such as require their constant use were this not the case the dispersed situation of the officers at this time thro the different states on the recruiting service would prohibit the enquiry nor do i apprehend the regulations empowering  enjoining the regimental paymasters to bring them to an account will be found competent to the end such officers will be proper to state the accounts in the first instance  to receive vouchers c but will not do to settle them finally as their connections with the regiment will subject them much to the influence of the officers i should suppose if two or three gentlemen of integrity and of ability in accounts were appointed auditors to attend the army till the business is finished it would be the best expedient that could be fallen on they would be a check on the paymasters and i am persuaded will be the means of the accounts being fairly and justly liquidated if a settlement can be once obtained i trust the same confusion will never take place again as the paymasters will receive and pay all money due to the regiments and account for it and as the army is on a more permanent footing than it ever was before for this like most other inconveniences and difficulties which we have experienced is to be imputed in a great measure to short inlistments and the frequent dissolution of our troops a return of the army in jersey as late as the  th instant—i transmitted yesterday morning in a letter by mr randolph of chestnut street which you will     probably receive today and from which congress will be able to determine the expediency of calling out the militia from delaware and pennsylvania tho it gives me pain that we should be under the necessity of recurring to such a measure yet i should suppose it to be adviseable our army is weak and by no means equal to that of the enemy and till their designs are known and we are more reinforced with regular troops we should be prepared in the best manner we can i would observe if the militia are called out it should be for a fixed determinate time for tho they will certainly return when that expired yet that is more tolerable than for them to go off in parties every day as their whim and caprice suggest which has always been the case when the time was not stated i would also observe if it is possible they should be engaged to march out of their state if they are ordered if their service is located they will move with great reluctance if they do at all on saturday a smart skirmish happened with a detachment of our troops who attacked a number of the enemy near piscataway in which our men behaved well and obliged the enemy to give way twice as reported to me with loss the enemy receiving a strong reinforcement our people retreated to their post i cannot give the particulars as they have not been sufficiently ascertained their pickets were also attacked yesterday by some of our parties from bound brook and forced within their lines     george washington    may      morristown to the president of congress morristown    may      sir this will be delivered you by general arnold who arrived here today on his way to philadelphia he seems to be anxious to settle his public accounts which are of considerable amount and waits on congress hoping they will appoint a committee of their body or of such gentlemen as they shall judge proper to take the matter into consideration this he considers the more necessary as he has heard some reports have been propagated injurious to his character as a man of integrity if any such aspersions lie against him it is but reasonable that he should have an opportunity of vindicating himself and evincing his innocence i find he does not consider the promotion congress have been pleased to confer upon him sufficient to obviate the neglect arising from their having omitted him in their late appointments of majorgenerals he observes it does not give him the rank he had a claim to from seniority in the line of brigadiers and that he is subject to be commanded by those who had been inferior to him he further adds that congress in their last resolve respecting him have acknowledged him competent to the station of majorgeneral and therefore have done away every objection implied by their former omission these considerations are not without their weight though i pretend not to judge what motives may have influenced the conduct of congress upon this occasion it is needless to say any thing of this gentlemans     military character it is universally known that he has always distinguished himself as a judicious brave officer of great activity enterprise and perseverance i have the honor to be c  george washington    may      monsieur malmedy to monsieur malmedy  headquarters    may      sir in answer to your letter of the   th i must freely confess that i do not fully comprehend your meaning     nor can i forbear expressing my surprise that you still hold out the idea of difficulties in your situation notwithstanding the mark of attention you mention which has been lately conferred upon you by congress it astonishes me that a gentleman of your discernment should find it impossible to make a right distinction between continental and state appointments after all the pains that have been taken to explain it certainly there is nothing easier to conceive than that an appointment made by the legislature of a particular state unauthorized by congress can have no effect out of that state the reason is plain such legislature has only a local jurisdiction and can do no act binding on any other state much less on the whole continent your rank of brigadier in rhode island on a continental scale is and always has been entirely nugatory you might request a ratification of it from congress as a matter of favor but you could not demand it as a     matter of right and you must be sensible that many substantial reasons independent of any personal objections to you oppose your wish a perseverance in your mistaken pretensions after you had seen they could not be complied with is what i did not expect to request to be employed in a manner not derogatory to the rank you held in rhode island according to your ideas of that rank is to request not to be employed at all i must repeat what i have before told you that i cannot consider you in any other light than that in which congress has placed you and whatever employment i may at any time have it in power to give you must be in conformity to that precise rank you actually possess in the continental army if you expect any other you deceive yourself such an employment though it may appear to you a degradation would not in fact be so because your appointment of brigadier is a perfect nonentity in a continental view if you formed erroneous notions of your state appointment and in consequence of them made representations to your friends in europe which now involve you in perplexities you ought to consider it as your misfortune and should not build any claims upon it that cannot be admitted but though the distinctions existing among us may not be well understood in france as you have hinted in a former letter is it impossible to give a satisfactory explanation of them to your friends or will it be any indelible disgrace to you to confess to them that you have been in an error in your first conceptions arising     from your being a stranger and unacquainted with the nature of our different military establishments we ought not to convert trifling difficulties into insuperable obstacles let me propose a few more questions appeal to your own understanding and conscience and then answer is not the continental rank which you now hold fully adequate to any expectations you can reasonably deduce from the rank you held in the french army and for the short term of seven months service in ours would not the american officers who have been in the service from the beginning of the war have a just cause to complain of your too rapid promotion were your wishes indulged and would it not justify those who have been your superior officers in your own country in raising their hopes to a height which it would be impossible to gratify in short sir i cannot bring myself to think that the extraordinary mark of distinction bestowed upon you by the state of rhode island is any sufficient foundation for expecting the continent to waive every consideration of policy or propriety in your behalf though i wish not to offend or wound yet justice both to you and myself requires that i should plainly inform you that your scruples and difficulties so often reiterated and under a variety of shapes are exceedingly perplexing to me and that i wish them to cease i am sir c      george washington    may      morristown to the president of congress morristown    may      sir your letter of the   th i had the honor to receive last night at eleven oclock the commission enclosed for monsieur armand i shall deliver to him as soon as i see him  agreeable to your request i will give commissions to the brigadiers and will ascertain their rank by their original commissions when i obtain     them the inquiry directed respecting major campbell shall be made and that be done which shall appear right i fear it will be hardly possible to satisfy the views and claims of some of the french gentlemen the late promotion of monsieur malmedy though highly honorable and such as should be considered fully if not more than adequate to his pretensions taken upon any principle does not come up to his demands he arrived here yesterday morning and has been writing to me upon the subject from the high marks of distinction but too readily conferred upon these men in many instances they seem to have lost sight of what is just and reasonable it would have been happy for us particularly for me and for the gentlemen themselves if a too easy grant of favors had not induced them to contemn all rank in our army under that of fieldofficers nor is it in my power to give commands to every appointment i shall inform monsieur armand and reconcile him to it in the best manner i can that there is no vacancy for him at present and i would beg leave to suggest that where promotions are made in future from political and honorary motives it would be well for congress to explain to the gentlemen that it may be some time before they can be put in actual command this might prevent their entertaining suspicions of neglect on my part which the situation of the army will not allow me to obviate there is no vacancy for monsieur malmedy of the rank he now holds unless the merits of many other officers who have     served with reputation and much longer here are to be overlooked to make way for him such a measure will neither be practicable nor prudent to attempt by a letter from general heard who is at pompton i am informed that colonels barton and buskirk with three hundred tory levies from bergen on the morning of the   th attempted to surprise and cut off about seventy of his militia stationed at paramus the officer happily had notice of their design and eluded it by moving his post it happened that the morning was foggy and the enemy entering at different places their parties engaged general heard says their loss could not be ascertained but from reports of the inhabitants ten of their men were killed and carried away at one time and several wounded i have the honor c  george washington    may      morristown richard henry lee to richard henry lee morristown    may      dear sir under the privilege of friendship i take the liberty to ask you what congress expect i am to do with the many foreigners they have at different times promoted to the rank of fieldofficers and by the last resolve two to that of colonels in making these appointments it is much to be feared that all the attending circumstances are not taken into consideration to oblige the adventurers of a nation which we want to interest in our cause may be one inducement   0 and to get rid of their importunity another but this is viewing the matter by halves or on one side only these men have no attachment nor ties to the country further than interest binds them they have no influence and are ignorant of the language they are to receive and give orders in consequently great trouble or much confusion must follow but this is not the worst they have not the smallest chance to recruit others and our officers think it exceedingly hard after they have toiled in this service and probably have sustained many losses to have strangers put over them whose merit perhaps is not equal to their own but whose effrontery will take no denial the management of this matter give me leave to add sir is a delicate point for although no one will dispute the right of congress to make appointments every person will assume the privilege of judging of the propriety of them and good policy in my opinion forbids the disgusting of a whole corps to gratify the pride of an individual for it is by the zeal and activity of our own people that the cause must be supported and not by a few hungry adventurers besides the error of these appointments is now clear and manifest and the views of congress evidently defeated for by giving high rank to people of no reputation or service you have disgusted their own countrymen or in other words raised their expectations to an insatiable pitch for the man who was a captain in france finding another who was only a subaltern there or perhaps nothing appointed to a majority with us extends his views instantly to a regiment in like manner the fieldofficer     can accept of nothing less than a brigade and so on by which means the man of real rank and merit must be excluded or perhaps your whole military system disordered in the mean while i am haunted and teased to death by the importunity of some and dissatisfaction of others my ideas in this representation do not extend to artillery officers and engineers the first of these will be useful if they do not break in upon the arrangement of that corps already established by order of congress the second are absolutely necessary and not to be had here but proper precaution should be observed in the choice of them for we have at present in pay and high rank two frenchmen who in my judgment know nothing of the duty of engineers gentlemen of this profession ought to produce sufficient and authentic testimonials of their skill and knowledge and not expect that a pompous narrative of services and loss of papers the usual excuse can be a proper introduction into our army the freedom with which i have delivered my sentiments on this subject will i am persuaded meet your excuse when i assure you that i have nothing else in view than the good of the service i am dear sir c george washington    may      governor henry to governor henry    may      sir when i had the honor of addressing you on the   th ulto i flattered myself that tho the recruiting business did not succeed to our wishes a sufficient reinforcement     would ere this have enabled me to open the campaign in such a manner as to have recommended the service to the lower class of people and thereby to have removed the necessity of compelling them to inlist but that hope has been unfortunately blasted so that we have only to decide whether the states shall be loaded with the enormous expence of militia with difficulty drawn out capable only of making a feeble defence and the war protracted or the army completed by coercive methods for altho the important season is almost past that afforded the opportunity of crushing the enemys power at present here had i been sufficiently enabled yet it greatly behoves us by an instant and vigorous exertion of our strength to put ourselves into such a situation as to have a good prospect of never being obliged so greatly to hazard our liberties as we have been the warmest advocates for militia and short inlistments must from the experience of two campaigns confess that the important purposes of war cannot be answered but by men engaged for a length of time no substitute can be admitted what then remains for us to do nothing less than furnishing our full quota of continental troops by any means that will ensure success our situation is perhaps more critical now than ever policy directs that caution should be used in the choice but whether it should be by an indiscriminate draft or by making it the interest of the timid the rich and the tory to furnish soldiers at their own expence in ease of themselves and in conformity to the resolve     of congress of the   th day of april last is a subject well worthy the most dispassionate and mature deliberation of your assembly both of these methods have been tried and are still practiced by some of the states with better success than simple recruiting they are however capable of abuse the former may produce convulsions in the people and their opposition by the manner in which it is conducted the latter affords the bad officer too tempting an opportunity of defrauding the public by receiving the reward for men already in the service or for some private emolument giving certificates when no soldier is furnished and of greatly injuring the service by introducing into it foreigners of no principle who seize the first opportunity of deserting to the enemy with their arms if the former should be adopted the men drafted should serve for a fixed time   years at least and every possible precaution taken against their substituting convicts or foreign servants in their room if the latter the men procured should serve during the war here the evils may be effectually guarded the substitute or exemption from militia duty being evidently an indulgence may be granted on no other terms than furnishing a native or a person of some property or connections in the country—the annexed return of your battalions now here will enable the assembly to form a good judgment of the number of men necessary to complete them to the full establishment a well executed law to encourage the taking up of deserters will greatly lessen the deficiency that     appears upon the returns which is not occasioned altogether by deaths because i am well assured that a number of the men taking advantage of their absence from their companies occasioned by their being left in hospitals have upon recovering gone home without leave nor can my most unceasing efforts bring them back the officers sent upon that duty shamefully spending their time in dissipation and idleness i hope the freedom of this letter will find an excuse in the importance of the subject and its length have an apology when tis considered that consequences of the greatest magnitude are involved in the issue of the present contest the management of which demands our utmost wisdom and activity i have c george washington    may      morristown brigadiergeneral parsons to brigadiergeneral parsons morristown    may      dear sir i was favored yesterday with your letter of the   th instant i wrote to governor trumbull fully and informed him that no part of the troops exacted from the state could remain there this letter i presume has reached the governor and i trust the observations contained in it would satisfy him of the necessity of drawing the whole troops together i think with you that the enemy will make no impressions into connecticut if they attempt any thing of the sort it will be to call our attention from more     important objects it is much to be wished that they would prosecute the war on a partisan or detached plan nothing could more certainly ensure their destruction the troops as fast as they are raised and their recovery from the smallpox will admit must come on to peekskill i am sorry the expedient adopted by the governor and council for filling their quota of men has not been attended with all the advantages expected from it  i wish their next attempt may have more happy consequences i am persuaded your remaining in the state some time longer would be of service yet as i consider the defence of the fortifications and passes through the highlands an object of the last importance and possessing them most probably to form the chief end of the enemys counsels and immediate operations i wish you to come to peekskill and there continue with the troops till some further disposition shall become necessary or may be ordered at the same time i would wish you to fix upon and leave behind a sufficient number of proper officers to collect and hasten on the recruits as fast as they are raised and gone through inoculation perhaps more than one may be necessary and i have no doubt you will choose for this purpose such as will be of great activity and industry and in whose conduct the most implicit confidence may be reposed     how far the expedition to long island would be practicable supposing our army was full i cannot determine in our present situation we have no men to spare for the purpose further i am by no means satisfied that the rules of war would justify our detaching a force to recover our prisoners under the present circumstances i rather think they would not but without going into a full discussion of the measure either upon the principles of war or justice i am certain that policy strongly forbids the attempt success in such case would lead to unhappy consequences no future prisoners in the hands of the enemy would receive the same favorable indulgence so essential to their health and comfort and it would authorize their imposing on them a more close and severe confinement you are not to infer from hence that i esteem the recovery of prisoners unjustifiable in all cases or have any doubts respecting the propriety of it  i am c george washington    may      morristown majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates morristown    may      sir i cannot help taking notice of some expressions in your letters which appear to me like an imputation of partiality in favor of this army to the disadvantage and inconvenience of the northern army can you     suppose if there had been an ample supply of tents for the whole army that i would have hesitated one moment in complying with your demand i told major troup exactly what i repeated in mine of the   th that on account of our loss at danbury there would be a scarcity of tents that our army would be a moving one and that consequently nothing but tents could serve our turn and that therefore as there was the greatest probability of your being stationary you should endeavor to cover your troops with barracks and huts certainly this was not a refusal of tents but a request that you should in our contracted situation make every shift in your power to do without them or at least with as few as possible the northern army is and ever has been as much the object of my care and attention as the one immediately under my command and i cannot recollect that i ever omitted complying with the requests or supplying the wants of the commander in that department when it lay in my power as the returns of military stores of all kinds come before me and as the direction and distribution of them are entrusted to me by congress i have endeavored to apply them in such manner as would render most effectual service to the public cause without suffering partiality for either department to have the least influence upon me i will make particular inquiry of the quartermastergeneral concerning his prospect and expectations as to the article of tents and if as i said before there appears a sufficiency for the whole     army you shall most willingly have your share but if there is not surely that army whose movement is uncertain must give up its claims for the present to that which must inevitably take the field the moment the weather will admit and must continue in it the whole campaign i am sir c george washington    may      morristown brigadiergeneral mcdougall to brigadiergeneral mcdougall morristown    may      dear sir i had yesterday the pleasure of yours of the   st instant i wish every officer in the army could appeal to his own heart and find the same principles of conduct that i am persuaded actuate you we should experience more consistency zeal and steadiness than we now do in but too many instances a disinterested attachment to the cause which we are engaged in can alone produce a line of behavior in every circumstance equal to the importance of it i perfectly agree with you in the impropriety of that diversity in the modes of training our regiments which has prevailed hitherto i have it in contemplation very soon to digest and establish a regular system of discipline manœuvres evolutions and regulations for guards to be observed throughout the army in the mean time i should be glad if you would introduce uniformity among those under your command and i would recommend to you to be particularly attentive to having them instructed in the proper use of their feet so as to     enable them to perform the necessary movements in marching and forming with ease order agility and expedition good consequences would undoubtedly result from accustoming the men to the noise of firing and to the habit of taking aim at an object you may therefore bestow a little ammunition on this purpose having regard to the quantity of this article among us of late several of our officers have broken their paroles and stolen away this practice ignominious to themselves dishonorable to the service and injurious to the officers of sentiment and delicacy who remain behind to experience the rigors of resentment and distrust on their account cannot be tolerated whatever be the pretence i have made a point of sending those back that have come under my observation and i must desire you will do the same towards those who fall under yours the reason commonly assigned for this breach of faith is the want of money and necessaries i regret that this plea is too well founded but i hope it will not continue to be so as effectual measures are taking to provide for the wants of our prisoners i am with esteem dear sir c george washington    may      morris town james warren to james warren headquarters morris town    may      dear sir your favor of the  th instant was duly handed me—i am fully sensible of the zeal your state has demonstrated in the instances you recite and in many   0 more with you i consider them as great exertions and as decisive evidence of your inclination to do every thing in your power to advance the common cause at the same time whatever efforts have been or can be made are not more than adequate to the exigency of the situation though over sanguine and uninformed people may think differently—this is a most interesting and critical period and will not countenance the least want of activity or attention in any quarter i have the highest confidence that your state will not let the great object we are contending for be lost or endangered more than is unavoidable by any such deficiency on their part your repealing the offensive part of the act you mention is a proof of your justice and regard to the sense of your sisterstates it certainly bore the features of a monopoly and was liable to the interpretation put upon it and though i am ready to believe it proceeded from impolitic rather than selfish motives—i am happy the cause of complaint is removed and the matter placed upon a more liberal footing i observe your state is not a little alarmed at the prospect of an immediate invasion notwithstanding the intelligence from europe in some measure warrants the supposition of such an event and makes it proper not intirely to disregard it—yet i am clearly of opinion it is not much to be apprehended it is by no means an eligible way to the conquest of this country—your state from its union numbers and situation being capable of a much better defence than     perhaps any other and it is presumable that the enemy will make their attacks where circumstances promise the greatest likelihood of success but be this as it may i cannot help disapproving the project of raising colonial regiments for your defence at least till the continental troops are raised it is easy to percieve as you have yourself hinted that it will have a direct tendency to defeat your endeavors for completing your quota of the united army—and it would be the most wretched policy to weaken the hands of the continent under the mistaken idea of strengthening your own it would also be well to consider how far it might be consistent with propriety in the pursuit of partial schemes to put it out of your own power to fulfil what is required of you by the continent if the several states by levying troops on the particular establishment of each leave but a small continental army in the field it will be impossible to effectually watch the motions of the enemy and oppose them where they may in reality direct their operations—the consequences of which must undoubtedly be fatal—but if we have a sufficient continental force on foot we shall be able to watch them narrowly and counteract them wherever they may attempt to move—every state will find its security in such an army whose sole business it will be to oppose the enemy where it is most requisite—it cannot be imagined that if your state were seriously attacked a proportionate part of the continental force would not be detailed to succor and protect it—my duty     inclination and a regard for the safety of the whole would equally compel me to it what valuable end can then be answered to you from the step you propose to take which can compensate for the irretrievable injury the common cause might sustain from our not having a sufficient army in the field for the purposes of general opposition—the measure injurious in every way can only serve to burthen the state with an unnecessary expence which will be intirely its own as the troops intended to be raised will be for local and colonial ends and no diminution of the common force i see no advantage you can derive from such an impolitic step which would not be fully produced by what i assured the assembly on a former occasion should be done which is—that the supernumerary regiments adopted by you should remain in your state till the designs of the enemy became so evident as to convince us their continuance would be no longer expedient or useful this assurance i repeat and i beg you will communicate it in my name to them—earnestly recommending it to them to relinquish the scheme—indeed sir on a cool dispassionate survey of all circumstances it will be found replete with impolicy and danger and i am persuaded that either they have already on mature deliberation laid it aside or on a reconsideration of the matter will coincide with me in opinion and correct the mistake with great regard and respect i am c      george washington    may      morris town governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters morris town    may      sir— i was yesterday honored with your letter of the   th instant as i could only repeat the observations contained in my letter of the   th upon your request for two regiments to remain in connecticut i must beg leave to refer your attention to them and to a few more which i shall now subjoin if the several battalions designed to compose the army were complete i should then hope a few troops might be spared to guard those places most accessible to parties of the enemy and their cruisers but as their state is very different it cannot be done unless we endanger objects of the last importance to us  i shall not trouble you with a minute detail of the forces assembled at this time from the different states by the last return from peekskill on the  0th not more than     three hundred and thirty continental troops were there then in addition to these there is a detachment here under lieutenant colonel butler consisting of about—men i will not comment upon this subject because i know it will not give you less pain than it does myself and my only design in mentioning it is to show i have but too just grounds for my anxiety and desire that troops should come on i wish those assembled as yet from some other states did not bear a proportion too analogous to this when those from massachusetts connecticut and rhode island do arrive my present intention is to post a respectable number about the white plains to act as an army or detachment of observation etc and from which your state as far as i am able to judge will be more likely to be protected against any capital attempts of the enemy than any other it will be impossible to secure every place against their small marauding plundering parties but nothing will be so probable to effect it as our drawing our strength to a point which will oblige them to do the same if we divide and act in detachments so will they i am extremely sorry you should have been at so much trouble and expense in sending to colonel langdon for part of the military stores in his hands his refusal and that of general heath i am pursuaded you will consider right and founded in necessity upon mature reflection all the stores are coming to springfield where they will be deposited in the public magazine except such as will be immediately wanted for the army and i feel myself extremely unhappy in not having it in my power to consent     that a part should be appropriated as you request our stores will by no means authorize me to do otherwise than to keep them for the forming army were they once let out how could i collect them or how could i be answerable for them to the states at large they are not more than equal to our certain demands and in respect to artillery the quantity imported and fit for the field is far inferior to that we are to oppose and what we want i have with pain been obliged to refuse other requisitions of the same nature and am concerned i should have been laid under the necessity when the expediency of preventing the stores being scattered throughout the states required it i am much obliged by the copy of the act you were pleased to transmit me and i only hope its effects may be equal to your wishes i have nothing of importance to communicate in the military line here i am told from the last advices from france things seem to be in a favorable train and that spain appears to be equally disposed to render us every assistance governor tryon it is reported is dead of the wound he received in the danbury expedition how far it is true i know not it is also said seventeen ships came in at sandy hook on the   d and more were in the offing i have the honor to be with great esteem and respect c      george washington    may      morristown to the president of congress morristown    may      sir i beg leave to inform congress that immediately after the receipt of their resolve of the   th of march recommending the office of adjutantgeneral to be filled by the appointment of a person of abilities and unsuspected attachment to our cause i wrote to colonel timothy pickering of salem offering him the post in the first instance and transmitting at the same time a letter for colonel william lee whom congress had been pleased to mention to be delivered to him in case my offer could not be accepted this conduct in preference of colonel pickering i was induced to adopt from the high character i had of him both as a great military genius cultivated by an industrious attention to the study of war and as a gentleman of liberal education distinguished zeal and great method and activity in business this character of him i had from gentlemen of distinction and merit and on whose judgment i could rely when my letter reached colonel pickering at first view he thought his situation in respect to public affairs would not permit him to accept the post that for colonel lee he sent immediately to him who in consequence of it repaired to headquarters by colonel lee i received a letter from colonel pickering stating more particularly the causes which prevented his accepting the office when it was offered and assuring me that he would in a little time accommodate his affairs in such a manner as to come into any military     post in which he might be serviceable and thought equal to here i am to mark with peculiar satisfaction in justice to colonel lee who has deservedly acquired the reputation of a good officer that he expressed a distrust of his abilities to fill the appointment intended for him and on hearing that colonel pickering would accept it he not only offered but wished to relinquish his claim to it in favor of him whom he declared he considered from a very intimate and friendly acquaintance as a firstrate military character and that he knew no gentleman better or so well qualified for the post among us matters being thus circumstanced and colonel lee pleased with the command he was in i wrote to colonel pickering on his return who accepted the office and is daily expected in this business i beg congress to be assured though colonel lee was postponed in the first instance their recommendation had its due weight and that no motive other than a regard to the service induced me to prefer colonel pickering his acknowledged abilities and equal zeal without derogating from the merits of colonel lee who holds a high place in my esteem gave him a preference and i flatter myself the cause will be promoted in his appointment especially as we shall have two good officers in lieu of one who i am persuaded will do honor to themselves in the line in which they move considering the passes through the highlands of the utmost importance to secure i sent generals greene and knox about a fortnight ago to see what     had been done for their defence and to consult with the general officers they should meet upon such further measures as might be deemed necessary for their greater safety the enclosed copy of their report will fully convey their sentiments upon the subject to which i beg leave to refer congress i have sent general putnam to command in that quarter and have instructed him to use every possible means in his power for expediting and effecting the works and obstructions mentioned in the report fearing that the cables might not be procured in time i have directed his particular and immediate attention to fixing the boom however as the cables would render that more secure and will be extremely serviceable in the opinion of the officers if they are to be had in philadelphia i would advise congress to order them to be purchased and forwarded without loss of time they cannot be got elsewhere they must be proportioned to the width of the river which is about five hundred and forty yards and as they will be of most use if diagonally laid the gentlemen think they should not be less than four hundred and fifty fathoms long and the largest size that can be had unless they are large and substantial they will answer no purpose and will not sustain their weight when stretched i should be glad to know whether it be the intention of congress that one of the already appointed general officers may be assigned to the command of the light horse or whether they have in contemplation the appointing of one for this purpose—if the     first i shall immediately name one to that duty if the second they will be pleased to choose one as it is time we should have our arrangements compleat  i have nothing of importance to communicate unless it is that seventeen ships are said to have arrived at new york on the   d and that others were in the offing a report has also prevailed and has come thro two or three channels that govr tryon that was is dead of the wound he received in the danbury expedition  one account is that lieut colo walcot fell in the engagement at ridgefield i dont know how far the facts are to be depended on it seems certain that mr tryon was wounded i have the honor c p s as i dont know what particular purposes congress had in view when they ordered col harrisons regiment of artillery to be raised i dont think myself at liberty to give any directions about it but if they have no certain employment for it in view i could wish them to order the whole or such part of it as they shall judge proper to join this army as we   0 are in great want of more artillerymen than we have—it will not be necessary that the artillery should come george washington    may      morristown majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam morristown    may      dear sir would it be practicable do you think under the present circumstances and situation of the troops at peekskill to surprise the enemy at kingsbridge it must be effected by surprise or not at all and must be undertaken by water which would also prove abortive if the enemy have vessels of any kind above fort washington the undigested ideas which i have entertained of the matter are these to embark a number of troops supposed adequate to the enterprise in boats under pretence of transporting them and their baggage to tappan as a more easy and expeditious method of joining the army under my immediate command to cover this the better a number of wagons might be ordered to assemble at the landing on this side in order to receive your baggage or if it should be thought that moving a body of men so near the enemy would put them too much upon their guard could not the troops be embarked at peekskill under pretence of reinforcing the garrison on the river in order to expedite the works and actually set off as if bound thither but under cover of darkness turn and push down the river but here possibly a difficulty will arise on account of the impracticability of getting down in the night and the difficulty of being concealed in any creek or     inlet on the western shore in the day these are all matters worthy of consideration and i have nothing more in view than to lead you into a train of thinking upon the subject let the matter be communicated to generals mcdougall and george clinton for their sentiments but under strong injunctions of secrecy for it always happens that where more than two or three are apprized of an undertaking of this kind the knowledge of it always gets abroad which must inevitably defeat any measure that depends upon secrecy the place at which i should propose your landing would be in the hollow between fort washington and spiten devil it is a good landingplace and affords a good passage into the road leading from fort washington to the bridge it is very obscure and would enable you to fall in upon the back of the troops at fort independence by which the surprise would be greater and their retreat cut off thence your troops might or might not march up by land and sweep the country before them of the enemy and provisions as circumstances would justify after consulting the gentlemen before mentioned on the propriety of this measure let me know the result by a careful person and when the plan could conveniently be carried into execution  i am dear sir your most affectionate c     george washington    may      morris town governor trumbull to governor trumbull morris town    may      sir i was yesterday evening honored with your letter of the   d instant it is certainly of importance that i should have the earliest intelligence of the enemys movements and i beg leave to thank you for the information you have been pleased to transmit on that head your anxiety for troops to remain in connecticut and my inability to grant them when i examine matters upon a large and i believe just scale distress me much i assure you sir no requisition has more weight with me than yours nor will ever be more readily granted when circumstances will admit and when i think it will not in its consequences be injurious to the general good i must take the liberty of referring you to my letters of the   th and   d for my reasons why we should draw our forces to a point and which i trust upon consideration will appear good and satisfactory a capital object in the enemys plan is to divide and distract our attention for this purpose has the division under lord percy been kept so long at rhode island expecting from thence that the apprehension of an invasion or their penetrating the country would prevent any troops coming from the eastward could i but assemble all our forces our situation would be respectable and such i should hope as would compel general howe to employ his together or to hazard their destruction on the other hand     whilst the quotas from the several states are so extremely deficient should they be divided and act in detachments there will be just grounds to apprehend our ruin i have the honor to be c george washington    may      morristown majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene morristown    may      dear sir i have ordered the assistantcommissary at this place to repair immediately to camp it is the peculiar misfortune of this army to have generally speaking the heads of the different departments always absent when they are most wanted two months was i laboring as hard as a man could to get the commissarygeneral to this place and had scarcely accomplished it before the congress ordered him to philadelphia from whence i have used my utmost endeavors to bring him back but am answered that he is detained by order in the mean while the army may starve i will again send to him by express and for present supplies advise the adoption of the mode you pointed out by your taking the provision out of the country about elizabethtown newark and millstone because two ends will be answered by it on the road today i met a person who told me that he left new york on saturday noon that he was desired to let me know that a successful attack might be made upon brunswic that there were at this time a captain lieutenant and two sergeants from new york among us as spies in the habit of countrymen that     seventy sail of transports are ready as he supposes by this time for sailing that seven of them were fitted for stores and had got forage on board the rest designed for troops stores and provisions philadelphia the destination talked of that he understood some transports arrived on sunday last with troops from newport but that no other reinforcements had got in nor any vessels from europe except the seventeen provision ships we have already heard of i hope colonel dayton reported to you the suspicious person met with at bullions tavern and that you have had him under examination before this i am dear sir c george washington    may      morristown to the president of congress morristown    may      sir the enclosed is a copy of a letter received yesterday from general howe congress will perceive by referring to the copy of his letter of the   st of april transmitted in mine of the   th that he persevered in his demand for an equal number of prisoners to be returned for those sent out by him which has been the subject of controversy between us as general howe has called upon me again for my final decision upon the subject and congress are fully possessed of it having received transcripts of every paper respecting it i wish them to take the matter under their earliest consideration and to inform me as soon as they can whether the grounds on which it has been conducted by me are agreeable to their ideas and whether my     objections are or are not to be departed from the affair is particularly stated in my letter of the  th ultimo to general howe in answer to the paper addressed to me by lieutenantcolonel walcott copies of which were enclosed in my letter to the president on the  0th of the same month the dispute so far as general lee is concerned rests at present on their declaring him exchangeable as other prisoners are on the principle of equality of rank to ensure which or his safety lieutenantcolonel campbell and the hessian fieldofficers are detained the other objection to returning their prisoners is that a great proportion of those sent out by them were not fit subjects of exchange when released and were made so by the severity of their treatment and confinement and therefore a deduction should be made from the list good faith seems to require that we should return as many of theirs at least as we received effectives from them i mean such as could be considered capable of being exchanged and perhaps sound policy that the agreement subsisting for exchanges should continue on the other hand it may be said that our prisoners in general in the enemys hands at present will have greater security by our retaining them and that general howe will be less apt to relinquish any part of his claim the more the number in our hands is diminished by an exchange i confess i am under great difficulty in this business but what is more particularly the cause of this application is the latter part of the first paragraph of the enclosed copy—and for your determination     respecting the prisoners now here that i may make my arrangements accordingly this is couched in terms of great ambiguity and i am really at a loss what interpretation to give it whether he intends that his conduct respecting them shall be as i advise this appears more favorable than can well be expected or that if the previous demand is not answered in a satisfactory manner he shall consider them on a different footing from that on which our former prisoners were and the agreement totally dissolved we are told government offered the prisoners they took to the india company and they have procured an act dispensing with that of the habeas corpus in particular cases of persons supposed inimical to them how far they or their commanders may adopt these measures remains to be known i have only mentioned them as they respect the general subject of my letter  notwithstanding my recommendation agreeably to what i conceived to be the sense of congress lieutenantcolonel campbells treatment continues to be such as cannot be justified either on the principles of generosity or strict retaliation as i have authentic information and i doubt not you will have the same that general lees situation is far from     being rigorous or uncomfortable except his not being permitted to go at large on parole he has reason to be content with every other circumstance of his treatment i am just moving to boundbrook from whence i returned yesterday morning on monday morning a body of the enemy advanced near that post they retreated on seeing a detachment march to meet them there was some firing at long shot but without any great damage we had only three men slightly wounded what their loss was i know not three of their lighthorse were killed by advices from the eastward the troops are coming from rhode island i have the honor to be c  george washington    may      middlebrook brigadiergeneral parsons to brigadiergeneral parsons headquarters middlebrook    may      dear sir i was just now favored with your letter of the   th by major humphreys the intelligence communicated by it is truly interesting and agreeable and now i shall take occasion not only to give you my hearty approbation of your conduct in planning the expedition to long island but to return my sincere thanks to lieutenantcolonel meigs and to all officers and men engaged in it this enterprise so fortunate in the execution will greatly distress the enemy in the important and essential article of forage and reflects much honor on those who performed it     i shall ever be happy to reward merit when in my power and therefore wish you to inquire for a vacant ensigncy in some of the regiments for sergeant ginnings to which you will promote him advising me of the same and the time  as i could only repeat what i have said in my former letters to you and to governor trumbull on the subject     of his and the assemblys request for part of the troops to remain in connecticut it is unnecessary for me to say more respecting it than that i cannot possibly comply with it at this time the passes and fortifications in the highlands are of the last importance and every means in our power must be employed to secure them if the enemys movements which most probably will be understood in a little time should be such as to show that hudsons river is not their object and the state of the troops will admit i shall with great pleasure post a part of them about white plains and stamford and give every protection i can to connecticut consistent with the general interest but till these events take place neither prudence nor policy will justify me in sparing men you will agreeably to my request repair to peekskill after making the necessary orders about the troops i am with great esteem c george washington    may      middlebrook governor henry to governor henry headquarters middlebrook    may      sir i this morning received information which i believe is not to be doubted that on saturday last a large fleet consisting of a hundred sail left new york and stood out to sea whither they are destined or what they had on board remains to be known if possessing hudsons river should not be general howes first object i should suppose his operations will be against philadelphia and that this  00 fleet if they have troops on board are bound into the delaware bay though my opinion is as above yet i would take the liberty of suggesting that it may be expedient to put your militia upon the most respectable footing that circumstances will admit lest their destination should be more southern at the same time that i mention this i would advise that they should be immediately supplied with ammunition or that it be so deposited in the hands of the several committees or other proper persons that it may be had upon the most sudden emergency the former would be by far the most eligible mode if they would keep it for the purposes for which it was given should this fleet arrive on your coast and the enemy attempt to penetrate the country or to make incursions i would recommend that the earliest opposition be made by parties and detachments of militia without waiting to collect a large body i am convinced this would be attended with the most salutary consequences and that greater advantages would be derived from it than by deferring the opposition till you assemble a number equal to that of the enemy by pursuing this mode they will be much annoyed and will receive an early impression of the unfavorable disposition of the people towards them besides they will not have the same opportunity of establishing themselves as they otherwise would and it may be added that militia acting in large bodies for want of discipline are unwieldly difficult to conduct and less apt to render proportionate  0  services these hints i take the liberty to suggest and submit to you as worthy of attention in the course of this week eighteen transports have arrived at york with troops supposed to be foreign from their uniform whether they are immediately from germany or those who were in canada is a matter of conjecture some have imagined the latter would be called to reinforce general howe i have the honor to be c p s i must beg your attention to my letter on the subject of filling your regiments it is a matter of the last importance  their present weak state does not furnish by any means the quota assigned you i trust and am persuaded no exertions will be omitted to effect this salutary and desirable event george washington    may      middlebrook to the president of congress headquarters middlebrook    may      sir monsieur ducoudray is just arrived at camp and proposes to set out tomorrow for philadelphia what his views are i am uncertain having had no conversation with him upon the subject but i find an idea prevails that there is an agreement between mr deane and him that he shall have the chief command of the artillery how well founded this opinion may be i cannot determine but if it be true it may involve the most injurious consequences general knox who has deservedly acquired the character of one of the most valuable officers in the service and who  0  combating almost innumerable difficulties in the department he fills has placed the artillery upon a footing that does him the greatest honor he i am persuaded would consider himself injured by an appointment superseding his command and would not think himself at liberty to continue in the service should such an event take place in the present state of things there would be too much reason to apprehend a train of ills such as might convulse and unhinge this important department supposing monsieur ducoudray to have made such an agreement the case is of great difficulty and in my opinion is worthy of the consideration of congress yet may not means be still devised to satisfy this gentleman by appointing him to some command not derogatory to his promised rank and which will be agreeable to him from the recommendations we have had of him i am obliged to esteem him of high character and of great knowledge in what he professes and from this consideration and the manner in which he is mentioned to us it appears that much address and delicacy must be used to conciliate matters many reasons besides those i have noted might be assigned for continuing general knox first in command in this department which on reflection will readily occur i would only observe without insinuating the most distant shadow of distrust of monsieur ducoudrays honor candor or integrity that on the general maxims of prudence and policy it may be questioned with much propriety whether so important a command as that of the artillery should  0  be vested in any but a native or one attached by the ties of interest to these states congress will be pleased to excuse the freedom i have used upon this occasion and i trust will impute it to the importance of the subject which gave rise to it  i have the honor c  george washington   june      middlebrook richard henry lee to richard henry lee middlebrook   june      dear sir by your favor of the   d ultimo i perceive my letter of the   th has been expressed in too strong terms i did not mean by the words to get rid of importunity to cast the smallest reflection indeed the hurry with which i am obliged to write the few private letters i attempt will not allow me to consider the force and tendency of my words nor should i  0  have been surprised if the fact had really been so if i am to judge of their i mean foreigners applications to congress by those to myself for it is not one nor twenty explanations that will satisfy the cravings of these peoples demands you will before this can reach you have seen monsieur ducoudray what his real expectations are and what his agreements with mr deane i know not but i fear if his appointment is equal to what i have been told is his expectation it will be attended with unhappy consequences to say nothing of the policy of entrusting a department on the due execution of which the salvation of the army depends to a foreigner who has no other tie to bind him to the interests of this country than honor i would beg leave to observe that by putting monsieur ducoudray at the head of the artillery you will lose a very valuable officer in general knox who is a man of great military reading sound judgment and clear conceptions he has conducted the affairs of that department with honor to himself and advantage to the public and will resign if any one is put over him  my last return of the army will give you our  0  strength and show the state of the recruiting service which seems to be at an end the regiments of pennsylvania indeed appear to be growing worse and unless some coercive method can be hit upon to complete battalions i see no chance of doing it general howes encouragement by proclamation has occasioned great desertions from our army to his with the loss of arms this i have represented to congress and submitted to them the propriety of offering something back by way of counteraction but have received no answer and this being frequently the case leaves me often in a very disagreeable state of suspense from which a simple yea or nay would relieve me if some effectual mode is not devised to fill the regiments it is impossible at least very unlikely that any effectual opposition can be given to the british army with the troops we have whose numbers diminish more by desertion than they increase by enlistments  0  i have requested the directorgeneral of the hospital here as it is properly within his line to take notice of the report which you say prevails to the southward concerning the sick and to remark upon it in the gazettes i am c  0  george washington   june      middlebrook to the president of congress headquarters middlebrook   june      sir i would take the liberty of addressing a few lines to congress on a matter which appears to me of importance  0  and which is considered in the same light by many of our officers and others not in the military line the subject i allude to is the condition of many persons now with the enemy who deluded by their arts and a misguided attachment to their measures fled from the protection of the states to find security with them and who in many instances are in arms against us it has been suggested through various channels and the suggestion seems to be credited especially as some have already escaped that many of these unhappy people convinced of their error and the wicked part they have taken would embrace the earliest opportunity of leaving the enemy and returning among us were they sure of being received into our friendship again and of enjoying their property and the rights of citizens this subject in the consideration of it strikes me as important interesting and delicate involving many consequences worthy of mature deliberation and attention as such and deeming myself incompetent to it i think it my duty to submit it to congress for their discussion to take such measures therein as they shall esteem necessary and right if these people particularly those in arms are ingenuous in what has been hinted and it is their wish or that of any considerable part of them to return i should suppose it would be expedient and founded in sound policy to give every suitable assurance to induce them to come such an event would be attended with salutary effects would weaken the enemy distress them greatly and would probably have a  0  most happy influence in preventing others from joining their arms on the other hand the indulgence may be liable to great abuse supposing it not to be duly guarded or if the effects produced by it should be partial they will not be adequate to the ends in view yet as the enemy on their part are using every device they are capable of to seduce both soldiers and citizens from our service into theirs and have succeeded but too well it is generally thought in the military line that something should be attempted to counteract them whether congress will be of the same sentiment and if they should what and how extensive the mode and indulgence ought to be is entirely with them there is one difficulty that occurs to me supposing the measure to be adopted what line of discrimination can be drawn upon such an occasion though circumstances should differ and seem to require it while the poor deluded ignorant duped by artifices and a thousand causes to lead them wrong have a claim to their countrys pardon and indulgence there are many of wellinformed understanding who from their earlyavowed hostile dispositions and inveterate disregard of her rights and those who have taken a double and triple part cannot have the same pretensions whose only view in returning may be to serve their own sordid purposes and the better to promote those plans they have steadily pursued one thing more i would observe which is that if congress judge an adoption of measures eligible on the subject of my letter the sooner it is come into   0 the better for the most obvious reasons and the time allowed for those to return who wish the indulgence should be fixed at a short period not longer in my opinion that till the—day of—next otherwise they may avail themselves of the circumstance and wait events to decide their choice if any good consequences are produced the means can be renewed and further extended congress will be pleased to excuse me for thus freely communicating my sentiments especially when i assure them that they are dictated by what i esteem my duty i have the honor to be c p s the more i consider the subject of my letter the more important and interesting it appears i am inclined to think if the measure proposed should be deemed expedient that it will be better that the indulgencies and assurances for their return should be communicated thro the medium of some second secret hand qualified to offer them and negotiate the business rather than by an act of public authority opportunities i should suppose may be found by which they may obtain due information in that way and which will not hold out to the enemy the same cause of suspicion and of vigilance prevent their escaping whatever more shall be considered most advisable should be immediately adopted what time should be allowed in the first instance i am at a loss to determine if the continuance is too short there may be danger of their not being apprized so as to get off if t is too long     theyll defer matters to the last and act then as circumstances of interest dictate to err in the form will be least injurious  george washington   june      middlebrook to the president of congress middlebrook   june      sir i this morning had the honor of your letter of the  th with its enclosures the resolution of the  0th of may respecting the french gentlemen who came passengers in the amphitrite reached camp before     your letter and has excited much uneasiness in the artillery corps  the enclosed copy of a letter from general knox will convey their anxiety upon the subject which i think it necessary to transmit as well from duty as on account of his request the difficulties upon this occasion arise from the peculiar circumstances of most of the officers composing the artillery regiments at this time i do not know for my own part what operation congress precisely meant the resolution should have but if the commissions which these gentlemen are to receive should give them rank from the date of those they had from the king of france or from their compact with mr deane there are but few officers now in the artillery who will not be superseded in their command unless some method is adopted to prevent it this i am persuaded congress had not in contemplation because it is opposed to policy and to justice and i am led to believe the resolution was come into for want of due information how matters were circumstanced in this instance      the officers now in the artillery i am obliged to consider of great merit experience has proved them to be most warmly attached to the rights of their country and their conduct in the line of their profession has been such as does the highest honor to themselves and the gentleman who immediately commands them without derogating in the least from the character of the french officers who are to be commissioned and whom i wish to receive every countenance they merit there is strong reason to doubt laying aside every consideration of policy whether they have seen as much real service as our own in the course of two campaigns it would be hard not to say unjust that the latter should lose their command when they have a claim to every mark of favor and after they have taken great pains to form their companies the service requires that they should not and i am convinced the event would be attended with the most fatal consequences     but what is to be done this is a case of difficulty view it as you will i am not for rejecting the french gentlemen far otherwise i am for employing them and public faith and the encouragements given to bring them over demand that it should be done after much thought and consideration upon the subject two modes occur to me as the only possible ones by which it can be effected and by which the inconveniences i have mentioned can be remedied one is that the new corps of artillery should be formed and these gentlemen attached to it this we have reason to fear cannot be done from the difficulties we have experienced in raising men and from their having no interest or connexions with the people their situation in such case if they are men of sentiment and active dispositions would be irksome and distressing the other is that our present officers now under consideration should have their commissions antedated to give them precedency of rank and this may be done with the greater propriety as most of them were intended to hold the posts they now sustain before the french gentlemen had any claim upon us it is true they were not commissioned because the old corps existed under the first arrangement further it is said and there is no doubt of the fact that these gentlemen were promoted by brevet just before their departure from france merely to give them rank here antecedent to which our officers were superior to them in this point and these brevets only confer local rank confined to the frenchamerican colonies this latter     mode appears the most eligible if it is adopted they will be distributed through the corps as assistant officers their want of a knowledge in our language incapacitates them for command in the first instance and not only so but to place them at the head of companies over officers that have been at great trouble pains and expense in raising the men would be both unmilitary and unjust i shall now quit the subject wishing that whatever will best conciliate matters and advance the public good may be done suggesting at the same time with all deference that as it is much easier to prevent evils than to remedy them after they have happened it will be well in all cases of foreign and indeed other applications that the consequences which granting them wil involve should be maturely weighed and taken in every point of view in the present case of difficulty things i am persuaded might have been adjusted with the greatest facility had the committee of foreign applications been fully possessed of all the circumstances respecting the artillery regiments    i have the honor c  george washington   june      middle brook appolos morris to appolos morris headquarters middle brook   june      sir i am favd with yours of the    and    may from both of which it is evident to me that you have at length determined upon the part which you are to     take in this great dispute i will not argue with you upon the propriety of your conduct but i cannot help saying that i think it very odd that after being denied an answer to your political queries which appears from mr allens letter to you of the  d april you should upon the bare assertion or rather opinion of that gentleman expressed in his letter of the  th of may conclude that matters between this country and great britain might have been adjusted had any terms short of independence been insisted upon i must tell you in plain terms that at this time a neutral character is looked upon as a suspicious one and i would therefore advise you to leave a country with a majority of whom you cannot agree in sentiment and who are determined to assert their liberties by the ways and means which necessity and not the love of war has obliged them to adopt i thank you for your expressions of personal regard and am sir c  george washington   june      middlebrook samuel b webb to colonel samuel b webb camp at middlebrook   june      dr sir by mr turnbull who is just past this for philadelphia i am informed that you have lately drawn  00 hunting shirts— 00 waistcoats—  00 overalls     in addn to the cloathing you obtained some time ago—by a late return from genl putnam who comds at peekskill dated the   st ulto it appears that of your regiment he has only    men at that post—and by a return from genl parsons of the   th of ye same m it further appears that the whole strength of your regiment was only  0  rank  file—what is the meaning of all this  in what point of view am i to consider such proceedings—can you conceive it necessary that your regiment is to have one suit for parade and another to march to new haven present appearances render it doubtful whether they will ever get further or intend to leave the state of connecticut—and more than all this can you think it justifiable to keep  00 and odd spare suits by them when a numbr of poor fellows who have been doing hard duty in the field have scarcely cloathing to cover their nakedness and many of them rendered unfit for duty for want thereof whilst the clothier genl knows not where to provide them i am sorry you oblige me to tell you in plain terms that this conduct is highly offensive to me and you are hereby injoined to proceed with every man of your regiment fit for duty immediately to peekskill leaving the necessary officers with proper instructions to recruit to your establishmt you are to carry all the cloathing into peekskill that the troops there may be benefitted by the superfluity of your regimt i well remember that you to obviate my objections to cloathing your men in red proposd hunting shirts     as a covering but i then observed that this could not be expected at the public expence nor had i any conception that you could have entertained the most distant thought of drawing these things from the public stores when you must have known how difficult a matter it is to provide for the large demands of the army it is with pain i have been induced to express myself in a language so pointed but your own reflection will convince you that i have but too much reason i am c george washington   june      middle brook to the president of congress head quarters middle brook   june      sir i was this morning honored with your favor of the  th instant with its inclosures i am extremely happy in the approbation congress have been pleased to express of my conduct respecting the proposed cartel for the exchange of prisoners and shall govern myself by the principle which influenced me on that occasion and such other as shall appear right and just should there be any further negociation on the subject  i shall order a return to be made of the chaplains in service which shall be transmitted as soon as it is obtained at present as the regiments are greatly     dispersed part in one place and part in another and accurate states of them have not been made it will not be in my power to forward it immediately i shall here take occasion to mention that i communicated the resolution appointing a brigade chaplain in the place of all others to the several brigadiers they are all of opinion that it will be impossible for em to discharge the duty—that many inconveniences and much dissatisfaction will be the result and that no establishment appears so good in this instance as the old one among many other weighty objections to the measure it has been suggested that it has a tendency to introduce religious disputes into the army which above all things should be avoided and in many instances would compel men to a mode of worship which they do not profess the old establishment gives every regiment an opportunity of having their own religious sentiments—is founded on a plan of a more generous toleration—and the choice of chaplains to officiate has been generally in the regiments—supposing one chaplain could do the duties of a brigade which supposition however is inadmissible when we view things in practice that being composed of four or five—perhaps in some instances six regiments there might be so many different modes of worship i have mentioned the opinion of the officers and these hints to congress upon this subject from a principle of duty and because i am well assured it is most foreign to their wishes or intention to excite by any act the smallest uneasiness  jealousy among the troops   0 there remains no room to believe otherwise than that the enemy are on the point of moving this is confirmed by intelligence from all quarters and thro so many different channels that we must consider it certain whether they will move of land or water or by both cannot be ascertained nor is their destination precisely known—but every circumstance points out philadelphia as their object being of this opinion i have directed the return of genl mifflin before he left philadelphia i wrote countermanding the order for his coming here but he did not receive my letter i would also mention to congress that i think the military stores lately arrived at or coming to philadelphia should be removed to a place of perfect security tho i would not excite—needless—uneasy apprehensions prudence requires that those so essential should not be exposed to risk i have c george washington june      middlebrook john augustine washington to john augustine washington middlebrook—june      dear brother i think i stand debtor to you for your letters of the   d of april and   th of may which are all that have come to hand since my last to you from morristown i am now assembling the troops of this state and those southward of it at this place which lays about seven miles from the enemys principal post at brunswick and convenient for following them either     to philadelphia or to the eastward—there has been no considerable movement among them of late—from every appearance philadelphia is their object and to facilitate their passage across the delaware a number of flatbottomd boats are provided and now ready upon carriages to form a bridge with—but appearances are deceiving—false colors are often thrown out to mislead or bewilder this may be the case now i cannot learn that the enemy have as yet received more than a few recruits as a reinforcement but i fancy they hourly expect transports with their foreign mercenarys i can no otherwise account for genl howes inactivity as his numbers all along have greatly exceeded mine and at times doubled and tripled them at present i could say things that would rather surprize you but the uncertain conveyance of letters makes it imprudent to entrust things to them that you would wish to conceal from the enemy—the different states must fall upon some decisive measures to compleat their regiments or no one can say what the consequences will be i hope i may congratulate you and my sister on her happy recovery from the smallpox together with your children—the loss my brother sam has sustained will i fear be very sensibly felt by him some mismanagement must surely have been in the way for the small pox by inoculation appears to me to be nothing my whole family i understand are likely to get well through the disorder with no other assistance than that of doctor lund—in short one of     the best physicians in this army has assurd me that the great skill which many of the faculty pretend to have in the management of this disorder and the great art necessary to treat the patient well is neither more nor less than a cheat upon the world that in general an old woman may inoculate with as much success as the best physician the whole art lying in keeping the patient rather low in diet and cool especially at the period of the eruptive fever this he says is the only art requisite—to this and the means by which the disorder is communicated instead of receiving the infection in ye natural way the ease with which patients get through is to be attributed there are particular cases he adds where some other disorder or some uncommon circumstances cast up that may require the aid of physicians but in general neither physicians nor physic is necessary except a few purgatives which the white walnut bark and many other things the natural product of the country affords that this is truely the case i firmly believe and my own people not less i suppose than between two and three hundred getting happily through it by following these directions is no inconsiderable proof of it—surely that impolitic act restraining inoculation in virginia can never be continued—if i was a member of that assembly i would rather move for a law to compel the masters of families to inoculate every child born within a certain limitted time under severe penalties— the account as you have no doubt seen by the gazettes and by my last letter of the destruction     of some of our stores at danbury is true in part—but trifling in comparison of what you have heard—we lost no powder at all about   00 barrels of porke and about the same number of last years tents was the chief loss we sustained—since that we have burnt    sail of the enemys vessels at the east ward of long island laden with   0 tons of pressed hay rum c—one of which vessels was armed with    guns the party also brot off  0 prisoners besides a few killed on the side of the enemy on our part not a man was hurt—in the danbury affair i am well convinced from a number of concurring accounts the enemy in killed wounded and missing could not have lost less than  00 men my love and sincere good wishes attend my sister and the rest of the family and with the most affect regard i am c george washington  0 june      middlebrook lieutenantgeneral howe to lieutenantgeneral howe middlebrook  0 june      sir your several letters of the   st of april   d of may and  th instant have been received having stated my sentiments in an explicit manner in my letter of the  th of april upon the subject of your demand and the disagreement between us i thought it unnecessary to trouble you with a repetition of them from the complexion of yours of the   st of april we appeared to differ so widely that i could entertain no hopes of a compromise being effected or that an answer would produce any good end but     as you have called upon me again for my final determination upon the matter i shall freely give it after making some observations upon what you have said with the intention to obviate the objections on my part to a compliance with your demand through lieutenantcolonel walcott you admit the principle upon which my objection to account for the whole number of prisoners sent out by you is founded but deny the application by delicately insinuating in the first instance that the ill treatment complained of was an expedient to cherish popular delusion and by asserting in the second that supposing their sufferings to have been real they were to be ascribed to other causes than those assigned by me i shall not undertake to determine on whom the charge of endeavoring to excite popular delusion falls with most propriety but i cannot forbear intimating that however successful ingenious miscolorings may be in some instances to perplex the understanding in matters of speculation yet it is difficult to persuade mankind to doubt the evidence of their senses and the reality of those facts for which they can appeal to them unless this can be done permit me to assure you it will always be believed whatever may be suggested to the contrary that men could not be in a more deplorable situation than those unhappy sufferers were who are the subject of our difference did i imagine that you sir had any serious scruples on the occasion i might produce in support of what i have alleged the strongest proofs that human testimony can afford     to prove that the prisoners did not suffer from any ill treatment or neglect of yours you say they were confined in the most airy buildings and on board the largest transports in the fleet that they were supplied with the same provisions both in quantity and quality as were allowed to your troops not on service that the sick such of them as required peculiar care were received into the british hospitals and the rest attended by their own surgeons who were supplied with medicines without restriction till it was discovered that they disposed of large quantities by private sale that airy buildings were chosen to confine our men in is a fact i shall not dispute but whether this was an advantage or not in the winter season i leave it to you to decide i am inclined to think it was not especially as there was a general complaint that they were destitute of fire the greater part of the time and were only prevented from feeling the inclemency of the weather in its extremest rigor by their crowded situation this i must believe was not very conducive to their health and if we may judge by comparison we must conclude that they endured similar inconveniences on board the transports as to the supplies of provisions i know not what they were my ideas of the matter were drawn from their united testimony confirmed by their appearance which represented the allowance as insufficient in quantity bad in quality and irregularly served you yourself mention some accidental instances of omission i apprehend they were much more frequent     than you were apprized of it may not be improper to observe that there is a material difference between persons confined and deprived of every means of subsistence in aid of their allowance and those who are at large and have other resources as is the case with your troops when not on service who have the benefit of their pay and what they can occasionally gain by their labor you might also find from inquiry that we made no distinction in our supplies between your soldiers prisoners with us and our own in the field they were not stinted to a scanty pittance but had full as much as they could use and of the best kind in respect to the attention paid to the sick i am sorry their accommodation was injured in any degree by the misconduct of the surgeons i heartily join with you in reprobating their proceedings and shall esteem it a favor if you will point out the persons and furnish me with such proofs of their guilt as you may be possessed of the more effectually to exonerate yourself from the consequences imputed to the neglect or ill treatment of the prisoners you assert they had every comfort and assistance from you that your situation would admit and that they wanted nothing but money and cloathing which ought to have been furnished by me had we left your prisoners with us to depend entirely upon the supplies they drew immediately from you their condition would have been little better than ours in your hands your officers and soldiers can both inform you that they experienced every mark of public and private generosity that     could be shown them frequent instances might be adduced that on notice of your men being in want orders were immediately given that necessaries should be procured for them every thing was done on our part to facilitate any steps you took for the same end you were permitted to have an agent amongst us countenanced by public authority and allowed every latitude he could wish to enable him to execute his office i am sorry to say the same conduct has not been observed towards us and that there are instances to show that far from endeavoring to remove the difficulties which necessarily lay in our way to making such ample supplies as we could wish obstacles have been made that might very well have been waved a late instance of this is to be found in your refusing to let us have a procuring agent with you who might purchase what was necessary to supply the wants of our men you must be sensible that for want of a regular mode being adjusted for mutually conveying supplies there was a necessity for an exercise of generosity on both sides this was done by us and we supposed would have been done by you which made us less anxious in providing than we should have been had we foreseen what has really happened we ascribed every deficiency on your part to the indeterminate situation of affairs in this respect and looking forward to a more provident arrangement of the matter we thought it our duty not to let the prisoners with us be destitute of any thing requisite for their preservation and imagined     that your reasonings and feelings would have been the same your saying that we were frequently advised of their distress is of little avail it was not done till it was too late to remedy the ill consequences of the past neglect and till our prisoners were already reduced to a miserable extremity i wish their sufferings may not have been increased in the article of cloathing by their being deprived of what they had through the rapacity of too many of their captors reports of this kind have not been wanting you further observe that my own experience would suggest whether our army in the course of the last campaign was not subject to the same calamitous mortality with the prisoners in your possession i cannot but confess that there was a great degree of sickness among us but i can assure you that the mortality bore no kind of resemblance to that which was experienced by the prisoners with you and that the disorders in the camp had nearly ceased before the captivity of a large proportion of them the garrison that fell into your hands on the   th of november was found i am convinced in perfect health in reply to my intimation that it would have been happy if the expedient of sending out our men had been earlier thought of you are pleased to say that the event has proved the caution with which you ought to have adopted the measure what inference can be drawn from my refusing to account for prisoners scarcely alive and by no means in an exchangeable     condition to warrant an insinuation that i should have done the same had they been released under different circumstances let your own candor determine but then you ask how is the cause of debility in prisoners to be ascertained this seems to be considered as a perplexing question for my part i cannot view it as involving any great difficulty there is no more familiar mode of reasoning than from effects to causes even in matters of the most interesting importance in the subject before us the appearance of the prisoners and what eventually happened proved that they had been hardly dealt with but their joint asseverations aided by the information of others not interested in the distress more than as they regarded the rights of humanity established the fact too firmly for incredulity itself to doubt it i should hardly believe you to be serious in your application of the exception to which you allude to the case of majorgeneral lee if you had not persisted in a discrimination respecting him i did not entertain the most distant idea that he could have been supposed to come under the description contained in it and to force such a construction upon that gentlemans circumstances however it may be an evidence of ingenuity is but an indifferent specimen of candor i still adhere to what i have already advanced on this head i can by no means think of departing from it i am now to give you my final decision on the subject of your demands in doing this i can do little   0 more than repeat what i have already said i am extremely desirous of a general exchange on liberal and impartial principles and it is with great concern i find that a matter so mutually interesting is impeded by unnecessary obstacles but i cannot consent to its taking place on terms so disadvantageous as those you propose and which appear to me so contrary to justice and the spirit of our agreement i think it proper to declare that i wish the difference between us to be adjusted on a generous and equitable plan and mean not to avail myself of the releasement of the prisoners to extort any thing from you not compatible with the strictest justice let a reasonable proportion of prisoners to be accounted for be settled and general lee declared exchangeable when we shall have an officer of yours of equal rank in our possession i ask no more these being done i shall be happy to proceed to a general exchange but in the mean time i am willing that a partial one should take place for the prisoners now in your hands as far as those in ours will extend except with respect to lieutenantcolonel campbell and the hessian fieldofficers who will be detained till you recognise general lee as a prisoner of war and place him on the footing i claim this latter proposition i am induced to make from the distinction which your letter of the   d of may seems to hold forth and i think it necessary to add that your conduct towards prisoners will govern mine the situation of lieutenantcolonel campbell as represented by you is such as i neither wished nor     approve upon the first intimation of his complaints i wrote upon the subject and hoped there would have been no further cause of uneasiness that gentleman i am persuaded will do me the justice to say he has received no ill treatment at my instance unnecessary severity and every species of insult i despise and i trust none will ever have just reason to censure me in this respect i have written again on your remonstrance and have no doubt such a line of conduct will be adopted as will be consistent with the dictates of humanity and agreeable to both his and your wishes i am sir c      george washington    june      middlebrook joseph reed to joseph reed middlebrook    june      dear sir your favor of the  th was given me by joseph arrowsmith just as mr peters informed me that he was about to set out for philadelphia i could not resist the inclination however of detaining him long enough to write you a short letter to thank you as i do most sincerely for the friendly and affectionate sentiments contained in yours of the above date towards me and to assure you that i am perfectly convinced of the sincerity of them true it is i felt myself hurt by a certain letter which appeared at that time to be the echo of one from you i was hurt not because i thought my judgment wronged by the expressions contained in it but because the same sentiments were not communicated immediately to myself the favorable manner in which your opinions upon all occasions had been received the impression they made and the unreserved manner in which i wished and required them to be given entitled me i thought to your advice upon any point in which i appeared to be wanting to meet with any thing then that carried with it a complexion of withholding that advice from me and censuring my conduct to another was such an argument of disingenuity that i was not a little mortified at it however i am perfectly satisfied that matters were not as they appeared from the letter alluded to      i sincerely wish that you may accept the appointment of congress and the post i am desirous of placing you in and must beg to be favored with an answer immediately upon the subject as the service will not admit of delay a general officer in that department would not only take off a great deal of trouble from me but be a means of bringing those regiments into order and service with much more facility than it is in my power divided as my attention is possibly to do mr peters waiting obliges me to conclude  george washington    june      middlebrook majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler headquarters middlebrook    june      dear sir i have your favr of the  th   0th instant the account brought by the officers from canada may not be entirely true but that part which speaks of a removal of some regiments down the river favors an opinion that i have for some time entertained which is that if genl howe had not a certainty of a full reinforcement from england part of the troops from canada would be ordered round for that purpose that the european reinforcement will be short or be very late is beyond a doubt and therefore the move from canada more probable on the night of the   th genl howe began his march from brunswic seemingly with an intention to     push directly for delaware in the course of the night his front reached somerset courthouse eight or nine miles from brunswic where he halted and has remained ever since his rear is still at brunswic i do not know whether this was intended as a real move towards philadelphia or whether it is to endeavor to draw us down from the heights we occupy along his whole front  the militia turn out in a very spirited manner and seem determined in conjunction with the continental troops to harass and oppose the enemy upon their march through the country his principal difficulty will be in crossing the delaware we shall hang heavy upon his rear and i expect that genl arnold and mifflin will meet him with a considerable force made up of continental troops and militia upon the western side of the delaware as soon as i found that the enemy had drawn their force into jersey from whence they could not remove it without a good deal of previous notice i ordered down all the troops from peekskill except one thousand effective continentals and the militia which is a force superior to any that the enemy now have in new york or its dependencies and therefore fully sufficient to prevent any surprise when these troops come down our army will be respectable and i hope not only able to check but to make an impression upon some part of the enemys line    i am c     george washington    june      middlebrook majorgeneral arnold to majorgeneral arnold  head quarters camp at middlebrook    june      dear sir i have received your favor of the   th inst you mention a want of intelligence respecting my situation and that of the enemy as to mine the main body of our army are encamped at middlebrook and a considerable body under general sullivan at sourland hills the position here is very strong and with a little labor which will be bestowed upon it will be rendered a great deal more so the passes in the mountains are for the most part extremely difficult and cannot be attempted with any degree of propriety our right is our most accessible and weakest part but two or three redoubts will render it as secure as could be wished the enemy are strongly posted having their right at brunswic and their left at somerset besides being well fortified on their right they have the raritan all along their front and the millstone on their left in this situation an attack upon them would not be warranted by a sufficient prospect of success and might be attended with the most ruinous consequences my design therefore is to collect all the force that can properly be drawn from other quarters to this post so as     to reduce the security of this army to the greatest possible certainty and to be in a condition of embracing any fair opportunity that may offer to make an advantageous attack upon them in the mean time i intend by light bodies of militia countenanced by a few continental troops to harass them and weaken their numbers by continual skirmishes i have ordered all the continental troops at peekskill except the number requisite for the security of the post to hasten on to this army  and shall draw a part of general sullivans troops to reinforce our right leaving the rest at and about sourland hills to gall the flank and rear of the enemy with orders in case of any movement towards us to endeavor to form a junction or if this should not be practicable to fall briskly upon their rear or flank the views of the enemy must be to destroy this army and get possession of philadelphia i am however clearly of opinion that they will not move that way till they have endeavored to give a severe blow to this army the risk would be too great to attempt to cross a river where they must expect to meet a formidable opposition in front and would have such a force as ours in their rear they might possibly be successful but the probability would be infinitely against them should they be imprudent enough to do it i     shall keep close upon their heels and do every thing in my power to make the project fatal to them but besides the argument for their intending in the first place a stroke at this army drawn from the policy of the measure every appearance coincides to confirm the opinion had they designed for the delaware in the first instance they would probably have made a secret rapid march for it and not halted as they have done to awaken our attention and give us time to prepare for obstructing them instead of that they have only advanced to a position necessary to facilitate an attack upon our right which is the part they have the greatest likelihood of injuring us in and added to this consideration they have come out as light as possible leaving all their baggage provisions boats and bridges at brunswic which plainly contradicts the idea of pushing for the delaware it is an happy circumstance that such an animation prevails among the people i would wish to let it operate and draw as many as possible together which will be a great discouragement to the enemy by showing that the popular spirit is at such a height and at the same time will inspire the people themselves with confidence in their own strength by discovering to every individual the zeal and spirit of his neighbors but after they had been collected a few days i would have the greater part of them dismissed as not being immediately wanted desiring them to hold themselves in readiness for any sudden call and concerting signals with them at the appearance of which they are to fly to arms i would have every means taken to     engage a couple thousand of them for a month or as much more as they can be induced to consent to in this case they will be able to render essential service both by an addition of strength for the present and by lessening the fatigue and duty of the continental army which will tend to preserve them both in health and spirits you will forward on all the continental troops by a safe route as fast as they arrive but you need send over no more of the militia till further orders i approve of your fortifying such places as you judge most likely to frustrate any attempt of the enemy to pass the river i am with great regard dear sir your most obedient servant p s i have been so crowded with business at head quarters that i have not been able to write fully to congress—i should therefore be glad you would communicate the purport of this letter to them george washington    june      middlebrook m danmours to m danmours headquarters camp at middlebrook    june      sir i have received your favour of the  th instant transmitting me your observations on the state of american affairs and the part that france is interested by the motives of good policy to act in consequence of it your reflections appear to me extremely judicious and well founded and prove that you have made a good use of your time in collecting the information necessary to regulate your judgment     in a matter that so intimately concerns all europe as well as america it were to be wished that sentiments similar to yours were impressed upon the french court and that they could be inducd not to delay an event so desirable both to them and to us as the one you are anxious should take place—an immediate declaration of war against britain in all probability coud not fail to extricate us from all our difficultys and to cement the bond of friendship so firmly between france and america as to produce the most permanent advantages to both—certainly nothing can be more the true interests of france than to have a weight of such magnitude as america taken out of the scale of british power and opulence and thrown into that of her own and if so it cannot be adviseable to trust any thing to contingencies when by a conduct decisively in our favor the object in view might be put upon a sure footing permit me sir to correct a mistake you have made in narrating a fact with respect to the danbury expedition in which some magazines of ours were destroyed—you mention only an hundred men being lost to the enemy but from various accounts and circumstances there is little reason to doubt there must have been at least four hundred killd wounded  taken—i have taken notice of this error because it is of some little importance the affair shoud be rightly stated as it serves to show in a striking point of view the spirit of opposition prevailing among the people which animated them to assemble on so sudden an occasion and to attack a   0 regular body of two thousand men with so much vigor as to force them to a precipitate return little differing from a rout genl howe has lately made a very extraordinary movement he sallied out from brunswick on the night of the   th instant and marched towards sommerset about nine miles distant when he halted and began to fortify—by this operation he had drawn much nearer to us and was in a tolerably commodious posture for attacking our right which led us to conjecture this might have been his design—but all of a sudden he last night began to decamp and with a good deal of expedition if not precipitation has returned to his former position with his right at amboy and his left at brunswick this was certainly a hasty resolution but from what motive it is not easy to determine he had begun a chain of redoubts from right to left which together with other appearances indicated a design of remaining there some little time at least his abandoning the ground he had taken and leaving the redoubts half finished is an argument that he had been disappointed in his views and found it necessary to alter them perhaps he was discouraged by the spirit that appeared among the inhabitants who flocked together to join our army even beyond my expectations as he began to retire in the night had but a little way to go was protected on his flank next to us by the rariton and on his rear by the millstone i had little or no opportunity of annoying him in his return his soldiery plundered the people as usual and burnt many valuable houses in their rout     i am sorry it is not in my power to avail myself of your services in the way you propose—at the same time i assure you i entertain as high an opinion of your zeal and abilities as the opportunities i have had of knowing you will admit i am c  george washington  0 june      middle brook majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler head quarters middle brook  0 june      dear sir i am favd with yours of the   th instant from fort edward but that of the   th from saratoga to wh you refer has not come to hand supposing the plan mentioned in amsburys evidence to be true i cannot conceive that it will be in the power of the enemy to carry it into execution but to provide against all events i have ordered genl putnam to hold four massachusetts regiments in readiness at peekskill to go up the river at a moments warning and to order sloops from albany which are to be kept for that purpose  it does not     appear that burgoyne has brought any reinforcements from europe if so he cannot move with a greater force than five thousand men he certainly will never leave the garrison of ticonderoga in his rear and if he invests it to any purpose he will not have a sufficient number left to send one body from oswego and another to cut off the communication between fort edward and fort george as the garrison at ticonderoga is sufficient to hold it against any attack i do not think it politic under your representation of the scarcity of provisions to send up troops to consume what ought to be thrown into the fort those troops held ready by genl putnam can always upon a certainty of the enemys intention to pass by ticonderoga with the whole or part of their force be up time enough with the assistance of the militia to give them a check as their march cannot be a very rapid one    i draw a very favorable omen from the intercepted letter to genl sullivan it shows that they despair of carrying their schemes by force and are reduced to the necessity of having recourse to the arts of flattery bribery and intimidation the general is not at     this post i therefore cannot say how far it may be agreeable to him for you to carry on the correspondence in his name if your letter has not gone you had better wait for his concurrence for it is a delicate matter        since i began this letter yours of the   th came to hand the contents of which are fully answered by what i have before written i shall immediately forward the letter to congress it is evident from genl st clairs letter that it will not be proper to order up the reinforcement before it is really wanted for he very judiciously observes that they will consume the stores i shall desire genl sullivan to inform me whether he knows such a man as robt shannon and what is his character i cannot conceive what occasions the delay of the massachusetts and new hampshire continental troops i have repeatedly wrote to them in the most pressing manner to have them sent on but in vain i however hope that your representations as you are on the spot will have a better effect        george washington  0 june      middlebrook to the president of congress middlebrook  0 june      sir when i had the honor of addressing you last i informed you that the main body of the enemy had marched from brunswic and extended their van as far as somerset courthouse i am now to acquaint you that after encamping between these two posts and beginning a line of redoubts they changed their ground yesterday morning and in the course of the preceding night and returned to brunswic again burning as they went several valuable dwellinghouses we had constantly light troops hovering round them as far as circumstances would permit but being secured on their flanks by the rariton and millstone they were difficult to approach and without loss they effected their return to their former posts this sudden and precipitate change in their operations has afforded matter for much speculation we suppose their original design was to attempt an impression on our right or to manœuver us out of our ground or to advance towards the delaware whether these conjectures were well founded cannot be ascertained but it is probable if they had an impression in view they found it could not be attempted without great loss as to bringing on an attack they effectually secured themselves against one by the post they took or as passing the delaware was their object that from the temper of the people the prosecution of it if not impracticable would meet with much greater opposition than they     expected for i must observe and with peculiar satisfaction i do it that on the first notice of the enemys movements the militia assembled in the most spirited manner firmly determined to give them every annoyance in their power and to afford us every possible aid  this i thought it my duty to mention in justice to their conduct and i am inclined to believe that general howes return thus suddenly made must have been in consequence of the information he received that the people were flying to arms in every quarter to oppose him i shall not reason upon this event but i cannot but consider it as a most fortunate and happy one to us and the most distressing mr howe has yet experienced unless he has schemes in contemplation beyond the reach of my conjecture i should have written to congress more frequently respecting the enemy after they came from brunswic had i not been almost constantly on horseback and had their designs been clear but as they were not i did not wish to puzzle them with conjectures more especially as i wrote to general arnold with whom     i was obliged to correspond that he might coöperate with me as circumstances should require to transmit them copies of my letters       i omitted to mention in my last that in consultation with my genl officers it was agreed that promotions should be regimental in the army for all officers under the rank of field officers and for all of that rank in the line of their state this is now settled as a general rule a right being reserved however that it may be made for particular merit out of this line or refused for demerit or any substantial objection  i have c     george washington    june      middlebrook to the president of congress middlebrook    oclock pm    june      sir i have the honor and pleasure to inform you that the enemy evacuated brunswic this morning and retired to amboy burning many houses as they went along some of them from the appearance of the flames were considerable buildings from several pieces of information and from a variety of circumstances it was evident that a movement was in agitation and it was the general opinion that it was     intended this morning i therefore detached three brigades under the command of majorgeneral greene to fall upon their rear and kept the main body of the army paraded upon the heights to support them if there should be occasion a party of colonel morgans regiment of lightinfantry attacked and drove the hessian picket about sunrise and upon the appearance of general waynes brigade and morgans regiment who got first to the ground opposite brunswic the enemy immediately crossed the bridge to the east side of the river and threw themselves into redoubts which they had before constructed our troops advanced briskly upon them upon which they quitted the redoubts without making any opposition and retired by the amboy road as all our troops from the difference of their stations in camp had not come up when the enemy began to move off it was impossible to check them as their numbers were far greater than we had any reason to expect being as we were informed afterwards between four and five thousand men our people pursued them as far as piscataway but finding it impossible to overtake them and fearing they might be led on too far from the main body they returned to brunswic by information of the inhabitants general howe lord cornwallis and general grant were in the town when the alarm was first given but they quitted it very soon after in the pursuit colonel morgans riflemen exchanged several sharp fires with the enemy which it is immagined did considerable execution i am in hopes that they afterwards fell in with general maxwell     who was detached last night with a strong party to lie between brunswic and amboy to intercept any convoys or parties that might be passing but i have yet heard nothing from him general greene desires me to make mention of the conduct and bravery of general wayne and colonel morgan and of their officers and men upon this occasion as they constantly advanced upon an enemy far superior to them in numbers and well secured behind strong redoubts general sullivan advanced from rocky hill to brunswic with his division but as he did not receive his order of march till very late at night he did not arrive till the enemy had been gone some time i have sent down lord stirlings division to reinforce general maxwell in the morning i shall move the main body of the army to some secure post nearer amboy from whence we can with more ease annoy the enemy than from this distance i am inclined to think they mean to cross to staten island if they do we may perhaps find an opportunity of making a stroke upon their rear at any rate we shall have a chance of obliging them to make a total evacuation of the state of jersey i have the honor to be c  george washington    june      middlebrook joseph reed to joseph reed middlebrook    june         0 george washington    june      quibbletown to the president of congress camp at quibbletown    june      sir when i had the honor to address you last it was on the subject of the enemys retreat from brunswick to amboy and of the measure pursued to annoy them at the time of writing the information i had received respecting their loss was rather vague and uncertain but we have reason to believe from intelligence thro various channels since that it was pretty considerable and fell chiefly on the grenadiers and light infantry who formed their covering party the inclosed copy of a letter containing the information of a person just from new york corresponds with other accounts on this head and with the declarations of some deserters some of the accounts are that officers were heard to say they had not suffered so severely since the affair at princetown after the evacuation of brunswic i determined with the advice of my general officers to move the whole army the next morning to this post where they would be nearer the enemy and might act according to circumstances in this i was prevented by rain and they only moved yesterday morning i have advanced lord stirlings division and some other troops lower down in the neighborhood of matuchin meetinghouse and intended to have posted more there but found on reconnoitring the ground that it was low and disadvantageous and still more unfavorable through a scarcity of water these reasons added to that of there not being the     smallest prospect of attacking the enemy in amboy with a probability of success secured on their flanks by water and in their front by strong redoubts across the neck would not permit me either in my own opinion or that of my general officers to keep any greater body of men in that quarter where they would have been dispersed and of consequence extremely insecure i have light parties lying close on the enemys lines to watch their motions and who will be ready to act in conjunction with lord stirlings division and such other troops as it may be necessary to detach though i think and so do the rest of the officers that no event is likely to take place that will require more since the idea of forcing their lines or bringing on a general engagement on their own ground is universally held incompatible with our interest and that that number is sufficient to avail us of any advantages we can expect to arise from their retreating from amboy supposing notice of the fact should be obtained their contiguity to the sound and the small distance across it having boats prepared to pass in will enable them to get off should they so incline against every prudent and justifiable exertion on our part whether such is their design is more than i can positively determine but there is every reason to believe that they have been and are transporting their baggage to staten island and making every preparation to embark on board their transports for some new expedition your favor of the   th i just now received and am     extremely obliged by your cordial congratulations on the enemys retreat from brunswic and favorable interpretation of the event of my conduct the resolution you did me the honor to transmit shall have my attention it is much to be regretted that an express sent off to general maxwell on saturday night to inform him of general greenes movement towards brunswic that he might conduct himself accordingly did not reach him whether the express went designedly to the enemy or was taken is not known but there is reason to believe he fell into their hands if general maxwell had received the order there is no doubt but their whole rearguard would have been cut off this the enemy confessed themselves as we are well informed by persons in bonhamtown by a reconnoitring party just returned it is reported as a matter of doubt whether any of the enemy have removed from amboy though it is almost certain they have transported a great deal of their baggage i have the honor to be c  george washington    june      middlebrook to the president of congress camp at middlebrook    june      sir on thursday morning general howe advanced with his whole army in several columns from amboy as far as westfield we are certainly informed that the troops sent to staten island returned the preceding evening and it is said with an augmentation of marines so that carrying them there was a feint with     intention to deceive us his design in this sudden movement was either to bring on a general engagement upon disadvantageous terms considering matters in any point of view or to cut off our light parties and lord stirlings division which was sent down to support them or to possess himself of the heights and passes in the mountains on our left the two last seemed to be the first objects of his attention as his march was rapid against these parties and indicated a strong disposition to gain those passes in this situation of affairs it was thought absolutely necessary that we should move our force from the low grounds to occupy the heights before them which was effected as they advanced they fell in with some of our light parties and part of lord stirlings division with which they had some pretty smart skirmishing with but very little loss i believe on our side except in three fieldpieces which unfortunately fell into the enemys hands but not having obtained returns yet i cannot determine it with certainty nor can we ascertain what the enemys loss was as soon as we had gained the passes i detached a body of light troops under brigadiergeneral scott to hang on their flank and to watch their motions and have ordered morgans corps of riflemen to join him since the enemy remained at westfield till yesterday afternoon when about three oclock they moved towards samptown with our light troops in their rear and pursuing the enemy have plundered all before them and it is said burned some houses i have the honor to be c      george washington    june      middlebrook john augustine washington to john augustine washington camp at middlebrook    june      dear brother whether it is owing to your not writing to me or to the miscarriage of letters i cannot undertake to say but certain it is i have not received a letter from you for some considerable time— finding genl howe was assembling his whole force excepting the necessary garrisons for new york c at brunswic in this state i began to collect mine at this place a strong piece of ground ten miles distant from him where i have now been in my tent about   weeks—on the night of the   th he marchd out of brunswick and advanced the head of his column to somerset court house nine miles whilst the rear remained at middlebrook about  —in this situation he lay till the   th his left wing covered by brunswick—his right by the river millstone and his front by the rariton perfectly secure from any attempt of ours if we had been in other respects ripe for an attack our conjectures of this move were two either that it was designed immediately to philadelphia or which was much the most probable against this army as it was not to be conceived that genl howe would be rash enough to proceed across the country with one army in front while this under my command was so situated as to fall at any time upon his flank and rear without making an attempt to defeat and disperse it be the real design which it would certain it is a     disappointment and much chagreen followed for on the night of the   th a sudden retreat was made back to brunswick burning and destroying houses c as they went this retreat i am persuaded was the effect of dispair at finding the militia of this and the state of pennsylvania turning out to oppose them whilst they would have part of my force if they had attempted to cross the delar to oppose them in front at the passage of the river whilst i should be laying at them behind—and to attack my troops situated as i am they found impracticable without great loss and a probable defeat on sunday the   d they retired from brunswick to amboy but having intimation of the design the evening before i detached three brigades to fall upon their rear from whom i believe they received a pretty good peppering—some accounts make their loss in killed and wounded near  00 but the truth of this i do not undertake to vouch for as they are equal to indians in concealing their loss by a removal of their dead and were they to take up the business of scalping they would much resemble savages in every respect—so much is the boasted generosity and glory of britains fallen so soon as they got to amboy they began to transport their baggage and stores as fast as possible to staten island and having divested themselves of all incumbrance of this kind they moved out their whole force on thursday last and advanced rapidly towards us—what was the designe of this new manœuvre     i know not—whether to attempt our strength on the left as they had before done on our right—whether to cut of the light troops which i had advanced towards their lines—whether finding themselves a little disgraced by their former move they wanted to flourish off a little at quitting the jerseys—or whether by this sudden eruption they meant to possess themselves of as much fresh provision as they could plunder the inhabitants and spread desolation as i have said before i know not but certain it is they have left nothing which they could carry off robbing plundering and burning houses as they went—we followed them with light troops back to their works at amboy but could not prevent the desolation they committed i expect from appearances and my intelligence they will be imbarked in a few hours for staten island or new york for what other expedition time not i can discover—by means of their shipping and the easy transportation that shipping affords they have it much in their power to lead us a very disagreeable dance—my best wishes attends my sister and all the rest of the family  with every sentimt c george washington   july      middlebrook governor trumbull to governor trumbull camp at middlebrook   july      sir i had last night the honor of your letter of the   th of june the proposition which relates to the exchange of the gentlemen you mention is entirely     agreeable to me as they are now entitled to a releasement from the time of their captivity and fall within the rule of exchange i have prescribed to myself which is that of liberating those first who were first taken i am sorry it is not in my power to comply with your request for arms notwithstanding the many arrivals there is scarcely a sufficiency to supply the demands for the continental troops what has become of them i am unable to conceive every state complains of a deficiency and great part of their several quotas comes into the field very indifferently furnished and yet the public magazines are nearly exhausted the importations from time to time far exceed the number of continental troops raised to make use of them these have not and could not have been all put into their hands and yet there are very few of them now to be found undisposed of if they are not many of them in possession of the militia it is impossible to imagine where they are as a very inconsiderable part of them has fallen into the hands of the enemy the fluctuating state of the army and the irregular manner in which the militia usually left the camp rendered it impracticable to withdraw the arms entrusted to them at their coming out and gave them a fair opportunity of appropriating them to themselves which every reason obliges me to believe they did not fail to improve it appears to me highly probable that upon a careful scrutiny many individuals will be found in possession of more than their own use requires and the surplus will fully answer the purpose     you have in view it is painful to me to refuse any request of yours but when from the want of being fully acquainted with all circumstances it happens to interfere with the general good i am convinced it is your wish i should give the preference to that you will easily be sensible sir that it would be improper entirely to drain the public arsenals or to straighten the continental army in order to accommodate the militia in case of emergency it will be much more easy to draw them thence and put them into the hands of the inhabitants than if they were once distributed to them and should be wanted for the continental troops they could be recovered from them to answer the call should your state be seriously invaded and your militia unarmed you cannot doubt they would be supplied with every means of defence in the power of the public that any arms in store not immediately wanted for the army would be given to those who were disposed to make use of them but when continental arms are wanted for continental troops it cannot be expected that those should remain unsupplied and those arms be dedicated to another purpose they cannot in any case or at any time be so useful as in their hands— since my last the enemy disappointed in their attempt upon our right have made an experiment upon our left and frustrated in that also have now abandoned the jerseys and encamped upon staten island there is a great stir among their shipping and in all probability their next movement will be by water though it is impossible to decide with     certainty to what place but i last night received intelligence from general schuyler that general burgoyne is beginning to operate against ticonderoga and its dependencies if it is not merely a diversion but a serious attack of which it bears strongly the appearance it is a certain proof that the next step of general howes army will be towards peekskill and very suddenly if possible to get possession of the passes in the highlands before this army can have time to form a junction with the troops already there  to guard against contingencies i have ordered general parsonss and general varnums brigades to march off with all despatch towards peekskill and when they are arrived at or near that   0 post a reinforcement of four of the strongest massachusetts regiments will proceed thence immediately to albany on their way to ticonderoga i have also urged general clinton without loss of time to call out a respectable body of the new york militia to join general putnam i have the fullest confidence that you will do every thing you can to second my endeavors by forwarding as fast as possible the remaining troops of your state or whatever else may be in your power our greatest exertions will be requisite to counteract the enemy in their first attempts on which their success chiefly depends i have the honor to be with great respect sir c           george washington   july      middlebrook to the president of congress camp at middlebrook   july      sir the enclosed copies of general st clairs letters transmitted yesterday afternoon and last night by general schuyler i have thought it my duty to send to you the intelligence they contain is important and interesting nor are there circumstances wanting besides these to induce a belief or at least to raise a strong presumption that the enemy have in contemplation a junction of their two armies by way of the lakes and the north river if they have their whole canada force on the former it is certainly their object on receiving these accounts i wrote immediately to general putnam to embark nixons brigade for reinforcing the northern army to wait however the arrival or near approach of general parsonss and general varnums brigades from this place who march this morning or the coming in of an equal number of militia to supply their place before they sail this i have done by the advice of my general officers and it is all that is thought practicable in the present uncertain indeterminate situation of things the rest of the army will be held in readiness to move according to information and circumstances as i have observed if we were certain general burgoyne was approaching ticonderoga with his whole army i should not hesitate a moment in concluding that it is in consequence of a preconcerted plan with general howe and that the latter is to cooperate     with him by pushing his whole force up the north river and aiming a stroke in the first instance and immediately against the highland passes but as the appearance of the enemy on the lake may be a feint calculated to amuse and distract though it may seem like a real attack to draw this army to peekskill and more to the northward that general howe may with more facility turn his arms against philadelphia it has been determined unadvisable for us to move till we have further proofs of his intentions and that our conduct must be governed by his our situation is truly delicate and embarrassing should we march to peekskill leaving general howe on staten island there will be nothing to prevent his passing to south amboy and pushing from thence to philadelphia or in short by any other route though the marching such of his troops from the point opposite amboy as were encamped there and the sailing of the ships from princess bay yesterday morning are circumstances indicating that an embarkation has or will take place on the other hand if the north river and the possession of the highlands are his objects our remaining here till his views are certainly known may subject em to a risk that we wish to avoid thus let us examine matters as we will difficulties stare us in the face we shall attempt to consult and do the best we can i have written to generals putnam and george clinton fully upon the subject urging them to put forth every exertion in their power and instantly to call in a respectable body of militia to aid in the defence of those important     posts at this critical conjuncture i trust they will come out their services in all probability will be wanted but for a very short time i must earnestly request that you will send mr stewart the issuing commissary genl to camp immediately—there is reason to apprehend the army will be in great distress and confusion for want of issuing commissaries in three or four days—on saturday those with mr trumbull declare they will leave him without they are put on a different footing from what they now are i need not mention the consequences that will result from such an event if there are not others here to supply their places— there is one thing more i would add which is that there are not more than forty thousand dollars in the military chest and two months pay due to all the army except two or three regiments which have just obtained warrants one hundred and fifty six thousand out of the last supply sent the paymaster i was obliged to order to peekskill for the troops in that quarter whose demands are great and pressing also—i must earnestly entreat that you will forward a supply direct to the paymaster should we be obliged to move before the troops are paid much uneasiness  murmuring will be the certain attendants  i fear some thing worse as the enemy will adopt every stratagem and device to deceive  distress us notwithstanding the present appearances in favor of making an expedition up the north river i doubt not but you will have the most vigilant look outs kept along delaware bay     and proper express  signals for communicating the earliest intelligence i think it would be highly expedient that some sensible—judicious men should be employed in that business at this time who would view things as they ought to be and from whose accounts certain inferences and conclusions may be drawn so as to form a proper line for our conduct—the most fatal consequences may flow from false information at this period—things should be examined with all possible certainty—i shall not be surprized to hear of several ships appearing in or off delaware tho genl howes destination should be elsewhere—their fleet give them the most signal advantages and an opportunity of practising a thousand feints i have c  george washington   july      morris town general lee to general lee  headquarters morris town   july      dear sir i received your favor of the  th june in which you enter into consideration of the breach of parole imputed to lord drummond and give it as your opinion that his conduct has not been such as to justify the imputation it can answer no valuable purpose to enter into a discussion of the particulars of this affair which would     probably end as it began and leave his lordship and myself in the same way of thinking respecting it which we now entertain i shall only observe that at the time the matter happened it was clearly my sentiment and that of every gentleman with whom i conversed on the subject that his lordship had acted in an exceptionable manner irreconcileable to the true spirit of his parole no circumstance that has since come to my knowledge appears to me to be of sufficient weight to remove the suspicion and from any thing i know i must still retain the same idea of his conduct that i had at first  you cannot but be sensible my dear sir that the omission of trifling circumstances or a small difference in representing the same is capable of altering the complexion of a fact and make it appear in a light very opposite to that in which it ought really to stand and this will suggest the propriety of not being hasty in fixing your judgment as to the true nature of his lordships proceeding in this affair george washington   july      morris town edward rutledge to governor rutledge headquarters morris town   july      sir a few days since i had the honor of your letter of may  th in which you refer me to general howe for an explanation of the reasons for declining the attempt upon st augustine recommended by me     i meant nothing more than to propose it for consideration and that you and the general who would be fully acquainted with all circumstances should judge of the propriety and adopt or reject it as you thought most expedient the reasons for not undertaking it appear to me intirely solid and satisfactory and i am satisfied that had it been practicable your best endeavors would not have been wanting to forward and give it success the enemy after manœuvring awhile in the jerseys have at last abandoned it and are now incamped upon staten island their preparations during the winter indicated a design upon philadelphia but it would have been too hazardous to have attempted passing the delaware unless they could first have given a blow to this army they could not but expect some opposition in front and so formidable a force hanging upon their rear unchecked and in full spirits would probably have made them repent the enterprize—they were sensible of this and all their movements were apparently calculated to draw us to an engagement with them on terms that would give them a prospect of defeating us which if they could have effected even in part would have facilitated their project against philadelphia but finding we kept ourselves advantageously posted and that they would be obliged to fight us if they did it at all on a very unequal footing they seem to have relinquished their purpose and to be on some different plan we took every opportunity of skirmishing with them and from various accounts we have     reason to believe to very good effect and with little loss to ourselves by the motions among their shipping they appear to be preparing for some expedition by water—it is impossible to determine with precision where we have lately received intelligence from general schuyler that the enemy are beginning to operate against ticonderoga—if this proves to be any thing more than a diversion there is no doubt general howe will proceed up hudsons river for if they have any rational end in view it must be a junction of the two armies to intercept the communication between the eastern and southern states and will make it necessary for howe and carleton to cooperate—but this may be nothing more than a diversion to keep a large body of our forces in that quarter while their troops except a sufficient number to garrison the place are coming round by water to join their main army under general howe—our situation is truly delicate and perplexing and makes us sensibly feel now as we have often done before the great advantage they derive from their navy but we are doing the best we can in our circumstances and keep in sight the different objects to which they may direct their attention as the information from the northward was such as merited notice i have sent a reinforcement thither from peeks kill and have dispatched a couple of brigades hence to that post—we have also moved the whole army to a position more convenient for throwing speedy succors over the north river than the one     we lately occupied and at the same time sufficiently near to philadelphia to oppose any attempt of the enemy to possess themselves of that city i have c george washington   july      morris town general sullivan to general sullivan morris town   july      dear sir since i had the pleasure of seeing you some of the officers have been suggesting a plan for cutting off the enemys post at bergen which they seem to think could be easily effected—as it may be in your power to collect certain information of the strength c of that guard which i understand consists of new levies i would refer the matter intirely to your consideration  discretion wishing that if your accounts are such as would promise a tolerable certainty of success you would make the attempt i need not mention to you that the most profound secresy is necessary upon every occasion of this nature  very particularly on this as two minutes notice would give them an opportunity of withdrawing across the causeway where it would be impossible for you to get at them—to prevent this a small party should be dispatchd before the rest by some different rout which should occupy the post near bergen by which means every intelligence might be kept from them no soul being allowd to go in should this enterprize appear so feasible as to risque it i shall expect soon to hear from you you will observe to march     your troops at such hours as will prevent their being hurt by the excessive heat of the weather it will be prudent at all events to send a party of   or  00 men somewhere beyond hackensac under a cautious active officer from which small parties may be sent up to fort lee and along the north river to observe every motion of the enemy about new york by land or water—two or three light dragoons should be with them to convey every necessary intelligence to you in order that i may be apprized as early as possible i am c george washington   july      morristown governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters morristown   july      sir i had the honor of writing to you the  d instant with a postscript the  th i there informed you of the enemy having evacuated the jerseys and of the intelligence received from ticonderoga which induced me to suppose it highly probable the next operation of general howe would be up the north river but as i have received no information since the first of the   th ult to confirm the expectation of a serious attempt in that quarter i am led very much to suspect that the hostile appearances that way may be only a diversion to keep awake our apprehensions for the security of the posts there prevent our drawing away any part of our forces from thence and even tempt us to weaken ourselves   0 here by sending reinforcements to them while the real design may be to attack elsewhere this supposition is also agreeable to the accounts we daily receive from deserters and others who come from the enemy we are told by these that accommodations for horses are filling up in the transports that they are taking in large supplies of provisions water and provender and that officers baggage is continually transporting on board of them from new york marked with their names and the corps they belong to these representations if true seem to denote an expedition that would take longer time than would be necessary for one up the north river but where is all matter of conjecture and cannot be determined with any degree of certainty prudence dictates that we should be as much upon our guard as possible every where and on this account i have thought it my duty to communicate to you the information i have received that in case anything should be meditated against the eastern states you may not be taken by surprise but may have warning to put matters in the best situation you can to give them a proper reception on my part no vigilance nor exertion shall be wanting to ascertain their intentions and give effectual assistance wherever they may direct their efforts since my last i have had advices from the southward that the public magazines there are entirely emptied of arms and that the troops now coming on will be destitute unless they can be supplied out of     those imported to the eastward this will oblige me to order most of the arms at springfield to be sent forward to furnish those troops it is matter of equal concern and surprise to hear such loud complaints in the eastern states for want of arms when we consider the quantities brought into them both on public as well as private account which their situation enabled them to receive in much greater proportion than the other states and the arrivals of which have been announced in all the public papers as well as in private and official letters how they have been applied it is impossible for me to conceive in case of an actual invasion of your state should such an event take place and should there be a necessity for it towards furnishing your militia you may draw out of the store at springfield a thousand arms for that purpose if there be any remaining after the number i shall be obliged to call for is supplied this you will be pleased to consider as a loan not a sale and to be replaced as soon as circumstances will permit by the enclosed i have instructed the commissary of stores to deliver them i have the honor to be c p s the enclosed information came to hand since writing the above the other letters you will be pleased to forward as directed with all despatch they are inclined to put the other eastern states upon their guard also      george washington  0 july      morristown to the president of congress morristown  0 july      sir i this morning received a letter of the  th instant from general schuyler a copy of which and of its enclosure i herewith send you the intelligence     which they contain is truly interesting supposing it just but it differs so widely from what we had reason to expect from the accounts mentioned in general st clairs letters to general schuyler copies of which you would receive in his letter transmitted from hence last night by major hoops that i would fain flatter myself it is not true i am the more encouraged to hope this as captain farnhams letter from fort anne to brigadier learned seems to be the foundation of the whole and does not authorize the unfavorable and unhappy conclusions built upon it i should rather suppose if any accident has befallen us it must have happened to the detachment of men from the grants under colonel warner for we find from general st clairs letters he expected something from him the whole account is so confused that we cannot establish any certain deduction from it and i shall be happy if it proves premature and groundless  i am told by a gentleman who came to camp yesterday evening that nixons brigade would certainly arrive at albany on tuesday morning as he saw the vessels in which it was embarked standing     up the evening before with a fair wind if the event mentioned by general schuyler should not have happened we cannot doubt but general burgoyne has come up the lake determined if possible to carry his point i mean to possess himself of our posts in that quarter and to push his arms further supposing this not to have happened as our continental levies are so deficient in their number our security and safety will require that aids from the militia should be called forth in cases of emergency if it has there is now an absolute necessity for their turning out to check general burgoynes progress or the most disagreeable consequences may be apprehended upon this occasion i would take the liberty to suggest to congress the propriety of sending an active spirited officer to conduct and lead them on if general arnold has settled his affairs and can be spared from philadelphia i would recommend him for this business and that he should immediately set out for the northern department he is active judicious and brave and an officer in whom the militia will repose great confidence besides this he is well acquainted with that country and with the routes and most important passes and defiles in it i do not think he can render more signal service or be more usefully employed at this time than in this way i am persuaded his presence and activity will animate the militia greatly and spur them on to a becoming conduct i could wish him to be engaged in a more agreeable service to be with better troops but circumstances call for his     exertions in this way and i have no doubt of his adding much to the honors he has already acquired in consequence of the advices from general st clair and the strong probability there is that general howe will push against the highland passes to cooperate with general burgoyne i shall by the advice of my officers move the army from hence tomorrow morning towards the north river if such should be his intention we shall not be too early as a favorable wind and tide will carry him up in a few hours on the other hand if philadelphia is his object he cannot get round before we can arrive there nor can he well debark his troops and proceed across the land before we can oppose him i have the honor to be c      george washington    july      pumpton plains majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam headquarters pumpton plains    july      dear sir in consequence of the disagreeable event which has taken place in the evacuation of ticonderoga and fort independence—though our situation does not make it prudent to send on any very considerable reinforcements immediately besides those already gone yet it is necessary we should be preparing to throw them in when it can be more safely done and the true state of affairs in that quarter is more clearly unfolded i have there fore to desire you will order general glover to hold his brigade in constant readiness to embark at a moments warning and at the same time that you will collect at your post as fast as possible a sufficient number of vessels to transport them with their baggage tents c to albany you will also send forward immediately some active trusty officer to meet such detachments as may be coming on belonging to the regiments that compose general nixons brigade with orders if he meets them where they can be sent by a short rout     and in an expeditious manner to join their corps to hasten them on accordingly without letting them come to peeks kill but such as he may find so far advanced towards it as to render it more conducive to dispatch to come on and go thence by water he is to make them continue their march with all speed and on their arrival with you—you are without the least loss of time to forward them to their regiments i mean that you should act in this in the manner best calculated according to circumstances—to answer the end of their joining the corps they belong to with the greatest expedition possible i have determined that ten field pieces with the necessary apparatus shall be sent on from your post to general schuyler—general knox will send up an officer with particular directions about them—you will be pleased to give every assistance requisite to the forwarding them with dispatch i have just received intelligence that general howes army is nearly all embarked—they will certainly proceed very soon to the place of their destination—our misfortune to the northward makes it of the last importance you should take every precaution to avoid one at your post which could not fail to involve consequences almost if not intirely irremediable—as a very material step towards this i would recommend to you to contract the points of defence and secure your flanks and rear as much as possible by stopping up all roads by which you are accessible in any part that are not absolutely necessary to keep open your communication with the     country from whence you draw your supplies—attend particularly to the cross roads leading from the valley on the right of the great road from peekskill to fish kills into that road and do not content yourself with slight impediment easily removed but endeavor to made them effectual be attentive also to the roads that lead from croton by the way of danbury or elsewhere towards fishkills—the fewer the avenues of approach to you the more certain the judgment you can form of the enemys intentions and operations the more easily you can adapt your measures to them and the greater will be your force at the point of attack i am c p s i have had an intimation of some vessels moving up the sound this is a circumstance well worth attending to keep trusty persons at norwalk fairfield and any other places convenient for observation to give you instant intelligence of any movements that way george washington    july      pompton plains de coudray to de coudray headquarters pompton plains    july      sir your favor of the  th instant by capt de goy was handed me the   th i was then on my march for this place which together with other intervening circumstances has put it out of my power before to consider your observations and form a determination concerning them you seem to have misunderstood the purport of what i said in my last with respect to the heavy     pieces that came in the amphitrite and to suppose that i considered them as intirely unfit for service and incapable of transportation—i meant only to point out the inconveniency of them in comparison with others of a much lighter construction and the advantage that would be derived from casting them over and producing three pieces of a larger calibre instead of one—and informed you that with a view to these i had given directions for them to remain at springfield and be cast anew upon the model on which the pieces generally in use in our army are constructed i am sensible that they might be made use of but i am convinced from my own experience and that of others that their weight is a very great disadvantage—that they are not transportable but with great difficulty through the mountainous and woody country in which our operations most commonly are and that they are extremely liable to be lost when any accident or misfortune happens—this must be obvious on the slightest reflection and it is also self evident that they require a greater force in horses and men to transport and manage them than pieces two thirds lighter unless the superior weight of metal in the former was counterbalanced by their carriages being framed on better principles than those of the latter which i have no reason to believe is the case from any description i have had of them—and as it is not the case the necessity that their carriages should be proportionably substantial to support them adds to the inconvenience of weight and the difficulty of transportation   0 to compensate for this disadvantage i know of only two considerations that can be offered that their length is conducive to exactness and the other that it increases the distance of the balls flight the difference in these respects is not very great nor are these advantages by any means equivalent to that of a piece being light and easily portable—for field artillery being designed to act against numbers to do execution the object ought to be near and within reach of grape shot if it is the distance to which the piece will carry is nearly out of the question and the difference in the exactness of which two pieces are capable will make little difference if any in the effect of their fire  the length of a piece may be useful in barbettefiring but this is of little moment compared with the inconveniences that attend it and we have found by experience that those in use with us have answered every valuable end in this way the british army sensible of the necessity of light pieces in a country like this seldom or never make use of any other they even exceed us in their attention     to this particular and bring into the field very few pieces heavier than three or four pounders weighing from   0 to  00 weight the alteration i propose is not a new experiment i mean only to reduce them to the same standard with the general run of the artillery in this army which we have the fullest evidence will be far more convenient and which have been from repeated trial found sufficient for every desirable purpose you suggest the impropriety of letting the twenty one pieces remain unemployed during the time they undergo a new manufacture while the present moment calls for them in the field this observation is not without force but it has been fully weighed and considering all things is not of importance enough to make it expedient to forego the advantages of reducing them to a more portable size and increasing the number by casting them over— you also misconceived what i said with respect to the light cannon waiting at springfield till ammunition waggons and men sufficient for them could be prepared to accompany them i did not intend that they should wait till the waggons could be made and till a proper number of men to manœuver them could be instructed in their duty but only till ammunition could be fitted up waggons procured in the most expeditious manner and men come on from the eastward which they will do as fast as possible—you cannot but suppose sir that i am fully desirous of having all the artillery that i deem proper for the service with the army and that i shall take every     step our circumstances will permit to hasten them forward twenty light pieces and two heavy are by this time at or very near peekskill and the remainder of the light will come on as soon as they can be accommodated with horses and other necessaries i am at a loss to conceive how you could imagine that i had been governed in my determinations on this matter by the advice of monsieur du plessis though that gentlemans conduct since he has been in this country has been such as to acquire him every proper mark of attention yet it can hardly be supposed that either general knox or myself would repose so implicit a confidence in his representations and counsels as to regulate our measures intirely by them in an affair of so much consequence i had a description of the pieces from several others who had an opportunity of seeing them and whose accounts perfectly agree with your own and from this i determined what should be done with them monsieur du plessis never hinted an idea of casting them over before it was resolved to do it you are even mistaken as to the fact of monsieur du plessis being an aid de camp to general knox with a commission of captain of artillery in the american service he only acts as volunteer in general knoxs family i shall be at all times obliged to you for any information respecting the state of the artillery and your opinion as to any thing you may think eligible but i am not as yet authorized to consider you as giving advice or direction in an official capacity since congress     have not instructed me in what light i am to view you and i am not at liberty to anticipate events that may hereafter take place or to suppose you invested with any character that they have not delineated you in to me for this reason it would be irregular to interfere with any arrangements general knox has made with my approbation in compliance with those you propose therefore and as every thing seems to me to be already in a very good train i do not think it necessary that capt de goy should proceed to take the direction of the pieces coming on as you recommend george washington    july      pompton plains majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler headquarters pompton plains    july      dear sir i wrote to you yesterday by express informing you of what i had done towards furnishing you with such supplies as are in my power to give and the obstacles that at present lie in the way of granting you others that your situation demands since that i have received yours of the  th  i have sent by express to     peekskill to order on from thence to you as speedily as possible forty barrels of powder and an equivalent quantity of lead it is astonishing beyond expression that you have heard nothing of st clair and the army under him i am totally at a loss to conceive what has become of them the whole affair is so mysterious that it even baffles conjecture i know not how to suppose it possible that they can be on any route towards us without our hearing something of them and even if they have been all taken prisoners one would imagine that the account of it by some channel or other would have come to your knowledge sometimes i am led to doubt whether it may not be possible that they had recalled their design of retreating from the forts and returned to them but here again it occurs that they could have found some means to communicate intelligence of it to you i impatiently wait more certain accounts of their fate  meantime i hope you will leave nothing in your power undone to check the career of the enemy this is the second day i have been detained here by the badness of the weather as soon as it will permit i shall prosecute my march through the clove i am c george washington    july      clove majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler clove    july      dear sir i last night received your favor of the  0th instant amidst the unfortunate reverse that has taken place     in our affairs i am happy to hear that general st clair and his army are not in the hands of the enemy i really feared they had become prisoners the evacuation of ticonderoga and mount independence is an event of chagrin and surprise not apprehended nor within the compass of my reasoning i know not upon what principle it was founded and i should suppose it still more difficult to reconcile it if the garrison amounted to five thousand men in high spirits healthy well supplied with provision and ammunition and the eastern militia marching to their succor as you mention in your letter of the  th to the council of safety of new york  this stroke is severe indeed and has distressed us much notwithstanding things at present have a dark  gloomy aspect i hope a spirited opposition will check the progress of general burgoynes arms and that the confidence derived from his success will hurry him into measures that will in their consequences be favourable to us—we should never despair our situation before has been unpromising and has changed for the better—so i trust it will again—if new difficulties arise we must only put forth new exertions and proportion our efforts to the exigency of the times as the operations of this army are uncertain depending much upon general howes which     still remain to be known i think it will be expedient that you should send down to new windsor and fishkill all the vessels and craft you may not have occasion for at albany to be in readiness for transporting a part of our force up the river in case the situation of affairs should require it and circumstances will admit i should suppose his movement will be up the river to coöperate with mr burgoyne and with a view if possible of concentrating their forces this idea prompted me to advise what i have respecting the vessels and more particularly as carrying our troops by water will not only facilitate their arrival but fit em for more immediate service than marching by land in cases of emergency i observe you mention the evacuation of fort george as a necessary act for my own part i cannot determine upon the propriety of such a measure being totally unacquainted with its strength and situation and of the grounds adjoining but there are gentlemen here who seem to consider it extremely defensible and of great importance they say that a spirited brave judicious officer with two or three hundred good men together with the armed vessels you have built would retard general burgoynes passage across the lake for a considerable time if not render it impracticable and oblige him to take a much more difficult and circuitous route i only mean to submit it to your consideration hoping that whatever is best will be pursued in this and every other instance  i am dear sir yours c     george washington    july      new jersey william howe to lieutenantgeneral sir william howe new jersey    july      sir the fortune of war having thrown majorgeneral prescott into our hands  i beg leave to propose his exchange for that of majorgeneral lee this proposition being agreeable to the letter and spirit of the agreement subsisting between us will i hope have your approbation i am the more induced to expect it as it will not only remove one ground of controversy between us but in its consequences effect the exchange of lieutenantcolonel campbell and the hessian fieldofficers for a like number of ours of equal rank in your possession i shall be obliged by     your answer upon the subject assuring you that majorgeneral prescott shall be sent in if the proposed exchange is acceded to either on the previous releasement of general lee or your promise that the same shall immediately take place on general prescotts return i have the honor c george washington    july      governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters at the clove    july      sir i have the honor of yours of the   th with its enclosures i had some time before received the account of the evacuation of ticonderoga but upon what grounds or for what reasons this sudden resolution was taken i have not yet learnt i have not heard from general schuyler since the  0th he was then at fort edward and expected that general st clair who was at bedford with the troops that he brought off would join him in a few days i am in hopes by my not hearing from genl schuyler since the  0th that general burgoyne has not followed his success with much rapidity i have sent up such a reinforcement of men and artillery as i could spare and i am not without hopes that when the army in that quarter collect again and have taken breath after their late confusion they will be able with the assistance of the militia to check burgoyne in a country which i am informed is very strong by nature the capture of general prescott was a bold enterprise and will give us an opportunity of making a demand of the releasement of general lee in such     a manner that i think general howe cannot with honor refuse to comply until i know general howes determination upon this matter i would not have general prescott sent forward i would have him genteelly accommodated but strongly guarded i would not admit him to parole as general howe has not thought proper to grant general lee that indulgence i have just received a letter from general parsons in which he informs me that he understands general prescott is to be sent to windham which he says is by no means a place of safety as it would be easy for him to effect an escape to long island by means of the disaffected i therefore beg he may be removed further from the sound and into some place where the people are generally well affected a vigilant officer should be sent with him whose constant care he should remain under for by shifting of guards it is more than probable that some inattentive person might give him an opportunity of making his escape i am in hopes if general lees exchange is acceded to that a general exchange of prisoners may be brought about as the former treatment of that gentleman was one principal bar to its being carried into execution before i am c george washington    july      clove majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler headquarters at the clove    july      dear sir as i have not had the pleasure of hearing from you since the  0th instant i am induced to hope that the enemy have not pursued their success with the rapidity   0 that was to be apprehended and that general st clair will have formed a junction with you before they advance upon you immediately upon the receipt of your first letter concerning the distress you would labor under for want of the assistance of an active officer well acquainted with the country i wrote to congress and desired them to send up general arnold provided the matter before them respecting his rank was settled in such a manner that determined him to continue in service upon my requisition general arnold waiving for the present all dispute about rank left philadelphia and arrived here last evening and this day proceeds on his journey to join you although he conceives himself had his promotion been regular superior in command to general st clair yet he generously upon this occasion lays aside his claim and will create no dispute should the good of the service require them to act in concert i need not enlarge upon the well known activity conduct and bravery of general arnold the proofs he has given of all three have gained him the confidence of the public and of the army the eastern troops in particular i will not condemn or even pass a censure upon any officer unheard but i think it a duty which general st clair owes to his own character to insist upon an opportunity of giving the reasons for his sudden evacuation of a post which but a few days before he by his own letters thought tenable at least for a while people at a distance are apt to form wrong conjectures and if general st clair has     good reasons for the step he has taken i think the sooner he justifies himself the better i have mentioned these matters because he may not know that his conduct is looked upon as very unaccountable by all ranks of people in this part of the country if he is reprehensible the public have an undoubted right to call for that justice which is due from an officer who betrays or gives up his post in an unwarrantable manner when i had proceeded thus far yours of the   th came to hand enclosing a copy of the council of war held at ticonderoga before the evacuation i shall as you desire transmit a copy of it to congress by that account the strength of the garrison falls very short of the returns made to me a little while before but much more so of your estimate in yours of the—in which you say the garrison consisted of five thousand men i have already sent you off the ten pieces of artillery compleatly fixed a quantity of cartridges ready made are ordered on and six tons of ball with cartridge paper sufficient to make them up all the camp kettles that were to be spared from this place and peekskill are gone on and i most heartily wish i could send you tents genl mifflin is making an exact scrutiny into the number of tents here and if any can be drawn from the regiments they shall be sent to you tho they be but few the remainder of nixons brigade will follow the moment they arrive at peekskill they are all that i can possibly spare in my present situation to weaken this army more     than is prudent would perhaps bring destruction upon it and i look upon the keeping it upon a respectable footing as the only measure that will prevent a junction of howes and burgoines armies which if effected may have the most fatal consequences the thirty pieces of light artillery which want carriages should be sent immediately away if you can get them transported into new england or any place of safety let it be done i can give you no particular directions for your conduct but i trust that every proper step will be taken to make a vigorous defence i am c george washington    july      clove to the brigadiergenerals of militia in the western parts of massachusetts and connecticut headquarters at the clove    july      gentlemen the evacuation of ticonderoga has opened a door for the enemy unless speedily and vigorously opposed to penetrate the northern parts of the state of new york and the western parts of new hampshire and massachusetts bay it is also to be feared that they will form a junction by the way of the north river with general howe and thereby cut off the communication between the eastern and southern states i need not represent to you how fatal such a measure would prove to the interests and liberties of the united states it cannot be supposed that the small number of continental troops assembled at fort edward are alone sufficient to check the progress of the enemy to the militia therefore must     we look for support in this time of tryal and i trust that you will immediately upon receipt of this if you have not done it already march with at least one third part of the militia under your command and rendezvous at saratoga unless directed to some other place by general schuyler or arnold i would recommend it to you to engage your men to remain in service for a limited time to be regularly relieved by others at the expiration of that time we shall then know what force we have to depend upon and it will also be more convenient for the men part of whom may be gathering their harvests while the others are bravely defending their country general arnold who is so well known to you all goes up at my request to take the command of the militia in particular and i have no doubt but you will under his conduct and direction repel an enemy from your borders who not content with hiring mercenaries to lay waste your country have now brought savages with the avowed and express intent of adding murder to desolation i am c p s this to be forwarded by express from one brigadier to the other  george washington    july      clove livingston gerry clymer to the committee of congress  camp at the clove    july      gentlemen the little notice i had of your coming to the army and the shortness of your stay in camp will     more than probably occasion the omission of many matters which of right ought to be laid before you—and the interruption which my thoughts constantly meet by a variety of occurrences must apologize for the crude and indigested manner in which they are offered the completion of the continental regiments is a matter of such infinite importance that i think no means should be left unessayed to accomplish it—drafting where the powers of government are adequate would be the speediest and most effectual but if it should be thought unadvisable to attempt this mode next to it i would recommend that the business of recruiting should be taken entirely out of the hands of the officers of the army and that each state should appoint some person of known activity one for instance who has been a good under sheriff in each county or township not only to recruit but to apprehend deserters—these persons to be liberally rewarded for each recruit and deserter whom they shall deliver at stated periods and places to officers appointed to receive—discipline and march them to the army—none of these recruiters to have the smallest power to act out of their own districts but     to be absolutely fixed to them—a mode of this kind would in my humble opinion be less burthensome to the public than the present prevent the idle habits which recruiting officers contract not only injurious to themselves but others the most effectual means which can be devised for the recovery of deserters the surest way of keeping your regiments of equal strength and of making the duty more equal in the detail of it in a word many valuable advantages would result from it whilst i can suggest but one reason against it and that fully satisfied i am when weighed in the scale of interest will not operate i mean the keeping so many officers in camp who might be spared from the duties of the field till the regiments are stronger than at present—the sixteen additional regiments labor under such disadvantages in some states as to render the interposition of congress in some shape or other indispensably necessary with respect to food considering we are in such an extensive and abundant country no army was ever worse supplied than ours with many essential articles of it—our soldiers the greatest part of last campaign and the whole of this have scarcely tasted any kind of vegetables had but little salt and vinegar which would have been a tolerable substitute for vegetables have been in a great measure strangers to neither have they been provided with proper drink—beer or cyder seldom comes within the verge of the camp and rum in much too small quantities—thus to devouring large quantities of     animal food untemperd by vegetables or vinegar or by any kind of drink but water and eating indifferent bread but for this last a remedy is providing are to be ascribed the many putrid diseases incident to the army and the lamentable mortality that attended us last campaign—if these evils can be remedied the expence and trouble ought not to be obstacles—though some kind of vegetables are not to be had others are which together with sour crout and vinegar might easily be had if proper persons acquainted with the business were employed therein soap is another article in great demand the continental allowance is too small and dear as every necessary of life is now got a soldiers pay will not enable him to purchase by which means his consequent dirtiness adds not a little to the disease of the army— i have no reason to accuse the clothier genl of inattention to his department and therefore as his supplies are incompetent to the wants of the army i am to suppose his resources are unequal ought not each state to be called upon to draw such supplies from the country manufactories as can be afforded particularly of shoes stockings shirts and blankets articles indispensably necessary and of which scarce too many can be provided—in the meanwhile every provision to be making for clothing the troops uniformly and warm in the winter it is a maxim which needs no illustration that nothing can be of more importance in an army than the     clothing and feeding it well—on these the health comfort and spirits of the soldiers essentially depend and it is a melancholy fact that the american army are miserably defective in both these respects—the distress most of them are in for want of clothing is painful to humanity dispiriting to themselves and discouraging to every officer—it makes every pretention to the preservation of cleanliness impossible exposes them to a variety of disorders—and abates or destroys that military pride without which nothing can be expected from any army the consequence of giving rank indiscriminately is much to be dreaded—great dissatisfaction has already arisen on account of bestowing this on officers in the civil departments of the army on the inferior staffs waggon masters c who by custom propriety and every other motive are excluded from it in all well regulated armies the too great liberality practised in this respect will destroy the pride of rank where it ought to exist and will not only render it cheap—but contemptible it is the policy of all armies to make it valued and respected as a stimulus to emulation and an incitement to bold and gallant undertaking—it must be very unadviseable therefore in our infant state of war to adopt novel customs to bring it into discredit which must and will be the consequence of making it too common besides the disgust it creates in others an auditor of accounts to be constantly with the army is absolutely requisite—it is impossible for me crowded as i am with other business to examine     and adjust the numerous complex accounts of the army with that correctness the public have a right to expect before warrants pass for payment and without doing it great impositions may follow—the provision for making regimental paymasters regulate all regimental accounts is altogether incompetent to the end proposed from it for these men being appointed generally agreeable to the recommendation of the field officers of the regiments they belong to associating constantly with the officers of their corps—and in a great measure under their controul cannot be considered as sufficiently uninfluenced nor are auditors at a distance from the army of much use as it would require a delay not admissible to send accounts to them to audit before they were passed and paid in consequence of warrants from the commander in chief of the army a good geographer to survey the roads and take sketches of the country where the army is to act would be extremely useful and might be attended with exceeding valuable consequences—he might with propriety have the chief direction of the guides who must have a head to procure govern and pay them—if such a person should be approved of i would beg leave to recommend mr robt erskine who is thoroughly skilled in this business—has already assisted us in making maps of the country and has as i am informed uniformly supported the character of a fast friend to america a small travelling press to follow head quarters would be productive of many eminent advantages—it     would enable us to give speedy and exact information of any military transactions that take place with proper comments upon them and thereby frustrate the pernicious tendency of falsehood and misrepresentation which in my opinion of whatever complexion they may be are in the main detrimental to our cause—if the people had a channel of intelligence that from its usual authenticity they could look up to with confidence they might often be preserved from that despondency which they are apt to fall into from the exaggerated pictures our enemies and their emissaries among us commonly draw of any misfortunes we meet with and from that diffidence of truths favorable to us which they must naturally feel from the frequent deception they are exposed to by the extravagant colorings our friends often give to our successes—it would also be very useful to dispatch business in camp being the most expeditious means of taking copies of any orders or other matters that require to be dispersed and would save a good deal in returns and other papers we are often obliged to get printed in philadelphia an ingenious man to accompany this press and be employed wholly in writing for it might render it singularly beneficial i am exceedingly embarrassed how to dispose of the french officers in general but more especially the artillery officers who are come out under the sanction of a compact i can think of no other way than that of forming a separate corps of them and draughting men from the whole line to compose that corps—but even this will be attended with many  00 disagreable effects—among others this is not the least that officers will think themselves much injured to have the men they have had the trouble of raising taken from them and given to others—there is something in this which is discouraging and breaks the spirit of a good officer who prides himself in having a full and compleat corps a doubt has arisen whether a person who belongs to any of the united states of america and who owed allegiance to any of the said states that went to the enemy some time past and since that time has been lurking about any of the fortifications or about any of the encampments of the armies of the united states plundering and driving off cattle to the enemy recruiting for them or committing any other attrocious crime or who is appointed an officer in the enemies army can be tried by a general court martial under the resolution of congress of the   st of august      and punished as a spye i have c  george washington    july      clove majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath headquarters at the clove    july      dear sir i have your favs of the  th and  0th instants i am pleased to find from the copy of the letter from  0  bordeaux that matters wore so good a face in france it is more than probable that they will push an advantageous trade with us before a formal declaration of war indeed if they were to strike a blow before the declaration they would only repay england for playing a game of the same kind in the year      there is a very material difference between the returns you transmit me and genl st clairs account of the garrison of ticonderoga by a copy of the council of war before the evacuation it appears that they had only  0   effectives and  00 militia your return of massachusetts troops that has marched amounts to    0 there were besides these four regiments of new hampshire troops these are mysteries which a proper enquiry must clear up i have sent genl arnold up to join genl schuyler who is collecting a force near fort edward by the latest accounts the enemy had not advanced in force from skeensborough i therefore hope that with genl arnold assistance in whom the army and militia in particular place great confidence matters will be put in a more favorable train    genl howe still lays intirely quiet on board the fleet at staten island very few troops remain on shore and the destination a profound secret whatever were his intentions before this unlucky blow to the northward he certainly ought in good policy to endeavor to coöperate with genl burgoine i am so fully of opinion that this will be his plan that i  0  have advanced the army thus far to support our party at peeks kill should the enemy move up the river     george washington    july      clove to the president of congress camp eleven miles in the clove    july      sir we have been under great embarrassments respecting the intended operations of general howe and still are notwithstanding the utmost pains to obtain intelligence of the same  at present it would appear that he is going out to sea by authentic information there are only forty ships at new york the rest are gone elsewhere and have fallen down between the narrows and the hook between these two places the number from the most accurate observation was about one hundred and twenty yesterday as i observed before their destination is uncertain and unknown but i have thought it my duty to inform congress of these facts that they may give orders  0  to the militia to hold themselves in readiness to march at the shortest notice in case philadelphia should be their object at the same time i am to request that they will have a sufficient number of proper lookouts fixed at the capes of delaware to whose accounts implicit confidence may be given to make the earliest reports of the arrival of any fleet which congress will transmit by the speediest conveyance as the enemy will probably make many feints and have it unhappily but too much in their power from their shipping i would advise that the lookouts should be cautioned to be extremely accurate in their observations and reports mentioning with as much precision as possible the number of ships that may appear our situation is already critical and may be rendered still more so by inaccurate and illgrounded intelligence from the advices received on saturday of the movements of part of the enemys ships and the strong reasons there were to suppose general howe would push up the north river to coöperate with general burgoyne i detached lord stirling with his division to peekskill on sunday morning they crossed the river that evening and the next morning this movement will prove unnecessary should his destination be to the southward i have also ordered general glovers brigade from peekskill to reinforce general schuyler from his representations of the inadequacy of his force to oppose general burgoyne and of the seeming backwardness of the people in that quarter to afford him aid i have the honor to be c  0  p s i think the works at billingsport well worthy of attention and it is expedient to effect their completion as soon as possible george washington    july      clove majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler eleven miles in the clove    july      dear sir i yesterday evening received the favor of your letters of the   th    th inst with their inclosures i am heartily glad you have found two such advantageous spots to take post at and i hope the progress of the enemy will not be so rapid as to prevent your throwing up such lines as you may esteem necessary for their defence  though our affairs for some days past have worn a dark and gloomy aspect i yet look forward to a fortunate and happy change i trust general burgoynes army will meet sooner or later an effectual check and as i suggested before that the success he has had will precipitate his ruin from your accounts he appears to be pursuing that line of conduct which of all others is most favorable to us i mean acting in detachment this conduct will certainly give room for enterprise on our part and expose his parties to great hazard could we be so happy as to cut one of them off supposing it should not exceed four five or six hundred men it would inspirit the people and do away much of their present anxiety in such an event they would lose  0  sight of past misfortunes and urged at the same time by a regard for their own security they would fly to arms and afford every aid in their power your exertions to bring the people to view things in their proper light to impress them with a just sense of the fatal consequences that will result to themselves their wives their children and their country from their taking a wrong part and for preventing toryism cannot be too great general burgoyne i have no doubt will practise every art which his invention shall point out to turn their minds and seduce them from their allegiance he should be counteracted as much as possible as it is of the last importance to keep them firm and steady in their attachments you have already given your attention to this matter and i am persuaded you will omit nothing in your power to effect these great and essential points stopping the roads and ordering the cattle to be removed were certainly right and judicious if they are well accomplished the enemy must be greatly retarded and distressed i hope before this you have received the supplies of ammunition mentioned in my late letters i fully expected too that the camp kettles which i ordered from hence on your first application had reached you till yesterday when i found on enquiry that the qr master by some accident did not send em before three or four days ago there will be no occasion to transmit to congress a copy of your observations suggesting the necessity of evacuating fort george the gentlemen who  0  mentioned the holding of that post had taken up an idea that it was defensible with the assistance of the vessels on the lake which were supposed to be better equipped and what gave countenance to the idea was that the bastion was erected under the direction and superintendence of british engineers and was intended as part of a very large strong and extensive work i thought it expedient to submit the matter to your further consideration wishing you at the same time to pursue such measures respecting it as your own judgment should advise and direct i could heartily wish harmony and a good understanding to prevail through the whole army and between the army and the people the times are critical big with important events they demand our most vigorous efferts and unless a happy agreement subsists they will be feeble and ineffectual the enemies of america have cultivated nothing with greater or with so much industry as to sow division and jealousy amongst us i cannot give you any certain account of general howes intended operations his conduct is puzzling and embarasssing beyond measure so are the informations which i got at one time the ships are standing up towards the north river in a little while they are going up the sound and in an hour after they are going out of the hook i think in a day or two we must know something of his intentions i am c p s it will not be advisable to repose too much confidence in the works you are about to erect and from thence to collect a large quantity of stores i  0  begin to consider lines as a kind of trap and as not answering the valuable purposes expected from em unless they are on passes that cannot be avoided by an enemy george washington    july      clove lord stirling to lord stirling camp near clove    july      my lord since my last to you dated at galloways in the clove i have marchd one division of the army to this place whilst two others proceeded to chester to be ready to march by a back road to philada if need be or to cross at new windsor if the enemy contrary to our present expectation should attempt to operate up the north or east rivers i have to request that your lordship would apply to genl putnam to have boats ready to throw your division and such other troops as occasion shall require across the north river with the utmost expedition upon notice given which if at all will be sudden—or how would it answer if your lordships division was to come over to this side and wait orders could you recross being on the spot and boats ready before the communication could be stopped—and which is of consequence could your men get comfortably covered in the neighborhood of kings ferry my last advices which can be depended upon are that the enemys fleet except  0 sail which are at new york have fallen down to the hook that it consists of   0 sail of topsail vessels and about  0   0 or  0 smaller ones—this with the report of the pilots being southern ones and some other circumstances have led to a belief that phila is the object—was this certain no time shd be lost in drawing both yours and genl sullivans divisions with other troops over under the probability of it however it is i have suggested the idea of your recrossing and do further suggest the propriety of genl sullivans taking your ground at peeks kill for if there is no appearance of the enemy in the sound his moving easterly towards crum pond is altogether useless i do not give these as orders but wish you to consult genl putnam and the other general officers on that side and see how my ideas correspond with theirs and such certain intelligence as you may have and act accordingly if the enemy are destined for philadelphia these moves will facilitate the march of the troops thither—if to the eastward they will be retrogade—but such is the disadvantage we do and such we must labor under if the enemy have cunning enough to keep their own councils whilst they have shipping to move in and the absolute command of the water george washington    july      ramapo majorgeneral schuyler to majorgeneral schuyler headquarters ramapo    july      dear sir your two favors of the   st and   d instant with their enclosures are come to hand i am sorry to find that you have not yet been joined by a larger  0  number of militia and that it has been found necessary to dismiss a part even of those that have come to your assistance though their presence is at this time so urgently wanted i am in hopes however that your situation will soon be far more respectable as i cannot but think the eastern states who are so intimately concerned in the matter will exert themselves to throw in effectual succors to enable you to check the progress of the enemy and repel a danger with which they are so immediately threatened i informed you in a letter of the   d that i had ordered a further reinforcement in general glovers brigade to be dispatched to you this is all the aid in continental troops that i can possibly afford you in the present state of affairs which you will be sensible is the case if you will endeavor to form an idea of my strength from a consideration of that of the two brigades which have been sent to reinforce you—you may make a tolerably exact estimate from them of the force i have to oppose the enemys main army and you will plainly perceive that i cannot with the least propriety render it less however strong my inclination to put you upon the footing you desire you seem to apprehend that the artillery sent up to you will be useless for the want of a sufficient number of hands to manage them but i see no reason to imagine this will be the case as by your last return including noncommissioned officers you will have nearly twelve men to each piece which are as many as we make use of here and are sufficient for the purpose—   0 not more than six artillerists are required to load and fire a piece in action and you will have six others to each to make good any loss that may happen—for the draggropes and for any thing else besides loading and firing active men drafted from the batalions will answer extremely well—and a very few days are necessary if diligence is used to make men tolerably intelligent capable of performing every part of the duty of a private artillerist— the information of the prisoners and others transmitted by you does not make the numbers of the enemy to exceed the idea first entertained of them nor do i see any thing in it to induce a belief that their progress will be so rapid as not to give you time to make proper preparations and receive sufficient accessions of force to enable you to give them a vigorous and successful opposition they do not appear to be much more than five thousand strong and seem to be unprovided with wagons to transport the immense quantity of baggage and warlike apparatus without which they cannot pretend to penetrate the country you mention their having a great number of horses but they will nevertheless require a considerable number of wagons for there are a great many things that cannot be transported on horses as they can never think of advancing without securing their rear by leaving garrisons in the fortresses behind the force with which they can come against you will be greatly reduced by the detachments necessary for the purpose  and as they have to cut     out their road and remove the impediments you have put in the way this circumstance with the incumbrance they must feel in their baggage stores etc will inevitably retard their march a considerable time and give you leisure and opportunity to prepare a good reception for them if they continue to act in detachments you will have it in your power to improve it to very great advantage by falling vigorously upon some one of them with your whole force which if you are fortunate enough to succeed in will be fatal to them i have directed general lincoln to repair to you as speedily as the state of his health which is not very perfect will permit him this gentleman has always supported the character of a judicious brave active officer and as he is exceedingly popular and much respected in the state of massachusetts to which he belongs he will have a degree of influence over the militia which cannot fail being very advantageous i have destined him more particularly to the command of them and i promise myself it will have a powerful tendency to make them turn out with more cheerfulness and to inspire them with perseverance to remain in the field and fortitude and spirit to do their duty while in it the confidence     they have in him will certainly go a great way towards producing these desirable ends you intimate the propriety of having a body of men stationed somewhere about the grants the expediency of such a measure appears to me evident for it would certainly make general burgoyne very circumspect in his advances if it did not totally prevent them it would keep him in continual anxiety for his rear and oblige him to leave the posts behind him much stronger than he would otherwise do and would answer many other valuable purposes general lincoln could not be more serviceable than in the command of this body and no person could be more proper for it than him from the view i have of the matter i should also think it necessary to send general arnold or some other sensible spirited officer to fort schuyler to take care of that post keep up the spirits of the inhabitants and cultivate and improve the favorable disposition of the indians this is recommended on the supposition that any thing formidable should appear on that quarter i am dear sir c george washington    july      ramapo majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam ramapo    july      dear sir my letter of yesterday would inform you of the reasons which occasions the remove of this part of the army towards philadelphia and the recall of the     divisions under genls sullivan and lord stirling  i have now to add that it is my desire that you should keep as many of the remaining troops as can possibly be spared from the defence of the forts and passes of the highlands in the most perfect readiness to move either this way or to the eastward as occasion shall require i do not pretend to fix upon or ascertain the number which may be necessary for those defences yourself  officers must determine this point proportioning your defence to the troops left by genl howe on york island if you have not already done it let the eastern states be immediately advised of the fleets sailing from the hook that they may be in a posture of defence as no person can with certainty say where the blow will be struck i am dear sir c p s since writing the above i have recd yours of yesterdays date enclosing the intercepted letter from genl howe to burgoyne c to me a stronger proof could not be given that the former is not going to the eastward than this letter adduces it was evidently intended to fall into our hands the     complexion of it the circumstances attending it c evinces this beyond a doubt in my mind  i therefore desire that no time be lost in sending on genls sullivan and lord stirling with their divisions if it was not too dangerous to hazard their shipping to sea merely to perform a manœuver to deceive i should think it not unlikely that the north river might yet be the object  that they had run out with a view of returning when our troops should be drawn of but the possibility of a dispersion of their fleet makes so much against this that i am persuaded more than ever that philadelphia is the place of destination  therefore hope that no time will be lost in marching the troops already ordered  preparing as many of the others as can be spared to follow if my conjectures are right     george washington    july      ramapaugh to the president of congress camp at ramapaugh   miles from the clove    july      sir i do myself the honor to transmit you a copy of my letter to genl howe of the   th inst proposing an exchange between genls lee and prescot—i dispatched it early the next morning and presume it got to hand on the   th as yet i have not received his answer the amazing advantage the enemy derive from their ships and the command of the water keeps us in a state of constant perplexity and the most anxious conjecture we are not yet informed of their destination nor can any plausible conclusions be drawn respecting it—at least not such as appear satisfactory—what renders the matter still more difficult and confused is their extreme inactivity and delay—for it is certain they began to embark immediately after the evacuation of amboy and now remain between the narrows and the hook or were there when i was last advised upon the subject—i have two active officers with an escort now out for the purpose of intelligence and for reconnoitring their situation from fort lee and along the river in that neighborhood things being thus circumstanced and various opinions as to their real object prevailing among us some supposing it to be philadelphia—others the north river and others an expedition more easterly i would submit it to congress whether the militia of the neighboring counties should not be immediately called to the first or at chester—the lower counties at wilmington this measure     appears to me highly expedient and no objection can lie against it of sufficient validity to prevent it as a few days must certainly determine their real designs should they be against philadelphia and they have favorable winds their voyage will be made in a short time when it may be too late to obtain their aid and to arrange them properly for defence supposing em to come in—i am the more induced to recommend this measure as the several objects we have to attend to necessarily oblige this army to continue at a considerable distance from that place till their intentions are better understood and as they might by a sudden and rapid push attempt to effect some material—capital stroke before we could get there unless there is a respectable force to oppose em for tho no great dependence can be put in a militia acting alone—nor a vigorous opposition expected from em from the nature of things to a disciplined well appointed army yet their operations may be greatly retarded by em and may be checked till other succors can arrive the report of a force especially if it is any wise respectable let it be of what sort it may will have some influence on their conduct and may prevent enterprizes that would otherwise be undertaken from the intelligence received on saturday evening that a number of the enemys ships were standing up the north river and in the course of that and the preceding day that forty sail were in the sound going into fairfield harbor i had not the least doubt in my mind that genl howe had in view a     stroke against the highlands and the fortifications there and to cooperate with genl burgoyne—in consequence of these advices i judged it expedient to move the army the next morning from our then encampment towards those posts lord stirlings division was ordered to take the rout to kings ferry and to pass the river to peeks kill and i proceeded myself with the remainder which composed the main body by the rout leading thro the clove towards new windsor we marched over a very difficult and rugged road till night when we halted the first division having advanced about eighteen miles in this situation we lay till yesterday morning when from the information received before respecting the enemys fleet being at and near the hook and no further accounts of the ships in the sound a change in our measures took place stephens and lincolns divisions were ordered to proceed to chester there to wait further directions as a place from whence they may move with more ease either to philadelphia or hudsons river being seven miles nearer the former and equally convenient to the latter and general greenes division to this ground by dividing and this arrangement i am in hopes our movements will be more expeditious wheresoever they may be necessary i have c p s    after sealing my letter i received by express from colo moylan a letter advising that the fleet sailed from the hook yesterday morning out to sea      george washington  0 july      coryells ferry majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates coryells ferry  0 july      sir as we are yet uncertain as to the real destination of the enemy tho the delaware seems most probable i have thought it prudent to halt the army at this place howells ferry and trenton at least till the fleet actually enters the bay and put the matter beyond a doubt from hence we can be upon the proper grounds to oppose them before they can possibly make their arrangements and dispositions     for an attack i take it for granted that the preparations by water are ready to resist the sudden attack of any ships that may run up previous to the landing of troops  that the posts in the highlands may not be left too much exposed i have ordered genl sullivans division to halt at morris town whence it will march southward if there should be occasion or   0 northward upon the first advice that the enemy should be throwing any force up the north river genl howes in a manner abandoning general burgoyne is so unaccountable a matter that till i am fully assured it is so i cannot help casting my eyes continually behind me  as i shall pay no regard to any flying reports of the appearance of the fleet i shall expect an account of it from you the moment you have it ascertained to your satisfaction and i desire that at the same time that you advise me of this you will send an express to lord stirling or commanding officer at trenton to move on with the troops from thence i am c george washington    july      coryells ferry governor trumbull to governor trumbull coryells ferry    july      sir i was just now honored with your letter of the   th instant the evacuation of ticonderoga and mount independence is an event so interesting and so unexpected that i do not wonder it should produce in the minds of the people at least the well attached the effects you mention i am fully in sentiment with you that the cause leading to this unhappy measure should be fully and minutely examined public justice on the one hand demands     it if it was not the result of prudence and necessity and on the other the reputation of the officers concerned if they are not blameworthy had not congress considered that as a separate department appointed the officers in some instances to that command themselves and been fully possessed of all the facts respecting the event that i am i should not have doubted a single moment about directing an inquiry these matters i say have laid me under some doubts as to the line i should pursue but i am persuaded an examination will be ordered in a few days either by the congress or myself when i hope the subject will be properly discussed and that done which is right  as to sending continental troops from peekskill no more can be detached from thence to the northern army than what are already gone two brigades nixons and glovers have been ordered from thence to their aid more than were ever intended in the arrangement of our forces not a man more can go as all the troops i mean continental at that post except two thousand are called to join this army for i have to inform you that general howes object and operations no longer remain a secret at half after nine oclock this morning i received an express from congress advising that the enemys fleet consisting of two hundred and twentyeight     sail were at the capes of delaware yesterday in the forenoon this being the case there can be no doubt but he will make a vigorous push to possess philadelphia and that we should collect all the force we can to oppose him fearing from report and from the event itself the abandonment of the northern posts that distrust jealousy and suspicion of the conduct of the officers might arise in the militia and that degree of confidence in them wanted which would be necessary to success and to give a more promising aspect to our affairs in that quarter i sent generals lincoln and arnold to assist in that command these two gentlemen are esteemed good officers and i think very deservedly i am persuaded that nothing that their judgments shall direct will be omitted to stop the progress of general burgoynes arms as far as in them lies and i am equally sure their personal exertions and bravery will not be wanting in any instance their presence i trust will remove every ground of diffidence and backwardness in the militia and that they will go on when and where their services are demanded with a spirit and resolution becoming freemen and the sacred cause in which they are engaged as the troops are on their march from hence i shall not add more than that i have the most entire confidence in your exertions upon every occasion to advance the common interest and that i have the honor to be with great respect c    sparks prints no letters of washington between october   d and november  th and it was through colonel harrison that he communicated with congress the interval was crowded with movements of both armies hardly a day passing without some skirmish on the   th the british attacked the position of the americans on chattertons hill and remained in possession of the field on the two following days preparations were made by the enemy for again attacking the americans but something occurred to prevent and not till the third was there an active movement when the american sentries noted an unusual commotion in the british camp that resulted in the sudden march towards kingsbridge general greene who was now stationed at fort lee formerly called fort constitution gave notice on the   st of october that the enemy had taken possession of fort independence on the north side of kingsbridge having made their appearance in that quarter two days before that he had previously caused every thing valuable to be removed and the bridges to be cut down i should be glad to know your excellencys mind he adds about holding all the ground from kingsbridge to the lines if we attempt to hold the ground the garrison must be reinforced but if the garrison is to be drawn into fort washington and we only keep that the number of troops on the island is too large in reply the commanderinchief wrote that the question could be answered only by being on the spot and knowing all the circumstances and that he should submit the whole to the judgment of general greene reminding him of the original design to garrison the works and preserve the lower lines as long as they could be kept and thus by holding a commmunication across the river to stop the enemys ships from passing up or down in this period the following orders and other matter must be noted the moving state of the army will occasion some irregularity but the general hopes that officers of all ranks will exert themselves to correct all abuses particularly the following straggling from camp or plundering parties taking up and keeping horses loading the teams with heavy lumber and unnecessary baggage firing in and about the camp to prevent the first the rolls are to be frequently called at least three times a day and the absent punished—to prevent the second all horses not belonging to the artillery or ammunition or fieldofficers to be collected and sent to the quartermastergeneral near head quarters to prevent the third the field officers should have a general examination of the baggage of their regiments and all heavy chests tables chairs and other lumber be left or after this they will be thrown off the wagons wherever met with to prevent firing in camp the order of yesterday to be executed by giving the offender  0 lashes on the spot let him belong to what regiment he may—orderly book   november      the general is sorry to find that there are some soldiers so lost to all sense of honor and honesty as to leave the army when there is the greatest necessity for their services he calls upon the officers of every rank to exert themselves in putting a stop to it and absolutely forbids any officer under the rank of a brigadier general discharging any officer or soldier or giving any permission to leave the camp on any pretence whatever the situation of the army and the season requiring that the soldiery should be as well accommodated as possible especially at night the taking of straw or even grain in the sheaf is not to be considered as included in the orders against plundering—orderly book   november      our situation is altered in no instance unless in the number of our troops which is every day decreasing by their most scandalous desertion and return home—robert h harrison to the president of congress   november      by command of his excellency i have the honor to acknowledge his receipt of your favors of the   th ulto and to inform you that he esteems the plan you propose to lay before congress for preventing more rations being drawn than may be due well calculated to answer the end that respecting the sick seems to him not entirely perfect the captains or commanders of companies are prohibited from drawing pay for such sick as may be discharged from the hospitals as unfit for service if during their stay and before it can be known whether their case will or will not admit of their return it should become necessary to make up a regimental pay abstract in what manner are the officers to make up their rolls are they to include the sick or not as this is a case that may and must of necessity frequently happen it appears to his excellency that the intended regulation should be more general and restrain the officers from including in their pay abstracts or rolls all the sick they send to the hospitals and the pay due em previous to their going in such case those who are discharged as unfit for service may receive their pay as intended those who returned to duty can obtain what was due them when the regiment was paid by applying to the paymaster with the officer and surgeons certificates or be included in a subsequent abstract the inconveniences and abuses which are designed to be remedied by these regulations his excellency does not apprehend to arise so much from necessity as incident to the nature of armies as from the imperfect institution of the present and the great mixture and diversity of troops composing it and also from the inattention of the officers in whose appointments but too little regard has been had to choosing men of merit and honor the defenceless state of pensylvania as communicated by the committee

and of making them serviceable the result is that they should be appointed to regiments by congress according to the ranks they have been pleased to give em and with the same pay as is allowed other officers in such cases their want of our language is rather an objection but it is hoped they will attain a sufficient knowledge of it ere it be long to be of great service and that in the interim their advice and assistance in directing of works may be of use where they may be stationed—harrison to the president of congress   november      the general is very sensible that the time of service of many of the militia will soon expire but as this is the most interesting and critical part of the campaign and their departure would greatly discourage the other troops and injure the service he doubts not their love to their country will induce them to prolong their stay until the close of the campaign which must soon happen—orderly book   november        the council agreed unanimously that in case the enemy were retreating towards new york it would be proper immediately to throw a body of troops into new jersey that those raised on the east side of hudsons river should be detached for this purpose and that three thousand men should be stationed at peekskill and the passes of the highlands   the situation of our affairs is critical and truly alarming the dissolution of our army is fast approaching and but little if any prospect of levying a new one in a reasonable time a large part of it under the denomination of new levies are now on the eve of their departure and this at a time when the enemy have a very numerous and formidable force watching an opportunity to execute their plans and to spread ruin and devastation among us impressed with the importance of these matters i this day laid them before a council of general officers with a view of obtaining their opinion upon the same and of the measures which in their judgment should be immediately adopted the result was that i should apply to several of the states for supplies of militia    the hope and probability of raising a new army within a convenient time are so little and the consequences so evidently alarming if a sufficient force is not kept up to counteract the designs of the enemy in the meantime that the council and myself have unanimously agreed that the militia should be engaged if possible to continue till the  st of march we flatter ourselves by that time if not long before such an army will be levyed as to render any future claims upon them unless in cases of the most pressing emergency altogether unnecessary—washington to the massachusetts general assembly   november      he asked for  000 men from massachusetts but well knowing the condition of your state and the difficulties you

recruiting orders had not been issued to col magaw and col cadwalader washington wrote on the  th explaining the want of money and added you will i doubt not agree with me in that it could not be the generals duty or that of any other general officer to attend upon the officers of these two battalions to know whether they would serve or set about the business of recruiting and i am very confident

the village of white plains were burnt on the night of the  th of november this wanton act was caused by a major in the army and was severely censured by the commanderinchief in the general orders of the next day—it is with the utmost astonishment and abhorrence that the general is informed that some base and cowardly wretches last night set fire to the courthouse and other buildings which the enemy had left the army may rely on it that they shall be brought to justice and meet with the punishment they deserve when the army evacuated their first works at white plains on the   st of october a few barns and other houses within the lines containing forage and public stores which could not be removed were burnt by order of the general some historians have erroneously confounded the two incidents and represented the burning of the houses in the village as an act authorized by the commanderinchief   on the same day that is november  th general washington wrote to general greene then at fort lee expressing his conviction that the enemy would invest fort washington and adding i must recommend to you to give every attention in your power and give every assistance you can to that garrison   general greene wrote in reply on the  th—the passing of the ships up the river is to be sure a full proof of the insufficiency of the obstructions to stop the ships from going up but that garrison employs double the number of men to invest it that we have to occupy it they must keep troops at kingsbridge to prevent a communication with the country and they dare not leave a very small number for fear our people should attack them upon the whole i cannot help thinking that the garrison is of advantage and i cannot conceive it to be in any great danger the men can be brought off at any time but the stores may not be so easily removed yet i think they can be got off in spite of them if matters grow desperate this post is of no importance except in conjunction with mount washington i was over there last evening the enemy seem to be disposing matters to besiege the place but colonel magaw thinks it will take them till december expires before they can carry it if the enemy do not find it an object of importance they will not trouble themselves about it if they do it is a full proof that they feel an injury from our possessing it our giving it up will open a free communication with the country by the way of kingsbridge that must be a great advantage to them and injury to us if the enemy cross the river i shall follow your excellencys advice respecting the cattle and forage these measures however cruel in appearance were ever my maxims of war in the defence of a country in attacking they would be very improper—ms letter dated fort lee november  th   by

should be offered to officers and men inlisting to serve during the war the individual states undertook in some cases to alter the rewards maryland having no lands in the west offered to its recruits ten dollars in lieu of the  00 acres of land promised by congress but congress decided that its faith was pledged to a performance of the promise of land that the promise was equally obligatory upon

these negotiations for an exchange were pending howe sent a lieutenant barker to new london to propose to the principle inhabitants or persons of the greatest authority in that colony an exchange of prisoners officers for officers in each class and sailors for sailors it was very justly determined that such an application to a state was improper and inconsistent and could only be made to general

never engaged in our service i must request you immediately to direct the colonies or commanders of regiments in your division to make out an exact list of the particular officers and privates who have been killed taken prisoners or are missing in the respective regiments and companies to which they belong—washington to general lee    november      i also wish that you would have all the british prisoners collected that you conveniently can and sent to me as soon as possible with the hessian prisoners that i may exchange them the return of the latter i think will be attended with many salutary consequences but should it be made without that of a large proportion of other troops it will carry the marks of design and occasion precautions to be taken to prevent the ends we have in view—washington to the board of war    november        journals of congress    november      in communicating these resolutions of congress to the convention of new york washington wrote from general greenes headquarters on the   th they the resolutions are plain and explicit and i will take the liberty to add should form a part of the instructions to be given to the officers who may be appointed to recruit i would also beg leave to observe that the necessity of raising the new army becomes more and more urgent and is such as calls for every possible exertion to effect it the congress convinced of this and seeing the delays of some of the states in carrying the resolves commended to them into execution have empowered and required me to nominate officers to the regiments of such states as have not sent commissioners to the army for that purpose as this is a matter in which i would not wish to interefere at this time farther than compelled by their direction and the situation of our affairs i shall be happy to know what progress you have made in this instance and whether the arrangement for your regiments is not completed if it is not finished let me entreat you to do it as speedily as possible the necessity is obvious and must be felt by every one till the officers are appointed no measures for enlisting men can be pursued in addition to the resolutions already adopted congress again and again urged upon the states the pressing necessity there was for raising troops on the   th it deemed it necessary upon every principle of propriety to remind the several states how indispensable it is to the common safety that they pursue the most immediate and vigorous measures to furnish their respective quotas of troops for the new army as the time of service for which the present army inlisted is so near expiring that the country may be left in a condition in a great measure defenceless unless quickly supplied by new levies two days later wishing to give all possible facility to recruiting the army as the necessity was so evident and pressing it authorized each state to enlist their men either for the war or three years without presenting enlisting rolls for both terms keeping it always in view that in the opinion of congress the public service will be best promoted by inlistments for the war on the   d the matter was again considered some parts of the army being already disbanded and there being great danger that the enemy must be opposed either by unequal numbers or by militia not only a more expensive but a less efficacious aid than regular forces and there being good grounds to hope that vigorous efforts at this critical conjuncture may bring the war to a speedy as well as a happy conclusion—washington to appoint recruiting officers paca witherspoon and ross were appointed to go to headquarters to consult with the general on this and other matters connected with the army   a similar letter was sent to majorgeneral heath   colonel

nation but give me leave to assure his excellency that actuated by the most glorious cause that mankind ever fought in i am determined to defend this post to the very last extremity a copy of this reply was immediately sent across the river to general greene and enclosed in the following note from him to general washington who was then at hackensack enclosed you have a letter from colonel magaw

recommendations they threw the officers to whom i communicated it into so great a flame of discontent that i ventured notwithstanding your orders to hesitate they accused him of partiality to his

for further orders   lee replied to reed on the   st withdrawing our troops from hence would be attended with some very serious consequences which at present would be tedious to enumerate but he did order heath to send two thousand men to cross the river an order which heath very properly declined to obey pleading the positive instructions given him by washington by your mode of reasoning

instructed me and to the world heath to lee    november      i sent heath orders to transport two thousand men across the river    but that great man as i might have expected intrenched himself behind

of the hudson began to manœuvre for an independent command even at the cost of superseding washington the confidence reposed in him his success at the south the ready expression of his views and his assiduous courting of prominent members in the continental and state congresses had given rise to an exaggerated opinion of his military ability and counting upon this opinion fostered by the flattery of injudicious friends and admirers he was holding up before him the succession to washington on the fall of fort lee reed wrote him i have some additional reasons for wishing most earnestly to have you where the principal scene of action is laid i do not mean to flatter or praise you at the expense of any other but i confess i do think it is entirely owing to you that this army and the liberties of america so far as they are dependent on it are not totally cut off you have decision a quality often wanted in minds otherwise valuable    every member of the family the officers and soldiers generally have a confidence in you—the enemy constantly inquire where you are and seem to be less confident when you are present continuing he attributed the loss of fort washington to the state of suspense in which washington was thrown by the advice of general greene oh general an indecisive mind is one of the greatest misfortunes that can befal an army how often have i lamented it this campaign all circumstances considered we are in a very awful and alarming situation—one that requires the utmost wisdom and firmness of mind as soon as the season will admit i think yourself and some others should go to congress and form the plan of the new army point out their defects to them and it may possibly prevail on them to lend their whole attention to this great subject even to the exclusion of every other this injudicious letter addressed to a vain man could not but flatter him lee replied on the   th lament with you that fatal indecision of mind which in war is a much greater disqualification than stupidity or even want of personal courage accident may put a decisive blunderer in the right but eternal defeat and miscarriage must attend the man of the best parts if cursed with indecision    i only wait myself for this business i mention of rogers and co being over shall then fly to you for to confess a truth i really think our chief will do better with me than without me this letter was received at headquarters when reed was absent at burlington and was opened by washington under the belief that it was of a public nature this chance could not but leave an unpleasant impression on the mind of the general who sent the letter to reed and without a word of reproach explained the circumstances that had made him see what neither inclination nor intention would have prompted me to in      reed undertook to explain the matter saying that his own letter to lee had led to expressions and an answer which must have been disapproved by you and which i was

the same despatch he proposed a plan for the next campaign in which he contemplated extensive operations an incursion into rhode island and massachusetts and if possible the possession of boston an ascent up the north river to albany and an attack on philadelphia and virginia in the autumn to effect this scheme he required thirtyfive thousand men the rapid retreat of the american army across new jersey gave him fresh hopes of further successes but these were defeated by the battle of trenton meantime he suggested another plan to the minister for the next campaign which had for its chief

came over to me at brunswick from bethlehem without the least guard or escort and a lieutenant of the seventh regiment went through our whole army and was at last discovered by a mere accident he had a pass from the council of safety and that was all such an irregular mode of suffering prisoners to go in alone must be put a stop to or the enemy will be as well acquainted with our situation as we are ourselves if they are left at liberty to choose their own route they will always take that through our army for reasons too obvious to mention—washington to the board of war   december

happy distance from newark elizabethtown woodbridge and boundbrook he addressed a similar letter to the committee of congress sent to learn his position and situation on the same day after major hoops had reached him he again wrote to washington i am certainly shocked to hear that your force is so inadequate to the necessity of your situation as i had been taught to think you had been considerably reinforced he expressed a belief that the main effort of the enemy was to be directed against the eastern states and concluded by saying it will be difficult i am afraid to join you but cannot i do you more service by attacking their rear   kosciusko   putnam took command on the   th and established martial law   general washington wrote again the next day to general lee pressing him to hasten

miles higher up the delaware in some expectation of finding boats there and in the neighborhood sufficient to pass the river but in this he was disappointed the enemy having taken the precaution to destroy or to secure on the south side all the boats that could possibly be employed for this purpose cornwallis then took post at pennington remaining there till the   th when the severe weather warned them to go to their winter cantonments the chain i own is rather too extensive but i was induced to occupy burlington to cover the county of monmouth in which there are many loyal inhabitants

all the force he can bring p s   oclock a m i this minute received information that the enemy were repairing the bridges three or four miles below trenton which seems to indicate an intention of their

shall dispose of the remainder in such a manner and at such places as will be most likely not only to annoy the enemy in their passage but to give the earliest information of any attempt of that kind parties of the enemy have been reconnoitering both up and down the river and i imagine it has been one of these parties that have appeared near burlington for as they have not found the least opposition from the people of jersey they venture very far from their main body which from the best information still lays about trenton and above it i have desired col humpton to apply for a party of men to go up coopers and ancocus creeks and bring down all the craft he may find there for it is in vain to cut down bridges if the boats are left they cannot be trusted to the care of the owners for if an enemy was to appear such is their fear that they would deliver them up upon the first demand—washington to the president of the philadelphia council of safety thomas wharton jr  0 december

th whereas a false and malicious report has been spread by the enemies of america that the congress was about to disperse resolved that general washington be desired to contradict the said scandalous report this congress having a better opinion of the spirit and vigor of the army and of the good people of these states than to suppose it can be necessary to disperse nor will they adjourn from the city of philadelphia in the present state of affairs unless the last necessity shall direct it congress approved washingtons suppression of this resolution on the day after putnam and mifflin were called in to consult with congress and both by strong arguments urged the necessity of the congress retiring this view met with the acceptance of congress who declared that as philadelphia was now

have released and who are of the same rank except in the instance of colonel allen his exchange on account of his long imprisonment i have been particularly instructed to propose the officers whose enlargement i now require are chiefly on parole and of those who were sent from canada by general carleton in respect to the privates you will be pleased to direct an equal number to be returned out of those who were made prisoners on long island on the   th of august including six volunteers described in one of the lists i thank you for the ready attention that was given to the return of major bird and others who came out with him in exchange for the officers who went from brunswic but i must request that upon any future occasion the particular officers to be returned shall be of my appointment or some person authorized for the purpose i cannot conclude this letter without mentioning the severe treatment of monsieur wiebert this gentleman was made prisoner on the   th ultimo with the garrison on york island—and holds the rank of a lieutenantcolonel in our service i am credibly informed he has been committed to the provostguard and is there suffering all the inconveniences of a gaol i am persuaded this treatment is without your knowledge and that the cause of the complaint will be removed as soon as it is discovered—washington to general howe    december        general

thrown me into a situation where i have my choice of difficulties if i stay in this province i risk myself and army and if i do not stay the province is lost forever    our counsels have been weak to the last degree   howe states that the weather having become too severe to keep the field and the winter cantonments having been arranged the troops marched to their respective stations   from information received of the enemys movements it appears to me that they intend leaving this part of the country and to retire towards brunswic and the towns contiguous to it perhaps for the purpose of going into winter quarters unless indeed the whole should be intended as a feint there does not therefore appear the same necessity for your advancing as was conjectured at the time my orders for your marching were determined on for this reason as well as on account of the danger which the state of new york would be exposed to and which the convention has represented to me by their letter i should conceive it to be expedient for you to return with parsons brigade to your former station these troops you are to post in the most advantageous manner to answer the purposes of defending the country from the incursions of the enemy and of curbing the insolence of the disaffected however previous to your departure from the jerseys i entirely agree with you in sentiment that the troops cannot be better employed than in surprising any of the enemys posts either at hackinsac or the parts adjacent that are so situated as to admit of a strong probability of success an enterprise of this sort will encourage our friends and advance the recruiting service which is a matter of infinite importance as to colonel vose with greatons bonds and porters regiments i would choose they should move forwards to join general gates—washington to majorgeneral heath    december        in apologizing for not making an earlier reply to a letter from the convention of new york washington wrote on the   th the continued motion of our army for some time past put it out of my power to sit regularly down to business indeed i have now so much on my hands and such a choice of difficulties that i hardly know which first to attend to    as the office of aid major has been hitherto unknown in the continental service perhaps by introducing it among your regiments umbrage might be given to the others if they were not likewise provided with an officer of the same kind and therefore to avoid disputes i could wish the matter might be waived    when i ordered down gen heath from his post at the highlands it was done in consequence of a determination of a council of general officers who agreed that we had no other means of stopping the progress of general howe who was so evidently making a grand push to make himself master of philadelphia the advantages of keeping possession of the posts in the highlands were not unattended to we considered that the enemy had thrown the main body of their army over into jersey that they were about to make a considerable embarkation which has since turned out to be against new england and that it would take most if not the remainder of their army to keep up the garrisons at new york c and that therefore they had not a sufficient force left to attempt the strong posts at the highlands tho only guarded by general george clinton with the force of the state of new york general howe easily forced our small army to retreat before him to the delaware but not finding boats to transport his troops we having had time and precaution to secure and destroy them he seems by his late motions to be moving back towards brunswick for winter quarters or intending a feint upon this change of measures i have immediately ordered general heath to return to peekskill with general parsons brigade if he finds any of the enemys posts at hackensack or elsewhere weakly guarded he is to endeavor to beat them up i shall give the deputy quarter master general orders to have the clothing both new and old brought up to this army and have it distributed as it is most wanted but you may depend if the old cloaths which have been so charitably contributed by the inhabitants of philadelphia can answer the present necessities of the other regiments that the new shall be all applied to the regiment particularly belonging to your state—washington to the pennsylvania council of safety    december      your collection of old cloathes for the use of our army deserves my warmest thanks they are of the greatest use and shall be distributed where they are most wanted i think if the committee or some proper persons were appointed to go through the county of bucks and make a collection of blankets c in the manner you have done in philadelphia it would be better than doing it in a military way by me for many people who would be willing to contribute or sell if asked to do so by their neighbors or acquaintances feel themselves hurt when the demand is made backed by an armed force but i would at the same time remark that if any who can spare without inconvenience refuse to do it i would immediately give proper assistance to take from them—washington to the pennsylvania council of safety    december        joshua loring commissary general of british prisoners   whether general howe can accommodate them the prisoners better in point of room i will not determine to be sure he cannot safely trust them abroad in a country which he has but just taken possession of i have already sent in all or most of the prisoners that were in the states of pennsylvania jersey and maryland and made a demand of such officers in exchange as i thought were best intitled to a preference beginning with those taken at quebec under gen montgomery and arnold but general howe without paying any regard to my request sent out such as best pleased him or who made the most urgent application i have remonstrated sharply upon this head and told gen howe in express terms that unless he will agree to send out such only as i name i will not send any more of his prisoners in but to this letter i have received no answer—washington to governor trumbull    december      the accounts received from new york respecting the distresses of our prisoners induce me to recommend to your honorable body that measures should be taken to effect an exchange as soon as possible or as far as circumstances will admit of ever since the cartel has been settled between gen howe and myself i have been endeavoring to accomplish it but my attempts have been attended with but little success for the prisoners belonging to the british army and who have been sent from jersey pennsylvania and maryland gen howe or rather his commissary has undertaken of his mere motion and contrary to my express requisition to return a number belonging to us who were not called for and whose releasement should have been postponed till after that of others i have wrote to gen howe on the subject and presume in future that none will be sent out but those named by me that this business may not remain an object of further delay i would advise that all the prisoners in your state be immediately sent to the commanding officer of the british troops on the island of rhodeisland taking two exact lists of the names corps and ranks of the officers and the number of privates signed by the officer of the highest rank one to be sent with him accompanied by a line to gen howe that the particular prisoners belonging to us and to be received in exchange will be required by me to which end i must request that the other list be immediately transmitted to me that the requisition may be made—washington to the committee of new hampshire    december        were it not for them these new forces in a few days by reason of the impolicy and fatal system of short inlistments there would not be the least shadow of an army to check the operations of the enemy i should be happy if there had been just grounds for the report of the success of our arms at hackensack but matters have been entirely the reverse by the expiration of the service of the troops denominated the flying camp men on the  st inst and their return home our force on this side hudsons river which before that period was not competent to a successful opposition was reduced to a mere handful with this small number without deriving the least aid from the militia notwithstanding the earliest and most pressing application i have been pushed thro jersey by the main body of the enemys army and for want of their assistance a large part of that state has been exposed to all the effects of ravage and of the most wanton plunder the delaware now divides what remains of our little force from that of gen howe whose object beyond all question is to possess philadelphia they have been industrious in their efforts to procure boats for their transportation but the precautions i have taken have hitherto rendered their attempts unsuccessful how things will terminate i must leave to itself as yet i have received but little or no augmentation except that of the city militia who have turned out in a spirited manner convinced that philadelphia was the object of mr howes movements and of the fatal consequences that would attend the loss of it i wrote for genl lee to reinforce me with the troops under his immediate command by some means or other their arrival has been retarded and unhappily on friday last the general having left his division and proceeded three or four miles nearer the enemy then    miles from him of which they were informed by some tories was surprised and carried off about    oclock by a party of  0 light horse i will not comment upon this unhappy accident i feel much for his misfortune and am sensible that in his captivity our country has lost a warm friend and an able officer upon the whole our affairs are in a much less promising condition than could be wished yet i trust under the smiles of providence and our own exertions we shall be happy our cause is righteous and must be supported every nerve should be strained to levy the new army if we can but procure a respectable one in season all may be well and to this no pains can be too great the next campaign will be an important one and the issue may lead to happiness—or the most melancholy of all events—washington to governor bowdoin    december        nothing ever amazed me more than the note said to be wrote by john dickinson esqr to his brother the general if he applies to me to show him the contents i see no reason for refusing because he may easily be informed by applying to the writer washington to the pennsylvania council of safety    december      dickinson had written to his brother not to accept any more continental money in liquidation of bonds and mortgages held by him the letter had been intercepted   vol iv       the eastern shore of the chesapeake bay   governor cooke wrote on the  th that

landed and were marching upon newport howlands and bristol ferry washington replied that he could not afford any assistance and believed that the enemy would confine themselves to the island   read in congress december   th   the first chiefly relates to your wishes that the troops of the state of connecticut whose time expires on the first of january may by intreaties and promises of reward be induced to stay beyond their term past experience has repeatedly convinced us that troops at the most favorable season of the year and well supplied with every necessary cannot be prevailed upon to stay a day longer than what they engaged for if that has been the case under the circumstances i have mentioned it cannot be expected that men worn out with a fatiguing campaign and in want of even necessary cloathing at the most inclement season of the year will or can stay beyond their engagement indeed except they would enlist anew or consent to stay a considerable time i think they had better go home as fast as possible for thereby they will have time to have refreshed themselves and when they have forgot their fatigues they will probably inlist again time enough to take the field in the spring    when i reflect upon what our situation in this quarter will be in ten days from this time i am almost led to despair as i said before i cannot count upon those troops whose time is to expire upon the first of january i am thus left with a few southern regiments almost reduced to nothing by sickness and fatigue to oppose the main body of general howes army laying close upon my front and most assuredly waiting for the dissolution of our army to make as easy a conquest of the province of pennsylvania as they have done of jersey i do not find the militia of pennsylvania inclined to give me as much assistance as they are able to do were they willing tho i am endeavoring to bring them out by every means and am making use of both threats and persuasion to gain my end i shall draw the new inlisted troops together as fast as they can be collected armed and accoutred but much cannot be expected from that source for some time if the four regiments of militia from your state and the six thousand men ordered in by the state of massachusetts should arrive at peeksskill general heath will have a much larger body of men than he will have any occasion for at that place and i had determined that they should cover the upper part of jersey but under my present difficulties i shall order as many as can be spared to proceed thus far the necessity of the times must plead my excuse for calling men so far from home and at this season of the year who have an enemy just landed on their own coasts and have not even a continental regiment to assist them but i trust they will undertake this chearfully when they reflect that they cannot ensure that liberty which they have so nobly contended for while our common enemy maintains any footing upon any part of this continent—washington to governor trumbull    december      when i wrote to you on the   th instant i had little doubt of receiving considerable support from the militia of this state and was taught to believe that a large part of the old troops coming with general lee had reenlisted it is easier to conceive than describe the situation i am in—left—or shall be in a very few days with only a very few southern regiments reduced almost to nothing to oppose howes main army already posted in such a manner as to pour in his whole force upon us so soon as the frost affords him a passage over the delaware and our number such as to give no effectual opposition thus circumstanced it is a matter of concern to me that in my last i directed you to take back any of the militia designed for the support of the army under my command and have to request that instead of ordering the return of any of those that were destined for this department by order of the respective states that you will hasten them on with all possible expedition as i see no other chance of saving philadelphia and preventing a fatal blow to america in the loss of a city from whence so much of our resources are drawn—washington to governor trumbull    december      i entreat you to collect every man you possibly can send people out to contradict the reports that are circulated that we have more men than we want from which many perhaps that would turn out if they thought there was a real necessity remain at home—washington to the pennsylvania council of safety    december      i most earnestly intreat you sir and the rest of the gentlemen of your committee to exert your influence among the people of the county and endeavor to make them turn out generally in defence of their capital which will most assuredly fall a sacrifice unless the militia of the province contribute largely to its defence those who are so far lost to a love of their country as to refuse to lend a hand to its support at this critical time may depend upon being treated as their baseness and want of public spirit will most justly deserve—washington to lewis gordon chairman of northampton county    december        brother to colonel lambert cadwalader of the continental service   reed had written to washington from bristol on the   d urging the necessity of attempting something to revive our expiring credit give our cause some degree of reputation and prevent a total depreciation of the continental money which is coming on very fast that even a failure cannot be more fatal than to remain in our present situation in short some enterprise must be undertaken in our present circumstances or we must give up the cause in a little time the continental army will be dissolved the militia must be taken before their spirits and patience are exhausted and the scattered divided state of the enemy affords us a fair opportunity of trying what our men will do when called to an offensive attack will it not be possible my dear general for your troops or such part of them as can act with advantage to make a diversion or something more at or about trenton the result was a conference at headquarters and on the adjutantgenerals return to bristol where he conferred with cadwalader in company with colonel john cox he crossed the river and proceeded to the quarters of colonel griffin at mount holly to determine on measures of immediate and active cooperation they found that officer seriously ill and the condition of his troops their number and equipment such as to put an end to all hope of effective effort

effective force of four thousand seven hundred and seven but this return did not include the four regiments just arrived from the northern army nor lees division now commanded by sullivan nor the

sullivans division to about three thousand   bowes reed   now taylorsville it was also known as the eightmile ferry   i should have most certainly pursued those that retreated had it not been for the distressed situation of my troops about three or four and twenty hundred in number who had experienced the greatest fatigue in breaking a passage through the ice and all the severities of rain and storm this with the apprehension that we could receive no succors and that the difficulty of passing and repassing the river might become greater led us to conclude our return eligible the officers and men who were engaged in the enterprise behaved with great firmness perseverance and bravery and such as did them the highest honor i shall be extremely ready and it is my most earnest wish to pursue every means that shall seem probable to distress the enemy and to promise success on our part if we could happily beat up the rest of their quarters bordering on and near the river it would be attended with the most valuable consequences i have called a meeting of the general officers to consult of what measures shall be next pursued and would recommend that you and general putnam should defer your intended operations till you hear from me perhaps it may be judged prudent for us to pass here with the force we have if it is practicable or if it is not that i may come down to you and afford every assistance in my power we will try to concert a plan and upon such principles as shall appear to promise success—washington to general cadwalader    december        general greene and colonel knox would have persuaded the commander in chief to have pushed on and improved the alarm given the enemy to which he was inclined but the generality of the officers were against it and his excellency did not then think he could answer going contrary to the judgment of the majority of the council of war he has since regretted his not seizing the golden opportunity—gordon history ii

delaware he was informed of this movement after a large part of his men had landed on the jersey side and at ten oclock he wrote from burlington to the commanderinchief—as this defeated the scheme of joining your army we were much embarrssaed which way to proceed i thought it most prudent to retreat but colonel reed was of opinion that we might safely proceed to burlington and recommended it warmly lest it should have a bad effect on the militia who were twice disappointed the landing in open daylight must have alarmed the enemy or we might have been cut off by all their force collected at this place we had intelligence immediately after landing that the enemy had left the black horse and mount holly upon this we determined to advance to burlington colonel reed and two other officers went on from one post to another till they came to bordentown where they found the coast clear we shall march at four tomorrow morning for that place accordingly he reached bordentown the next day about noon and wrote that he had then with him eighteen hundred men and five hundred more were advancing from below here he received orders from general washington to remain till he should himself

exchange—washington to lieutenantgeneral howe    december      we have the greatest occasion at present for hard money to pay a certain set of people who are of particular use to us if you could possibly collect a sum if it were but one hundred or one hundred and fifty pounds it would be of great service it too would be most convenient i am taking every measure to improve our late lucky blow and hope to be successful the greatest impediment to our motion is the want of provisions if it lays in your way to give the commissary any advice or assistance in that way i am sure you will do it

of each of the states accompanied by the above resolve ever attentive to the security of civil liberty congress would not have consented to the vesting of such powers in the military department as those which the enclosed resolves convey to the continental commanderinchief if the situation of public affairs did not require at this crisis a decision and vigor which distance and numbers deny to assemblies far removed from each other and from the immediate seat of war the strength and progress of the enemy joined to prospects of considerable reinforcements have rendered it not only necessary that the american forces should be augmented beyond what congress had heretofore designed but that they should be brought into the field with all possible expedition these considerations induce congress to request in the most earnest manner that the fullest influence of your state may be exerted to aid such levies as the general shall direct in consequence of the powers now given him and that your quota of battalions formerly fixed may be completed and ordered to headquarters with all the despatch that an ardent desire to secure the public happiness can dictate—baltimore  0 december

not admit nor circumstances allow of a reference to congress    i am no advocate for the extension of military power neither would i advise it at present but from the fullest conviction of its being absolutely necessary    the state of war is so uncertain dependent upon so many contingencies a day nay an hour is so important in the crisis of public affairs that it would be folly to wait for relief from the deliberative councils of legislative bodies the virtue of the people at such an hour is not to be trusted and i can assure you that the general will not exceed his powers though he may sacrifice the cause there never was a man that might be more safely trusted nor a time when there was a louder call—greene to the president of congress    december        i have the pleasure to

heath january          edward antill was lieutenantcolonel of the regiment commanded by colonel hazen the origin and condition of this regiment were different from those of any others in the army as soon as congress were made acquainted with the disastrous issue of the attack on quebec they authorized the raising of an additional regiment of canadians in that province and appointed hazen to be the colonel and antill to be the lieutenantcolonel this was the second canadian regiment as one had already been established under colonel james livingston the regiment commanded by hazen went by the name of congresss own because it was not attached to the quota of any of the states it was to consist of one thousand men who were to be enlisted for the war and on account of the great distance from congress and to promote despatch the appointment of the officers was entrusted to the colonel with the approbation of the commanding officer in canada the regiment was to be arranged in four battalions divided into five companies each during the spring of      about five hundred men were raised who were on service in different parts of the province but on the evacuation of canada the number had decreased and when the regiment arrived in albany during the month of august it was reduced to less than one hundred hazen and antill proceeded to philadelphia to lay the state of their regiment before congress and after the resolve was passed for establishing the new army of eightyeight battalions to be assigned in due proportions to the several states it was decided that hazens regiment should continue on its original foundation that is the men to serve during the war and the colonels to be empowered to appoint the subordinate officers as the regiment belonged to no state the officers were authorized to raise their men in any or all of the states to hasten the enlistments it was agreed that colonel hazen should superintend the recruiting service in new york and the eastern states and lieutenantcolonel antill in new jersey pennsylvania maryland and virginia but when colonel hazen reached albany he found that the eastern states were giving so much larger bounties for filling up their quotas of the eightyeight battalions than he was authorized to allow by congress that his prospect of success was small owing to this circumstance the recruits for the regiment chiefly consisted of men from the middle states—journals of congress january  0th and october   d      antills ms letter january  d     —sparks   since i wrote to you last the enemy have withdrawn all

detached bodies i know not but as many valuable purposes may i think be answered by your moving towards new york i wish no time may be lost in doing it i have good reasons to believe that there are very few men left in the city of new york or upon the island consequently a body of troops marched that way may possess themselves of the city or occasion a reinforcement to be thrown in there and in either case cannot fail of advancing our cause—washington to majorgeneral heath january          these sixteen additional regiments were established on a different footing from the eightyeight battalions which were apportioned among the several states the appointment of officers being referred to the states respectively according to the quota of each whereas in the sixteen battalions or regiments the appointment of the officers was left to the commanderinchief and he was empowered to raise the men in any or all of the united states colonel gist was authorized to raise four companies of rangers and instructed to proceed to the cherokee or any other nation of indians and attempt to procure a number of warriors not exceeding five hundred who were to be supplied with arms blankets and other necessaries and instead of presents to receive the same pay as the troops in the continental service i am not aware that any indians were obtained the colonels of ten regiments were appointed in january and furnished with instructions similar to the above their names were nathaniel gist john patton william grayson thomas hartley samuel b webb david henley ezekiel cornell henry sherburne alexander scammell henry jackson the appointments to the other six regiments were made subsequently at different times   congress had instructed general washington to propose five hessian fieldofficers lately taken at trenton in exchange for general lee and one for colonel ethan allen reports were received that general lee was ill used and congress resolved that in case the british commander would not consent to the proffered exchange precisely the same treatment should be exercised towards these officers as that practised upon general lee in short that the law of retaliation should be carried into rigid effect president hancock wrote to washington on the  th of january—general lees situation seems to be extremely dangerous and critical and from general howes behavior to him it is highly probable he will be brought to trial for desertion general lee it is said by mr eustace his aidedecamp having addressed two letters to general howe received them both back again

remonstrance in consequence of it should your information on the subject have rendered that step necessary   read in congress january  0th   the above statement in regard to the character in which the british commander held general lee is confirmed by his correspondence with the minister he wrote to lord george germaine on the  0th of december—general lee being considered in the light of a deserter is kept a close prisoner but i do not bring him to trial as a doubt has arisen whether by a public resignation of his halfpay prior to his entry into the rebel army he is still amenable to the military law as a deserter upon which point i shall wait for information and if the decision should be for trial on this ground i beg to have the judges opinion to lay before the court deserters are excluded in my agreement with the enemy for exchange of prisoners to this the minister replied—as you have difficulties about bringing general lee to trial in america it is his majestys pleasure that you send him to great britain by the first ship of war sir william howe wrote in answer to this order—washington declines to exchange the hessian fieldofficers taken at trenton or lieutenantcolonel campbell unless lee is recognised as a prisoner of war lee is therefore detained for further instructions being apprehensive that the close confinement of the hessian officers would be the consequence of sending lee to britain and that this would occasion much discontent among the foreign troops—letter july  th      this measure of caution was approved and the minister replied—his majesty consents that lee having been struck off the halfpay list shall though deserving the most exemplary punishment be deemed as a prisoner of war and may be exchanged as such when you may think proper—letter

sea service have been the subject of many of my letters to lord and general howe but all the satisfaction or answer that i could ever obtain was that the reports were groundless however upon the authority of capt gambles relation and the miserable emaciated countenances of these poor creatures who have lately been released i shall take the liberty of remonstrating sharply to his lordship and

taken in the action of the  rd instant at princeton and on the march from thence he therefore strictly orders all such persons to bring in any horses or other plunder they may have in their possession

commanded a new jersey regiment with which he had been stationed during the year preceding on the westerly frontiers of new york particularly at fort stanwix or fort schuyler as it was called after it was occupied by colonel dayton near the end of the year the regiment was ordered to ticonderoga where it was at this time stationed under lieutenantcolonel barber the service had borne heavily upon the troops and they were impatient to return home this will appear by a letter from lieutenantcolonel barber to colonel dayton dated at mount independence opposite to ticonderoga we have now reached he observes the   th of february but have made no advances towards new jersey what is yet worse there is not the least prospect of our departure notwithstanding our soldiers times are expiring in thick succession the time i long dreaded has come when the virtue of our men is tried in such delicate circumstances they being detained on this ground after their times are out their native province and friends suffering by the depredations of the enemy and a most poisonous example set them here by regiments quitting the ground immediately on the expiration of their enlistments as yet they are quiet but i fear i shall have much trouble with them before we are relieved i have written to general schuyler according to your directions and received his answer requesting my exertions to detain the men until troops can arrive sufficient to garrison this post we have now the dull prospect of lingering out perhaps two months longer in the disagreeable state of a separation of soul and body for you must certainly suppose our hearts are in new jersey though our bodies are on mount independence the men think very hard of their fate they repeat your promises they mention the circumstances of their state friends and property arguments which cause me a difficulty to answer   this expedition under general heath towards new york was unsuccessful the troops who were wholly militia marched in three divisions one commanded by general lincoln proceeded down the road by the north river general scott in the center advanced by the way of white plains and generals wooster and parsons from new rochelle and east chester on the   th just before sunrise the three divisions reached the enemys outposts in the neighborhood of kingsbridge nearly at the same time there was skirmishing and a few prisoners were taken from the enemy at valentines hill this small adventure was magnified into a great victory by the reports that went abroad and when the state of facts became known the reaction on the public mind caused the enterprise to be regarded with some degree of ridicule it is true that the result seemed insignificant when compared with so formidable an array of generals and troops and it is also true that general heath summoned fort independence to surrender in a more lofty and peremptory tone than was expedient unless he was prepared to execute his threat with an overwhelming force his summons was closed with the following words twenty minutes only can be allowed for the garrison to give their answer and should it be in the negative they must abide the consequences the garrison returned no answer and no consequences followed the fort was not attacked and general heath retreated after maintaining his position for ten days very near the enemys works the expedition was well conducted on several accounts but in respect to its main object it was a signal failure the particulars may be found in general heaths memoirs pp  0       read in congress january   th   this proposition was made conformably to a resolve of congress by which general washington was likewise empowered to appoint the agent   general putnam communicated to me last night the disagreeable account that lieutenantcolonel prestons party of militia from cumberland county in this state has deserted him this practice in the militia so generally prevails that unless some effectual check can be speedily applied i apprehend the most fatal consequences the mischief is not confined to the desertion alone they stay till they are properly equipped to render essential service and by that means plunder the public of the necessaries that were at first otherwise intended and would be better applied now i recommend to you that you call immediately into service by such ways as you think best at least one third of all the militia of this state making it generally known amongst them that they must come prepared to stay till the  st of april unless sooner discharged by authority it will occur to them that nothing but their most vigorous exertion at this time will enable me to oppose any design of the enemy and that therefore they ought to continue with me till relieved by the regular troops now raising i mean however that every possible indulgence should be shown to those men who have been in actual service and were regularly discharged and that no excuse shall be admitted for those who have shamefully remained at home when their every thing was at stake—washington to majorgeneral dickinson    january      from the orderly book january  st—the general is sorry to find that the late general order allowing the plunder taken from the enemy to be divided for the benefit of the captors has been mistaken by some and abused by others the indulgence was granted to the scouting parties only as a reward for the extraordinary fatigue hardship and danger they were exposed to upon those parties the general never meant nor had an idea that any of ours or the enemys stores found at any evacuated post were to be considered the property of those that first marched in neither did he mean that any public stores discovered by any of the scouting parties should be appropriated to their use unless they found the enemy in the actual possession and dispossessed them plunder taken under such circumstances either by the militia or the continental troops is to be reported by the commanding officer of the party to some of the continental or provincial generals who are directed to have all the provisions and military stores so taken appraised by the commissary or quartermaster general or their deputies and the party paid the value thereof such articles as are taken not necessary for the use of the army are to be sold at public vendue under the direction of the quartermastergeneral or some of his deputies for the benefit of the captors the general prohibits in both the militia and continental troops in the most positive terms the infamous practice of plundering the inhabitants under the specious pretence of their being tories let the persons of such as are known to be enemies to their country be seized and confined and their property disposed of as the law of the state directs it is our business to give protection and support to the poor distressed inhabitants not to multiply and increase their calamities after the publication of this order any officer either militia or continental found attempting to conceal the public stores plundering the inhabitants under the pretence of their being tories or selling at vendue plunder taken from the enemy in any other manner than these orders direct may expect to be punished in the severest manner and be obliged to account for every thing so taken or sold the adjutantgeneral is to furnish the

this proclamation the circumstances of the case in fact seemed to require it as a necessary check to the effects produced by the measures adopted on the part of the enemy yet it was disapproved by some who believed themselves and doubtless were sincere patriots even in congress there were those who were not backward to hint that it was inexpedient and that in issuing it the commanderinchief had transgressed the bounds of his power mr abraham clark a delegate from new jersey and one of the signers of the declaration of independence expressed himself as follows in a letter to colonel dayton you say that some of our elizabethtown people want the general to alter his proclamation it must render any man unpopular to speak in favor of those who joined the enemy and took protections but i think the generals proclamation a violation of our civil rights and i ventured to call it in question in congress my motion was committed to a committee who reported favorably of the proclamation but foreseeing their report would be contested they desired that the same might lie for consideration which i suppose was with the design that it should never be called for and i presume it never will unless i do it for it is notorious that the general directly counteracted a resolve of congress of the  th of march last strictly forbidding any officer to impose or require any oath of the inhabitants and he requires an oath of allegiance to the united states when such an oath is absurd before our confederation takes place each state requires an oath to that particular state in many other things the proclamation is exceptionable and very improper i believe the general is honest but i think him fallible—ms letter march  th   you will receive with this a copy of my letter to you of

prevails that the enemy are afraid of us if then you should be driven which nothing but the enemys want of spirit can prevent the tables will be turned the country dispirited and we shall again relapse into our former discredit i therefore give it as my opinion that you had better give your remove to the scotch plains the best coloring you can and return to your former station or to springfield for fear of consequences which may be extremely injurious to us   this letter was sent as a circular to all the states   there is such a demand upon me from all quarters for money which i

sufficient quantity to answer their purposes i shall be glad to be informed whether i have a right to draw warrants upon the loan officers in the different states    i must beg that you will write to the assemblies of the different states and insist upon their passing a law to inflict a severe and heavy penalty upon those who harbor deserters knowing them to be such our army is shamefully reduced

upon my arrival before the fort i summoned the garrison to surrender as your excellency is sensible is the practice on the first investing of a place and this i did in particular at the motion of a gentleman before i left peekskill as it was supposed the garrison consisted of hessian troops and from some preceding circumstances it might answer a very good purpose and although some of the enemy may laugh at a fort being summoned and not taken i believe they will scarcely publish the summons after this i called a council of war as i did in every instance of importance during our continuance before the fort and in every one of them the council was unanimous i have taken the liberty of enclosing one of them namely that preceding our removal by which your excellency will perceive that the landing of lord percy to surround us was not so much as mentioned the facts were briefly these the troops were scattered in a circle of more than eight miles we tried to hut them but the rain had driven four of general lincolns regiments from their huts with the loss of nearly all their ammunition the enemy had sallied early one morning and surprised one of our outguards the regiment nearest the place was struck with a panic and had quitted their quarters leaving their baggage the troops were so scattered as not to be collected in less than two or three hours in which case those that were quartered within cannonshot of the fort would be entirely cut to pieces before they could be supported a diffidence and uneasiness were discovered in even the bravest officers in such a situation and a universal desire to get more advantageously quartered every officer objected to a storm as they apprehended the militia inadequate to such an enterprise every purpose it was supposed would be and

to about six thousand men on the   st of january two thousand of these men embarked in twentyfour transports and sailed out of the harbor as it was supposed for new york this diminished the numbers on the island so much that it was thought an attempt to dislodge them might be made with a fair prospect of success a plan was laid for this purpose but there were only four thousand troops at providence and those mostly raw militia and not more than one thousand more of the same description were expected this force was not deemed sufficient in quality or strength to attack under many disadvantages fortified posts manned by veterans and therefore spencer and arnold requested permission to call to their assistance four or five regiments of continental troops from massachusetts and connecticut

since i wrote to you on the  th ins i have been compelled from the spreading of small pox in our army to submit to the necessity of innoculation  have accordingly ordered all the continental troops now here  coming from the western states to be innoculated immediately on their arrival—you will therefore give orders for the innoculating the connecticut troops and as govr cook is desired to forward on the rhode island troops to connecticut for this purpose you will also have proper attention paid to them—i need not recommend to you the greatest secresy and dispatch in this business because a moments reflection will inform you that should the enemy discover our situation they cannot fail taking advantage of it you may perhaps not be able to reconcile this order with the enterprize proposed in my former letter agt long island if that can be carried on at the same time with innoculation i would by no means have you decline but if one must give way to the other of which you will be the best judge innoculation being of the greatest importance must have the preference and the enterprize laid aside it will be best to draw the troops within as small a circle as possible and towards peekskill to have them innoculated by this means if proper care is used the danger of the infections spreading will be small and the country have but little cause to dread it—washington to majorgeneral parsons  0 february        i wish you to consider the prospect you have of raising your regiment for tho it is my desire to promote men of credit to office and to rank yet a regard to publick interest will not authorize their promotions without they can be of service afterwards and multiplying the number of officers without regiments will not be answering the end proposed viz adding to our strength but will be incurring a heavy and large expense i regret much the policy of the new england states which has given rise to so many difficulties and which i fear will be severely felt i cannot give directions for an extra bounty that would be approving a measure which i have always condemned and which so far from being justifiable has been reprobated by congress as impolitick and injurious to the public cause if the gentlemen appointed in those governments to a part of the sixteen additional battalions cannot make up their corps the truth of these observations will be verified and happy will it be if the measure should not extend its baneful influence elsewhere—washington to colonel henry sherburne  0 february        general knox was now in boston to expedite the raising of a battalion of artillery in massachusetts the different bounties given to recruits by the different states particularly in new england caused a good deal of embarrassment in raising the new army congress had resolved to allow a bounty of twenty dollars to every soldier enlisting into the new establishment for three years or during the war a committee of delegates from the several new england states had recently assembled at providence for the purpose of consulting on affairs common to them all and particularly to take into consideration some method of regulating the prices of the necessary articles of life which had become so disproportioned to the wages of soldiers and the laboring classes that much distress was likely to ensue this committee recommended to each of the states which its members represented to add a bounty of thirtythree dollars and one third to the continental bounty of twenty dollars in raising their quotas of the eightyeight battalions but instead of the bounties proposed by the committee the legislature of massachusetts offered double that amount or sixtysix dollars and two thirds which added to the continental bounty made the extraordinary sum of eightysix dollars and two thirds as a gift in advance to every soldier at the time of enlisting it was urged in explanation that the monthly pay of the continental soldiers was so low as to afford no reasonable inducement for men to leave their farms and the legislature chose this mode of giving them a proper compensation in preference to an enlargement of their monthly pay which had been objected to by congress as tending to produce dissatisfaction in the army new hampshire gave the same bounties as massachusetts in connecticut and rhode island additional bounties were likewise given governor trumbull advanced strong arguments in a letter to washington in support of the justice and policy of these bounties the basis of which was the greatly increased expenses of living since the war began and the impossibility that the soldiers in the new england states many of whom were married could supply proper relief to their families from their ordinary pay special bounties were in some cases given by the towns the bounties were intended for the eightyeight battalions only but in connecticut and it is believed in the other states the additional regiments were put on the same footing but there was a particular inconvenience in this affair of the bounties as it operated on the reenlistment of the soldiers already in the army an order had been issued by the commanderinchief on the  st of february expressly forbidding any officer to give or promise a greater bounty in raising men for the eightyeight battalions than that offered by congress or to enlist them from the lines of one state to serve in those of another the consequence was that the soldiers from the states where additional bounties were allowed would not reenlist but preferred to wait till the times of their original enlistments should expire and then return home and secure the bounty whatever may have been the necessity of the measure it was thronged with difficulties in every mode of its application and was a source of perplexities and vexations to the commanderinchief   the exceeding difficulty there is in procuring spirituous liquor with the exorbitant prices now asked for that article renders it absolutely necessary to stop serving it out to the troops in a general way till supplies can be laid in upon more easy and better terms the commissary general is therefore directed to issue none except it be to fatigue parties scouting parties or to such troops as are necessarily employed in any extraordinary piece of duty till further orders—orderly book    february        in conformity with general washingtons proclamation general maxwell who commanded near the enemys lines at elizabethtown had ordered such persons as would not take the oath required to go immediately to the enemy some refused to do either the one or the other on the ground that by the terms of the proclamation they were not obliged to go till the expiration of thirty days on this subject general maxwell wrote for instructions it would seem that many of the inhabitants of new jersey as intimated above p  0  and even those in power were not perfectly satisfied with the proclamation of the commanderinchief issued within the borders of that state and requiring an oath of allegiance to the united states the following is an extract from the minutes of the council dated february  0th— the council having taken into consideration the proclamation of his excellency general washington of the   th of january last whereby it appears that certain of the inhabitants of this state are required to repair to headquarters or to the quarters of the nearest general officer of the continental army or militia and take the oath of allegiance to the united states of america resolved that his excellency the governor be requested to write to his excellency general washington to know whether by the oath above mentioned is to be understood the oath of allegiance prescribed by an act of the general assembly of this state and if not that they request to be furnished with a copy of the oath administered by virtue of the said proclamation the governor accordingly wrote to general washington enclosing this resolve to which he replied i fear it is not in my power to give so full and satisfactory an answer to your request to explain the nature of the oath administered by virtue of my proclamation as you may expect what the style of it was as administered by the brigadiers to whom that business was chiefly assigned i cannot precisely tell my instructions to them were to insist on nothing more than an obligation in no manner to injure the states without reverting to the form of any prescribed law of this state had i known of any particular form adapted to the circumstances of its inhabitants i would most certainly have ordered it—letter march  d   general mifflin had written the enclosed papers were given to me with a request to forward them to your excellency i do not pretend to censure the proceedings of the gentlemen but i think it bad policy to confine persons who will act the part of martyrs and who cannot consistently with their own principles take an active part against us if your excellency thinks proper to order a release it will gratify many of your friends and prevent some who wish to injure our cause from charging us with cruelty and an imitation of the enemy i have not till now had time to answer yours of the  th instant my sentiments respecting the treatment proper to be observed to martyrs coincide with yours lenity will operate with greater force in such instances than rigor t is therefore my first wish to have our whole conduct distinguished by it still it is not my desire neither indeed is it within my power to release any man from a confinement imposed upon him by the civil power they best know the charge and merit of the case consequently should ultimately determine it for these reasons i dare not comply with your request i have enclosed a letter from mr sears the business falls within your department—washington to brigadiergeneral mifflin    february        general lees letter to washington here mentioned was dated at new york february  th in which he said as lord and general howe have given me permission to send the enclosed to the congress and as the contents are of the last importance to me and perhaps not less so to the community i most earnestly entreat my dear general that you will dispatch it immediately and order the congress to be as expeditious as possible in the letter to congress which was enclosed general lee requested that two or three gentlemen might be sent immediately to new york to whom he would communicate what he conceived to be of the greatest importance assuring congress that lord and general howe would grant a safe conduct to the gentlemen thus deputed he did not give the slightest clue to what such an important plan could involve but congress almost unanimously decided that it was inexpedient to send any of their members to such a conference this decision was due to a fear of the impression such a meeting would have on the court of france as the british government had not failed to make the most of the meeting on staten island in september      vol iv p  0  and deane had been much embarrassed by it in his efforts to secure aid from france lee was urgent and wrote another letter reiterating the request but congress adhered to its decision although washington and general greene thought there could arise no injury from accepting the proposition john adams saw in it an artful stratagem of the two grateful brothers to hold up to the public view the phantom of a negotiation in order to give spirits and courage to the tories to distract and divide the whigs at a critical moment when the utmost exertions are necessary to draw together an army they meant further to amuse opposition in england and to amuse foreign nations by this manœuvre as well as the whigs in america—john adams to general greene march      washington on receiving the second refusal of congress to entertain the idea of a conference communicated it to lee who seemed to take the refusal much to heart replying on the  th— it is a most unfortunate circumstance for myself and i think not less so for the public that the congress have not thought proper to comply with my request it could not possibly have been attended with any ill consequences and might with good ones at least it was an indulgence which i thought my situation entitled me to but i am unfortunate in every thing and this stroke is the severest i have yet experienced god send you a different fate adieu my dear general yours most truly and affectionately it was nearly eighty years before the purpose of lee in proposing the meeting was discovered the theft of some of the papers of the secretary of the royal commissioners henry strachey disclosed a plan for putting an end to the war drawn up by general lee and dated    march     —the very day on which congress confirmed its decision not to accede to a conference this scheme has been printed by its owner mr george h moore and contains the plan of a campaign to the southward designed to cripple virginia maryland and pennsylvania and so terminate the contest—on the success of which lee would stake his life—treason of charles lee to his servant guiseppi minghini lee wrote for some necessaries and added if any of the dogs are with you bring them your dogs are in virginia this circumstance i regret as you will be deprived of the satisfaction and amusements you hoped to derive from their friendly and companionable dispositions—washington to general lee    february      i concur with you in the belief that the backwardness observed by the militia in turning out may be fairly charged to their officers—an observation that should have its due weight with the power that appoints them very many of our misfortunes originate in the want of proper attention to the choice of officers in answer to the representation of the joint meeting of the council and assembly of this state respecting the rank of officers in their battalions i take the liberty to observe that i know of no method freer from the charge of injustice and partiality than to refer the decision to a board of officers so soon as the battalions are raised before them every officer will have an opportunity of advancing all his reasons for precedence the disputes that prevailed on a like occasion at cambridge were settled in this way to the satisfaction of them all—washington to governor livingston    february      we are now at an enormous bounty and with no small difficulty recruiting an army of upwards of an hundred battalions the ensuing campaign may from the same causes prove as sickly as the last if the hospitals are in no better condition for the reception of the sick our regiments will be reduced to companies by the end of the campaign and those poor wretches who escape with life will be either scattered up and down the country and not to be found or if found totally enervated and unfit for further duty by these means the bounty is not only lost but the man is lost also and i leave you to judge whether we have men enough to allow of such a consumption of lives and constitutions as have been lost the last campaign for my own part i am certain that if the army which i hope we shall have in the field this year is suffered to moulder away by sickness as it did the last we must look for reinforcements to some other places than our own states    i hear from every quarter that the dread of undergoing the same miseries for want of proper care and attention when sick has much retarded the new enlistments particularly to the southward—washington to the president of congress    february      lord stirling did me the favor of sending to me your letter of the  th inst to him mentioning your cheerfulness to continue in service though your brigade had returned home and waiting my determination on that head the readiness with which you took the field at the period most critical to our affairs the industry you used in bringing out the militia of the delaware state and the alertness observed by you in forwarding on the troops from trenton reflect the highest honor on your character and place your attachment to the cause in a most distinguished point of view they claim my sincerest thanks and i am happy in this opportunity of giving them to you circumstanced as you are i see no necessity of detaining you longer from your family and affairs which no doubt demand your presence and attention you have therefore my leave to return—washington to brigadiergeneral cæsar rodney    february      to obviate all difficulties that would otherwise arise on account of the dates of commissions i have determined that all commissions in the new army shall bear date on the  st january      and then a board of officers shall determine the precedency which when ascertained may be settled by numbering the commissions or some such way i was aware of the animosities that would arise if rank was claimed agreeable to the dates in the different states and therefore determined upon the foregoing mode which gives an equal chance to every person according to his former services—washington to major general parsons    february        sorry i am to inform you and this i do under the rose to be known only to those who ought to be acquainted with it that without it their numbers are nearly double ours and what kind of troops ours are you need not be informed when i tell you that we have scarce any other than militia unhappily for us most of those that could be depended upon are down with the small pox either by inocculation or in the natural way—washington to gates  0 february        general skinner was a royalist of new jersey and his corps consisted of persons of that description who had taken advantage of general howes proclamation and given in their adhesion to the king an interesting sketch of these new jersey volunteers loyalists has been written by william s stryker adjutantgeneral of new jersey   mr burke a member of congress from north carolina sent to the governor of that state a sketch of the debate on the principal subject of this letter which was marked with much warmth there was a unanimous disposition however for using every possible effort to strengthen the army and ample resolutions to this effect were passed journals february   th one of the resolutions was closed with the following superfluous not to say pompous paragraph it being the earnest desire of congress to make the army under the immediate command of general washington sufficiently strong not only to curb and confine the enemy within their present quarters and prevent them from drawing support of any kind from the country but by the divine blessing totally to subdue them before they can be reinforced in discussing this paragraph strong indications were given of the temper and secret sentiments of the members mr burke observes jersey pennsylvania north carolina and south carolina voted for expunging it the four eastern states virginia and georgia for retaining it there appeared through this whole debate a great desire in some of the delegates from the eastern states and in one from new jersey to insult the general in this fact we discover the silent workings of the spirit of hostility to the commanderinchief which assumed a formidable aspect both in congress and in the army before the end of the year sparks   read in congress february   th   monsieur faneuils scheme was not approved by congress in reference to the last part of the above letter congress informed general washington that in their opinion no foreign officers ought to receive commissions in the army who were not well acquainted with the english language and did not bring strong testimonials of their abilities journals march   th on the day before the committee of secret correspondence was instructed to write to all their ministers and agents abroad to discourage all gentlemen from coming to america with expectations of employment in the service unless they are masters of our language and have the best recommendations after having been pressed by general washington to increase the number of generals in the army by promotion and new appointments congress on the   th of february appointed five majorgenerals namely stirling mifflin st clair stephen and lincoln the last was taken for the first time into the continental service having till now commanded the massachusetts militia ten brigadiergenerals were elected on the   st of february namely poor glover paterson wayne varnum dehaas weedon muhlenberg john cadwalader and woodford the appointment was not accepted by cadwalader he had not been previously in continental service but had acquired much reputation by his command of the pennsylvania militia the feeling inspired by washington in his aides is well illustrated by a passage in a letter written by tench tilghman to his father—a loyalist— if it pleases god to spare the life of the honestest man that i believe ever adorned human nature i have no doubt of it freedom i think i know the sentiments of his heart and in prosperity and adversity i never knew him utter a wish or drop an expression that did not tend to the good of his country regardless of his own interest he is blessed wherever he goes for the tory is protected in person and property equally with the whig and indeed i often think more for it is his maxim to convert by good usage and not by severity—   february        read in congress march   th   our delicate and truly critical situation for want of a sufficient force to oppose the enemy who are now ready and before many days elapse will take the field induced me to expect that the troops raising in the southern states and intended for this army would march in companies or half companies as they were made up without waiting for their regiments to be compleat policy strongly suggested the propriety of the measure and i requested it but to my great anxiety and surprize i am told that this line of conduct is totally neglected tho a great number of recruits are actually engaged i must entreat congress to interpose again with their most pressing applications  commands that this expedient may be adopted without a moments delay no injury can result from it because a sufficient number and proper officers can and must be left to recruit the corps to their full complement nor will my fears respecting the state of our arms allow me to be silent on that head let the states be urged to send their men equipped with them and every other necessary if possible—i know not what supplies may be in store else where or in the power of congress but they must not depend upon their being furnished here with any or but with very few no human prudence or precaution could secure but a small part of those belonging to the public and in the hands of the soldiery from being embezzled and carried off when their time of service expired nor can the same abuses be restrained in the militia—washington to the president of congress    february      the cry of want of provisions comes to me from every quarter—genl maxwell writes word that his people are starving—genl johnson of maryland yesterday informd me that his people could draw none—this difficulty i understand prevails also at chatham—what sir is the meaning of this—and why were you so desirous of excluding others from this business when you are unable to accomplish it yourself—consider i beseech you the consequences of this neglect and exert yourself to remove the evil  complaints which cannot be less fatal to the army than disagreeable to sir yr most obedt—washington to commissary irvine    february        colonel campbell had been taken prisoner in boston harbor on board a transport in june      see vol iv p       see journals of congress january          general washington was authorized by congress to settle any disputes in the army respecting rank journals    february      but notwithstanding this power it was his custom to refer all cases of this sort to the decision of a board of officers   i last night received the favor of your letter and am much obliged by the opinion you are pleased to entertain of me i am not invested with the powers you suppose and it is as incompatible with my authority as my inclination to contravene any determinations congress may make but as it does not appear to me that your present treatment is required by any resolution of theirs but is the result of misconception i have written my opinion of the matter to colonel bowdoin which i imagine will procure a mitigation of what you now suffer i have also requested that inquiry be made into the case of captain walker and proper steps taken to remove all just cause of complaint concerning him i shall always be happy to manifest my disinclination to any undue severities towards those whom the fortune of war may chance to throw into my hands—washington to lieutenantcolonel campbell   march      at the same time that colonel campbell wrote to general washington he also sent a long letter to sir william howe which was forwarded through the hands of the council of massachusetts and in which he described the situation in very expressive language he acknowledges having received kind and proper treatment till this resolve of congress for retaliation but gives a revolting picture of his condition in concord gaol see his letter in the remembrancer vol v p     colonel campbell was a member of parliament for dumfermline in scotland   resolved that the board of war be directed immediately to order the five hessian fieldofficers and lieutenantcolonel campbell into safe and close custody it being the unalterable resolution of congress to retaliate on them the same punishment as may be inflicted on the person of general lee—journal february  0th congress assigned as a reason for this resolve the letter from general howe to general washington dated january   d   read in congress march   th on the main subject of this letter congress resolved that general washington be informed that congress cannot agree to any alteration in the resolve passed on the  th of january and as to the complaints of colonel campbell it was never their intention that he should suffer any other hardship than such confinement as is necessary to his security for the purpose of that resolve—journals march   th in communicating this resolve the president of congress observed the obvious distinction of general howe in his treatment of general lee who is notoriously committed to the custody of the provost and denied his parole while our other officers are admitted to it was the ground on which congress proceeded when they passed that resolve of january  th the intention of which was to show that in proportion as severities against him were increased the same treatment should be exercised on six fieldofficers—letter march   th during the last campaign the greatest part of the army were at a considerable continental expense well armed from whence i had hopes that in arming our new one no very great difficulty would obstruct us but in opposition to all my orders and notwithstanding my utmost vigilance most of the regiments going off at different times from different places and under different circumstances took off with em many public arms that were put into their hands these no doubt are still in possession of the individuals who bore them away and may i should suppose with little expense and some activity in the officers aided by the supreme civil power in each state be regained to the public unless some such step as this is adopted and attended with success i fear we shall not be able to furnish a sufficient number for our soldiers satisfactory answers to my repeated applications on the subject have not yet been favored me with by congress so that i am still a stranger to the resources they have it therefore behoves each state in addition to my endeavors to exert its most unwearied activity in arming its quota before they march for the field our situation and prospects compel me in the most pressing manner to call your attention towards expediting the recruiting and equipping of your battalions—washington to the convention of new york   march      the embarrassment about firearms which threatened to be serious and alarming was happily relieved by the arrival of two vessels from france in the month of march one at portsmouth in new hampshire with a cargo of about twelve thousand fusees one thousand barrels of powder blankets and military stores on account of the united states and the other at philadelphia with eleven thousand fusees of which six thousand belonged to the united states and the remainder were purchased by congress for the public service this fortunate supply added to those already in use was enough to equip the whole army for the approaching campaign and was of the utmost importance congress voted that five thousand of the firearms brought into portsmouth should be delivered to the council of massachusetts three thousand were received by connecticut and more than two thousand by new hampshire   this letter was in reply to one which mr morris had lately written remarking on a previous letter from general washington to him in which the prospects of the future particularly in regard to the movements and designs of the enemy were depicted in sombre colors i do not like to be sanguine observed mr morris and yet it is necessary in a contest like this we are engaged in to view the best side of the picture frequently remember good sir that few men can keep their feelings to themselves and that it is necessary for examples sake that all leaders should feel and think boldly in order to inspirit others who look up to them heaven no doubt for the noblest purposes has blessed you with a firmness of mind steadiness of countenance and patience in sufferings that give you infinite advantages over other men this being the case you are not to depend on other peoples exertions being equal to your own one mind feeds and thrives on misfortunes by finding resources to get the better of them another sinks under their weight thinking it impossible to resist and as the latter description probably includes the majority of mankind we must be cautious of alarming them i hate deception and cannot wish any thing like it should ever escape you but i really think if the bright side of our affairs were sometimes to be painted by your pen or sanctified by your name it would draw forth the exertions of some good men sooner than distress does from others i hope you will excuse me for this style of writing which almost amounts to confidential and were i sure of such being received in the same light in which i write it i should lament to you the absence of many great good and valuable men from congress for if great care is not taken that body so respectable from the nature of the appointment the importance of its object and the respectable characters of its heretofore individual members will lose great part of its weight and consequence in the eyes of our own people we have now to lament the absence from the public councils of america of johnson jay r r livingston duane deane w livingston franklin dickinson harrison nelson hooper rutledge and others not less conspicuous without any proper appointments to fill their places and this at the very time they are most wanted or would be so if they had not very wisely supplied the deficiency by delegating to your excellency certain powers that they durst not have entrusted to any other men but what is to become of america and its cause if a constant fluctuation is to take place among its counsellors and at every change we find reason to view it with regret—letter february   th   mr morris accorded in opinion with general washington on this point he said in reply i wish with you that they had complied with general lees request and when i sent forward those despatches to baltimore i wrote my sentiments to some of the members i must hint to you what i take to be one of the most forcible arguments that has been used in congress against this measure i have not heard that it was used but it occurred to me on reading general lees letters i mean the effect it might have at the court of france should they hear as they undoubtedly would that members of congress visited general lee by permission of the british commissioners the meeting with lord howe at staten island last summer injured mr deanes negotiations much and retarded supplies intended for us—letter march  th   in the list of promotions on the   th of february congress had entirely omitted brigadiergeneral arnold and raised five junior officers over him to the rank of majorgeneral this measure was deeply regretted by washington who valued highly the military abilities of arnold and who considered the good of the service to require a strict regard to the customary rewards for professional merit we have lately had several promotions to the rank of majorgeneral and i am at a loss whether you have had a preceding appointment as the newspapers announce or whether you have been omitted through some mistake should the latter be the case i beg you will not take any hasty steps in consequence of it but allow proper time for recollection which i flatter myself will remedy any error that may have been made my endeavors to that end shall not be wanting—washington to arnold   march      arnold wrote in reply i am greatly obliged to your excellency for interesting yourself so much in my behalf in respect to my appointment which i have had no advice of and know not by what means it was announced in the papers i believe none but the printer has a mistake to rectify congress undoubtedly have a right of promoting those whom from their abilities and their long and arduous services they esteem most deserving their promoting junior officers to the rank of majorgenerals i view as a very civil way of requesting my resignation as unqualified for the office i hold my commission was conferred unsolicited and received with pleasure only as a means of serving my country with equal pleasure i resign it when i can no longer serve my country with honor the person who void of the nice feelings of honor will tamely condescend to give up his right and retain a commission at the expense of his reputation i hold as a disgrace to the army and unworthy of the glorious casue in which we are engaged when i entered the service of my country my character was unimpeached i have sacrified my interest ease and happiness in her cause it is rather a misfortune than a fault that my exertions have not been crowned with success i am conscious of the rectitude of my intentions in justice therefore to my own character and for the satisfaction of my friends i must request a court of inquiry into my conduct and though i sensibly feel the ingratitude of my countrymen yet every personal injury shall be buried in my zeal for the safety and happiness of my country in whose cause i have repeatedly fought and bled and am ready at all times to risk my life i shall cautiously avoid any hasty step in consequence of the appointments which have taken place that may tend to the injury of my country—letter dated at providence march   th again in my last i intimated to your excellency the impossibility of my remaining in a disagreeable situation in the army my being superseded must be viewed as an implicit impeachment of my character i therefore requested a court of inquiry into my conduct i believe the time is now at hand when i can leave this department without any damage to the public interest when that is the case i will wait on your excellency not doubting my request will be granted and that i shall be able to acquit myself of every charge which malice or envy can bring against me—march   th   brigadiergeneral lewis resigned his commission in the service which was accepted by congress on the   th of april by some resolves of congress just come to my hands i find as i hoped and expected your name in the new appointment of brigadiers but perceived at the same time that you were named after muhlenberg and weedon the reason assigned for this was your having resigned your former rank in the service of the continent you may well recollect my dear sir that i strongly advised you against this resignation i now as strongly recommend your acceptance of the present appointment you may feel somewhat hurt in having two officers placed before you though perhaps never to command you who once were inferior in point of rank to you but remember that this is a consequence of your own act and consider what a stake we are contending for trifling punctilios should have no influence upon a mans conduct in such a cause and at such a time as this if smaller matters do not yield to greater if trifles light as air in comparison with what we are contending for can withdraw or withhold gentlemen from service when our all is at stake and a single cast of the die may turn the tables what are we to expect it is not a common contest we are engaged in every thing valuable to us depends upon the success of it and the success upon a steady and vigorous exertion consider twice therefore before you refuse in case of acceptance which i wish and expect i have to desire that you will repair immediately to headquarters as general officers are exceedingly wanted to assist in arranging the new army at all events let me hear from you as speedily as possible—washington to brigadiergeneral woodford   march        the letter from general lee purported to be written chiefly to request his aidedecamp major jacob morris to visit him in new york but he also renewed the strong desire which he had before expressed in a letter to congress of having an interview with some of its members who should be deputed for the purpose   read in congress march   th   i think you were right in not putting any thing to the risque of a miscarriage for until we get our new army properly established it is our business to play a certain game and not depend upon militia for any thing capital—washington to general spencer    march        a militia bill was depending in the new jersey legislature admitting of a composition for actual service from £  to £ 0 in this situation of things wrote the governor i despair of being able to execute the requisition of congress    i cannot make our assembly sensible of the importance of an effectual militia law or if they be they are so unduly influenced by the fear of disobliging their constituents that they dare not exert themselves with the requisite spirit for the exigencies of war to this washington replied— how can an assembly of gentlemen eyewitnesses of the distresses and inconveniences which have their principal source in the want of a well regulated militia hesitate to adopt the only remedy that can remove them and stranger still think of a law that must necessarily add to the accumulated load of confusion for heavens sake entreat them to lay aside their present opinions and waving every other consideration let the public good be singularly attended to the ease they design their constituents by competition must be delusive every injurious distinction between the rich and the poor ought to be laid aside now the enemy cannot remain much longer in their present situation their peace for some days past indicates preparations to move when they do your assembly may perhaps wish that their militia were in the field i have endeavored to cut off the communication between bergen and new york having received intelligence of it a few days ago—to governor livingston   march      in my opinion the present time is of infinitely greater worth than is generally supposed vain and useless will all our civic institutions however wise prove unless the state of independence in which alone they can operate is secured and as this must necessarily depend on the success of our arms military preparations should possess an eminent degree of our deliberations and care—washington to governor livingston   march        the president of congress had written to general gates on the subject of his discharging again the duties of adjutantgeneral in reference to this letter gates wrote to washington i own i was surprised at the contents and the more so as it was not preceded by one on the same subject from your excellency unless it is your earnest desire that such a measure should directly take place i would by no means consent to it he never resumed the office of adjutantgeneral on the   th of march he was directed by congress to repair immediately to ticonderoga and take command of the army there   general wooster had resigned his commission in the continental army and was now in command of the connecticut militia   in regard to this affair general wooster had written that john stanton had lately gone into new york and come back with a flag of truce from general howe to take a widow lady and her effects into the city stanton was permitted to land with his flag and then he went to new rochelle passing through general woosters camp on the way under these circumstances general wooster detained him and wrote to the commanderinchief for advice   i concur with you in opinion that every reason is against making any allowance in cash to such officers as may not chuse to keep the number of horses allowed them no person must think of drawing a single shilling of public money as a perquisite—washington to majorgeneral mifflin q m g    march        read in congress    march        printed from the draft in washingtons own ms the difficulty if not impossibility of giving congress a just idea of our situation and of several other important matters requiring their earliest attention by letter has induced me to prevail on majorgeneral greene to wait upon them for that purpose this gentleman is so much in my confidence so intimately acquainted with my ideas with our strength and our weakness with every thing respecting the army that i have thought it unnecessary to particularize or prescribe any certain line of duty or inquiries for him i shall only say from the rank he holds as an able and good officer in the estimation of all who know him he deserves the greatest respect and much regard is due to his opinions in the line of his profession he has upon his mind such matters as appear to me most material to be immediately considered and many more will probably arise during the intercourse you may think proper to honor him with on all which i wish to have the sense of congress and the result of such deliberations as may be formed thereupon—washington to the president of congress    march        general george clinton was appointed by congress on the   th of march commandant of the forts in the highlands with the rank of brigadiergeneral on this occasion the commanderinchief wrote to him as follows i congratulate you most cordially on your late appointment to a command in the continental army i assure you it gave me great pleasure when i read the resolve and i wish that your exertions may be crowned with a suitable success—letter march   st the appointment had been recommended to congress by the convention of new york   after the departure of general heath for massachusetts the command at peekskill devolved on general mcdougall military stores and provisions to a considerable amount had been collected at that place which tempted sir william howe to project a scheme for destroying them to prepare the way an american officer who had been captured at fort washington was sent out as exchanged being escorted with a flag to general mcdougalls outguards this officer reported that the enemy talked publicly of making an excursion into the country with the design of taking off the forage and that they intended to effect it by three divisions one to proceed up the sound to mamaroneck another from kingsbridge by the centre road and a third to land at tarrytown a conversation of this kind had doubtless been held in the hearing of the officer that the intelligence thus conveyed by him might draw off the attention of general mcdougall from the real point of attack as he had only two hundred and fifty men at the post he took no other steps in consequence of this report than to prepare for removing the stores to places of greater safety at forts montgomery and constitution before this was accomplished however nine or ten sail of the enemys vessels appeared in the north river near tarrytown and two of them ascended as high as tellers point twelve miles below peekskill on the evening of the   d of march the next morning at nine oclock the whole fleet was under sail and at twelve they anchored in the bay at peekskill consisting of the brune frigate two ships and two brigs three galleys and four transports with some small craft the whole under the command of colonel bird at one oclock about five hundred men in eight flatboats landed at lents cove on the south side of the bay having four pieces of light artillery drawn by the sailors this force being double that under general mcdougall he retreated to the hills beyond the town towards the highlands giving directions for destroying such stores as could not be removed at the same time he sent orders to lieutenantcolonel willet to leave a subalterns command at fort constitution and march a detachment to his assistance the british kept possession of the town till the next day when it was found that a party had advanced to a high ground flanked by a wood here they were attacked by colonel willet in the afternoon and a smart skirmish ensued the party retreated to the main body and in the evening favored by the light of the moon they all embarked and sailed down the river nine of the enemy were killed and wounded in the skirmish with willett and four were killed at the creek while attempting to burn the boats the americans had one man mortally wounded by a cannonshot the loss of provisions and stores was considerable and the principal object of the enemy was effected—general mcdougalls ms letter march   th sir william howes letter to lord george germaine april  st general washington expressed his full approbation of general mcdougalls conduct and wrote to congress that he conceived every prudent step had been taken and as good a disposition made as the small number of troops would admit   read in congress

your concurrence and if it should i must request that you will lose no time in repairing to headquarters the arrangement of the new army and the good of the service requiring that the post should be immediately filled the pay i presume you are acquainted with but lest you should not i think proper to mention that it is a hundred and twentyfive dollars a month should circumstances put it out of

resigned on the  th i have to lament that the expressions intended to thank the late council of safety for easing me of a part of the heavy load i bear in forming our new army could be so misunderstood by your board i rejoiced at hearing that they had not only appointed their officers in the first instance but arranged them likewise and desired that in future i should fill up the vacancies as they happen intending thereby to save you the trouble and prevent delays—washington to the pennsylvania board of war   april      the expressions referred to were contained in a letter to the council of safety dated march   th as follows by the late powers granted to me by congress i had a right to fill up all commissions under the rank of brigadiergeneral but as i thought the conventions assemblies or councils of safety of the different states were best acquainted with the persons proper to fill the necessary appointments i was pleased to see that you had completed your arrangements yourselves in the first instance in order to prevent the inconveniences and delays that may arise from any vacancies that may happen in future remaining unfilled i shall take the liberty to make the appointments always taking care to pay a due regard to seniority where merit is equal   i am anxious to know whether general arnolds nonpromotion was owing to accident or design and the cause of it surely a more active a more spirited and sensible officer fills no department in your army not seeing him then in the list of majorgenerals and no mention made of him has given me uneasiness as it is not to be presumed being the oldest brigadier that he will continue in service under such a slight i imagine you will lose two or three other very good officers by promoting yours or any ones over them my public letters will give you the state of matters in this quarter and my anxiety to be informed of the reason of arnolds nonpromotion gives you the trouble of this letter—washington to richard henry lee   march        the pay abstract of the tenth regiment of connecticut militia from october to january last was this day presented to me for paymt the very unreasonable disproportion of officers induced me to decline giving orders for the payment i must beg the favor of you to have some mode adopted by which the public treasury may be eased of such extraordinary demands impositions of this nature are provided for in future by congress but how we are to remedy those that have happened i am at a loss to determine i can only say that nothing shall pass through my hands that may be construed into the slightest approbation of such impositions i have enclosed the abstract for your consideration—washington to governor trumbull   april      i must insist that you will not in a single instance abate your attention to the purchase of arms the late arrivals will not supply the continental arms they must therefore be proportionately delivered out and he who depends entirely on being supplied from these funds and omits purchasing all the arms within his reach will be greatly disappointed the campaign is on the very eve of opening a decisive blow at the beginning will leave the fortunate party very little to do for some time afterwards now if the officers in direct disobedience of my repeated orders wait at their respective homes in good quarters till they are pleased to think they can conveniently leave them i must take the field with little more than my family and lose this important opportunity—washington to samuel b webb   april        in consequence of general howes suggestion that some person should be appointed by general washington to meet a british officer for the purpose of settling the differences that existed in regard to the exchange of prisoners colonel harrison had been selected for this purpose and received his powers and instructions on the  th of march a meeting took place between him and colonel walcott the british commissioner it proved ineffectual as to the points at issue and there was another meeting on the  d of april when as the parties did not agree colonel walcott presented to colonel harrison a paper which the latter considered so objectionable in its temper and contents that he would not receive it although it was brought prepared and was hence presumed to have been approved by general howe as colonel harrison refused to be the bearer of it to general washington it was sent out by a flag under the cover of a letter from lord cornwallis walcotts demand and washingtons reply were published by order of congress   the following clause was here inserted in the first draft of the letter but it was omitted in the transcript sent to general howe—happily we found an equivalent so far as their number went in those returned from canada and who had experienced the humanity of general carleton   the design of washingtons letter and its publication by the congress was to sanctify their breach of faith in not sending back our soldiers in exchange to represent general howe as devoid of humanity and to irritate the deluded americans still more against the english nation as a people totally lost to virtue it was by such misrepresentations and falsehoods that the rebel leaders first fomented and brought on the present rebellion and they still concontinue to support it by the same infamous means men of malignant and ambitious dispositions of mind are always at the head of their affairs it was such dispositions that made lovell a delegate and washington a general—politicus in the london chronicle    august      john adams wrote of this letter washington is in the right and has maintained his argument with a delicacy and dignity which do him much honor he has hinted at the flagitious conduct of the two howes towards their prisoners in so plain and clear a manner that he cannot be misunderstood but yet decency and delicacy are preserved which is the more to be applauded because the natural resentment of such atrocious cruelties renders it very difficult to avoid a more pointed language in describing them—to his wife    april        i have the disagreeable information that disputes still prevail in your state about the rank of your officers and that the recruiting service is exceedingly injured by them shall the general cause be injured by such illtimed and ineffectual jarrings among them i have inclosed two resolves of congress warmly hoping that the knowledge of them may tend to an honorable and necessary accomodation—no settlement which they can make and submit to among themselves will affect the army at large—i have long since determined to refer the adjusting of rank to a board of general officers which will proceed upon the business so soon as the army collect and circumstances will admit—washington to governor johnson    april        for some days past there has been a pretty considerable movement among the enemy in their shipping c whilst it seems next to impossible to make our officers in any of the states exert themselves in bringing in their men to the field as if it were a matter of moonshine whether they come today tomorrow a week or a month hence the campaign will i expect be opened without men on our side unless they come in much faster than i have reason to expect them the unfortunate policy of short enlistments is daily and hourly exemplified thoroughly convinced i am that if the troops who were enlisted last year had been engaged for the war or even three years i could with them and such aids as might have been drawn to our assistance have drove the british army and their auxiliary troops out of the jerseys in the course of last winter i do not know but they might also have been driven from new york instead of that we have at this late day an army to assemble for selfdefence but past errors cannot be rectified we must guard as much as possible against future evils the ridiculous and inconsistent orders given by the executive powers in some of the states and even by the officers therein for the rendezvous of their men is scarcely to be thought of with patience it would seem as if to harass the troops and delay their junction were the ends in view—washington to john augustine washington    april        i heard of mr franklins practices some time ago and advised governor trumbull of the same that his conduct might be properly attended to it is very unhappy for us that thro the intrigues of such men the enemy have found means to raise a spirit of disaffection but too general in many of the states in this i have strong assurances that it has arisen to a great height and i shall not be disappointed if a large number of the inhabitants in some of the counties should openly appear in arms as soon as the enemy begin their operations i have taken every measure in my power to suppress it but nevertheless several from sussex and bergen have joined their army and the spirit becomes more and more daring every day—washington to the president of congress    april        at the request of the virginia council governor henry had written lamenting the tardiness with which the continental enlistments proceeded in that state and proposing a volunteer corps which he thought could be raised without much difficulty he said it would consist of men from the upper country who would make excellent soldiers and continue long enough in service to become regularly disciplined it was a part of the plan that they should find their own arms clothes and blankets and choose their captains and subalterns who should in their turn elect the fieldofficers they were to be subject to the continental articles of war governor henry stated as an apology for the deficiency in the enlistments of the virginia regulars that many obstacles had been thrown in the way the georgians and carolinians had enlisted there two battalions at least a regiment of artillery was in great forwardness colonel baylor was collecting a regiment of horse and colonel grayson one of the sixteen additional regiments adding to these the indian wars and marine service the want of necessaries the false reports of deserters and the terrors of the smallpox governor henry believed it not to be difficult to account for the deficient enlistments in a satisfactory manner governor henrys ms letter march   th   general howe having received information from the minister that a small number only of the solicited reinforcements would be sent to america was obliged to change his plan of operations for the campaign which has been stated above p    note and to curtail very considerably his proposed sphere of action he wrote to lord george germaine in a secret despatch on the  d of april that the idea of an attempt against new england must be given up as also that of any important movement up the north river his main purpose now was to invade pennsylvania by sea not deeming a march through the jerseys expedient on account of the difficulties and delays that must attend it three thousand provincial troops under governor tryon were to be left at new york to act on the hudson or against connecticut as circumstances might point out at the same time he wrote to sir guy carleton stating his inability to cooperate with the northern army particularly in the first part of the campaign he gave encouragement however that a sufficient force might be spared to open the communication for shipping through the highlands and that this corps might afterwards act in favor of the northern army the constructing of the bridge was probably a finesse to conceal his real designs your friendly and affectionate wishes for my health and success have a claim to my most grateful acknowledgments that the god of armies may incline the hearts of my american brethren to support the present contest and bestow sufficient abilities on me to bring it to a speedy and happy conclusion thereby enabling me to sink into sweet retirement and the full enjoyment of that peace and happiness which will accompany a domestic life is the first wish and most fervent prayer of my soul my best respects await your good family and neighbors at mount airy as also any other inquiring friends with every wish for your health and happiness i remain dear sir—washington to london carter    april        this was in reply to a resolve of congress that the appellations congresss own regiment and general washingtons life guards were improper and ought not to be kept in use—journals april   th   read april   st referred to board of war complaints have been made by a number of farmers and others in different parts of the country but especially on the roads between this place and philadelphia that the waggons light horse and others belonging to the continental army have and do continue to take down the fences of their fields of grain and grass lanes which at this season must be attended with consequences very prejudicial to the community in general it is therefore his excellency the generals orders that no person belonging to the said army does on any pretence whatever take down any such fences or leave open any bars or gates or ride or travel thro any such inclosures unless a danger of falling into the hands of the enemy renders it absolutely necessary in all other cases they are to keep the high roads as they will answer the contrary by being punished for a breach of orders—orderly book    april      i lament captain conways loss but tho my indignation at such ungenerous conduct of the enemy might at first prompt me to retaliation yet humanity  policy forbid the measure—experience proves that their wanton cruelty injures rather than benefits their cause that with our forbearance justly secures to us the attachment of all good men i cannot therefore consent to your proposition being carried any farther—washington to general stephen  0 april        the following statement will show how much influence a small circumstance will sometimes have in war arthur lee was in bordeaux on the  0th of february where he received a letter from a confidential correspondent who assured him that boston was certainly to be attacked in the spring and that burgoyne was to command this intelligence was sent by arthur lee to the secret committee of congress and by them transmitted to general washington and the legislature of massachusetts thus embarrassing the commanderinchief as to the designs of the enemy and alarming the people of massachusetts and turning their thoughts to the raising of forces for their own protection when the best interests of the cause required them to contribute all the strength in their power to the main army the intelligence was false and was probably communicated by a finesse of the british government with the view of distracting the attention of the americans in regard to the real objects of the approaching campaign—sparks   i wrote you on the   d instant communicating intelligence lately received respecting the enemys designs up the no river a letter from general mcdougall this moment received places their intentions beyond the power of misconception several transports have anchored at dobbs ferry and in my opinion they intend to divert our attention if possible from their movements towards the delaware at any rate they may attempt to make some incursions into the country back of this place and if they can seize the passes through the mountains thereby aiming to cut off the communication between the army here and the no river to frustrate such a design effectually i must repeat my desire that you would post as good a body of troops in the mountains west of the river as you can collect and spare from the garrison this will serve not only to retain our possession of the passes but will awe the disaffected and protect our friends—washington to brigadiergeneral george clinton    april        general glover changed his mind after receiving this letter he accepted the appointment and in a few days joined the army in the letter to which the above was an answer he gave as a reason for declining the commission that he did not think himself qualified to fill an office of that rank this objection was so novel that it is fair to presume there were other motives acting on the mind of general glover though not explained in his letter   dr craik was a most intimate personal friend of washington from the very beginning of his public career till the end of his life on the  th of march      dr craik was commissioned a surgeon in the regiment commanded by colonel fry and shortly afterwards by colonel washington he was in the army during that camgaign and present at the battle of the great meadows the year following he was a surgeon in braddocks army and took part in the memorable action of the monongahela he was often heard to say in relating the particulars of that eventful conflict that he expected every moment to see colonel washington fall while riding in the most exposed manner after nearly all the officers had been either killed or disabled by wounds dr craik served almost the whole of the french war in the virginia regiment and then settled as a physician in the neighborhood of mount vernon and finally at alexandria from that time he was the physician to washingtons family and ever associated with him on terms of the closest friendship   dr craik accepted the appointment of assistant directorgeneral of the middle department   the desertions from our army of late have been very considerable genl howes proclamation and the bounty allowed to those who carry their arms have had an unhappy influence on too many of the soldiery in a particular manner on those who are not natives nor have the base frauds practised by several of our officers contributed a little to this in my opinion many of the privates complain loudly declaring they have not received either pay or bounty—others not a farthing of the latter and they have become so mutinous and uneasy in many cases that i have been obliged to draw warrants for money on account to distribute among the men not having it in my power to obtain regular abstracts notwithstanding the most pointed and repeated orders on the other hand some of the officers aver they have not been able to collect and adjust yet all their recruiting accounts i could wish some measures could be devised to cause more frequent desertions of their troops—congress may think of some expedient—a larger bounty might have some effect and money to the foreigners in lieu of land the bounty given by genl howe to those who carry in arms is sixteen dollars as we are told tho his proclamation only expresses they shall have the full value to the inhabitants who will take up arms and join him he promises land—washington to the president of congress   may        the british shipping was probably sent up the north river for two objects the first to menace peekskill and thus prevent general mcdougall from detaching any forces towards danbury and the second to receive the troops who were sent against that place should circumstances render the route in the north river more expedient than a return to their landingplace on the sound general mcdougall however had anticipated general washingtons advice and marched with twelve hundred men and one fieldpiece as far as bedford where he heard that the enemy had retreated towards norwalk and were beyond his reach   on the   th of april about five oclock in the afternoon two thousand british troops landed at compo near fairfield under the command of governor tryon with the design of proceeding into the country to danbury twentythree miles from the place of landing and of destroying the public stores collected in that town they reached danbury the next day at four oclock in the afternoon having met with no opposition in their march they immediately set fire to the public stores and several private dwellinghouses colonel huntington was at danbury with fifty continental soldiers and one hundred militia a force too feeble to attempt any resistance and he retreated to the heights near the town meantime general silliman an officer of the continental militia who was at fairfield and saw the landing of the enemy called together as many militia as possible and sent off a small party that evening who came upon the enemy and had a skirmish with their advance guard the next morning general silliman marched in pursuit with all the men he could muster about four miles from redding he was joined by general arnold and at redding they met general wooster their whole force was now six hundred men of whom one hundred were continental here they stopped to refresh their troops and they reached bethel on the road to danbury about twelve oclock at night where they heard that the town was destroyed at daylight the next morning arnold and silliman proceeded with four hundred men to ridgefield with the design of intercepting the enemy on their return and wooster with two hundred men took another route to harass their rear he soon fell in with the enemys retreating column and in a skirmish received a mortal wound when arnold arrived at ridgefield his numbers had increased to five hundred he took a position across the road threw up a breastwork and waited the approach of the enemy which happened at three oclock in the afternoon when a sharp conflict ensued and continued for nearly an hour the americans gave way but rallied and pursued the enemy to their ships having several sharp skirmishes with them that evening and the next day till they all left the beach in their boats colonel huntington had also assailed the enemys rear and joined the main body under arnold the conduct of general wooster was recommended in the highest terms colonel huntington wrote the day after the action that till he received his wound he commanded the unconnected and undisciplined troops with great spirit zeal and bravery he died on the  d of may arnold behaved with his usual coolness and intrepidity at ridgefield his horse was killed under him and he saved himself by drawing his pistol and shooting a soldier who after having discharged his musket was rushing upon arnold with his bayonet the next day another horse on which he rode was shot through the neck the enemy embarked on the   th at night having been engaged in the expedition three days of the americans twenty were killed and between seventy and eighty wounded forty of the enemy were known to have been killed and it was presumed the number was considerably larger several prisoners were taken the loss in public stores was severely felt particularly that of sixteen hundred and ninety tents which had been removed from peekskill to danbury for safekeeping and were very much wanted in the army—ms letters of generals arnold and silliman and colonel huntington dated april   th and   th   read in congress april  0th   the same letter was sent as a circular to colonels mcclanahan bowman and febiger commanding virginia regiments   immediately after receiving the intelligence of arnolds brave conduct at danbury congress promoted him to the appointment of majorgeneral although owing to his having been superseded on the   th of february he now ranked below several officers whom he had commanded a few days afterwards congress likewise resolved that the quartermastergeneral be directed to procure a horse and present the same properly caparisoned to majorgeneral arnold in the name of this congress as a token of their approbation of his gallant conduct in the action against the enemy in their late enterprise to danbury in which general arnold had one horse shot under him and another wounded—journals may  0th   read in congress may  th   this will be delivered to you by colonel conway an irish gentleman in service of france who came passenger in the amphitrite and was introduced to me yesterday by a letter from mr deane and one from general heath copies of which are transmitted this gentleman waits on congress to obtain an appointment in the army of the states and from mr deanes recommendation is an officer of merit he says no particular command was agreed on between him and mr deane nor does he wish otherwise than that congress should exercise their own discretion at the same time he observes that it will be mortifying to him to hold a rank under that of messieurs de fermoy and deborre who were inferior officers in their own service and subject to his command he can give the character of several of the officers who were passengers with him i cannot pretend to speak of colonel conways merits or abilities of my own knowledge having had but little opportunity to be acquainted with him from what i can discover he appears to be a man of candor and if he has been in service as long as he says he has i should suppose him infinitely better qualified to serve us than many who have been promoted as he speaks our language he seems extremely anxious to return to camp as the campaign may be expected to become active every day and wishes congress to determine whatever command they may think proper to honor him with as soon as they shall think it expedient—washington to the president of congress   may      in mr deanes letter to congress respecting colonel conway he stated it to be the design of that officer to establish himself in america and become a citizen deane moreover added that colonel conway was well qualified to fill the office of adjutant or brigadiergeneral and that he had promised that congress should grant him one of these ranks he likewise advanced a part of his pay—diplomatic correspondence vol i p    it would

would direct and the circumstances of the army admit if they are less secure than we wish them to be it is owing to our inability and not to inattention i have written to genl mcdougall and will do it again to employ much of his care upon this subject war in theory and the modes of defence are obvious and easy—but in practice they are more difficult unhappily for us the means in our power do not always accord with our wishes or what would be our interest to pursue—washington to the president of congress  0 may        as few vices are attended with more pernicious consequences in civil life so there are none more fatal in a military one than that of gaming which often brings disgrace and ruin upon officers and injury and punishment upon the soldiery and reports prevailing which it is to be feared are too well founded that this destructive vice has spread its baneful influence in the army and in peculiar manner to the prejudice of the recruiting service—the commander in chief in the most pointed and explicit terms forbids all officers and soldiers playing at cards dice or at any games except those of exercise for diversion it being impossible if the practice be allowed at all to discriminate between innocent play for amusement and criminal gaming for pecuniary and sordid purposes officers attentive to their duty will find abundant employment in training and disciplining their men providing for them and seeing that they appear neat clean and soldierlike nor will any thing redound more to their honor—afford them more solid amusement or better answer the end of their appointment than to devote the vacant moments they may have to the study of military authors the commanding officer of every corps is strictly enjoined to have this order frequently read and strongly impressed upon the minds of those under his command any officer or soldier or other person belonging to or following the army either in camp in quarters or the recruiting service or elsewhere presuming under any pretence to disobey this order shall be tried by a general court martial—orderly book   may        general knox was associated with general greene in carrying these instructions into effect they proceeded to the highlands and examined the river and the passes in company with generals mcdougall george clinton and wayne the last of whom had just returned from ticonderoga these five officers wrote a joint report to general washington on the   th of may in which they recommended that the obstruction across the river at fort montgomery should be completed in the following manner namely that a boom or chain should be stretched across in front of which should be one or two cables to break the force of a vessel before it should strike the chain that two continental ships then on the spot and two rowgalleys should be manned and stationed just above the obstruction in such a position as to fire upon the enemys ships in front when they approached this force with the land batteries on the margins of the river the generals believed would be sufficient to defeat any efforts of the enemy to ascend by water they also added we are very confident if the obstructions of the river can be rendered effectual the enemy will not attempt to operate by land the passes through the highlands are so exceedingly difficult this opinion proved nevertheless not to be well founded as fort montgomery was afterwards assaulted and taken by a party which penetrated the defiles of the highlands on the west side of the river the boom was constructed with difficulty to support the weight of the chain it was necessary to place under it large rafts of timber at small distances from each other which together with the chain itself presented such obstructions to the descending current as to raise the water several feet by which its force was increased and the chain broken this was in part remedied by the cables passing on the lower side of the chain—sparks   as soon as general washington heard of arnolds promotion to the rank of majorgeneral he appointed him to the command at peekskill with orders on the  th of may to repair to that post when arnold came to headquarters however general washington granted him permission to proceed to philadelphia according to his request and ordered general putnam to peekskill the present arrangement of the army requiring a majorgeneral in that station the commanderinchief wrote to general mcdougall as some matters are to be settled to the satisfaction of general arnold previous to his accepting the rank lately conferred upon him he is gone to philadelphia i have therefore ordered general putnam to peekskill you are well acquainted with the old gentlemans temper he is active disinterested and open to conviction and i therefore hope that by affording him the advice and assistance which your knowledge of the post enables you to do you will be very happy in your command under him—letter may   th arnold was unsuccessful in applying to congress for the restoration of his rank his enemies in that assembly seem to have been more numerous than his friends though they were compelled by the public voice to

wife    may        monsieur malmedy was a french officer who had served in rhode island and received from that state the commission of brigadiergeneral on the  0th of may congress appointed him a colonel in the continental service which he thought was below his merit and not consistent with his previous rank he made known his disappointment and dissatisfaction in a letter to general washington he had been advanced in rhode island in consequence of the recommendation of general lee i am afraid we shall never be able to find places vacant equal to the expectations of the french gentlemen who are now here much less for those that will follow the high rank conferred upon those who first came over many of whom had no pretensions either from their services or merit has naturally raised the expectations of those who come properly recommended to such a pitch that i know not what will satisfy them indeed it is not to be imagined that a gentleman and an old soldier can submit to be commanded by a person in this country who he remembers to have been his inferior in france i know not how we can remedy this evil or put a stop to the growth of it but by being very circumspect for the future on whom we confer rank above that of a subaltern—washington to the president of congress   may        i received your letter by monsieur malmedy i am sorry that some of the gentlemen promoted by congress render themselves unhappy either by forming in their minds the most groundless suspicions of neglect or torturing themselves by an unwarrantable degree of jealousy at the promotion of others it has always been my wish and design that you should be provided for as soon as you acquired a competent knowledge of our language to make you fit for command and as circumstances would admit when you were here last i told you that i should try to place you in some corps as you seemed uneasy at your situation and expressed a desire of being immediately in service this was all i meant or promised nor could you infer more from what i said there is now a vacant majority in colonel hazens regiment at princeton under the command of lieutenantcolonel antill which you may have immediately by repairing thither and which you will do should this appointment not be equal to your views i have no other in my power and i would further observe that if you will take a calm and dispassionate view of things you cannot expect more upon any principle of reason or justice i might add without any disparagement to your merit that there are many good officers in the service who have been in it from the commencement of the war that have not received such honorable marks of favor and distinction if there are foreigners who came to america when you did or since who have been promoted to higher rank without having better pretensions it has not been through my interest though i wish to see every man rewarded according to his deserts and esteem emulation in officers a laudable quality yet i cannot but condemn the over sanguine unjust ambitious expectations of those who think every thing should be made to yield to gratify their views—washington to major colerus    may        monsieur armand marquis de la rouerie was a french officer who had been ten years in service and received the rank of colonel from congress on the  0th of may at his own request he was commissioned to raise a partisan corps of frenchmen not exceeding two hundred men it was thought that some advantage would result from such a corps by bringing together into a body such soldiers as did not understand the english language colonel armand was a zealous and spirited officer during the whole revolution and continued on terms of friendly correspondence with washington for several years after the war ended—sparks   read in congress may   th   this expedient was by drafting a certain proportion of the militia for the purpose of filling up the continental battalions the same plan was adopted by massachusetts and new hampshire the drafts were to be considered in all respects as continental soldiers but were to serve only till the first of january and in the meantime enlistments for completing the several battalions according to the plan of congress were to be prosecuted   general parsons had suggested that an enterprise against long island might be effected from connecticut and asked the opinion of general washington respecting the propriety of attempting to rescue the american prisoners who were at flatbush and in the vicinity of that place spies had lately returned who had made known where the prisoners were stationed and in what manner the british troops were distributed in different parts of the island   from the collection of mr winslow warren of boston   no pleasure could exceed what i should feel if it was in my power to protect every town and every individual on this wideextended continent this however is a pleasure that never can be realized and as our dispersed situation is neither formidable for defence nor offence it becomes me to place the continental troops in such a manner as to answer a more valuable purpose than to give the shadow for it is no more of security to particular neighborhoods your apprehension of the enemy taking possession of newark and elizabethtown with a view of holding them does not strike me at all if any such ideas possessed them the few men we have there would rather be an inducement they already have experienced the evil of multiplied posts as we shall do if they should be seized with a spirit of enterprise such guards as we have from boundbrook to newark inclusively could give no effectual opposition to the enemy if they were disposed to move and the country is too much drained by both armies to afford much support the other consideration of opening the intercourse or rather making it more open with new york has weight but is overbalanced by others of a more powerful nature in a word if a man cannot act in all respects as he could wish he must do what appears best under the circumstances he is in this i aim at however short i may fall of the end—washington to majorgeneral stephen    may        i need not suggest to congress the necessity of keeping our numbers concealed from the knowledge of the public nothing but a good face  false appearances have enabled us hitherto to deceive the enemy respecting our strength—washington to the president of congress    may        if congress have it not in contemplation to appoint a general of horse but leave it to me to assign one of the brigadiers already appointed to that command i shall assuredly place general reed there as it is agreeable to my own recommendation and original design of this please in my name inform him but add as it would not be agreeable to me and i am sure could not be so to him to be placed in a situation that might be the standing of a day only i could wish to know what the views of congress are on this head which mr thomson or any of the members i suppose could inform i would have written to general reed myself on this subject and other matters but my extreme hurry will not permit me to do it and therefore i decline it altogether be so obliging as to offer my best regards to him and assure him that i read his name in the appointment of brigadiers with great pleasure—washington to moylan    may        in a

sloops and crossed the sound to southhold where he arrived at six oclock the enemys troops on this part of the island had marched for new york two days before but it was reported that there was a party at sag harbor on the south branch of the island and about fifteen miles distant colonel meigs ordered the whaleboats to be transported over land to the bay between the north and south branches of the island where one hundred and thirty men embarked and at twelve oclock at night they arrived safely on the other side of the bay within four miles of sag harbor here the boats were secured in a wood under a guard and the remainder of the detachment marched quickly to the harbor where they arrived at two oclock in the greatest order attacking the outposts with fixed bayonets and proceeding directly to the shipping at the wharf the alarm was given and an armed schooner with twelve guns and seventy men began to fire upon them at the distance of one hundred and fifty yards which continued for three quarters of an hour but it did not prevent the troops from executing their design with the greatest intrepidity and effect twelve brigs and sloops one of which was an armed vessel with twelve guns one hundred and twenty tons of hay corn oats ten hogsheads of rum and a large quantity of merchandise were entirely destroyed six of the enemy were killed and ninety taken prisoners not

service who offered his aid to mr deane in enabling him to procure military supplies proposing himself to join the american army on certain conditions it was known that the french government approved these advances on the part of monsieur ducoudray and his proposals were accepted by mr deane according to the arrangement ducoudray was to proceed to america in a vessel freighted with firearms cannon and other military supplies and mr deane agreed that he should have the command of the artillery and the rank of majorgeneral with the pay of that rank before he left france however mr deane became dissatisfied with his conduct and wrote on the subject to congress—see diplomatic correspondence of the american revolution vol i pp     0  when ducoudray arrived in philadelphia and presented his agreement with deane and other papers to congress they were referred to the committee on foreign applications it appeared that he had so constructed his plan that he was to command the engineers as well as the artillery the affair was suspended and in its progress occasioned a good deal of uneasiness and difficulty among both the foreign and the native officers—sparks   a month later a report reached the camp that congress had appointed ducoudray a majorgeneral in the american army and that he was to take command of the artillery without waiting to have this rumor confirmed from any official source generals greene sullivan and knox wrote each to congress a laconic epistle dated on the same day and requested that should the fact be so they might have permission to retire from the army the following is a copy of general greenes letter to the president of congress george washington   july      middlebrook camp at middlebrook   july      sir a report is circulating here at camp that monsieur ducoudray a french gentleman is appointed a majorgeneral in the service of the united states his rank to commence from the  st of last august if the report be true it will lay me under the necessity of resigning my commission as his appointment supersedes me in command i beg you will acquaint me with respect to the truth of the report and if true enclose me a permit to retire i am with great respect your most obedient humble servant n greene the letters of general sullivan and general knox were of the same purport and clothed in nearly the same language after taking the subject into consideration congress on the report from john adams resolved that the president transmit to general washington copies of the several letters from generals sullivan greene and knox to congress dated july  st      with directions to him to let these officers know that congress consider the said letters as an attempt to influence their decisions an invasion of the liberties of the people and as indicating a want of confidence in the justice of congress that it is expected by congress the said officers will make proper acknowledgments for an interference of so dangerous a tendency but if any of those officers are unwilling to serve their country under the authority of congress they shall be at liberty to resign their commissions and retire—journals july  th the report was unfounded congress having made no such appointment nor when the letters were written had the case of ducoudray been brought in a formal manner before them it was called up however about the same time and after three or four days debate congress determined not to ratify the treaty entered into between mr deane and monsieur ducoudray the commissioners in france had been instructed by congress to procure a few good engineers for the american service they engaged four officers of this description who held commissions in the french army namely duportail laumoy radière and gouvion—see diplomatic correspondence vol i p     these officers came to the united states with the knowledge and approbation of the french government and were the only ones engaged by the express authority of congress the contract made between them and the commissioners franklin and deane was confirmed and duportail was appointed colonel of engineers laumoy and radière lieutenantcolonels and gouvion major they proved to be valuable officers and their services in the engineer department were of essential importance during the war—journals july  th october  d i have no wish to see such a large proportion of important offices in the military department in the hands of foreigners i cannot help considering them as so many spies in our camp ready to take their measures as their interest may direct if foreigners are introduced their command should not be very extensive then the injury cannot be great but even in this case it is an injury to america for the multiplying foreign officers gives us no internal strength a good nursery of officers nursed by experience firmly attached to the interest of the country is a great security against foreign invaders the only tie that we have upon foreigners is the sentiment of honor too slender for the happiness of a country to depend upon—while officers created from among the people are bound not only by the ties of honor but by that of interest and family connection we in many instances see the power of british gold let us not neglect to guard against its influence i have no narrow prejudices upon this subject neither have i any private differences with any of those gentlemen my opinion is founded upon the general conduct of mankind—general greene    may      i must again repeat the impropriety of creating so many foreign officers a very considerable part of our force will get into their hands what method can great britain take to defeat us more effectually than to introduce a great number of foreigners into the army and bind them to their interest by some very interesting considerations that this is practicable nobody will doubt that we ought to guard against it everybody must allow british gold may reason forcibly with those whose hopes and future expectations are not connected with the people they betray—greene to john adams    may      congress in the beginning went upon a very injudicious plan with respect to frenchmen to every adventurer that came without even the shadow of credentials they gave the rank of field officers this circumstance seconding the aspiring disposition natural to those people carried the expectations of those who had really any pretensions to the character of officers to a length that exceeds all the bounds of moderation as it was impossible to pursue this impolitic plan the congress have begun to retrench their excessive liberality and the consequence has been universal disgust and discontent it would perhaps be injurious as the french are much addicted to national punctilio to run into the opposite extreme to that first embraced and by that mean create a general clamor and dissatisfaction policy suggests the propriety of discriminating a few of the most deserving and endeavoring to keep them in temper even by gratifying them beyond what they can reasonably pretend to this will enable us to shake off the despicable part with safety and to turn a deaf ear to the exorbitant demands of the many it will easily be believed in france that their want of merit occasioned their want of success from the extraordinary marks of favor that have been conferred on others whereas the united voice of complaint from the whole might make ill impressions in their own country which it is not our interest should exist we are already greatly embarrassed with the frenchmen among us and from the genius of the people shall continue to be so it were to be wished that our agents in france instead of courting them to come out were instructed to give no encouragement but where they could not help it that is where applications were made to them by persons countenanced and supported by great men whom it would be impolitic to disoblige be assured sir we shall never be able to satisfy them and they can be of no use to us at least for some time their ignorance of our language of the disposition of the people the resources and deficiencies of the country their own habits and tempers all these are

therefore afraid of falling a second time into the enemys hands—this i would willingly disbelieve—as i cannot be of opinion that any officer would suffer men to act or speak in that manner—as they must be sensible that men were not enlisted merely to make use of the public money and provision and when called to real service pretend to give any excuse for not complying with orders—i should

command at ticonderoga and to request general sullivan to remove a false bottom in the canteen under which he would find a letter the canteen had been accidentally left by amsbury at fort george but it was sent for and brought to general schuyler who found the letter concealed in the manner described and written amsbury said by one michael shannon he enclosed it to general washington by whom it was forwarded to general sullivan the letter was a shallow contrivance to try the fidelity and patriotism of an american general   general howe has suddenly quitted his new post between somerest and brunswick and has returned to his old situation the whole design of his making his late movement this way may possibly have been to induce us to draw off our troops from peekskill though i think it most probable that he was disappointed in his expectations of the manner in which we should act and that finding the people turned out with great spirit to strengthen our opposition he concluded it most prudent to relinquish his intentions and resume his former position but lest the first supposition should be true i have ordered generals mcdougal and glover not to proceed if they are at a

appoint all the officers in the regiments to be raised in their respective states and whereas some states proceeded to the appointment of their officers at an earlier day than others by which means many of those who were junior officers before the said    september would take rank of senior ones altho they should both be promoted to the same rank in the new army to prevent which and that no controversies may hereafter arise on the subject of rank it is resolved   that every officer in the army of the united states under the rank of a brigadier general who has been promoted or appointed by congress by the commander in chief or by the legislative or executive authority of any of the states having authority so to do by virtue of the above mentioned or any resolution of congress since the said   th day of september and who are not yet commissioned shall have their commissions dated as on the   th september      and such who are already commissioned the commander in chief or commander in any department shall alter to that date the date of said commissions respecting only the rank of the officers their pay shall commence from the respective times of their appointments   that all persons who were officers before the said   th day of september and continue so to be shall have their rank in the army determined from the dates of their commissions previous to that day and if the commissions of any two or more were of equal date the rank of such with respect to each other shall be determined by their future rank in the army of the united states and where that has always been equal then by ballot to be taken in such manner as the commander in chief shall direct   that all persons having heretofore served as officers in the army of the united states and promoted on or since the    september      shall have their rank with respect to each other determined from their former rank and date of former commissions and if two or more were of equal rank before such promotion and all of whose former commissions bore the same date their rank with respect to each other shall be determined by ballot to be taken in such manner as the commander in chief shall direct   that all persons who have not heretofore been officers in the army of the united states and who have on or since the   th september last been made so shall have their rank with respect to each other determined by ballot to be taken in such manner as the commander in chief shall direct   that the commander in chief and commander of each department respectively shall order return to be made to them

days ago with a seeming intention to make a general attack upon us but after marching seven or eight miles parallel with the sound he returned again into amboy contenting himself with burning many houses and plundering all that fell in his way the day before yesterday he threw the whole of his army over to staten island and totally evacuated the state of new jersey before the accounts from the northward we were much at a loss to account for these strange manœuvers but it now looks very like a plan to amuse us till accounts could be recd by them of the movements of burgoyne if a coöperation is intended general howe must speedily throw off the mask and make his preparations for going up the north river if he does not i shall think that the fleet and a small force of indians and light troops are amusing you upon the lake while the main body comes round and forms a junction by water one reason operates strongly against this in my opinion and that is that a man of general burgoynes spirit and enterprise would never have returned from england merely to execute a plan from which no great credit or honor was to be derived i shall therefore till i see the contrary believe that he will make a strenuous effort to break through by the way of ticonderoga i shall hold this army in readiness to move and have desired general clinton to call in the militia of orange and ulster and general putnam that of connecticut which is most contiguous if we can keep general howe below the highlands i think their schemes will be entirely baffled—washington to majorgeneral schuyler   july

to prevent the carriage of intelligence something that his lordship could not do having nothing to communicate   i should be sorry to injure his lordship or any other gentleman in so delicate a point but i do not think justice requires me either to retract or extenuate what i have said he may perhaps have acted as he did through misconception but whatever was the cause the conclusion i drew was fully authorized by appearances—note by washington   i make no doubt but before this you will have heard that the enemy have evacuated jersey this information i should have done myself the pleasure of transmitting to you by the first opportunity after the event had not my attention been employed in making a new disposition of the army and had i apprehended it materially interesting that it should have come immediately from myself when general howe withdrew his forces from this state and went to staten island from the intelligence received at that time from general st clair at ticonderoga that the canada army were on the lake and approaching that post and from every other circumstance it appeared extremely probable nay almost certain to me and to all the general and other officers possessed of the facts that general howes first and immediate movement would be up the north river and that the two armies meant to coöperate and favor each others attack this i say was my opinion and that of my officers at that time from a full consideration of the intelligence we then had but i confess however satisfied i was then upon this subject i am now in extreme doubt respecting his intended operations having heard nothing from ticonderoga since the   th ultimo nor any further accounts of the enemys approach we are left to conjecture whether their appearance on the lake was with a view to a real and serious attack or whether to amuse and draw our attention that way while a stroke is meditating against some other place this uncertainty is rendered considerably greater by the concurrent accounts of deserters who have escaped from new york and staten island in the course of a few days past from their information and a variety of circumstances—such as that berths are fitting up for the lighthorse on board the transports provender taken in and providing for three or four weeks the embarkation of the officers baggage with their names and corps endorsed thereon and the ships watering—it would seem more probable that general howe has in contemplation some other object than the north river whether he has or what it is however is unknown to us i have thought it my duty nevertheless to give you this information that if he should once more turn his arms against the eastern states you may not be taken by surprise but that matters may be put in the best train to receive him which circumstances will admit on my part no exertions in my power shall be wanting to counteract his plans wheresoever they may be directed and to render every service compatible with our general line of defence and the interest of the states at large—washington to the governors of the eastern states   july        the letter and enclosures conveyed the news of the evacuation of ticonderoga on june  0th a council of officers at ticonderoga decided that that place should be abandoned and the full continental force take post at mount independence where a scantiness of provisions exposed them to the dangers of an easy reduction by siege on july  th a second council was held and a determination reached to retreat as soon as possible the march began early on sunday morning the intention being to come by way of skenesborough but finding the enemy in possession of that place st clair turned away to bennington intending to go from thence to the north river and prevent if possible burgoyne from penetrating into the country—the st clair papers i  0    read in congress july   th greene thought he might receive orders to go to the north—greene life of greene i     congress directed that so much of this letter as related to arnold be sent to him and that he be directed to repair immediately to headquarters and follow the orders of general washington—journals    july      this event the evacuation of our posts on the lake among the most unfortunate that could have befallen us is rendered more interesting by the manner in which it took place i have no further information upon the subject than what the copy contains and shall be happy to hear by my next advices that the main body of the army of whose situation general schuyler knew nothing with certainty have not become prisoners for i fear from the disposition they discovered on this distressing occasion they will have surrendered to the enemy in case they fell in with them though inferior in number    i should be extremly happy if our situation would allow me to afford him a large reinforcement of men but i cannot with any degree of propriety in the opinion of my general officers send more to his aid at this time than a number of recruits on their march from massachusetts belonging to some of the regiments under his command who amount to six hundred at least and are now i suspect pretty well advanced towards peekskill with this augmentation of what he already has supposing general st clair and his force to have come in and any number of militia to have turned out he will have an army equal if not superior to general burgoynes from the only accounts we have obtained besides this consideration it is most probable that general burgoyne will suspend his operations till general howe makes a movement and an effort on his part his designs i think are most unquestionably against the highlands and that he will attempt the execution as soon as possible we have been prevented marching today by the rain but as soon as the weather permits we shall proceed as expeditiously as we can towards the north river and cross or not as shall appear necessary from circumstances p s half after   p m i this minute received a letter of the  th from genl schuyler a copy of which  of the proclamation alluded to you have inclosed—i fear more and more that genl st clair and his army are prisoners—washington to the president of congress    july        the original draft of this letter contained the following paragraph afterwards struck out for the most part all that is to be done in that case is to lay the piece horizontally and discharge her as briskly as possible and that piece which is the most manageable and capable of being fired the oftenest—has the largest calibre and will contain the greatest number of grape shot will always do most execution upon a body of men out of the reach of grape shot it is hardly worth consuming your ammunition upon a column of men for after laboring hours in vain you will find you have done them very little injury—and certainly no material benefit can arise in having pieces that will go a few yards nearer their object than others i should never wish to have any piece discharged at a body who were at such a distance as to be out of the reach of the pieces we commonly make use of   this letter was dated at fort edward and contained the following particulars i have not been able to learn what is become of general st clair and the army the enemy followed the troops that came to skenesborough as far as fort anne where they were yesterday repulsed notwithstanding which colonel long contrary to my express orders evacuated that post i am here at the head of a handful of men not above fifteen hundred without provision with little ammunition not above five rounds to a man having neither balls nor lead to make any the country in the deepest consternation no carriages to remove the stores from fort george which i expect every moment to learn is attacked and what adds to my distress is that a report prevails that i had given orders for the evacuation of ticonderoga whereas not the most distant hint of such an intention can be drawn from any of my letters to general st clair or any other person whatever   st clairs letters to schuyler the one dated the day before he left ticonderoga and the other on the march had miscarried   st clairs force consisted of two thousand and eighty nine effectives rank and file including one hundred and twenty four artificers unarmed besides the corps of artillery and about nine hundred militia who had joined him to stay only a few days many of these were mere boys altogether incapable of sustaining the fatigues of a soldier naked and illarmed not above one bayonet to every tenth man—st clair to governor bowdoin   july      he did not join schuyler until the   th   to this paragraph general schuyler replied the fort was part of an unfinished bastion of an intended fortification the bastion was closed at the gorge in it was a barrack capable of containing between thirty and fifty men without ditch without wall without cistern without any picket to prevent an enemy from running over the wall so small as not to contain above one hundred and fifty men commanded by a ground greatly overlooking it and within pointblank shot and so situated that five hundred men may lie between the bastion and the lake without being seen from this extremely defensible fortress of the vessels built there one was afloat and tolerably fitted the other still upon the stocks but if the two had been upon the water they would have been of little use without rigging or guns—ms letter july   th   lieutenantcolonel barton of the rhode island militia had received

available for the campaign my communications will widen so much as i proceed the drain upon the army for posts will be so considerable not to speak of detachments and safeguards to protect and to awe the country that if that first diminution is not replaced my effective strength may become inadequate to the service intended    july      carleton being confined to canada by positive instructions declined to accede to this request though admitting its force and burgoyne while deploring from a military view this strict construction of orders confessed that carleton was justified in his decision

garrison the forts and all the rest of the fieldartillery is to come on with the forementioned divisions colo cranes battalion is to accompany them and colo lambs to supply their place lord stirlings

have the full effect in carrying our plan into execution success attend you w howe the young man who brought out the letter from new york voluntarily sought the american guard and gave it up he had been a prisoner in the city and said he was offered a high reward for carrying this letter to general burgoyne that he at first declined taking charge of it but at last he acceded to the proposal with the intention to recover his liberty and then take the letter to the american camp whether this was a true account of the matter or not must rest on the testimony of the young man there can be no question however that the letter reached the destination for which it was intended by general howe   i imagine you must by this time have a considerable parcel of hard bread baked i am moving towards philadelphia with the army and should be glad to have it sent forward you will therefore immediately upon the receipt of this send all that is ready down to coryells ferry except about two thousand weight which is to be sent to the place called the white house and there wait for the division of the army which is with me i expect to be in that neighborhood the night after tomorrow if the weather

from lord stirling of the   d inst i find he intends to pursue his rout from kakigate thro pyramus to the great falls—thence to walsessing  thro springfield to brunswick or bound brook the reason of my being thus particular in describing lord stirlings rout is because i wish you to take every possible pains in your power by sending trusty persons to staten island to obtain intelligence of the enemys situation and numbers—what kind of troops they are and how many  what guards they have their strength  where posted my view in this is that his lordship when he arrives may make an attempt upon the enemy there with his division if it should appear from a full consideration of all circumstances and the information you obtain that it can be done with a strong prospect of success—washington to col dayton    july      it is out of my power to displace genl fermoy or to get rid of him in any way his appointment was by congress who assigned him to the northern army you must endeavor to place some person about him who is master of the french  english languages and by that means he will be better enabled to receive and give orders to his brigade but if you and the other general officers find him incapable of executing his office rather than the service should suffer he must be plainly told of his inability and advised to give up the command at least till he has made himself sufficient master of our language to convey his orders to the officers of his brigade—washington to general schuyler    july      on the   th washington learned that seventy sail of the enemy were

chester to philadelphia and on the jersey side where there is a likelihood of the enemys operating and procuring good trusty guides well acquainted with all those roads and paths i wish you also to obtain drafts as exact as possible of the country that i may the more readily have a good insight into its situation and circumstances from the idea i at this time have of it i should imagine the main body of our army ought to be incamped on the westside of schuylkel for the benefit of good water good ground and because it has a free and open communication i would not by any means have the troops enter philadelphia not only on account of its being pent up between two rivers but as it would serve to debauch them and introduce diseases and would be detrimental to the city and disagreeable to the
