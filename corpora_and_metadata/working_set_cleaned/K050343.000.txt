the secret history of the secret history of the white staff purse and mitre  written by a person of honor  london printed and sold by s keimer at the printingpress in paternoster row      price six pence  the history of the secret history of the white staff etc as nothing is more irksom to a sensible man than to have his judgment imposed upon so nothing can be a greater obligation to him than to be undeceived the case now before us is national it is not a single person that is deceived here but the whole body of the people are banterd and made fools of and what better work can a man set his hand to for the public service than to detect these frauds and undeceive the world  there have not been two little pamphlets published for a long time past which have made more foolish noise in the world than the first and second part of the secret history of the white staff and it is the more wonderful because as shall soon be made appear there has been no substance or foundation in the matters of fact for them or for any of the several pamphlets which have followed them but that the world has been very much amused and imposed upon both in the one and the other and the whole has been a mere delusion an ignis fatuus prepared either on purpose to get a penny by the books or to deceive the people or both this being premised it seems necessary the world should know something of the history of these two secret histories because by having this matter searched a little into there will be brought to light some things very profitable to us in their being known though most absurd in themselves things equally wonderful in the effect which they have had among the people and equally strange in the knavery of the contrivers  that we may arrive to a clear notion of what is needful to be understood concerning those books the matter must be first laid down in general briefly that the book called the secret history of the white staff seems to be published in order to justify the conduct and clear up the reputation of a late great minister of state known throughout the book by the title of the staff or as some of the answerers say to raise a dust that he may be lost in the cloud  in doing this they run through many of the most considerable transactions of state during the ministry of that great man from his first appearing in a public employment or office in her majestys household to the death of the queen and as some pretend to say artfully labors to make the staff appear really a white staff washing him clear from the dirt cast upon him by the parties who have opposed him and who it may be likely have as artfully endeavored to blacken and deface him clearing up sundry actions from the supposed guilt with which they are charged and laying the blame on such as are really blameworthy upon other heads  how well they have performed is not the present enquiry it is easy for writers this way or that way to form a specious tale to clear up the characters which they would render bright or to blacken those who they would misrepresent but what weight is to be put upon such assurances we shall see when the secret history of these books is a little farther laid down  in the mean time it is provoking to the last degree to see what success these men have had in the trick they have put upon the town and how universally all sorts of men have run into the cheat and been bubbled to accept these romances for a true narration and have taken the fable for a history without enquiring into the things whether they were imposed upon yea or no  the few friends of the staff on one hand albeit they were not the first who were deceived yet were very soon drawn into the snare taking the book to be done by a friend or perhaps by himself in order to vindicate him to the world by setting his actions in a true light and casting the blame of sundry things which common fame laid at his door upon the conduct of diverse other persons perhaps the nearness of some passages which they found in these books to what they knew something of in the conduct of the staff or their willingness to have it be as it was there represented and their passion to have others think as favorably of the staff as they did themselves might concur to deceive them forasmuch as diverse things taken notice of in those books might have some connection with other passages which were really true so that it would be easy for men to be led aside at their first view of things also the part these men took with the staff in his resentment of the conduct of those who had dispossessed and supplanted him at court bore no small share in their credulity being very willing that all imaginable indignities should be offered to those who had been so successful in their opposition to the staff as to cast him out of his seat and to dispossess him of the favor of his prince and to see them exposed to all the world who had exposed him in such a manner which as they said was not to be forgiven  the enemies of the staff on the other hand seemed to be moved so much at the attempt made to clear up his character in things which they seem to have unanswerably laid to his charge as that they could not let slip so fair an opportunity which seemed to them to offer itself in this book to load him with farther infamy and though at the first view they found themselves capable to detect the falsity and sophistry of the books themselves as it is expressed in some of their answers yet they could not avoid the snare of taking the books for genuine and for a design of the staff to start something into the world in his own vindication  the writers of the books sitting still all this while had their leisure to laugh at mankind and to please themselves with thinking how either side fell into their snare and bought up many thousands of the books which as shall presently be shown was the summa totalis of the design and to see with what eagerness the party writers on every side carried on the paper war which they had raised and which confirms the truth of what is here asserted beyond all contradiction it shall appear that the same people employing other hands have been the editors not only of the books themselves but also of several of the answers to these books causing the deceived people to dance in the circles of their drawing while these have enjoyed the sport of their own witchcraft and like the hangerson of the camp have taken the spoil of the field of battle as well of the victors as of the vanquished  it was but a few days past when coming casually into a public coffeehouse and finding the whole discourse as for some time it was carried on by opposite parties upon the subject of these books i joined my self to the company where it was warmly inquired into who should be the author or authors of these books i found one man who appeared as a quaker and spoke as a quaker although as i afterward understood he was not a thorough quaker maintaining a point which differed from all that had spoken about it and which put me upon further enquiring into the matter than i had done before   verily says the quaker i think that ye err much about this matter and i plainly perceive that ye do not judge rightly of the persons concerning whom ye are discoursing why said his neighbor who was his opposer do not thou think that the earl of oxford has written this book  quaker nay i do not believe it  neigh you quakers are so full of double meanings no man can talk with you do you not believe that he has done it or caused it to be done that he has employed others to do it for him  quak if thou can not talk with me then should thou hold thy peace i am a friend to the truth and a lover of those that speak uprightly neither have i any double meaning in my speech  neigh answer me directly dont you believe that he has done it i say or caused it to be done for him  quak i do not  neigh dont you believe that he has furnished materials for this book to daniel de foe or some such other scribler as for money he might get to do such a piece o drudgery for him  quak i know not lord oxford neither do i know daniel de foe but this may serve thee for an answer to thy question that i do not believe either lord oxford or any one for him had any concern in writing or composing those books  neigh pray let us hear your reason for it  quak nay now thou askst of me a question which i am not under any obligation to comply with thee in  neigh that is true but saying you do not believe a thing without telling any reason for it is the strongest argument you could bring to make us believe the contrary  quak i will give thee some of my reasons but i will assure thee also they are not the chief reasons which i might give which perchance it may not be convenient to mention at this time  neigh let us then have such reasons as you please to give  quak one reason is that if it had been done by lord oxford as thou say it was and that it was for his own vindication he would not have written that which is so unfit to perform what it is supposed to do and that he would have vindicated himself in a better manner or not have meddled with it in public  neigh that is no reason his cause is so bad it admits no vindication  quak nay then my reason is good in that i said he would therefore have let it alone but seeing thou do not approve of my reasons i have no need to trouble thee with more of them and here the quaker seemed to make some motion to rise and go away  neigh that is just what i said before that you have no reason at all  quak thou think to move me by thy words to enter into disputations with thee of these things but i shall not comply with thy desire let it therefore suffice thee that i know what i have said to be truth the which is more than saying i believe it and herewith the quaker rose up and departed  the quakers last words stirred up my curiosity and i immediately followed him and asked him if he would give me an opportunity to have a little friendly discourse with him that i had seen how rudely they had treated him in the coffeehouse but that i should let him see i had more respect  he yielded and we went to a public house where being sat down i told him that had i read over the books called the secret history of the staff etc and that i had frequent thoughts about them that i observed a great many things which in my opinion look like romances that i often thought the whole was a continued fiction that some things were put in which if they were true no body could know but those whose interest it was not to make them public that other things were mentioned which were not probable sundry speeches framed which i believed were never spoken and that i had long wished that i might one time or other come to some discovery of the truth of the case and that hearing him though a stranger to me jump so exactly with my opinion and that he seemed to have more knowledge of particular circumstances than i had i was very earnest to discourse with him about it and that i might not hinder his being as free with me as he would be with any friend of his acquaintance i told him my name place of abode etc and named some eminent quakers to him whom i supposed he might know and who i knew would answer for my sincerity  he heeded me very attentively and when i had ended he answered thus or to this purpose friend thou seem to me to be a grave person and one who art soberly searching after the knowledge of the truth and i think it is meet that i should inform thee of what i know concerning this matter for albeit i was not free to answer to a forward man whom i perceived to speak perversely to me without cause yet i shall not refrain from thee in any thing wherein i may assist thy understanding of the truth i have been curious in making enquiry concerning the books whereof thou speak and i may assure thee that they are no other than fables being composed by evil persons for lucre and gain and that the persons whereof those men made mention have had no knowledge thereof nor were concerned in employing or directing the writers thereof and this thou may be confirmed in the knowledge of if thou will as i have done make diligent enquiry among those who are more especially employed in business of this nature    i was surpised with this account as i might well be although it was nothing but what i always believed yet it made me still more curious to enquire of him in what manner he came to the knowledge of this thing so as to be satisfactory and that while we believed the world was imposed upon by the books we might not suffer our selves to be imposed upon in our enquiry after them for said i in a thing of this nature i would not take up with slight evidence he told me he had been very particular in his enquiry and first that he had obtained of a friend to speak of it to the lord oxford himself and that the said lord expressing himself with the utmost indignation at the books themselves assured the person who mentioned it to him that he had no knowledge of them till he saw them in print that he always was of opinion that printed vindications were useless things and injurious to the persons they would pretend to serve that he knew nothing he had done that needed any vindication but if it were otherwise he desired he might be left to vindicate himself as he found occasion that many if not most of the facts in these books were false and that those which had truth in them were mingled with such abundance of romance as that they did not so much as appear to be dressed up like the truth that he disliked every thing in those books and also the manner in which it was there placed and that no one could oblige him more than by letting the world know that he disowned what was there reflecting upon others and despised what pretended to be in behalf of himself  besides this account which was very satisfying he told me that he had been curious to get information among the writers of pamphlets to find out if he could either who had a hand in it or who they supposed to have so that he had found one friend who was acquainted with that person who common fame had taxed with it in public and that he had obtained from his said friend to go to that person it seems he found the poor man in a very dangerous condition having had a fit of an apoplexy and being very weak insomuch that his life was despaired of but mentioning the said books to him and that the town charged him with being the author of them and that he had written them by direction of the said lord oxford the said person answered that they did him a great deal of wrong neither did he believe that the lord oxford was any way concerned directly or indirectly in the said books and that he believed his lordship had never heard of them till they were published it was true he said that he happened to see some of the copy while it was at the press and that being desired to look upon it he did revise two or three sheets of it and marked some things in them which he disliked but for the rest he could safely swear he never saw them or knew what was in them till after they were printed nor did he know whether the things which he had marked as above said were altered in the print yea or no  the person who went to him then asked him if he did not believe that they were written at the desire and by the directions of people who traded in such books and who did it merely to get money by them without any other design this way or that way respecting the parties or divisions of the people and he answered he did verily believe it was so  my friend told me he could not question the truth of what a man as it were stepping into the grave had so freely declared and that he thought men could not answer charging things publicly upon others without any proof of them saving what was suggested to them by the surmises of their own evil thoughts or of other evil persons and he did not know how men could answer wronging others in such a manner  but that which farther than all this confirmed this quaker as he said in his beleiving that it was not either of the persons abovementioned who had written these books was a farther information which he told me he had met with from two several persons who as he said were of the tribe of writers who are by the world called hackneys as before who gave him some account how these books were managed and by whom  there are it seems said he several clubs or setts of these men who are kept in constant employment by the booksellers or publishers of pamphlets to write on such and such subjects as the said booksellers shall direct and these said booksellers or publishers join together their stocks when such books are written to pay as well the charge of writing as of printing the same and then unite their interest in their way of trade for the more effectual vending the said books and i am assured said he farther that these persons do not consult the side or party on which or in whose behalf the said books may be supposed to plead but the great thing which they regard is that the said books may sell and if they find it sells so as to answer their design they go on perhaps to employ the same persons to write an answer or answers thereto and that he was satisfied by his friend that these books of the white staff were written by some of these men called hackneys as aforesaid and by the order of and for the wages given by some of the said booksellers publishers etc and that no other persons or designs were to be found concerned therein  i told him this was a very infamous practice if it was true but desired to know if he had good grounds to believe the same he told me he thought he had sufficient ground to believe that there were such people and that there were such setts of men who employed these writers and of this he had such evidence that as he said he was able to name several men who were so employed and also those who did employ them he likewise told me he was assured of their doing this upon the single view of gaining by the vending or selling their books without any other design not being concerned what cause or what principle these men writ for or upon seeing as he was informed it was their frequent practice to employ one man or set of men to write a book upon this or that subject and if that book succeeded that is to say if it sold well then to employ others or perhaps the same hands to write answers to the same book and to confirm this he told me he could assure me that the book entitled the purse and the mitre which was written in opposition to the former book the staff were written by the order and at the expense of the very same men who had before caused the said secret history of the white staff to be written that the writer or hackney who was thus employed was one pittis of whom more shall be spoken afterward  and that albeit they were published by a different hand the principals were the very same and they were published and sold on the account of the same set of booksellers and this he said he was able to give sufficient testimony to the truth of if there were any occasion  i was more surpised with this last part of his account than i was with the other and could not conceal the astonishment i was in thereat which made him take the liberty to tell me that he admired to see those things seem strange to me for that he said this had been the constant practice of these people for some years and that most of the libels which had been published for some years past had been written in this manner and that the great mistake which he observed to be in it was not that such men were suffered to write for that he did not see how any laws could be made to restrain them but that which was to be wondered at was the folly of the people who suffered themselves to be amused with every jack with a lanthorn and who by laying such stress upon what they read in every pamphlet gave a weight to them when they had not any in themselves and fancying that this or that great person had set his head or hand to work to write these things they made them thereby effectual to do that evil which they were originally not designed to do and which if they were let alone they would not be able to do  i joined with him in his opinion of all these things and farther it caused diverse reflections in my thoughts upon the folly and absurdity of those who have pretended to write weighty and solid answers to these books entitled the history of the staff etc how some call it the work of the late lord treasurer and take the liberty from thence to answer that book as his lordship performance casting the follies and ignorance the malice and ill manners of a few three halfpenny scriblers in the face of his lordship as his own if there are false grammars they are called his ignorance and want of learning false facts they are called his lies shuffling and quibling with the arguments which were necessary because they knew little of what they were speaking is called his sophistry not only abusing the person on whom these things are cast but likewise abusing very notoriously the readers by making them believe that these things are of moment which are the conceptions of silly mercenaries drawn from what they picked up in fragments here and there from the coffeehouse chat and learned alebench discourse of this city and then framed together in a book to deceive the credulous heads and inquisitive tempers of the people and pick their purses of a little money  but that no man may question the truth of what is here affirmed the written of these sheets avers and is able on occasion to make oath that the said mr pittis owned and acknowledged to him the said writer of these sheets that he was the author of the said book called the mitre and purse and showed me part of the copy in manuscript before the same was printed neither is this all but the writer of these sheets avers that he can prove who employed the said mr pittis and what hire or price he received for the work  this is mentioned with the more plainness because of a like case which has just now happened and is made public by pittis himself and is as follows mr pittis has been taken up for writing a pamphlet called reasons for a war with france which book he has owned he was hired to write by that conscientious bookseller so celebrated for his honesty mr edmund curl in fleet street who was one of his bail upon which he gives out an advertisement in several of the newspapers that a book was preparing for the press entitled reasons against a war with france by the author of the mitre and purse which as is said above appears to be the same author viz mr pittis this so evidently proves the practice above of mr curl and his associates writing for and against that no men can be so wilfully obstinate as not to be convinced  now to return from this digression the quaker told me many more things which i have not room to take notice of here but he was particularly warm when he discoursed of the use which we made of these books the people of this city says he are all true believers for they can believe every thing which pleases them and call every thing which they do not approve of false if thou continued he should go among them and tell them that the history of the white staff was not written by lord oxford or by some of his emissaries they would laugh thee to scorn on the other hand should thou say unto them that the history of the purse and mitre was not written by the instigation of the priest of r  r or of the late high man thou callst chancellor but that this last was written by the hire and by the directions of the same persons who were in that respect the authors of the other they would be displeasd with thee in a grievous manner and these things would seem unto them as idle tales yet in truth thou may be assured said he it is no otherwise and time will farther satisfy thee of these things nay i am credibly informed says he that some of thy people have been so wicked as to affirm that these books were written by other persons and to name those persons whereas it is certain that they could not be able to prove one tittle thereof which said he is a worse offense than any of those which they take liberty to reprehend for this said he is the greatest affront offered to truth that men are capable to offer and they ought in the first place to enter upon the demonstration of the fact which they assert to wit that lord oxford or some one for him or by his direction has written and published the said tracts before they entered upon the subject of the said book forasmuch said he as if it be not a verity which they have first laid down to wit that the said books were written by him or by his knowledge and direction or if it be a verity as i am persuaded thereof that he had no knowledge of the said books before they were written and published then it is folly and shame unto them who have engaged themselves to answer the same as if written by him wherefore also all which they have said upon those subjects afterward falls to the ground by reason that the same is built upon a wrong foundation likewise says he if it appears that they have been thus easily deceived it seems to me that they are also become wilful deceivers of others in that they adventure to affirm what they know not and desire others to build upon the like sandy foundations raising slanderous accusations upon persons upon suspicion of their having done what they have not in truth been guilty of for said he they are false teachers of others who are not well assured of the truth of what they teach and albeit said he this lord oxford were an evil man for friend said he i like not his ways neither do i approve of his doings any more than thou may do howbeit i must not charge him or any other unjustly with things whereof they are not guilty and if these persons have affirmed that this man has used such sophistry and such dishonesty for his own vindication as is found in the said books and he has not done so neither is any way directly or indirectly concerned therein as i have just cause to believe he is not then have they done wickedly and deserve reproof therefore neither can i give credit to any of the inferences which they draw therefrom forasmuch as right consequences are very seldom formed from wrong premises and this my friend said he is my opinion of this matter  reflecting after this upon the quakers discourse for we went not much farther at that time it produced some wonder in me at the strange usage which men give one another in this age and above all it came very strongly in my mind good lord said i what a temper of slander and reproach is gone forth in the world were we to hear some men talk of the books called the white staff one could hardly think but they knew for certain and were able to prove it in a court of justice that the earl of oxford was the author of them or that they had seen him give the instructions for the writing them to the persons who he had employed when the books are read over which are called the answers and considerations upon these histories of the white staff where the persons are called the most scandalous names for writing them which by this quakers account have had no knowledge of them till they were published what opinion must we entertain of the writers of these books and how will they take off all the weight which might otherwise be thought due to the arguments used in these books where i see the person who is supposed to be the original treated with such harshness the other who is charged with being his tool called so many rascals and such like names and yet in the bottom of the case for ought i see neither of these are in the least concerned in the original part of the books what shall be in justice said to such a practice and what principle must these authors have who dare thus impose upon the world in that whereof they know nothing and dare thus charge men positively and publicly in that of which they have no evidence but their own partial conjectures  these sheets have not the least affinity to a vindication of the earl of oxford the undertaker hereof knows nothing of daniel de for mr pittis or any other of the mercenary scribbling tribe the question now in debate with me is whether it be true which the quakerabove mentioned has laid down yea or nay and in enquiring after this i have sincerely employed some hours let the white staff be as black as the devil let his actions merit all the reproach that good men think their due or that bad men can cast upon them in fine let him be all that can be either justly or unjustly said of him yet it is certain nothing ought to be said either of him or of any other person which is not true nay nor which cannot be proved to be true  but neither is this the true design of this book for howbeit men will take the liberty to say of those against whom they write things not true or perhaps things which they have not sufficient evidence of yet who shall go about in such a day as this is to reprehend the vice of our angry partymen shall be sure to get nothing but some of the dirt which they were before throwing at one another to be thrown at him by both sides and be like the guides who brought the dutch troops into reading at the time of the revolution who running too busy about to show the dutchmen their enemy and to mark out the villains who were to cut their throats were shot in the fray by their own friends for not standing out of the way  but the use that i would make of this is to admonish those who write that however they treat those men they write against they would have some regard for those whom they write unto that is to say that albeit they may not regard loading those they write against with accusations and blackning them with crimes whether they may be guilty or no yet that they would take care of their friends to whom they write that they do not impose upon them to believe lies and things which have no foundation but in the crazy prepossessed imaginations of a party putting suspicions and conjectures upon them for matters of fact and prepossessing their minds to believe a lie  i could not but reflect with particular astonishment upon the book called the mitre and the purse how i found a raging something like a frenzy in the very frontispiece the man seeming to be in a poetic fury at the person called the white staff he talks in his title of the hypocrisy and villainy of the white staff he draws a bill upon virgil for that eminent line which as he takes it will be very acceptable to all the enemies of the white staff viz quo teneam vultus mutantem protea nodo  having also some credit with the english poets he draws another bill upon dryden in his absalom and achitophel which he shoots like an envenomed arrow directly at the white staff  he left not faction but of that was left when he enters upon his subject he remembers what would gratify the town and falls upon the common topic thus the mercenary that has been hired to raise a dust in order to blind peoples eyes from seeing clearly into the white staffs true character having etc hist of mitre and purse page    a plain man unacquainted with such roguery would believe that mr pittis knew and could prove beyond contradiction that the writer of the white staff was a mercenary hired by the person called or understood by the white staff on the other hand how would he have imagined that the same persons who hired some other mercenary to write the white staff had hired him to write the purse and mitre and that the style of his first lines which are quoted above ought if they had been written with sincerity to have run thus the mercenary who we hired to raise a dust in order to blind peoples eyes and make them believe the white staff as genuine and not a romance having etc  the reader may not expect i should enter into a detail of this writers language this is not an answer to books but a detecting the knavery of books and making the injured people of britain sensible how they have been imposed upon by several of those people called booksellers on the one hand they hire a man or men to write a secret history pretending to vindicate and defend the character of the person of him whom they call the white staff and they bring him in making eloquent speeches detracting from and loading the characters and conduct of other ministers of state of whom perhaps not one word of what he is said to have spoken may be true and which is yet more not one word of it was ever spoken by him on the other hand the same men hire another man perhaps the same man to mimmick the opposite party to fall upon the white staff with all the opprobrious terms and all that railery which a person supposed to be injured by the said white staff could be inspired with and as if he was employed by the mitre and purse to fight their battle taking on him the defense of their character falls on with such unmerciful fury as if the white staff was a victim given up to be sacrificed by his tongue to the ghost of the highchurch cause lately dead and buried and when all this is said and done and when the world has been amused with this ambodexter scuffle thus long it appears that neither the whitestaff abusing or the mitre and purse abused have the least knowledge of the matter the person who is charged with writing for them is sick in his bed and knows little or nothing of it and the secret history of these secret histories is that they were coined in one mint all formed by one and the same set of men and with the same truly mercenary design viz to get a penny not valuing who on the one hand they slandered whom they set together by the ears what characters they reproached unjustly or whom they exposed and on the other hand not regarding whom they incensed against the persons concerned whom they imposed upon deceived and abused making the poor innocent people of britain to believe lies and things of other men which perhaps never entered into their heads or hearts to do or say  i need now go no further into the book it matters not what the subject is neither what the person is who writes it this is no charge upon mr pittis who as the quaker assured me wrote the book called the mitre and purse the more he falls upon the white staff the better is it for those who employed him as the more the writer of the white staff falls upon the mitre and purse the better for those who employed him the original of these things being the same persons this is the secret history of the secret history neither is this tract bent against the persons who employed these writers on one side or on the other it seems it is their trade and i have been informed that one mr edmund curl has been furnished with topics out of lex mercatoria to justify and defend the lawfulness of such an employment which he has practiced some years before he intermeddled with the books in question these things therefore i say are not the aim and design of this book but rather to open the eyes of the people to the main thing viz that they may be made more sensible than they have yet been how grossly they are imposed on by the writers of pamphlets at this time and how the great affairs of state are canvassd and settled or rather indeed unsettled and exposed by such little animals as curl and his hacks who write and print whatsoever they find the people foolish enough to buy and who watch the inclinations of the people to see what will take with and please their humor not valuing whom they deceive or whom they expose so that they can make their books sell off which they print and bring them to a second or third edition  passing then from this part to those which follow viz he other answerers of this book perhaps there may be some who have not the same original viz in the booksellers cabinetcouncil but who take this occasion to exert their other vice viz of prejudice against the persons concerned of these we may observe how justly to be ridiculed is all their serious railing their singling out particulars in the history of the staff their violence and enforcing their arguments with so much heat of zeal i say how justly to be ridiculed and exposed are all their serious efforts when the truth of the thing is that this whole affair has been only the work of a few booksellers who wanted to get a penny that the persons supposed to be concerned therein knew nothing of the books or had even any hand in their composition and that they have made fools of themselves and of the world by fighting with a man of straw of other peoples dressing up  it must move some laughter surely at themselves when if they shall enquire further into the thing as i have done they should arrive to an eclaircisment in this matter and to be satisfied that this jackalent was a mere booksellers romance a mere composition of grubstreet set on work by those who neither knew the persons they writ of nor owed them either ill will or good but would have wrote the same things for or against their own father for the same price  it is also very observable that in all the books which have been published either in answer to the said histories of the staff or reflecting upon them there is not one of these which i have yet met with whose author takes the least care to prove that the staff or the purse or the mitre or any one else for them or by their order or direction wrote or caused to be written any of those books they have gotten a new way to get over all these things at once viz by charging it positively upon whomsoever they please to call the authors expecting that their readers should take it upon the faith of the answerers that such men have written the books they answer whether they offer any evidence of it or not this is a token either of great impudence in the said writers who dare impose upon the world in such a manner upon their own authority or of great levity and credulity in the age who take their intelligence of things upon trust and sit down with the scandals and slanders of writers on any side without proof  but to let alone the writers who are in themselves all of a rank too mean and too scandalous to have any of these lines spent about them or that any one should be concerned at what is or is not published by them turn we to the people abused by them and imposed upon in their false accounts of these things it must be a particular satisfaction to those who are affronted in these writings whether staff purse mitre or who else may be designed under the pretended characters of those authors to be able as i hear they do already to assure their friends that they are not at all concerned in these books which are so positively laid to their charge since the first discourse which i had with the quaker aforesaid i have met with several persons of undoubted reputation who have assured me that all those persons who have been named by those authors to wit the e of o  d late l  d cha  the l  d b of r  the l  d b  and others also do affirm upon all the sacred things which bind men of honor and christianity to speak truth that they have been no ways concerned in these books either the history of the staff or of the purse and mitre  but to put this matter out of all question and to put to silence the writers who have taken upon them to publish to the world that this that and the other person have written or caused to be written these said books entitled the secret history of the staff the secret history of the mitre and purse etc the writer of these sheets makes this brief but positive proposal to them which if they do not accept they must be selfcondemned and all men must take their silence for a confession of their guilt the proposal is as follows viz let any of the writers who have fixed the writing or causing these said books to be written upon the person or direction of the said white staff mitre and purse bring any evidence to prove that it was so in fact and that the said persons known to be meant by the said names of the staff mitre or purse did write or direct to be written or know of or consent to the writing of the said books or any part or parcel thereof or that even the said staff purse or mitre or any of them did ever see the said books or hear of them or any part of them before they were printed and published i say let them bring any evidence other than bare report or their own conjectures and then the writer of these sheets will be confronted with and against them and will engage himself to prove who were the writers of the said books or at least who were the designers of and employers of those who did write them and will prove by irrefragable testimony that it was impossible any of the said persons so represented by the names of the staff the mitre and purse could be concerned in writing the same or have any knowledge directly or indirectly thereof  these proposals are so equitable and must be acknowledged so by every just person that we might even appeal to the authors themselves to be the censurers of their own writings and if any of them are encumbered with those things called reflections as it is feared much that they are not they must be brought acknowledge that they have been too credulous too forward to charge men with crimes which they could not prove them to be guilty of and that they have been too willing to impose upon the credulity of the age insinuating to them that such and such persons have been concerned in such and such things when they themselves cannot give any evidence that it is so in truth or reason why the other should believe so  what satisfaction these men would make for slandering other persons in such a manner that indeed is a thing which it is to be doubted such men lay little to heart the men who can satisfy themselves to slander their enemies and impose upon their friends can ill be supposed to concern themselves in making reparation for the injury done to the persons slandered as was remarked at the beginning i am not concerned to defend them let them answer for themselves howbeit for the innocent common people who are made to believe a lie by those men for their sakes i say it is but just that such practices as these should be exposed as they deserve that they may be better informed and may be made to see who they are that delude and deceive them these men when they read the several answers to the books called the white staff the mitre and purse and therein find such and such persons of quality charged directly with writing or hiring others to write thus and thus have nothing to do but to enquire first how do we know that these men did write these things secondly how does it appear where does the answerer or considerer prove the charge and if they find that this charge is not proved or the proof not attempted in their writings why then all the rest is nothing but the most impudent begging the question that has ever been known  the writer of these sheets is too well acquainted with the spirit of the men who will be offended at this thing and that they will defend the crime of which they are guilty by joining thereunto another crime that is to say they will defend one false thing with saying another they have said already that these books were written by such and such persons and being able to bring no other or further testimony thereof they will add still that they affirm it that it is and must be so but this is popery in the most jesuitical branch of it covering a fraud with a greater fraud protestants are come to a point in such things viz to believe nothing without some proof if it shall be alleged that direct proof cannot be obtained in such cases it is replied to this that where positive proof cannot be obtained no fact should be positively charged what cannot be proved should not be affirmed for affirmanti incumbat probatio they should with modesty and caution have argued if these things are written by such and such persons or by such and such mercenary hirelings by their direction then so and so prout in their answers but not a man of these answerers and considerers that i have met with have given themselves the trouble to use any measures for a salvo to their own reputations but have shot their bolts like the fool affirmed without probation charged the guilt without searching for the evidence and when the world comes to be convinced of this part of what force can all they have said after it be with any considering person  i shall leave it upon this issue nothing can be more convincing to the understanding of any man than this these books have been written and published by men unconcerned in the fact who in the way of their trade as booksellers etc have put romances upon the world a set of writers as bad as they have taken hold of the subject represented therein and pretending to answer the books have begun with a falsehood without taking the least pains to clear it up as they went on have charged the writing upon persons no way concerned therein without taking one step to prove that what they had so charged was true this stumble being made at the threshold all that they have said therein is most egregiously wicked and either false in fact or in consequence the persons are injured and their country abused and imposed upon in a criminal and abominable manner
