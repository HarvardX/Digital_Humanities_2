the anatomy of the human nerves with an account of the reciprocal motions of the heart and a description of the human lacteal sac and duct  by alexander monro p a  edinburgh printed for mr w monro and w drummond  sold by them and other booksellers there  preface the first sketch of the following essays was wrote for the service of a friend without any intention of mine to have been an author when they were published i was glad of the opportunity which the second edition of the anatomy of the bones gave me to correct them and i thought mr winslows anatomy made any further labor of mine on these subjects unnecessary but whenever it was foreseen that this third edition of the osteology was to be printed i was teazed with the importunities of friends and scholars to make the anatomy of the nerves more complete and to tack the other two essays to it it was in vain for me to plead the difficulty if not impossibility of bringing the physiology of the nerves to any certainty though it might engage me in an endless dispute and that any other description of the distribution of the nerves than what mr winslow had given was altogether superstuous they insisted would not be refused and forced me to undertake it  in the account of the nerves in general i have avoided what i could to give offense and therefore have not only treated all the opinions i mention with that modesty which the uncertainty of the subject required but have not named one author flattering myself that those whom i was under the necessity to redargue might be better concealed by my not declaring whom i approved  i attempted an accurate description of the particular nerves but upon comparing the notes i wrote of what i saw in dissecting the nerves with mr winslows exposition des nerss i found i had done little more than used other words for describing the same things and upon giving my papers to be perused by some of those for whose use any thing i write is chiefly intended i mean the students in physic i discovered another misfortune sufficient to make me alter my design the young anatomists were so confounded with the variety of branches and their subdivisions that they could not see even the gross outlines of the picture i had attempted to draw that i might be understood and my scholars might thereby be assisted to remember the more minute dissections i should show them i changed my notes into a superficial description of the larger branches of the nerves  the account of the systole and diastole of the heart is the immortal boerhaaves doctrine illustrated and the description of the receptaculum chyli and of the ductus thoracicus is nearly the same as it was in the former edition  the anatomy of the human nerves of the nerves in general  by the assistance of injections and microscopes wonderful plexuses of blood vessels are discovered to go from the pia matter into the cortex cincritious or ashycoloured part of the cerebrum cerebellum and spinal marrow whereas we can only see longitudinal vessels without numerous ramifications or reticular plexuses in the white medullary substance of these parts    the continuity of the cortex with the medulla of the encephalon and spinal marrow is observable with the naked eye and is more distinctly seen with the assistance of a microscope    in dissecting the brain and cerebellum we see the small beginnings of the medulla proceeding from the cortex and can trace its gradual increase by the addition of more medulla coming from the cortex    both cortex and medulla are very succulent for being exposed to the air to dry they lose more of their weight than most other parts of the body do    in several places we can observe the medulla to be composed of fibers laid at each others sides    the medullary substance is all employed in forming the white fibrous cords which have now the name of nerves appropriated to them within the skull we see the nerves to be the medullary substance continued and the medulla spinalis is all employed in forming nerves    the common opinion concerning the rise of the nerves founded on a superficial inspection of those parts is that the nerves are propagated from the same side of the encephalon at which they go out but it having been remarked after a more strict enquiry and preparing the parts by maceration in water that the medullary fibers decussate or cross each other in some parts of the medulla as for example at the corpus annulare and beginning of the medulla spinalis and practical observators having related several examples of people whose brain was hurt on one side while the morbid symptom palsy appeared on the other side of the body of which i have seen two instances and experiments made on brutes having confirmed these observations it has been thought that the nerves had their rise from the side of the encephalon opposite to their egress from the skull it may however still be said that this last opinion is not fully demonstrated because a decussation in some few parts is not a proof that it obtains universally and if there are examples of palsy of the side opposite to where the lesion of the brain was there are also others where the injury done to the brain and the palsy were both on the same side    the nerves are composed of a great many threads lying parallel where they come out from the medulla  this fibrous texture is evident at the origin of most of the nerves within the skull and in the cauda equine of the medulla spinalis we can divide them into such small threads that a very quicksighted eye can scarce perceive them but these threads when looked at with a microscope appear each to be composed of a great number of smaller threads    how small one of these fibrils of the nerves is we know not but when we consider that every even the most minute part of the body is sensible and that this must depend on the nerves which all conjoined would not make a cord of an inch diameter being divided into branches or filaments to be dispersed through all these minute parts we must be convinced that the nervous fibrils are very small from the examination of the minimum visibile it is demonstrated that each fiber in the retina of the eye or expanded optic nerve cannot exceed the size of the    00 part of a hair   0 the medullary substance of which the nervous fibrils are composed is very tender and would not be able to resist the common force of the circulating fluids and other such forces to which the nerves are exposed within the bones were not the pia matter and tunica arachnoides continued upon them the former giving them firmness and strength and the latter furnishing a cellular coat to connect the threads of the nerves to let them ly soft and most and to support the vessels which go with them  it is this cellular substance that is distended with air when it is blown through a blowpipe thrust into a nerve and that makes a nerve appear all spungy after being distended with air till it dries the proper nervous fibrils shriveling so in drying as they scarce can be observed     these coats  0 would not make the nerves strong enough to bear the stretching and pressure they are exposed to in their course to the different parts of the body and therefore as the nerves are going out at the holes in the cranium and spine the dura matter is closely wrapped round them to collect their disgregated fibers into tense firm cords and that the stretching they may be exposed to may have no effect to hurt them where they are not strengthened thus by the dura matter this strong membrane is firmly fixed to the sides of the holes in the bones through which they pass     the nervous cords thus composed of nervous fibrils cellular coat pia and dura matter have such numerous blood vessels bestowed on them that after their arteries only are injected the whole cord can be tinged of the color of the injected liquor and if the injection is pushed too violently the cellular substance of the nerves comes to be distended with it     a nervous cord such as has been just now described    has very little elasticity compared with other parts of the body when cut out of the body it does not become observably shorter while the blood vessels contract three eighths of their length     in the course which the nerves have to the several parts of the body they are generally lodged in a cellular or fatty substance and run in the interstices of the muscles and other active organs that so they might be little exposed to the pressure which these parts would make upon them and might be defended from any bad effects which such pressure might otherwise produce     the larger cords of the nerves divide into branches in their distribut on to the different parts the branches being smaller than the trunk from which they come and making generally an acute angle where they separate     in several places different nerves unite into one cord which is commonly larger than any of the nerves which form t     several nerves particularly those which are distributed to the owls suddenly form a hard knot considerably larger than all the nerves of which it is made these knots were called corpora olivaria and are now generally named ganglions     the ganglions have much thicker coats and larger more numerous blood vessels than the nerves so that they appear redder and more muscular on dissecting the ganglions fibers are seen running longitudinally in their axes and other fibers are derived from their sides in an oblique direction to the longitudinal ones     the nerves which go out from the ganglions are no way remarkably different from other nerves   0 the nerves that are sent to our organs of the senses lose there their firm coats and terminate in a pulpy substance the optic nerves are expanded into the soft tender webs the retinae the auditory nerve has scarce the consistence of mucus in the vestibulum cochlea and semicircular canals of each ear the papillae of the nose tongue and skin are very soft     the nerves of muscles can likewise be traced till they lose their coats and become very soft from which and what we observed of the sensatory nerves  0 there is reason to conclude that the muscular nerves are also pulpy at their terminations which we cannot indeed prosecute by dissection     it would seem necessary that the extremities of the nerves should continue in this soft flexible state   0    in order to perform their functions right for in proportion as parts become rigid and firm by age or any other cause they lose of their sensibility and the motions are more difficultly performed     though the fibers in a nervous cord are firmly connected and frequently different nerves join into one trunk or into the same ganglion yet the sensation of each part of the body is so very distinct and we have so much the power of moving the muscles separately that if the nerves are principal agents in these two functions which i shall endeavor to prove they are we have reason to believe that there is no union confusion or immediate communication of the proper nervous fibrils but that each fiber remains distinct from its origin to its termination     changes produced any way upon the coats of the nerves cannot however miss to affect the nervous fibrils the cellular substance may be too full of liquor or may not supply enough the liquor may not be of a due consistence or it may be preternaturally obstructed and collected the pia matter may be too tense or too lax as may also the dura matter their vessels may be obstructed their proper nerves may be violently irritated or lose their power of acting and a great many other such changes may happen which will not only occasion disorders in particular nerves but may cause the sympathy so frequently observed among the nerves which is so necessary to be attentively regarded in a great many diseases in order to discover their true state and nature without the knowledge of which we must commit very dangerous mistakes in the practice of physic and surgery     many experiments and observations concur in proving that when nerves are compressed cut or any other way destroyed the parts served by such nerves farther from the head or spine than where the injuring cause has been applied have their sensations motious and nourishment weakened or lost while no such effects are seen in the parts nearer to the origins of those nerves and in such experiments where the cause impeding the nerves to exert themselves could be removed and the structure of the nerves not injured as for example when a ligature made upon a nerve and stopping its influence has been taken away the motion and sensation of the parts soon were restored from which it would appear that the nerves are principal instruments in our sensations motions and nourishment and that this influence of the nerves is not inherent in them without the communication between these cords and their origin is preserved  it will be no objection to this conclusion that sometimes upon cutting a nerve the effects abovementioned have been felt for a short time but afterward the person was sensible of no numness or immobility for wherever this is said to have happened the cut nerve was only one of several which were sent to the member the want of whose influence would be felt no longer than till the habit was acquired of performing the functions casily by the other nerves  it is of no greater weight as an objection that when a ligature is drawn very hard upon a nerve the nerve never again recovers its influence upon the parts it is distributed to beyond the ligature but is of as little effect as if it had been cut through which is to say that its texture has been altered beyond recovery the same thing is to be seen by tying a thread tight round a tender twig of any vegetable it decays     experiments and observations show too that when parts of the encephalon or medulla spinalis have been irritated compressed or destroyed the parts of the body whose nerves had their origin from such affected parts of the encephalon or medulla spinalis became convulsed paralytick insensible or wasted and in such cases where the injuring cause could be removed from the origin of the nerves the morbid symptoms observed in the parts to which these nerves were distributed went off upon the removal of that cause from which it is thought reasonable to conclude that the nerves must not only have a communication with their origin but that the influence they have upon the parts they are distributed to depends on the influence which they derive from the medulla encephali and spinalis     though the medulla spinalis has its own vessels and cineritious substance which assists to form its medulla yet a very large share of the medullary substance within the spine is derived from the encephalon whose medulla oblongata descends from the head and the influence of the medulla spinallis on its nerves depends in a great measure on this medulla oblongata of the head hence an injury done to any part of the medulla spinalis immediately affects all the parts whose nerves have their origin below where the injuring cause is applied to the spinal marrow a luxation of a vertebra in the loins makes the lower extremities soon paralytick a transverse section of the medulla at the first vertebra of the neck soon puts an end to life     if such causes produce constantly such effects           in us and other creatures living in nearly the same circumstances as we do the conclusions already made will be good notwithstanding examples of children and other creatures being born without brains or medulla spinalis or notwithstanding the brains of adult creatures being much changed in their texture by diseases and notwithstanding the experiments of cutting off the heads of tortoises and some other animals which continued to move about a considerable time after their heads were off we may be ignorant of the particular circumstances requisite or necessary to the being or wellbeing of this or that particular creature and we may be unable to account for a great many phenomenon but we must believe our eyes in the examination of facts and if we see constantly such consequences from such actions we cannot but conclude the one to be the cause and the other the effect it would be as unjust to deny the conclusions made in the three preceding articles because of the seemingly preternatural phenomenon mentioned in the beginning of this as it would be to deny the necessity of the circulation of the blood in us and quadrupeds because a frog can jump about or a tortoise can walk long after all the bowels of its thorax and abdomen are taken out or because the different parts of a worm crawl after it has heen cut into a great many pieces it is therefore almost universally agreed that the nerves are principal instruments in our sensations motion and nourishment and that the influence which they have is communicated from their origin the encephalon and medulla spinallis but authors are far from agreeing about the manner in which this influence is communicated or in what way nerves act to produce these effects     some allege that the nervous fibers are all solid cords acting by elasticity or vibration others affirm that those fibers are small pipes conveying liquors by means of which all their effects are produced   0 the gentlemen who think the nervous fibers solid raise several objections to the other doctrine which i shall consider afterward and endeavor to show the fitness of their own doctrine to account for the effects commonly observed to be produced by the nerves  the objects of the senses plainly say they make impulses on the nerves of the proper organs which must shake the nervous fibrils and this vibration must be propagated along the whole cord to its other extremity or origin as happens in other tense strings and these vibrations being differently modified according to the difference of the object and its different application produce the different ideas we have of objects     to this account of the sensations it is objected  st that nerves are unfit for vibrations because their extremities where objects are applied to them are quite soft and pappy   0 and not susceptible of the vibrations supposed and if there could be any little tremor made here by the impulse of objects it could not be continued along the nervous cord because the cellular substance by which each particular fiber is connected to the neighboring ones   0 and the fatty substance in which the nervous cord is immersed     would soon stifle any such vibratory motion  the   d objection to this doctrine is that supposing the nerves capable of vibrations by the impressions of objects these vibrations would not answer the design for if what we know of other vibrating strings to wit that their tone remains the same unless their texture length or tension is altered and that different substances striking them do no more than make the sound higher or lower if these properties are to be applied to nerves then it will follow that the same nerve would constantly convey the same idea with no other variety than of its being weaker or stronger whatever different objects were applied to it unless we suppose the nerve changed in its texture length or tension each time a different object is applied which it is presumed no body will undertake to prove does happen but further if ever such a variety of vibrations could be made our sensations would notwithstanding be confused and indistinct because the tremulous nervous fiber being firmly connected and contiguous to several other fibers of the same cord would necessarily shake them too by which we should have the notion of the object as applied at all the different parts where the extremities of these fibers terminate     in whatever way the favorers of the doctrine of solid nerves please to apply the elasticity of nerves to the contraction of muscles their adversaries insist that nerves are too weak to resist such weights as the muscles sustain they would surely break especially that they are greatly if not wholly deprived of their strong coats before they come to the part of the muscle they are immediately to act upon     and the nerves being found to have little or no elasticity to shorten themselves     shows them altogether unfit for such an office as this of contracting muscles in the way proposed of their acting by elasticity     as a further objection against either motion or sensation being owing to the elasticity of the nerves it is said that if this doctrine was true the sensations would be more acute and the contractions of muscles would be greater and stronger when the parts become firmer and more rigid by age for then their elasticity is increased whereas on the contrary it appears     that then the sensations are blunted and muscular contraction becomes less and weaker     if the nerves were granted to be elastic and to communicate a springy force to all the parts they are distributed to they might appear necessary in this view to assist the application of the nutritious particles of the fluids to the sides of the vessels these particles were to repair and so far might well enough account for the share nerves are thought to have in nutrition yet if we cannot make use of elasticity in the other two functions of sensation and motion we must also endeavor to find out some other way the nerves act in nutrition which will be done afterward     having thus stated the reasons for and against the nerves acting as solid strings let us likewise relate the arguments for nerves being pipes and the objections to this doctrine  a great argument of those who think the nerves to be tubes conveying liquors is the strong analogy of the brain and nerves to other glands of the body and their excretories where a manifest secretion of liquor is made in the glands to be conveyed by the excretories to the proper places in which it ought to be deposited they think that the vascular texture of the cortex of the encephalon and medulla spinalis    the continuation of the cortex in forming the medullary substance     the fibrous texture    and succulent state of this medulla    and its being wholly employed to form the nerves   where the fibrous texture is evident   all these things say they conspire to show such a strong analogy between these parts and the other glands of the body as carries a conviction that there is a liquor secreted in the encephalon and medulla spinalis to be sent out by the nerves to the different parts of the body     the following objections are raised to this argument in favor of a liquor conveyed in the nerves from the analogy of the glands  st other glands it is said have their excretories collected into a few large pipes and not continued in such a great number of separate pipes as far as the places where the liquors are deposited which last must be the case if the nerves are the excretories of the glandular brain   dly we see the cavities and can examine the liquors in the excretories of other glands much smaller than the brain which cannot be done in the nerves   dly if the nerves were pipes they would be so small that the attraction of their sides to their liquors would be so great that the liquors could not be moved with the celerity required to influence our sensations and motions in the quick manner we see them performed   thly if the nerves were pipes they would be cylindrical ones and consequently not subject to diseases or at least we could have no comprehension of the diseases in them     the answer to the  st of these objections is that there are other glands where there is a manifest secretion and in which the disposition of the excretories is in much the same way as in the encephalon the kidneys for example have a reticulated cortex of vessels from which the eustachian or bellinian medulla consisting of longitudinal fibers and a few longitudinal blood vessels proceeds and this medulla is collected into ten or twelve papillae each of which is formed of numerous small separate pipes which singly discharge the urine into the large membranous tubes which united compose the pelvis upon comparing this texture of the kidney with what was said of the encephalon                the analogy will be found very strong     in answer to the   d objection in    it is granted that microscopes injections and all the other arts hitherto employed have not shown the cavities of the nervous fibrils or the liquors contained in them and from what was said    of the smallness of the nervous fibrils it is not to be expected that ever they should be seen but so long as such a number of little animals can every hour be brought to the framers of this objection in which they can as little demonstrate the vessels or contained fluids it will not be allowed to be conclusive reasoning that because ocular demonstration cannot be given of pipes therefore they do not exist for if we have any notion of an animal it is its being a hydraulick machine which has liquors moving in it as long as it has life if therefore such little animals have vessels and liquors which we cannot see why may not some of the vessels and liquors of the human body be also invisible to us  to avoid this answer to the objection it is further urged that though we might not see the canals and liquors of nerves as they are flowing naturally yet they ought to discover themselves by the canals being stretched or a nerves swelling upon being firmly tied and it might likewise be expected that however subtle the liquor of the nerves is it might be collected in some drops at least when the cut end of a nerve of a living animal is kept some time in the exhausted receiver of an airpump it is affirmed that neither did the tied nerve swell between the brain and ligature nor was there any liquor collected in the receiver of the airpump from which it is concluded that there is no liquor in the nerves  there is some difference among those who say they have tried these experiments some affirming that in young animals the nerve does swell above the ligature and that a liquor does drill out upon cutting a nerve but allowing the experiments to succeed any way the reply to the inference from them is that in neither way are they any thing to the purpose for the swelling of the nerve after it is tied or the efflux of liquors from its extremity will never prove either to be the effect of the fluid in the proper nervous fibrils so long as they might be occasioned by the liquors in the larger vessels of the cellular substance of the nerves and if these same vessels of the coats of the nerves do not discover their liquors by these experiments it is far less to be expected that the much more subtle nerves should     the   d objection to the doctrine of the brain being a gland and the nerves its excretories supposes a more rapid motion necessary in the fluid of the nerves than what most of the defenders of the nervous fluid will now allow and is afterward to be considered particularly in a more proper place   0 the   th objection being that if nerves are excretories of a gland they must be cylindrical pipes in which no obstructions or diseases would happen but since we daily see diseases in the nerves they must therefore not be such excretories the answer is that diseases happen often in the excretories of other glands as of the liver kidneys etc notwithstanding their cylindrical form and their much shorter and less exposed course when we consider the very tender substance of the brain the vast complication of vessels there the prodigious smalness of the pipes going out from it the many moving powers which the nerves are to undergo the shock of and the many chances which the vessels membranes and cellular substance accompanying the nerves have of being disordered and then affecting the nervous fibrils we have very great reason to be surprised that these cylindrical pipes are not much more frequently put out of order by too great or too small a quantity of liquors by too viscid or too thin fluids by liquors consisting of too mild and sluggish particles or of too acrid pungent ones by too great or too little motion given to the liquors by the diameters of the pipes being too much straightened or too much enlarged and by a great many other varieties of circumstances which might be supposed capable of disturbing the functions of the nerves supposing them to be cylindrical excretories of the gland the brain     the numerous vessels of the encephalon have brought some of the gentlemen who defend the opinion of the nerves being solid to acknowledge that there is a liquor secreted in the brain but then they will not allow that this liquor is sent out by the proper nervous fibrils but that it is poured into the cellular substance in which the nerves ly to keep them moist and supple and therefore fit for exerting their elasticity vibration etc by which in their opinion the effects commonly ascribed to nerves are produced     besides the objections already mentioned        against the nerves acting as elastick strings this opinion has some other difficulties attending it that may be urged as objections to it such as there is not one example in the body of liquors secreted in a large gland being poured into a cellular sustance as here supposed the liquors in the cells of the tunica cellularis of other parts are separated from the little arteries which are distributed to these cells  further it cannot be well determined how a liquor secreted in the cortex of the brain should make its way through the medulla to come out into the cellular membranes on the surface of that medulla  lastly a very simple experiment of injecting water by the artery of any member and thereby filling the cellular substance of the nerves of that member shows evidently that the liquor of the tunica cellularis of the nerves has the same fountain as the liquor in the tunica cellularis has any where else that is from the little arteries dispersed upon it     the doctrine of a fluid in the nerves is not only thus supported by the analogy of the brain and nerves to the other glands and their excretories but those who maintain this doctrine mention an experiment which they think directly probative of a fluid in the nerves it is this after opening the thorax of a living dog catch hold of and press one or both the phrenic nerves with the fingers the diaphragm immediately ceases to contract then let go the hold of the nerves and the muscle acts again pinch a second time the nerve or nerves some way above the diaphragm this muscle again ceases to act keep firm the hold of the nerve and with the fingers of the other hand strip it down from the gripping fingers toward the diaphragm and the muscle is made to contract and for three or four such stripings its action follows or obeys the motion of the fingers which strip it down then it becomes disobedient and will contract no more strip as you will unless the fingers gripping or pinching the nerve let go their hold or are removed higher up upon the nerve when the muscle may again be made to contract by stripping the nerve down toward it this experiment i have done with the success here mentioned let any one try if he can imagine any other reasonable account of these appearances than that the gripping fingers stopped the course of a fluid in the nerve that what of this fluid was thus made to stagnate in the part of the nerve between the gripping fingers and diaphragm was forced down into that muscle by the pressure of the fingers which stripped the nerve down and when ever this stagnating fluid was pressed all away by several repetitions of stripping the nerve the muscle being supplied with no more fluid contracted no more till upon removing the fingers which had hold of the nerve a new supply of liquor was brought from the brain or from the part of the nerve that had not yet been gripped or stripped and when ever this liquor could make its way down to the muscle or was forced down to it the muscle immediately began to renew its contractile motions     some gentlemen convinced of the reasonableness of the secretion of a liquor in the brain to be sent out by the nerves but not comprehending how a fluid could have such a rapid retrograde motion as they imagined was necessary for conveying the impressions of objects made on the extremities of nerves to the sensorium supposed two sorts of nerves one that conveyed a liquor for muscular motion and nutrition the other composed of solid nerves that were to serve for the organs of the senses to convey the vibrations communicated from objects to the sensorium     the objections mentioned     against the sensatory nerves acting by vibrations take place here and further there is nothing in the texture either of the brain or nerves which gives any reason to think that the nerves are differently formed on the contrary the structure is every where similar and often branches of the same nerve serve both for sensation and motion what occasioned justly a prejudice against the scheme of our sensations depending on a fluid in the nerves to wit the rapid refluxes supposed in the sensitive nerves is an opinion now deserted generally by the defenders of the nervous fluid for reasons to be given in a little though their opponents are still willing to palm it on them whereby they may have a better handle against the general doctrine of the nervous fluid     this same rapid refluxat was too which gave rise to another division of the nerves into arterious or effluent and venous or refluent it was said that muscular motion and nutrition depended on the arterious nerves and that the sensations depended on an accelerated motion of the nervous fluid toward the brain by the impressions which the objects of the senses make upon the venous nerves by this supposition the absurdity of rapid fluxes and refluxes in the same canal was prevented and an advantage was thought to be gained by it of saving too great a wste of the fluid of the nerves which otherwise the encephalon and medulla spinalis could not supply in sufficient quantity to answer all the exigencies of life     to this opinion     it has been objected   that there is no example in the body of a secreted liquor being returned immediately and unmixed to the gland by which it was originally separated from the mass of blood which would be the case were there venous nerves   dly there is no occasion for saving the fluid of the nerves in the way proposed the organs for secreting that fluid being large enough to supply all that is necessary o it in the common functions of life   dly if the fluid of the nerves was to be thus kept in a perptual circulation it would soon become too acrid for continuing with safety in such sensible tender vessels as the brain and nerves are composed of   thly this hypothesis will not answer the design for which it was proposed for though the momentary application of an object might cause an acceleration in the fluid of venous nerves yet if the object was kept applied to the nerves it would stop their fluid so that it could not go forward to the brain and therefore according to this doctrine we should be sensible of no objects except those whose application to the organs of the senses was momentary     let us now suppose it probable that the encephalon and medulla spinalis secern a liquor from the blood which is sent into all the nerves and that by the means of this liquor the nerves perform the offices commonly assigned to them it is necessary to enquire what kind of liquor this is and how it moves in order to determine how well its nature and motion are fitted for performing what is expected from it     it has been supposed that the liquor of the nerves was of a very strong acid or alcaline nature but since we can see none of our juices of such natures and since such liquors irritate and destroy the parts of the body they are applied to we can never imagine that the brain could separate or the nerves could bear any thing of such an acrid nature and this same tenderness and sensibility of these organs must hinder us to suppose the liquor of the nerves can be acrid or pungent of any kind as of the nature of inflammable spirits spirit of harthorn etc   0 some have imagined the liquor of the nerves to be capable of vast explosion like gunpowder or of violent sudden raretaction like air or of strong ebullition like boiling water or the mixture of acids with alkaline liquors but as none of the particles of our mass of blood from which this liquor of the nerves must be derived enjoy any such proerties we cannot suppose the blood to furnish what it has not besides all these operations are too violent for the brain or nerves to bear and when once they are begun are not so quickly controuled or put an end to as experience teaches us the nerves can be made to cease from acting     we know not sufficiently the properties of an ether pervading every thing to pretend to apply it to the animal functions especially where we must suppose it sent a great way in a long cord in which we cannot conceive how it should be confined which are difficulties not to be surmounted in accounting for the functions of nerves by means of such an ether     the surest way of judging what kind of liquor this of the nerves must be is to exmine the liquors of similar parts of the body all the glands separate liquors from the blood much thinner than the compound mass itself such is the liquor poured into the cavity of the abdomen thorax ventricles of the brain the saliva pancreatic juice lymph etc wherever there is occasion for secreted liquors being thick and viscid in order to answer better the uses they are intended for nature has provided reservoirs for them to stagnate in where their thinner parts may be carried off by the numerous absorbent veins dispersed on the sides of those cavities or by flying off where there is a communication with the external air the snot of the nose is very thick commonly by stagnating but when the secretion of the membrane of the nose is in creased by blowing the nose or by sternutatories we see it very thin and watery there not then time for the air or absorbents to carry off the more watery particles the cerumen of the ears is of a watery consistence when squeezed out before it has stagnated the mucus of the alimentary canal is concocted in lacunae the bile in the hepatick duct is lymphatick that in the gallbladder is viscid and strong the urine is much more watery as it comes from the kidneys than when it is excreted from the bladder the seed is thin as it comes from the testicles and is concocted in the vesiculae seminales etc     from    we may safely conclude that the secretion of a thing liquor is made in the cortex of the encephalon and medulla spinalis and seeing the thinness of secreted liquors is generally as the divisions of the vessels into small subtle branches and the ramifications within the skull are carried on to a very great subtilty the liquor secreted in the encephalon may be determined to be among the finest or thinnest fluids     seeing we can observe no large reservoire where the liquor secerned in the cortical substance is deposited to have its finer parts taken off we have reason to think that it goes forward into the nerves in the same condition in which it is secerned     by fine or subtle animal liquors is meant no more than those which are very fluid consisting of a large proportion of watery particles and a lesser one of the oily saline and terrestrious particles some of the liquors which we can have in sufficient quantity to make experiments with are so fluid and have so little viscidity or cohesion of parts that when laid on a piece of clean mirror they will evaporate without leaving a stain on the mirror such is the liquor drilling out on the surface of the pleura the lymph and several others  if then these liquors which are subject to our examination the secerning vessels of which are so large that we can see them have such a small cohesion of farts it might not be unreasonable to say that the liquor of the nerves is as much more fine and fluid than lymph as the vessels separating it are smaller and therefore that the fluid of the nerves is a defecated water with a very small proportion of animal sapo dissolved in it     two experiments are said to contradict this opinion of the liquor of the nerves being so fluid and subtle one is that upon cutting the cauda equina of a living animl a liquor as viscid as the white of an egg drops out the other is that a wounded nerve yields a glairy sanies but these are no proof that the liquor of the nerves is of the same nature since it is evident that the liquor discharged in both those cases comes out of the cellular substance involving the nervous fibrils     considering how many experiments make it evident that there is a constant uninterrupted stream of liquors flowing through all the canals of animals which convey liquors whose particles are not larger than the diameter of their canal which never is the case in a natural state of excretory vessels it i surprising how the opinion ever should have been taken up of the liquid of the nerves being obliged to make such a prodigious rapid course as to flow from the brain to each muscle instantaneously when we will to contract it or that this liquor should flow back with the like celerity from the extremity of each nerve to which an object of sensation was applied the nerves as well as the other excretories of the glands are always full of liquors the degree of distension of the canals by the liquors being even in a sound natural state sometimes more and sometimes less the sides of the tubes being stretched to make way for a larger quantity and contracting to accommodate themselves to a lesser quantity as much liquor as does violence to the sides of the canals in stretching or so little as the sides cannot contract to both occasion diseases     the motion of the fluid in the nerves will not only then be constant but it will also be equal or nearly so for though the blood in the larger arteries is moved unequally by the unequal forces the contraction of the ventricle of the heart and the weaker power the systole of the arteries yet the difference between these two moving powers comes to be less and less perceptible as the arteries divide into smaller branches because of the numerous resistances the liquors meet with and because the canals they move in become larger till in the very small arterious branches there is no difference in the velocity of the liquors from the effect of the heart or artery the motion of the fluids must still be more equal in the excretories of glands and particularly in those where the vessels have divided into very minute branches so that the nervous fluid will move constantly equally and slowly for ordinary but this natural course may be altered by the influence of the mind or by the pressure of some neighboring active organ     we have perhaps no idea of the manner how mind and body act upon each other but if we allow that the one is affected by the other and that the fluid of the nerves whatever name people please to give t is a principal instrument which the mind makes use of to influence the actions of the body or to inform itself of the impressions made on the body we must allow that the mind can direct this instrument differently particularly as to quantity and celerity   0 let us now suppose the nervous fluid such as has been argued for to wit an extreme fluid saponaceous water moving in a constant equal slow stream from the encephalon and medulla spinalis in each of the proper nervous fibers except when the motion is changed by some accessory cause such as the mind pressure of other parts etc and let us examine how well such a supposition will agree with the phenomenon of the three great functions nutrition sensation and muscular motion which the nerves are principal instruments of  in general we may well enough say that nerves can carry fluids to the most minute part of the body to supply what is wasted in any of the solids that the impression made by the objects of the senses on the very soft pulpy extremities of the nerves of the organs of the senses must make such a stop in the equalflowing nervous fluid as must instantaneously be perceptible at the fountainhead from which the pressed pipes come that the constant flow of the liquor of the nerves into the cavities of the muscular fibrillae occasions the natural contraction of muscles by the constant nisus it makes to increase the transverse diameter and to shorten the longitudinal diameter of each fiber and that it is only to allow the mind a power of pouring a greater quantity of this same fluid with a greater velocity into what muscular fibers it pleases to account for the voluntary strong action of muscles     but since such a superficial account would not be satisfactory it will be expected that the principal phenomenon of these three functions are to be explained by the means of such a fluid as has been supposed and that the several objections against this doctrine should be answered let us attempt this and where we cannot extricate ourselves from difficulties which may be thrown in let us boldly acknowledge ignorance     a if water with a very small proportion of oils and salts from the earth proves a fit nourishment for vegetables such a liquor as the fluid of the nerves has been described     may not be unfit for repairing the waste in animals  b the slow constant motion of this nervous fluid        to the most minute parts of the body    is well enough calculated to supply the particles that are constantly carried away from the solids by the vis vitae circulation of the liquors and necessary actions of life  g the greater proportional size of the encephalon the great fountain of this nutritious liquor of the nerves in creatures the younger they are seems very well calculated for their greater proportional growth at that time of life  d a palsy and atrophy of the members generally accompanying each other show that nourishment sensation and motion do depend on the same cause  e it was said     that the nerves were principal instrumnts in nutrition it was not affirmed that they were the sole instruments and therefore an atrophy may proceed from the compression or other lesion of an artery without being an objection to the doctrine here laid down     a all objects of our senses act by impulse when they are applied to their proper organs tangible objects evidently press on the surface of our bodies odorous particles need the assistance of air moved rapidly to affect our nose sapid substances often are not sufficient to give us any idea of their taste by their own weight but need the assistance of the pressure of the tongue upon the palate the rays of light collected into a focus drive light bodies before them sound communicates a vibration to all bodies in harmonic proportion with it the impulse made thus by any of these objects on the soft pulpy nerves   0 which are full of liquor will press their sides or extremities and their liquor will be hindered to flow so freely as it did the canals being all full     this resistance must instantaneously affect the whole canals that are pressed and their origins and have the same effect as if the impulse had been made upon the origin itself to illustrate this by a gross comparison let any one push water out of a syringe through a long flexible pipe fixed to the syringe he will be sensible of resistance or a push backwards instantaneously as any other puts his finger on the orifice of the pipe or grips the sides of it this impulse made on the nerves and thus communicated to their origin will vary according to the strength or weakness the quickness or slowness the continuance or speedy removal the uniformity or irregularity the constancy or alteration etc of the application or the objects to the nerves  b whenever the impulse proper to the object is regularly applied with due force to a nerve rightly disposed to be impressed by it and is communicated as just now explained to the sensorium it gives a true and just idea of the object to the mind  c the vaious kinds of impulses which the differn classes of objects make occasion a necsy of having the different organs of the senses variously modified so that the several impulses may be regularly applied to the nerves in each organ or in other words we must have different organs of the senses fitted to the different classes of objects  d as the objects have one common property of impulse so all the organs have most of the properties of the organ of touching in common with the papillae the skin in the nose and tongue this is evident in some operations on the eyes we can also perceive this as we may likewise do in some cases where matter is collected in the internal ear  e these properties common as well in the objects as the organs occasion frequently uncommon effects in the application of an object to an organ proper to another object of sensation for sometimes we have the same idea as if the object had been applied to its own proper organ at other times the object is as it were changed and we have the idea as if the organ had had its own proper object applied to it thus for example light is the proper object to be applied to the eye to give us any idea of colors yet when all light is excluded from the eyes an idea of light and colors may be excited in us by coughing sneezing rubbing or striking the eyeball  a cane vibrating by a stroke but not so as to give any sound perceptible to the ear if it is applied to the teeth it raises a strong idea of sound as will also a little insect crawling in the meatus auditorius  the fingers applied to two rough surfaces rubbing on each other are sensible of the sound they make surgeons of any practice in the cure of fractured bones can bear witness to the truth of this  the fingers dipped in acid and several other acrid liquors have a sensation very like to tasting  smlling and tasting every body knows are subservien and assisting to each other from such examples we have further proof of one genera cause of our sensations to wit impulse from the objects and that any one of the organs would be capable of producing the effect of another if the impulses of the different objects could be regularly appled to each  f if the impulse of an object is applied with due force but irregularly a confused idea of the object is raised distant objects are confused to myopes as very near ones are to presbytae  g if the application of the impulse is regular but the force with which it is applied is too weak our perception of the object is too faint one may whisper so low as not to be heard  h if the application of objects is too violent and there is any danger of the tender organs of our senses being lesed or destroyed the uneasy sensation we call pain is raised whatever the organ thus lesed is the objects of touch affect every organ thus prssure cutting pricking salts pungent oils great heat violent cold etc occasion pain wherever they are applied besides this every particular organ can be affected with pain by the too violent application of its own proper object too much light pains the eyes very loud sound stuns the ears very odorous bodies and too sapid objects hurt the nose and tongue a pretty sure proof this of the objects of our senses all acting and of the organs all being impressed in nearly the same way  i whenever this uneasy sensation pain is thus raised a sort of necessity is as it were imposed upon the mind to endeavor to get free of the injuring cause by either withdrawing the lesed part of the body from it as one retires his hand when his finger is pricked or burnt or the injuring cause is endeavored to be forced from the body as a tenesmus pushes acrid faeces out of the rectum in both these operations a convulsive contractio is immediately made in the lesed part or in the neighborhood of it and if the irritation is very strong or permanent the greater part of the nervous system comes to be affected in that spasmodic or convulsive way  this nisus of the mind to free the body of what is in danger of being very hurtful may serve to explain the phenomenon of a great many diseases when we are acquainted with the distribution of the partcular nerves and from this we can understand the operation of medicines that stimulate and may learn how by exciting a sharp but momentary pain we may free the body of another pain that would be more durable and that by having it thus in our power to determine a flow of the liquor of the nerves to any particular part for the benefit of that part or the relief of any other diseased part we can do considerable service by a right application of the proper medicines  k if a paingiving cause is very violent or long continued it destroys the organs either irrecoverably or puts them so much out of order that they only gradually recover people have been made blind or deaf for al their lives after by the violent effect of ligh on their eyes or sound on their ears and w are frequently exposed to as much light an sound as make us unfit to see or hear for a considerable time after i would explain this by a ligature put round the tender branch of an herb this ligature drawn to a certain degre may weaken the canals so as to be unfit for the circulation of the juices a good while till they are gradually explicated and made firm by these juices a stricter ligature would disorder the structure of the fibers so much that the liquors could not recover them the analogy is so plain it needs no commentary       in applying the fluid of the nerves to the action of muscles it was said that natural or involuntary contraction of muscles was the nisus which the nervous fluid flowing constantly into the muscular fibers makes to distend these fibrils by enlarging their transverse diameters and shortning their axes and that voluntary contraction was owing to a greater quantity of that nervous liquor determined toward the muscle to be put in action and poured with a greater momentum into the muscular fibrils by the power of the mind willing to make such a muscle to act    it has been objected to this account of muscular motion that if it was true the volume of a muscle in contraction necessarily would be considerably increased by so much liquor poured into its fibrils whereas it does not appear by any experiment that the volume of a muscle is increased by its being put into action    to ths it has been answered that the paces between the muscular fibers are suficint to llow the fibrils swelling during the contraction of a muscle to lodge in without any addition to the bulk of the muscle and that it plainly appears that these spaces between the fibrils are thus occupied by the compression which the larger vessels of mscles which run in those spaces suffer during the action of a muscle it is so great that the muscle becomes ple by contractng    another objection to the action of muscls being owing to the influx of a fluid into their fibrils is that muscular fibers are distractile or capable or being stretched and therefore when a fluid is poured into their hollow fibrils they would be stretched longitudinally as well as have their transverse diameters increasd that is a muscle would become longer as well as thicker when it is put in action whereas it is known to every body that a muscle is shortened when acting    in answer to this it has been remarked that though muscular fibrils are distractile yet they will not yield to or be stretched by every force however little that might be applied to them a cord that can be stretched in length by the weight of a pound or two might not yield in the least to an ounce or two and it must likewise be observed that gradually as any body is stretched its resistance to the stretching force increases a rope may be stretched to a certain length by a pound weight appended to it which would require two pounds to stretch it very little further and therefore the general observation of animal fibers being distractile cannot be a reasonable objection to the account of muscular motion abovementoned unless a proof is brought that the force which the liquid of the nerves must exert upon each fiber of a muscle in order to make a muscle act is capable of distracting or stretching the fibers which has not yet been attempted to be proved    if muscular motion depends on the influx of the nervous liquid the instantaneous contraction of a muscle when the mind wills to make it act will easily be understood from the nerves being always full of their liquor        if either the nerves of any muscle do not furnish a sufficient quantity of their liquor or if the fibers of a muscle become too easily distractile such a muscle will be unactive or paralytick    if too great a quantity of the liquor of the nerves is determined to a muscle or muscles by any cause which the mind cannot command such muscle or muscles will be convulsed    if the motion of the liquid of the nerves is not uniform but by disease becomes irregular an alternate relaxation and contraction of muscles may be the consequence hence trembling palsies chorea sancti viti etc   0 though the nerves may not furnish as much liquor as may be sufficient to make muscles contract with strength enough to overcome the resistances to their action yet there may be enough of liquor in the nerves to allow the impressions of objects to be conveyed to the sensorium this may be one cause of a members being sometimes sensible after it cannot be moved     unless the liquor of the nerves acquires some energy in the brain which we have no reason to think the circulation of the fluids in the vessels can give it or unless it has properties other than what we can discover in it or unless there is an active agent determining its momentum toward some particular parts which we are not conscious of if some of these dont obtain the action of the heart continuing of equal force to propel our liquors notwithstanding all the resistances that are to it is not to be explained     all muscles but especially the heart will continue to contract in an irregular way after they are cut away from the animal to whom they belonged which may be owing to the liquors continuing to flow in the small vessels and being poured irregularly into the muscular fibrillae     after the heart or any other muscle cut away from an animal has ceased to contract its contraction may again be restored by blowing ones warm breath upon it or pricking it with any sharp instrument that heat or prickng should by their stimulus      occasion contraction in a living creature may be understood but how they should have the same effect in a muscle separated from an animal i know not  n b number          are as inexplcable upon any other supposition yet made concerning muscular motion     i know no experiment or observations by which any thing can be proved or from which any thing can be reasonably inferr conerning the uses of the ganglions of th nerves and therefore pretend to gve no account of them  of the particular nerves there are generally said to be forty pair of nerves in all of which ten come out from the encephalon and the other thirty have their origin from the medulla spinalis  of the ten pair of nerves that are generally said to come from the encephalon the first is the olfactory which long had the name of the mammillary processes of the brain because in the brutes which were most commonly dissected their form has some resemblance to a nipple for they are large where they begin to go out from the brain and taper a little as they go forwards to the cribriform part of the ethmoid bone and because in these animals they are evidently continuations or productions of the two anterior ventricles of the brain being hollow and containing lymph the ancients believed that these nerves served to convey the superfluous mucus from the cold moist brain to be evacuated by the holes of the cribriform bone into the nose but in man these nerves are small long and without any cavity having their origin from the corpora striata near the part where the internal carotid arteries are about to send off their branches to the different parts of the brain and in their course under the anerior lobes of the brain which have a depression made for lodging them the human olfactory nerves become larger till they ome to the cribriform bone where they split unto a great number of small filaments to pass through the little holes in that bone and then each being joined by a franch of the fifth pair of nerves is spread on the membrane of the nose  the tender structure and sudden expansion of these nerves on such a large surface render it impossible to trace them far which has made some authors deny them to be nerves but when we break the circumference of the cribriform lamella and then gently raise it we may see the distribution of the nerves some way on the membrane of the nose  the contrivance of defending these long soft nerves from being too much pressed by the anterior lobes of the brain under which they lie is singular because they have not only the prominent orbitar processes of the frontal bone and the crista galli of the ethmoid bone to support the brain on each side with the falx by means of the veins going into the longitudinal sinus and other attachments bearing it up in the middle but have a groove formed in each lobe of the brain itself for them to lodge in their splitting into so many small branches before they enter the bones of the skull is likewise peculiar to them for generally the nerves come from the brain in disgregated filaments and unite into cords as they are going out at the holes of the bones but we shall find that this contrivance is the best for answering the purpose they are designed for of being the organ of smelling for had they been expanded upon the membrane of the nose into a medullary web such as the optic nerve forms it would have been too sensible to bear the impressions of such objects as are applied to it and a distribution in the more common way of a cord sending off branches would not have been equal enough for such an organ of sensation  the   d pair of nerves are the optic which rise each from the thalami nervorum opticorum and then after making a large curve outward run obliquely inwards and forwards till they unite at the forepart of the sella turcica and then dividing again each runs obliquely forwards and outward to go out at its proper hole in the sphenoid bone accompanied with the proper ocular artery to run afterward to the globe of the eye within which each is extended into a very fine cuplike web that lines all the inside of the eye as far forwards as the ciliary circle and is universally known by the name of retina  though the substance of these two nerves seems to be blended at the place where they are joined yet observations of people whose optic nerves were not joined at all and of others who have been blind of one eye from a fault in the optic nerve or in those who have had one of their eyes taken out make it appear that there is no such intimate union of substance the optic nerve of the affected side only being wsted while the other was large and plump and the same observations are contradictory to the doctrine of a decussation of all the nerves    for the disease could be traced from the affected eye to the origin of the nerve on the same side in many fishes indeed the doctrine of decussation is favored for their optic nerves plainly cross each other without any union at the part where they are joined in men and most quadrupeds  those people whose optic nerves were not joined having neither seen objects double nor turned their eyes different ways is also a plain proof that the conjunction of the optic nerves will not serve to account for either the uniform motions of our eyes or our seeing objects single with two eyes  the retina of a recent eye without any preparation appears a very fine web with some blood vessels coming from its center to be distributed on it but after a good injection of the arteries that run in the substance of this nerve as is common to other nerves it is with difficulty that we can observe its nervous medullary substance as these vessels are placed in the centrical part of the optic nerve and there are not medullary fibers here where it enters the ball of the eye this may be one reason why we do not see such bodies or parts of bodies whose picture formed on the bottom of our eye falls on this centrical part of the retina an inflammation in those arteries of the retina which an opthalmia is generally attended with may very well account for that tenderness in the eyes and inability to bear the light which people have in that disease the overdistension of these vessels may likewise serve to account for the black spots observed on bright colored bodies especially and that smoaky fog through which all objects are seen by people in some fevers if those vessels lose their tone and remain preternaturaly distended no objects may affect our retina though the eye externally appears sound or this may be one cause of an amaurosis or gutta serena  the third pair rise from the anterior part of the processus annularis and piercing the dura matter a little before and to a side of the lateral extremties of the posterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone run along the receptacula or cavernous sinuses at the side of the ephippium to get out at the foramina lacera to be distributed to the globe of the eye to the musculus rectus of the palpebra and to the attollens adductor deprimens and obliquus minor muscles of the eyeball these muscles being principal instruments in the motions of the eyelid and eyeball the nerve has therefore got the name of the motor oculi i have frequently observed in convulsions the eyelids widely opened the cornea turned up and outward and the eye balls sunk in the orbit which well described the conjunct action of the muscles which this pair of nerves serves possibly the distension of a consierable branch of the carotid which passes over this nerve near its origin on each side may be the reason of that heaviness in the eyelids and eyes after drinking hard or eating much  the fourth pair which are the smallest nerves of any derive their origin from the posterior base of the testes and then making a long course on the side of the annular protuberance enter the dura matter a little farther back and outward than the third pair to run also along the receptacula to pass out at the foramina lacera and to be entirely spent on the musculi trochleares or superior oblique muscles of the eyes the rotatory motions and the advancement of the eye balls forward by which motions several of our passions are expressed principally depending on these muscles the nerves that serve them have got the name of pathetici  the fifth pair are large nerves rising from the annular process where the medullary processes of the cerebellum join in the formation of that tuber to enter the dura matter near the point of the petrous process of the temporal bones and then plunging into the receptacula at the side of the sella turcica each becomes in appearance thicker and goes out of the skull in three great branches  the first branch of the  th is the ophthalmick which runs through the foramen lacerum to the orbit having in its passage thither a connection with the  th pair it is afterward distributed to the ball of the eye with the  d to the nose along with the olfactory which the branch of the  th that passes through the orbiter internus hole joins in the manner already mentioned in the description of the first pair this ophthalmic branch likewise supplies the glandula lacrymalis fat membranes muscles and the teguments of the eyelids its longest farthest extended branch passing through the foramen superciliare of the os frontis to be distributed to the forehead  the small fibers which this first branch of the  th and the third pair of nerves send to the eyeball being situated on the optic nerve and after piercing the sclerotick coat running on the choroid coat on the outside of the retina in their course to the uvea or iris may possibly be a reason why there is such a sympathy between the optic nerve and the uvea that the uvea contracts to lessen the pupil and exclude too numerous rays of light and this with the sympathy which must arise from some of the nerves of the membrane of the nostrils being derived from this first branch of the  th pair of nerves may also be the cause why a strong irritation of too strong light upon the retina may produce the same effect sneezing as when any tickling substance is applied to the membrane of the nose in the megrim all the branches of this nerve discover themselves to be affected for the forehead is racked with pain the eyeball is pained and feels as if it was squeezed the eyelids shut convulsively the tears trickle down and an uneasy heat is felt in the nose hence we can understand where external medicines will have the best effect when applied to remove this disease to wit to the membrane of the nose and to the forehead hence we can understand why alternate pressure near the superciliary hole of the frontal bone sometimes gives immediate relief in the megrim  the second branch of the  th pair of nerves may be called maxillaris superior from its serving principally the parts of the upper jaw it goes out at the round hole of the sphenoid bone and sends immediately one branch in the channel on the pop of the antrum maxillare the membrane of which and the superior teeth are supplied by it in its passage as it is about to go out t the orbiter externus hole it sends a nerve through the substance of the os maxillare to come out at stenos duct to be distributed to the anterior part of the palate and what remains of it escaping at the orbiter externus hole divides into a great many branches that supply the cheek upper lip and nostril the next considerable branch of the superior maxillary nerve is sent into the nose by the hole common to the palate and sphenoidal bone and the remaining part of this nerve runs in the palatomaxillaris canal giving off branches to the temples and pterygoid muscles and comes at last into the palate to be lost hence the ach in the teeth of the upper jaw occasions a gnawing pain deep seated in the bones of the face with a swelling in the eyelids cheek nose and upper lip and on the other hand an inflammation in these parts is often attended with sharp pain in the teeth hence an obstruction in the duct of the maxillary sinus which obliges the liquor secreted there to find out a preternatural rout for itself as i have seen more than once may be occasioned by the pain of the teeth  the third or maxillaris inferior branch of the fifth pair going out at the oval hole of the sphenoid bone serves the muscles of the lower jaw and the muscles situated between the os hyoides and jaw all the salivary glands the amygdalae and the external ear have branches from it it has a large branch lost in the tongue and sends another through the canal in the substance of the lower jaw to serve all the teeth there and to come out at the hole in the anterior part of the jaw to be lost in the chin and underliphence a convulsive contraction of the muscles of the lower jaw or the mouths being involuntarly shut a great flow of spittle or salivation a pain in the ear especially in deglutition and a swelling all about the throat are natural consequences of a violent irritation of the nerves of the lower teeth in the toothache and pain in the teeth and ear is as natural a consequence of an angina hence alternate pressure on the chin may sometimes relieve the violence of a toothache hence destroying the nerves of a tooth by actual or potential cauteries or pulling a carious tooth so often removes immeditely all these symptoms hence no cure is to be found for some ulcers in the upper or lower jaw but by drawing a tooth  the sixth pair which is the smallest except the fourth rises from the forepart of the corpora pyramidalia and entering the dura matter some way behind the extremities of the posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone have a long course below that membrane and within the receptacula at the side of the sella turcica to go out at the foramina lacera into the orbit tolbe lost in the abductormuscle of the eye in this passage each of them lies very contiguous to the internal carotid artery and to the ophthalmick branch of the fifth pair of nerves at the same place where they are contiguous to the carotid a nerve eer acording to the general description of anatoists go from each of them n an uncomon wy that is the angle is obtse beyond ere  rises to descend with the artery and to form the beginning of the intercostal nerve or according to other authors this nerve comes up from the great ganglion of the intercostal to be joined to the sixth here  the arguments for this latter opinion are that according to the common opinion this beginning of the intercostal nerve as it is called would rise in a manner not so ordinary in nerves in the next place it is observed that the sixth pair is larger nearer to the orbit than it is before it comes to the place where this nerve is said to go off and therefore it is more probable that it receives an addition there rather than gives off a branch lastly it is found that upon cutting the intercostal nerves of living animals the eyes plainly were affected they lost their bright water the gum or gore as we call it was separated in greater quantity the pupil was more contracted the cartilaginous membrane at the internal canthus came more over the eye and the eyeball itself was diminished  to this it is answered in defense of the more common doctrine that other branches of nerves go off in a reflected way as well as this does supposing it to be the beginning of the intercostal and that the reflection would rather be greater if it is thought to come up from the intercostal to the sixth   dly tha nerves enlarge sometimes where there is no addition made to them as in the instance already mentioned of the trunk of the fifth pa while below the dura matter   dly that the experiments on living animals show indeed that the eyes are affected upon cutting the intercostal nerve but not in the way mig have been expected if the intercostal furnishes such a shareof the nerve that goes to the abductor muscle of the eye for it might have been thought that this muscle would have been so much weakened immediately upon cutting the intercostal as its antagonist the adductor would have greatly prevailed over it and have turned the eye strongly in toward the nose which is not said to be a consequence of this experiment so that the arguments are still equivocal and more observations and experiments must be made before it can be determined with certainty whether the sixth pair gives or receives a branch here in the mean time i shall continue to speak about the origin of the intercostal with the common herd of anatomists  at this same place where the intercostal begins the fifth pair is contiguous and adherent to the sixth and it is generally said that the ophthalmic branch of the fifth gives a branch or two to the beginning of the intercostal or receives such from it others deny any such communication between them and those who affirm the communication confess that in some subjects they could not see it after examining the nerves here in a great many subjects i cannot determine whether or not there are nervous filaments going from the one to the other sometimes i thought i traced them evidently at other times i observed what i dissected for nervous filaments to be no other than collapsed cellular substance and in all the subjects where i had pushed an injection successfully into the very small arteries i could only observe a plexus of vessels connecting the one to the other in any of these ways however there is as much connection as we are assured from many experiments and observations on other nerves is sufficient to make a very great sympathy among the nerves here possibly the appearances in the eyes of dogs whose intercostal nerves were cut might be owing to this sympathy  the seventh pair comes out from the lateral part of the annular process behind where the medullary processes of the cerebellum are joined to that tuber and being accompanied with a larger artery than most other nerves enters the internal meatus auditorius where soon the two great pacquets of fibrs of which it appeared to consist within the skull separate from each other one of them enters by several small holes into the vestible cochlea and semicircular canals is stretched on this inner camera of the ear in a very soft pulpy substance and being never seen in the form of a firm cord such as the other packet of this nerve and most other nerves become is called portio mollis of the auditory nerve  the other part of this seventh pair passes through galens foramen caecum or fallopiuss aqueduct in its crooked passage by the side of the tympanum in which passage a nerve sent from the lingual branch of the inferior maxillary nerve along the outside of the tuba eustachiana and cross the cavity of the tympanum where it has the name of chorda tympa s commonly said to be joined to it the very acute angle which this nerve makes with the fifth or the sudden violent reflection it would suffer on the supposition of its coming from the fifth to the seventh whereas supposing its course from the seventh to the fifth its course would be more in the ordinary way has made some say that this chorda tympani should be esteemed a branch of the seventh pair going to join the fifth this same smaller packet of the seventh gives branches to the muscles of the malleus and to the dura matter while it passes through the bony crooked canal and at last comes out in a firm cord named portio dura at the extremity of this canal between the styloid and mastoid processes of the temporal bone giving immediately filaments to the little oblique muscles of the head and to those that rise from the styloid process it then pierces through the parotid gland and divides into a great many branches which are dispersed in the muscles and teguments that cover all the side of the superior part of the neck the whole face and cranium as far back as the temples including a considerable part of the external ear its branches having thus a considerable connection with all the three branches of the fifth pair and with the second cervical occasions a considerable sympathy of these nerves with it hence in the toothache the pain is sometimes very little in the affected tooth compared to what it is all along the side of the head and in the ear hence probably the relief of the toothache by blisters applied behind the ear or by a hot iron touching the antihelix of the ear by this communication or connection possibly too it is that a vibrating string held between ones teeth gives him a strong idea of its sound which no other can hear perhaps too the distribution of this nerve occasions the head to be so quickly turned upon the impression of sound on our ears  the eighth pair of nerves rise from the lateral base of the corpora olivaria in disgregated fibers and as they are entering the anterior internal part of the hole common to the os occipitis and temporum each is joined by a nerve which ascends within the dura matter from the  0th of the head the first and second cervical and sometimes from inferior nerves this every body knows has the name of the nervus accessorius when the two get out of the skull the accessorius separates from the eighth and descending obliquely outward passes through the sternomastoideus muscle to which it gives branches to be lost in the trapezius and rhomboid muscles of the scapula in this course it is generally more or less joined by the second cervical nerve  the large eighth pair soon after its exit gives nerves to the tongue larynx pharynx and ganglion of the intercostal nerve and being disjoined from the  th and intercostal to which it adheres closely some way runs straight down the neck behind the internal jugular vein and at the interior side of the internal carotid artery as it is about to enter the thorax a large nerve goes off from the eighth of each side this branch of the right side turns round from the anterior to the posterior part of the subclavian artery while the branch of the left side turns round the great curve of the aorta both of them mounting up again at the side of the o esophagus to which they give branches are lost at last in the larynx these are called the recurrent nerves which we are desired to shun in the operation of bronchotomy though their deep situation protects them sufficiently the muscles of the larynx being in a good measure supplied with nerves from the recurrents it is to be expected that the cutting of them will greatly weaken the voice though it will not be entirely lost so long as the superior branches of the eighth pair are entire  at or near the place where the recurrent nerves go off from the eighth pair or frequently from the recurrents themselves nerves go off to the pericardium and to join with the branches of the intercostal that are distributed to the heart  after these branches are sent off the parvagum on each side descends behind the great branch of the trachea and gives numerous filaments to the lungs in going to the o eophagus the one of the left side running on the forepart of the o esophagus communicates by several branches with the right one in its descent to be distributed to the stomach the right one gets behind the o esophagus where it splits and rejoins several times before it arrives at the stomach to which t sends nerves and then being joined by a branch from the left trunk they run toward the caeliac artery there to join into the great semilunar ganglion formed by the two intercostals  from the distribution of this par vagum we may learn how tickling the fauces with a feather or any such substance excites a nausea and inclination to vomit why coughing occasions vomiting or vomiting raises a cough hence we see how the nervous asthma and the tussis convulsiva kinkcough are attended with a straitning of the glottis how food ill to digest brings on the asthma on weakly people and why emetics have frequently cured the asthma very speedily how the superior orifice of the stomach is so sensible as to be looked on as the seat of the soul by some how people subject to distensions of the stomach have so often the sensations of balls in their breast or throats why the globus hystericus is so often attended with a violent strangulation at the glottis the sympathy among the branches of these nerves will lead us to understand these and several other phenomenon  the ninth pair of nerves comes from the inferior part of the corpora pyramidalia to go out of the skull at their proper holes of the occipital bones after their egress they adhere for some way firmly to the  th and intercostal and then sending a branch that in many subjects is joined with branches of the first and second cervical nerves to be distributed to the thyroid gland and muscles on the forepart of the trachea arteria the  th is lost in the muscles and substance of the tongue some have thought this nerve and others have esteemed the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves to be the proper gustatory nerve i know no observations or experiments to prove either opinion or to determine that both the nerves may not serve for tasting and for the motion of the tongue  the tenth pair rises from the sides of the medulla spinalis to go out between the os occipitis and first vertebra of the neck after each of them gives a branch to the great ganglion of the intercostal nerve they are distributed to the oblique muscles and to some of the extensors of the head whether the name of the tenth of the head or of the first vertebral ought to be given to this nerve is of no such consequence as to deserve a debate  in the description of the sixth pair i said that i would use the way of speaking which most anatomists have to wit i would say that the beginning of the intercostal nerve comes out of the skull and therefore shall here subjoin a cursory description of this nerve to those of the head notwithstandng its much larger part is composed of nerves coming out from the medulla spinalis there is no greater incongruity in point of method to say that a nerve one is describing receives additions from nerves that have not been described than it is to repeat in the description of a great many nerves that each of them gives branches to form a nerve which we are ignorant of which is all the difference between describing the intercostal before or after the spinal nerves  the branch reflected from the sixth pair joined possibly by some filaments of the ophthalmic branch of the fifth runs along with the internal carotid through the crooked canal formed for this artery in the temporal bone where the little nerve is very soft and pappy and in several subjects divides and unites again before it comes out of the skull as soon as the nerve escapes out of this bony canal it is connected a little way with the eighth and ninth then separating from them after seeming to receive additional nerves from them it forms a large ganglion into which branches from the tenth of the head and from the first and second cervical enter from this ganglion the nerves come out again small to run down the neck along with the carotid artery communicating by branches with the cervical nerves and giving nerves to the muscles that bend the head and neck as the intercostal is about to enter the thorax it forms another ganglion from which nerves are sent to the trachea and to the heart these designed for the heart joining with the branches of the eighth and passing between the two great arteries and the auricles to the substance of that muscle the intercostal after this being composed of two branches one going behind and the other running over the anterior part of the subclavian artery forms a new ganglion where the two branches unite below that artery and then descending along the sides of the vertebrae of the thorax receives branches from each of the dorsal nerves which branches appearing to come out between the ribs have given the name of intercostal to the whole nerve where the addition is made to it from the fifth dorsal nerve a branch goes off obliquely forwards which being joined by other such branches from the sixth seventh eighth and ninth darsal an anterior trunk is formed that passes between the fibers of the appendix musculosa of the diaphragm to form along with the other intercostal and the branches of the eighth pair a large semilunar ganglion situated betwn the caeliac and superior mesenteric arteries the roots of which are as it were involved in a sort of nervous network of this ganglion from which a great number of very small nervous threads run out to be extended on the surface of all the branches of these two arteries so as to be easily seen when any of the arteries are stretched but not to be dissected off from them and thus the liver gallbladder duodenum pancreas spleen jejunum ilium and a large share of the colon have their nerves sent from this great solar ganglion or plexus  several fibers of this ganglion running down upon the aorta meet with other nerves sent from the posterior trunk of the intercostal which continues its course along the sides of the vertebrae they supply the glandulae renales kidneys and testes in men or ovaria in women and then they form a network upon the inferior mesenteric artery where the nerves of the two sides meet and accompany the branches of this artery to the part of the colon that lies in the left side or the belly and to the rectum as far down as the lower part of the pelvis  the intercostal continuing down by the side of the vertebrae of the loins is joined by nerves coming from between these verebrae and sends nerves to the organs of generation and others in the pelvis being even joined with those that are sent to the inferior extremities  the almost universal connection and communication this nerve has with the other nerves of the body may lead us to understand a great many phenomenon where one otherwise would be greatly surprised at the sympathy to be observed among the parts of the body one who knows the course of this nerve will readily understand why a stone in the kidneys or ureters or any other cause irritating those organs should so much more frequently bring on vomiting and other disorders of the stomach than the stone or any other stimulating cause in the bladder does the obstructions of the menses will hence appear capable of occasioning strangulations belching colicks stomachaches and even convulsions in the extremities may be owing to such obstructions or to any violent irritations of the stomach or guts with a view to these communications i have frequently applied vesicatories from the ears to the clavicles of children laboring under the tussis convulsiva with observable good success  the spinal nerves rise generally by a number of disgregated fibers from both the anterior and posterior part of the medulla spinalis and soon after form a little knot or ganglion where they get on their firm coats and are extended into firm cords they are distinguished by numbers according to the vertebrae from between which they come out the superior of the two bones forming the hole through which they pass being the one from which the number is applied to each nerve there are generally said to be thirty pair of them seven of which come out between the vertebrae of the neck twelve between those of the back five from the loins and six from the os sacrum  the first cervical pair of nerves comes out between the first and second vertebrae of the neck and having given branches to join with the tenth pair of the head the second cervical and intercostal and to serve the muscles that bend the neck it sends its largest branches backwards to the extensor muscles of the head and neck some of which piercing through these muscles run up on the occiput to be lost in the teguments there and many fibers of it advance so far forward as to be connected with the fibrillae of the first branch of the fifth pair of the head and of the portio dura of the auditory nerve hence possibly it is that a clavus hystericus shall suddenly change from the forehead to a violent pain and spasm in the backpart of the head and neck  the second cervical is soon joined by some branches to the ninth of the head and intercostal and to the first and third of the neck then has a large branch that comes out at the exterior edge of the sternomastoideus muscle where it joins with the accessorius of the eighth pair and then is distributed to the platysma myoides teguments of the side of the neck and head parotid gland and external ear being connected to the portio dura of the auditory nerve and to the first cervial the remainder of this second cervial  spent on the levator scapulae and the extensors of the neck and head generally a large branch is here sent off to join the accessorius of the eighth pair near the superior angle of the scapula  to the irritation of the branches of this nerve it probably is that in an inflammation of the parotid gland the neck is pained as far down as the clavicle the head is drawn toward the shoulder of the affected side and the chin is turned to the other side in opening the external jugularvein no operator can promise not to touch some of the cutaneous branches of this nerve with the edge of the lancet which occasions a sharp pricking pain in the mean time and a numness of the skin near the orifice for some time after  the third pair of the neck passes out between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae having immediately a communication with the second and sending down a branch which being joined by a branch from the fourth cervical forms the phrenic nerve this desceding enters the thorax between the subclavian vein and artery and then being received into a groove formed for it in the pericardium it has its course along this capsula of the heart till it is lost in the middle part of the diaphragm the right phrenic has a pretty straight course but the left one is obliged to make a considerable turn outward to go over the prominent part of the pericardium where the point of the heart i lodged hence in violent palpitations of the heart a pungent acute pain is felt near the left orifice of the stomach  the other branches of the third cervic nerve are distributed to the muscles and teguments at the inferior part of the neck and top of the shoulder no wonder then that an inflammation of the liver or spleen an abscess in the lungs adhering to the diaphragm or any other cause capable of irritating the diaphragm should be attended with a sharp pain in the top of the shoulder as well as wounds ulcers etc of this muscle itself if the irritation of this muscle is very violent it may occasion that convulsive contraction of the diaphragm which is called a hiccough and therefore a hiccough in an inflammation of the liver has been justly declared to be an ill symptom  the irritation of the thoracic nerves so as to produce sneezing may sometimes free the phrenic nerves from any spasm they occasion so that sneezing sometimes takes away the hiccough and a derivation of the fluid of the nerves any other way may do the same thing or the hiccough may also be sometimes cured by a surprise or any other strong application of the mind in thinking or in distinguishing objects  the fourth cervical nerve after sending off that branch which joins with the third to form the phrenic and bestowing twigs on the muscles and glands of the neck runs to the armpit where it meets with the fifth sixth and seventh cervicals and first dorsal that escape in the interstices of the musculi scaleni to come at the armpit where they join separate and rejoin in a way scarce to be rightly expressed in words and after giving several considerable nerves to the muscles and teguments which cover the thorax they divide into several branches to be distributed to all the parts of the superior extremity seven of these branches i shall describe under particular names    cutaneus runs down the forepart of the arm near the skin to which it gives off branches and then divides on the forearm into several nerves which supply the teguments there and on the palm of the hand in opening the cephalic vein of the arm at the ordinary place the same symptoms are produced as i mentioned to be done in opening the external jugularvein and by the like cause to wit the hurting a branch of this cutaneous nerve with the lancet    musculocutaneus or perforans casserii passes through the cracobrachialis muscle and after supplying the biceps flexor cubiti and brachiaeus internus is spent on the teguments on the outside of the forearm and back of the hand    muscularis has a spiral course from the axilla under the os humeri and backward to the external part of that bone supplying by the way the extensor muscles of the forearm to which it runs between the two brachiaei muscles to be chiefly bestowed on the muscles that extend the wrist and fingers some of its branches going likewise to the flexors and others serving the skin on the outside of the forearm the extremity of it descends along the radius to the back of the hand in which and in the back unequal part of the thumb and three large fingers it terminates    ulnaris is extended along the inside of the arm to give nerves to the muscles that extend the forearm and to the teguments of the elbow toward the lower part of the arm it slants a little backward to come at the groove behind the internal condyle of the os humeri through which it runs to the ulna in its course along this bone it serves the neighboring muscles and teguments and as it comes near the wrist it detaches a branch obliquely over the ulna to the back of the hand to be lost in the unequal part of several fingers the larger part of the nerve goes straight forward to the internal side of the os pisiforme of the wrist where it sends off a branch which sinks under the large tendons in the palm to go cross to the other side of the wrist serving the musculi lumbricales and interossei and at last terminating in the short muscles of the thumb and forefinger what remains of the ulnar nerve after supplying the short muscles of the littlefinger divides into three branches whereof two are extended along the sides of the sheath of the tendons of the flexors of the littlefinger to furnish the concave side of that finger and the third branch is disposed in the same way upon the side of the ringfinger next to the little finger  when we lean or press on the internal condyle of the os humeri the numness and prickling we frequently feel point out the course of this nerve i have seen a weakness and atrophy in the parts which i mentioned this nerve to be sent to after a wound in the internal inferior part of the arm    radialis accompanies the humeral artery to the bending of the elbow serving the flexors of the cubit in its way then after giving large nerves to the muscles on the forepart of the forearm it continues its course near to the radius bestowing branches on the circumjacent muscles near the wrist it gives off a nerve which is distributed to the back of the hand and the unequal part of the thumb and several of the fingers the larger part of this nerve passing behind the annular ligament of the wrist gives nerves to the short muscles of the thumb and afterward sends a branch along each side of the sheath of the tendons of the flexors of the thumb forefinger middlefinger and one branch to the side of the ringfinger next to the middle to be lost on the concave side of those fingers  the manner of these nerves of the fingers both from the ulnar and radial going off is that a single branch is sent from the trunk to the side of the thumb and littlefinger farthest from the other fingers and all the rest are supplied by a trunk of a nerve which splits into two some way before it comes as far as the end of the metacarpus to run along the sides of different fingers that are nearest to each other  it might have been observed that in describing the posterior branches of the ulnar and radial nerve i did not mention the particular fingers to the unequal part of which they were distributed my reason for this omission is the uncertainty of their distribution for though sometimes these posterior branches go to the same fingers to the concave part of which their anterior branches are sent yet frequently they are distributed otherwise and i ought to observe that the muscular nerve has not always that termination in the back of the hand which i mentioned    articularis sinks downwards at the axilla to get below the neck of the superior head of the os humeri and to mount again at the backpart of it so that it almost surrounds the articulation and is distributed to the muscles that draw the arm back and raise it up    scapularis runs straight to the cavitas semilunata of the upper costa of the scapula which is made a hole in the recent subject a ligament being extended from one angle of the bone to the other giving nerves in its way to the muscles of the scapula when it has passed this hole it supplies the supraspinatus muscle and then descending at the anterior root of the spine of the scapula it is lost in the other muscles that lie on the dorsum of the scapula  the situation of these brachial nerves in the axilla may let us see how a weakness and atrophy may be brought on the arms by long continued pressure of crutches or such other hard substances on this part and the course of them from the neck to the arm may teach us how much better effects vesicatories or stimulating nervous medicines would have when applied to the skin covering the transverse processes of the vertebrae or at the axilla than when they are put between the shoulders or upon the spinal processes in convulsions or palsies of the superior extremities where a stimulus is required  the twelve dorsal nerves of each side as soon as they escape from between the vertebrae send a branch forward to join the intercostal by which a communication is made among them all and they soon likewise give branches backwards to the muscles that raise the trunk of the body their principal trunk being extended outward to come at the furrow in the lower edge of each rib in which they run toward the anterior part of the thorax between the internal and external intercostal muscles giving off branches in their course to the muscles and teguments of the thorax  the first dorsal has already been said to have this particular in it that it contributes to form the brachial nerves and that the two branches of the intercostal which come down to the thorax form a considerable ganglion with it  the six inferior dorsal nerves give branches to the diaphragm and abdominal muscles  the twelfth joins with the first lumbar and bestows nerves on the musculus quadratus lumborum and iliacus internus  may not the communications of all these nerves be one reason of the parts they serve acting so uniformly and conjunctly in respiration and conspiring together in the convulsive motions of coughing sneezing etc the twitching spasms that happen sometimes in different parts of the muscles of the abdomen by any irritation on the branches of the lower dorsal nerves are in danger of occasioning a mistake in practice by their resemblance to the colic nephritis etc the communications of these lower ones with the intercostals may serve to explain the violent effort of the abdominal muscles in a tenesmus and in childbearing  as the intercostal is so much larger in the thorax than any where else and seems to diminish gradually as it ascends and descends there is some suspicion that the trunk of it is here from which the superior and inferior parts are sent as branches  the five lumbar nerves on each side communicate with the intercostal and with each other and give posterior branches to the loins  the first commuicates with the last dorsal sends branches to the abdominal muscles to the psoas and iliacus and to the teguments and muscles on the anterior part of the thigh while its principal branch joins with other nerves to form the crural nerve  the second lumbar nerve passes through the psoas muscle and is distributed nearly in the same way as the former as is also the third  branches of the first second and third make up one trunk which runs along the anterior part of the pelvis and passing in the notch at the anterior part of the great hole common to the os pubis and ischium is spent on the adductor muscles and the teguments on the inside of the thigh this nerve is called the obturator or posterior crural nerve  by united branches from the first second third and fourth lumbar nerves a nerve is formed that runs along the psoas muscle to escape with the external iliac vessels out of the abdomen below the tendinous arcade of the external oblique muscle this nerve which is named the anterior crural is distributed principally to the muscles and teguments on the anterior part of the thigh a branch however of this nerve runs down the inside of the leg to the superior part of the foot keeping near to the vena saphaena in opening of which with a lancet at the ancle the nerve is sometimes hurt and occasions sharp pain at the time of the operation and numness afterward  the remainder of the fourth lumbar and the fifth joins in composing the largest nerve of the body which is soon to be described  whoever attends to the course of these lumbar nerves and of the spermatic vessels and nerves upon the psoas muscle with the oblique passage of the ureter over that muscle will not be surprised that when a stone is passing in this canal or even when it is inflamed the trunk of the body cannot be raised erect without great pain or that the skin of the thigh becomes more insensible and the thigh is drawn forward and that the testicle often is drawn convulsively toward the ring of the abdominal muscles  the six pair of the os sacrum consist each of small posterior branches sent to the hips and of large anterior branches  the first second and third after coming through the three superior holes of the os sacrum join together and with the fourth and fifth of the loins to form the largest nerve by much of the body which is well known by the name of sciatic or ischiatic nerve this after sending large nerves to the different parts of the pelvis and to the external parts of generation and the podex as also to the muscles of the hips passes behind the great tuber of the os ischium and then over the quadrigemini muscles to run down near to the bone of the thigh at its posterior part giving off nerves to the neighboring muscles and teguments some way above the ham where it has the name of the poplitaeus nerve it sends off a large branch that passes over the fibula and sinking in among the muscles on the anterior external part of the leg runs down to the foot to be lost in the superior part of the larger toes supplying the neighboring muscles and teguments every where in its passage the larger branch of the sciatic after giving branches to the muscles and teguments about the ham and knee and sending a large cutaneous nerve down the calf of the leg to be lost at last in the exterior side of the foot and superior part of the lesser toes sinks below the gemellus muscle and distributes nerves to the muscles on the back of the leg among which it continues its course till passing behind the internal malleolus and in the internal hollow of the os calcis it divides into the two plantar nerves the internal of which is distributed to the toes in the same manner as the radial nerve of the hand serves the concave side of the thumb and fingers and the external plantar is divided and distributed to the sole of the foot and toes nearly as the ulnar nerve is in the palm of the hand and in the concave part of the fingers  by applying what was said of the nerves in general to the particular distribution of the nerves of the inferior extremities we may see how people with fractured legs especially where there are splinters should be so subject to convulsive startings of the fractured member and why upon tying the blood vessels in an amputation of the leg the patients should sometimes complain of violent pain in their toes why such patients should also be troubled with startings or why for a considerable time after the amputation of the diseased limb when the suppuration is well advanced they should complain of pain in the sore which occasioned the amputation  the fourth nerve of the os sacrum which with the two following is much smaller than the three superior soon is lost in the vesica urinaria and intestinum rectum  the fifth comes forward between the extremity of the os sacrum and coccygis to be distributed principally to the levatores any  the sixth advances forward below the broad shoulders of the first bone of the os coccygis and is lost in the sphincter any and teguments covering it  the branches of the four last cervical nerves and of the first dorsal which are bestowed on the superior extremity and the two crurals with the sciatic which are distributed to the inferior extremities are much larger proportionally to the parts they serve than the nerves of the trunk of the body and especially of the viscera are and for a very good reason that in the most common necessary actions of life a sufficient quantity of fluid on which the influence of nerves seems to depend may be supplied to the muscles there which are obliged to perform so frequent and violent contractions the size of the nerves of the inferior extremities seems larger proportionally than in the superior extremities the inferior extremities having the weight of the whole body to sustain and that frequently at a great disadvantage what the effect is of the nerves here being lesed we see daily when people happen by sitting wrong to compress the sciatic nerve they are incapable for some time after to support themselves on the affected extremity and this is still more remakeable in the sciatic or hipgout in which the member is not only weakened but gradually shrivels and wastes  the systole and diastole of the heart and the reciprocal actions of its auricles and ventricles accounted for that the account i am to give of the alternate motions of the heart may be rightly understood it will be necessary to mention the few following propositions on which it depends    all muscles are furnished with bloodvessels and nerves and their action depends on the influx of blood and of the nervous fluid into their muscular fibers therefore whenever muscles are deprived of a sufficient quantity of either one or other of these liquors or of both their action is weakened or ceases the truth of this has been fully proved by the experiments of compressing tying and cutting the nerves or arteries of muscles    all muscles are in a constant state of action as long as blood and nervous fluid are freely supplied to them this seems evident from the continued contraction of the sphincters of the bladder and anus and of muscles whose antagonists are cut asunder or become paralytic  though in these two propositions i have assumed a fluid of the nerves for the probability of which see the arguments in the foregoing treatise yet to avoid a dispute it may be here remarked that the following account of the hearts motions will equally hold good by supposing the nerves to be solid cords acting by elasticity vibration etc if it is only granted that their action is necessary to the contraction of muscles and that compression is capable to hinder that action which experiments plainly show it is    the nerves of the heart pass to it between the two auricles or two arteries and between the auricles and arteries    the coronary arteries which are the only ones that supply the heart rise from the aorta immediately above the middle loose part of the semilunar valves in the same height of the aorta as where the angles of these valves are fixed    the edges of the semilunar valves are duplicated with a muscular corpuscle in the middle and muscular cords running obliquely from that corpuscle to the insertion of the valves into the aorta  these three last propositions are evidently made appear to be true by dissections    before the vessels in which the circulation is performed can act it is necessary to suppose them full of their liquors otherwise the whole vascular system could not be all at once put into action and the motion of the fluids sent out from the heart could not be propagated to that in the returning vessels consequently the circulation would be stopped almost as soon as begun  if then both auricles and ventricles attempt upon the first communication of motion to contract the ventricles being stronger will force their own contraction and hinder the contraction of the auricles which must be in the mean time much dilated by the influx of blood from the veins prop   and at this time the arteries are also distended by the blood thrown out of the ventricles therefore the cardiac nerves lying between them prop   will be compressed and prevented from exerting their office while this happens to the nerves the blood rushing out of the left ventricle into the aorta and thrusting the semilunar valves outward and upwards distends the great artery considerably whereby the valves are stretched and their lunated edges are brought to be straight and as high as their angles consequently these edges thus raised and pressed to the sides of the aorta are made to cover the orifices of the arteriae coronariae which the corpuscles will assist to do more adequately and therefore while they are in this situation no blood can be sent to the substance of the heart if then the nerves do not exert their office and access is denied to the blood this muscle the heart must by prop   become paralytic or unactive  the auricles which were attempting all this time to contract themselves will now when the resistance to them is removed throw the blood they contain into the ventricles and the arteries that were violently distended while the ventricles pushed the blood into them will at this same time when the ventricles cease to act constrict themselves and the valvulae semilunares will by their elasticity assisted by the muscular corpuscles and cords be depressed inwards since then by the constriction of the auricles and arteries the nerves of the ventricles are freed from the compression they suffered while the auricles and arteries were distended and since the blood in the aorta pressed strongly by the contracting sides of this artery and resisted by the liquors which are to be thrown through all its branches is also pushed with great force on the orifice of the left ventricle thrusts back the semilunar valves which stop its entry into that cavity and impetuously rushes into the coronary arteries since then i say the nerves of the heart are again free from compression and the blood is again sent to the heart by its arteries its muscular fibers must again contract by prop   and thus as long as these causes continue to act and cease alternately their effects must be exerted in the same manner that is as long as an animal lives the heart must have an alternate state of contraction called its systole and of relaxation or diastole and the auricles and arteries must be dilated while the ventricles are contracting and the ventricles must be dilated while the auricles and arteries are constricted or their actions must always be reciprocal  the description of the human lacteal sac and duct the receptaculum chyli of pecquet or saccus lacteus of van horn is a membranous somewhat pyriform bag two thirds of an inch long one third of an inch over in its largest part when collasped situated on the first vertebra of the loins to the right of the aorta a little higher than the right emulgent artery behind the right inferior muscle of the diaphragm it is formed by the union of three tubes one from under the aorta the second from the interstice of the aorta and cava the third from under the emulgents of the right side the lacteal sac becoming gradually smaller toward its superior part is contracted into a slender membranous pipe of about a line diameter which is generally named the thoracic duct this passes betwixt the muscular appendices or inferior muscles of the diaphragm on the right of and somewhat behind the aorta then being lodged in the cellular substance behind the pleura it mounts between this artery and the vena azygos as far as the fifth vertebra of the thorax where it is hid by the azygos as this vein rises forwards to join the descending or superior cava after which the duct passes obliquely over to the left side behind the o esophagus aorta descendens and great curvature of the aorta until it reaches the left carotid artery behind which and on the left side of the o esophagus it runs to the interstice of the first and second vertebra of the thorax where it begins to separate from the carotid stretching farther toward the left internal jugular vein by a circular turn whose unequal part is uppermost at the top of this arch it splits into two for a line and a half the superior branch receiving into it a large lymphatic vessel from the cervical glands this lymphatic appears by blowing air and injecting liquors into it to have no valves when the two branches are again united the duct continues its course toward the internal jugular vein behind which it descends and immediately at the left side of the insertion of this vein enters the superior posterior part of the left subclavian vein whose internal membrane duplicated forms a semilunar valve that is unequal externally and covers two thirds of the orifice of the duct immediately below this orifice a cervical vein from the musculi scaleni enters the subclavian  the coats of the sac and duct are thin transparent memoraes from the inside of which in the duct small semilunar valves are produced most commonly in pairs which are so situated as to allow the passage of liquors upwards but oppose their return in an opposite course the number of these is generally ten or twelve  this is the most simple and common course situation and structure of the receptaculum chyli and thoracic duct but having had occasion to observe a variety in these parts of different subjects i shall set down the most remarkable of them  the sac is sometimes situated lower down than in the former description is not always of the same dimensions is not composed of the same number of ducts and frequently appears divided into several small cells instead of being one simple cavity  the diameter of the duct is various in most bodies and is seldom uniform in the same subject but frequently sudden enlargements or sacculi of it are observable the divisions which authors mention of this duct are very uncertain i have seen it divided and one branch climb over the anterior part of the aorta at the eighth vertebra of the thorax and at the fifth slip behind that artery to join the other branch which continued in the ordinary course the precise vertebra where it begins to turn to the left side is also uncertain frequently it does not split at its superior arch in which case a large sac is found near its aperture into the subclavian vein generally it has but one orifice though i have seen two in one body and three in another nay sometimes it divides into two under the curvature of the great artery one goes to the right another to the left subclavian vein and i have found this duct discharging itself entirely into the right subclavian the lymphatic vessel which enters its superior arch is often sent from the thyroid gland  whether is not the situation of the receptaculum chyli so much nearer the muscular appendices of the diaphragm in men than brutes designed to supply the disadvantageous course the chyle must otherwise have in our erect posture  does not the descent of the extremity of the duct to the subclavian vein and the opening of the lymphatic into the top of the arch contribute to the ready admission of the chyle into that v  finis
