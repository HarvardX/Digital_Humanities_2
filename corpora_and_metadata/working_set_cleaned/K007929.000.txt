the rights of great britain asserted against the claims of america being an answer to the declaration of the general congress  london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxvi  an answer to the declaration of the general congress when independent states take up arms they endeavor to impress the world with a favorable opinion of their own cause and to lay the blame of hostilities on the injustice of their opponents but if nations accountable to none for their conduct deem it necessary to reconcile others to their proceedings the necessity is still more urgent with regard to those who breaking through every political duty draw their swords against the state of which they own themselves the subjects the opinions of mankind are invariably opposed to such men their assertions are heard with distrust their arguments weighed with caution and therefore it is as necessary for them to adhere to truth in the former as it is prudent to avoid sophistry in the latter  this consideration however obvious it may appear to others seems to have totally escaped the attention of the body of men who lately sat at philadelphia under the name of the general american congress in a paper published under the title of a declaration by the representatives of the united colonies of north america vide appendix  the facts are either wilfully or ignorantly misrepresented and the arguments deduced from premises that have no foundation in truth but as whatever falls from men who call themselves the representatives of a people must fall with some degree of weight on the minds of the undiscerning part of mankind it becomes in some measure necessary to examine briefly the reasons held forth by the congress to justify the rebellion of their constituents on a subject so trite arguments advanced by other writers may sometimes recur but novelty is less the object of this part of the disquisition than perspicuity and precision  the declaration of the congress begins with an involved period which either contains no meaning or a meaning not founded on the principles of reason they seem to insinuate that no body of men in any empire can exercise an unbounded authority over others an opinion contrary to fact under every form of government no maxim in policy is more universally admitted than that a supreme and uncontrollable power must exist somewhere in every state this ultimate power though justly dreaded and reprobated in the person of one man is the first spring in every political society the great difference between the degrees of freedom in various governments consists merely in the manner of placing this necessary discretionary power in the british empire it is vested where it is most safe in king lords and commons under the collective appellation of the legislature the legislature is another name for the constitution of the state and in fact the state itself the americans still own themselves the subjects of the state but if they refuse obedience to the laws of the legislature they play upon words and are no longer subjects but rebels in vain have they affirmed that they are the subjects of the kings prerogative and not his subjects in his legislative quality as the king with regard to his subjects in general is to be considered only in his executive capacity as the great hereditary magistrate who carries into effect the laws of the legislature the only discretionary and uncontrollable power in a free state  the discretionary and uncontrollable authority of the british legislature being granted their right to tax all the subjects of the british empire can never be denied some illinformed reasoners in politics have lately started an obsolete maxim which has been seized with avidity by the americans that the supreme power cannot take from any one any part of his property without his consent or in other words that representation is inseparable from taxation the colonists say they have no representatives in parliament and therefore parliament has no right to tax the colonists upon this principle scarce one in twentyfive of the people of great britain is represented out of more than seven millions fewer than three hundred thousand have an exclusive right to choose members of parliament and therefore more than three times the number of the americans have an equal right with them to dispute the authority of the legislature to subject them to taxes the truth is representation never accompanied taxation in any state the romans were a free nation yet the senate that is the great body of the nobility possessed the sole right of taxing the people in this kingdom the house of commons have an exclusive right of modifying and regulating the quantity of public supplies and the manner of laying taxes but the commons by their own authority cannot enforce the raising the supplies they vote that privilege is inherent in the supreme and unaccountable power vested in the three branches of the legislature united who are in fact the state as the virtual representatives of the whole empire and not the delegates of individuals  why it has been so generally received as a maxim in this country that taxation and representation are inseparable requires to be explained men little acquainted with the constitution derived the opinion from their finding that it is the indisputable right of the commons that all grants of subsidies and parliamentary aids should originate in their house but though they first bestow those subsidies and aids their grants as has been already observed have no effect without the assent of the other two branches of the legislature the common reason given for this exclusive privilege is that as the supplies are raised upon the body of the people the people only ought to have the right of taxing themselves this argument would have been conclusive if the commons taxed none but those by whose suffrages they obtained their seats in parliament but it has appeared that more than seven millions of people besides the peers who are in possession of so large a share of property in the kingdom have no voice in the election of the members who sit in the lower house the commons therefore and their constituents not being the only persons taxed the former cannot possibly have the only right of raising and modelling the supply from the mere circumstance of representation but if they have it not from representation they must in fact derive it from the supreme and discretionary power which is reposed in them in conjunction with the two other branches of the legislature it appears upon the whole that taxation is the result of that discretionary authority placed in the hands of the legislature and exerted by them for the necessary support of the state to this authority the whole empire must submit and consequently no one of its subjects can claim any exemption  the counties palatine of chester durham and lancaster were anciently in the same predicament with the americans on the article of taxation the earl of chester and the bishop of durham became by prescription and immemorial custom possessed of a kind of regal jurisdiction within their respective territories a similar form of government was established by king edward iii in the county of lancaster which was erected first into an earldom and then into a dukedom in the person of henry plantagenet whose heiress carried the same rights and privileges to john of gant that kings fourth son and his posterity but though the subordinate sovereigns of these counties could pardon treasons murders and felonies though they appointed all judges nominated all justices of the peace and in short possessed exclusively the whole internal government of their several counties their subjects if the expression may be used were always bound by the acts and statutes statutes at large    and    of henry viii c    of an assembly in which they had no representatives they were also liable to all payments rates and subsidies granted by the parliament of england ibid    of charles ii c     those counties it must be confessed like the americans considered their being excluded from having representatives in an assembly by which they were taxed a grievance accordingly the town and county of chester as far back as the thirtyfifth of henry viii petitioned the legislature for the privilege of sending members to parliament and their request was granted by an express statute    and    of henry viii c     the county and city of durham made a similar application and with the same success in the twentyfifth of charles ii    of charles ii c    had the americans instead of flying to arms submitted the same supposed grievance in a peaceable and dutiful manner to the legislature i can perceive no reason why their request should be refused had they like the county and city of chester represented that for lack of knights and burgesses to represent them in the high court of parliament they had been oftentimes touched and grieved with acts and statutes made within the said court derogatory to their most ancient jurisdictions liberties and privileges and prejudicial to their quietness rest and peace this country would i am persuaded have no objection to their being represented in her parliament  but the colonies though that circumstance is only insinuated in the declaration have uniformly affirmed that granting the supremacy of parliament should extend over the whole empire yet that they themselves have a right to an exemption from taxes either by the concessions of the legislature or by charters from the king it seems incompatible with reason say they that the colonies should have internal legislatures of their own possessing the authority of taxation and that notwithstanding the british parliament should retain its power of laying imposts the first of these assertions is not founded in truth the charters give no exemption from taxation on the contrary some of them expressly subject the colonies to the supreme legislature of great britain and had the charters mentioned an exemption the legislature by virtue of its supreme universal and discretionary power can recall any rights they have conferred when the good of the state renders that measure necessary though the king may give away by charter a right that militates against himself as hereditary chief magistrate he cannot authorize by any deed whatever an exemption from the general laws of the state in such a case one of the three branches of the legislature would usurp the power of the three united a solecism as great in polity as it is in mathematics to assirm that a part is greater than the whole  it may be necessary perhaps to make an apology for entering so minutely into the argument in favor of the right of taxation the americans themselves have deserted that ground they speak no longer as subjects they assume the language of rivals and they act as enemies the question between them and great britain for it is no longer between them and government consists of dependence or independence connection or no connection except on the footing of a sovereign state they have already arrogated to themselves all the functions of sovereignty they have formed a great deliberative council they have taken the whole executive power into their own hands they have struck a new currency raised armies appointed generals and that they have not chosen another sovereign must be ascribed more to their republican principles than to any remains of loyalty for their lawful prince  in this situation of affairs and opinions it is matter of little surprise that men who deny the authority of the state should load the legislature with opprobrious epithets the congress accordingly stigmatize parliament with various charges of tyranny violence and oppression passing from this strain of general scurrility they enter into warm encomiums on the ancestors of their constituents but they now deviate as much from truth in their applause as they had done before in their censure they affirm that the ancestors of the colonists obtained the lands which they have transmitted to the present race without any charge to the country from which they removed their very enemies could not wish to meet them on more advantageous ground the sums expended upon the various provinces since their first establishment for their ordinary support government and protection have been so enormous that without the authority of incontestible vouchers they could scarcely obtain

pretend to set the power of this kingdom at defiance lay themselves in the dust at her feet to claim her aid and protection against a single colony did they not complain in the same abject terms with the britons of old that the barbarians drove them into the sea and that the sea drove them back on the barbarians did not great britain like a guardian angel stretch forth her hand to their aid and by expelling their enemies from the continent of america rescue them not only from danger but the very fear of danger did she not over and above the many millions she expended upon the fleets and armies

entered into all their quarrels with their neighbors made their enemies her own and for their sake has she not in some degree subjected herself to an annual tribute to indian savages in whom habitual injuries had raised an irreconcilable hatred to their oppressors did she not too fatally relinquish great advantages on every other side of a successful war to eradicate the very seeds of future contests in america and by giving the colonies unlimited security from abroad procure for them that prosperity at home which has encouraged them like parricides to raise the dagger against her own breast  the congress in the next paragraph of their declaration affect to reprobate the last peace though they have derived so many and so great advantages from that treaty the conduct of the americans ought also to induce this kingdom to regret the stipulations she made for their security had canada remained in the hands of the french the colonies would have remained dutiful subjects their fears for themselves in that case would have supplied the place of their pretended affection for this nation they would have spoken more sparingly of their own resources as they might daily stand in need of our aid their former incapacity of defending themselves would have always recurred to their minds as long as the objects of their former terror should continue so near their borders but their habitual fears from france were it seems removed only to give room to their ingratitude to great britain  the effrontery with which the congress reprobate the late peace is scarcely equal to their folly in applauding the minister who had carried on the war with peculiar inconsistency they affect to commence an era of public ruin from mr pitts resignation in      yet the whole object of their wishes is to be placed on the same footing as in the year      they do not recollect or rather they pretend to forget that the most splendid actions in the war happened after mr pit retired from his office they are ignorant or designedly conceal that the commerce of this kingdom has amazingly increased and in consequence its revenue since the era from which they date public ruin they know or they ought from their own experience to know that notwithstanding their shutting their ports against our manufactures permanent and profitable sources of commerce have been opened in other quarters that instead of being distressed by their present interruption to trade our merchants find themselves incapable of fulfilling their commissions from foreign states that as the surest test of the flourishing condition of commerce the course of exchange to the amount of several per cents is universally in favor of great britain and that as the ultimate and invincible proof of the public prosperity the confidence of the people in the measures of government and their contempt for the rebellious efforts of the refractory colonies the national stocks suffer neither fluctuation nor fall in the price  having represented the pretended ruin brought upon the british empire by the late peace the congress descend to the fictitious grievances of america since the same period they affirm that the colonies were judged to be in such a state as to present victories without bloodshed and all the easy emoluments of statutable plunder this figure of rhetoric if it has any meaning conveys one contrary to the truth the colonists having obtained such amazing advantages by a peace which they now reprobate it was deemed just and proper by mr grenville then at the head of the treasury that they should bear a proportionable share of the national burdens incurred by the war but as their prior inability to bear internal taxes had precluded him from having a precedent he only threw out as it is vulgarly expressed in the beginning of the year      his intentions of raising a revenue in america by a stampduty similar to that established in great britain referring the consideration of the whole affair to the next session his object was to give time to the colonies to propose some other mode of taxation should that suggested to parliament appear either improper or burdensome during the whole of the summer      though some discontented spirits murmured not a single doubt was started against the absolute right of parliament to impose taxes on every member of the british empire the time allowed to the colonies furnished them with no expedient for raising a tax more suitable to the purpose of a revenue which by the bye was to have been spent among themselves and therefore in the beginning of the year      the famous stamp act was passed against a very inconsiderable minority in both houses of parliament  in this kingdom as well as in every state possessed of freedom there are always to be found factious persons who oppose every measure of government in their eagerness to disgrace the minister they too frequently obstruct the service and defeat the interests of their country every side of a speculative point is armed with arguments that may impose on the ignorant and encourage the sanguine the opposition in parliament in short committed themselves too far in favor of the prejudices of the americans with regard to the stamp act to support it with vigor when they themselves very unexpectedly lord rockingham and others in opposition came into office july  0      grenville and his party having thrown themselves out of place on the regency bill  came into office a few months after it had passed into law though their view of the object changed with their elevation they found that the flame which their own factious speeches in the preceding session had raised in america was too vehement to be extinguished without concessions a natural timidity of disposition joined to the common want of firmness which accompanies novelty in office rendered them inclinable to purchase present quiet for themselves at the expense of the future advantage of their country but still they wavered on the point of irresolution till mr pitts oratory weighed down the scale the stamp act was repealed and from that moment may be dated the commencement of what the americans call an era of public ruin  to enter into the motives of mr pitts oratory for the total and absolute repeal of the stamp act would be to desert a great and public subject for the sake of tracing the private views of an ambitious man in his argument if what he advanced deserves the name he fell in with the vulgar and it may be said false maxim that no profit ought to be expected from the colonies but that resulting from their commerce this opinion of mr pit whether it proceeded from ignorance or design and it probably proceeded from both has formed a popular error in former times as well as in the present age many who have pretended to understand perfectly the affairs of this kingdom most firmly but in my opinion very weakly believed that the great secret of our political interest consisted in forcing in a manner a monopoly of foreign commerce it was from this persuasion that the popular orator used upon the occasion just mentioned a figure of rhetoric at once foolish and absurd when he affirmed that the colonists should be prohibited from manufacturing even the hobnail of a horseshoe one might be tempted to ask the orator how this prohibitory mandate could be enforced or if it could whether it is less arbitrary than to demand an internal tax from the americans for the support of their own government and even for the general support of the state and as a suitable return for the protection which they have ever derived from the government of this kingdom  the congress had surely forgot this strange rhetorical figure of the great orator when they were tempted to date public ruin from his resignation in      they have also forgot or they do not choose to remember that he acquiesced in the declaratory bill brought in and passed by the marquis of rockinghams party who were in office in the beginning of the year      this bill expressly declares that all his majestys colonies and plantations in america have been are and of right ought to be subordinate to and dependent upon the imperial crown and parliament of great britain who have full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient validity to bind the colonies and people of america subjects of the crown of great britain in all cases whatsoever  mr pit to preserve some degree of consistency objected to the words in all cases whatsoever but his opposition was so languid that he did not attend the house when the bill was passed and only five peers were found to follow his opinion when it came under debate in the house of lords  the declaratory act as the american congress affirms comprehends all the grievances of which they complain yet that very congress with peculiar effrontery not only approve but even praise the conduct of the very party by whom the bill was introduced and the man by whose criminal acquiescence to use one of his own phrases it passed into a law that party and that man being now in opposition to government the americans endeavor to secure their support by flattering their vanity at the expense of truth they forget past demerits in the hopes of present services but when they expect to deceive a whole party into their interest they themselves are made the tools of that party and like the figure of the negro near temple bar are turned round by the machine which they pretend to move  the congress in a strain of eloquent adulation speaks with raptures of that illustrious band of distinguished peers and commoners who now declaim argue and protest in favor of their own rebellion it has appeared that the act of which they most complain was the manufacture of that very illustrious band encouraged by the negative opposition made by the earl of chatham whose advice the band followed as it soon after appeared to their own political destruction besides was it not under the administration of the earl of chatham in the years      and      though the americans date their misfortunes from the resignation of mr pit in october      that the bills imposing internal duties and consequently establishing internal taxation in america were passed into laws   geo iii chapter     did not the present administration whose measures the congress affect to reprobate throughout repeal all those acts except the duty on tea  0 geo iii  to gratify the prejudices of the americans and if possible to reestablish tranquillity in all the provinces with what color of reason therefore can the americans lay the blame either of their real or pretended grievances on the noblemen and gentlemen now in office and yet approve of the conduct of those very persons who passed the declaratory act and followed it with bills of imposts raised in the colonies  in reprobating the declaratory act the congress recur to their usual maxim that taxation and representation are inseparable though it has been already shown that they are as much represented as twentyfour in twentyfive of the inhabitants of great britain though it has been proved that whole provinces not represented had been for several ages subjected to imposts laid by the legislature though it shall hereafter appear that they themselves have been uniformly taxed by the british parliament this argument they hold forth as invincible and found upon it their present resistance to the supremacy of the parentkingdom in pursuing it injudiciously and too far they actually discover the expediency and even necessity of that supremacy of which they so loudly complain the parliament of great britain say they will certainly perceive that an american revenue if not diverted from the ostensible purposes for which it is raised will actually lighten their own burdens in proportion as they increase ours but is it not equitable is it not just is it not necessary that all the subjects of the empire should bear as equally as possible the public burdens of the empire why should the americans who have so largely so uniformly and so effectually experienced the protection of government be the only persons exempted from paying their share of its expenses is it either reasonable or suitable to the common usage of nations that those who desert their country should enjoy greater privileges than those that remain the americans having been spared during the infancy of their colonies on account of their poverty endeavor to establish into an inherent right what was actually an indulgence  though this indulgence has been a source of error to the more ignorant part of the americans there are surely many among them who know that parliament has been uniformly accustomed to extend its supremacy over all the colonies in matters of revenue in commerce in civil in all judicial regulations and in short with regard to the general constitution of their government the provinces of north america till taught otherwise by a disappointed faction in this kingdom allowed that the whole fabric of their polity might be newmodelled and reformed by the superintending power of parliament in fact it has been so newmodelled and reformed whenever abuses in the administration of their government under their civil polity or the general interest of the british empire made it necessary for parliament to interpose its authority instances of this interposition in both cases present themselves in almost every volume of the statutes from the restoration down to the present reign yet the americans falsely insinuate that it was in the present reign the exercise of the authority of parliament except only in the regulation of trade first commenced  a brief recital of some of those instances may throw light on a subject rendered obscure and perplexed by the prejudices of the ignorant and the arts of designing men to gain the ears of the populace by awakening their ancient jealousies the americans affect to ascribe the present system of measures to principles of toryism which they pretend prevail in our councils but unfortunately for this part of their plan of deception it will appear that most of the acts which bind america in coercive regulations were passed soon after the revolution in the reign of the very prince who brought about that great event the whig ministers of king william perceiving that the colonies even then had entertained views of placing themselves on a ground of independence on parliament advised their sovereign and their advice now stands on record to pursue measures which in their consequence should effectually secure their thorough dependence on the legislature of this kingdom  in consequence of the advice given by a whig ministry to a king who had mounted the throne upon whig principles and also upon the fullest evidence of the frauds and abuses committed in the plantations in violation of the act of navigation the act of the  th and  th of william iii for preventing frauds and regulating abuses in the plantations was passed by that act a power was given to the commissioners of the treasury and customs in england to establish ports and appoint officers in the plantations and those officers to have the same authority for visiting ships and goods and entering houses and warehouses as was exercised by the same officers in england  all penalties and forfeitures were made recoverable in the courts at westminster or in courts of admiralty in the plantations which courts were then for the first time established throughout all america in any action or suit concerning his majestys duties the offense might be laid in any precinct or division of the plantations where the same should be alleged to have been committed at the discretion of the officer or informer all laws bylaws usages and customs repugnant to any laws of great britain which relate to the plantations or mention the same are declared illegal null and void many other restrictions too tedious to be mentioned were at the same time enacted and imposed  but it was not in matters of trade only that parliament during the reign of king william superintended and controuled the colonies the colonists it was found had encouraged pirates in various places and no justice could be obtained in their courts against offenders whom they openly abetted to remedy this shameful abuse a remarkable act was passed in the   th and   th of william iii this act abolished all jurisdiction in that case in the courts in the plantations the sole power of trying such offenses in the colonies was vested in commissioners appointed under the great seal of england or seal of the admiralty according to the course of the admiralty that is to say without jury the commissioners were also empowered to issue warrants in any of the colonies for arresting such pirates or their accessaries they might at discretion either try the criminals in america or send them to england to be tried should the governors of any charter or proprietary government refuse to assist the commissioners should any person in authority in the colonies refuse to pay obedience to the act such refusal in either case was declared to be a forfeiture of the charter  an act passed in the  0th and   th year of the same reign confines the advantage of the fishery of newfoundland to british ships fitted out from great britain the execution of the orders and regulations respecting that fishery was placed in the hands of the admirals in the respective harbors that is to say in the hands of the master of the ship that should first arrive from great britain the decision in all questions of civil suit is vested in such admirals with appeal to the commander of the kings ships all criminal offenses are to be tried in any county of england by the kings commissioners of oyer and terminer and goal delivery  the opinions of this nation concerning the government of the colonies may be collected from the above acts the authority of parliament to bind america in all cases whatsoever and whenever the general interest of the whole empire required it was never disputed and it was often exerted to correct abuses and to suppress the ideas of independence which began even then to be cherished by the colonies the same principles and the same policy were carried down by parliament through the three succeeding reigns of queen anne and of george i and george ii  early in the first of those reigns the grossest abuses were committed by the petty legislatures in the colonies with respect to coin the interposition of parliament became necessary to correct those abuses an act was passed in the  th of queen anne for that purpose when the councils of that princess were guided by whigs by this act the rates of foreign coin in the plantations were ascertained and a severe punishment was inflicted on those who should take them at higher rates the american trade was placed in the same reign under further restrictions by act of parliament rice and molasses were added to the list of enumerated commodities in the reign of george i furrs and copperore of the plantations were subjected to the same restrictions  the british parliament confined not to acts their sense of the undoubted right they possessed of controuling the colonies in all cases whatsoever in the journals of both houses there are many proceedings which furnish proofs of their undeviating adherence to the same principles in the year   0  a bill was brought into the house of commons for abolishing all the charter and proprietary governments in america and reuniting them to the crown in   0  the house of lords came to several resolutions on the subject of laws enacted in several of those governments they declared those laws to be repugnant to the laws of england and destructive to the constitution this proceeding was likewise followed by a bill for abolishing those charters  these bills it must be confessed were not carried into laws but they did not fail through any doubt entertained by the legislature against their propriety they were lost through a change in the situation of those who brought forward the measure that the opinion of the legislature continued the same on this subject is evident as the same proposition was again taken up in the year      when a whig ministry governed the kingdom  in the reign of george ii the instances of the controuling authority of parliament over the colonies are more numerous and striking by an act of the  d of george ii chap    severe prohibitions and penalties are imposed and inflicted on such persons as shall cut and destroy whole pinetrees though such trees are growing within the limits of a township the penalties are directed to be sued for and recovered in the courts of admiralty the merchants of great britain having in the  th of the same reign preferred a petition to parliament complaining of the difficulties they met with in the recovery of debts in the plantations an act was passed which subjected all real estates in the colonies to just debts and demands and to be assets in the same manner as in england for the satisfaction of debts due by bond the exportation of hats from any of the colonies and even the conveyance of them by land from one colony to another is prohibited under severe penalties by an act passed in the same session  in the year      the province of massachusettsbay presented a petition to the house of commons praying that they might be heard by counsel on the subject of grievances the chief of these was that the crown had restrained their governor by instructions in certain cases relative to the issue and disposal of public money and the emission of paperbills of credit the commons having considered the matter came to a resolution that the petition was frivolous and groundless a high insult upon his majestys government and tending to shake off the dependency of the said colony upon this kingdom to which in law and right they ought to be subject complaint having at the same time been made to the house that the representatives of that colony had censured a person for giving evidence before a committee of the house in the case of a bill then depending in parliament it was resolved that the passing such censure was an audacious proceeding and a high violation of the privileges of the house a committee was accordingly appointed to enquire who were the abettors of this unwarrantable proceeding  we may perceive from the above circumstance how jealous parliament have been of their supremacy and uncontrollable authority over the colonies another instance must carry the proof of this position beyond the power of reply in the year    0 the house of commons entered into a consideration of the abuses committed in the colonies in respect to the emission of paper bills of credit after a long examination they came to various resolutions they resolved that the act passed in the  th of queen anne ascertaining the rates of foreign coin in america had not been duly observed that many indirect practices in that respect had been introduced contrary to the true intent of the act that an address should be presented to his majesty to require the governors of his colonies to take effectual measures for the strict observance of the act of the  th of queen anne that another address should be presented requesting his majesty to issue his royal proclamation to settle and ascertain the rates of foreign gold coins that the creating and issuing bills of credit in the british colonies by virtue of acts of assembly had frustrated the design of the act of the  th of queen anne that an humble address of thanks should be presented to his majesty for the orders he has already given on that head and that he should also be requested to require and command the governors of the respective provinces not to give their assent to any act whereby bills of credit might be issued in lieu of money  these spirited resolutions of the commons checked for some time the abuses in the emission and circulation of papermoney the new england government however did not continue long to pay any regard to royal instructions though supported and enforced by the authority of the house of commons the frauds committed awakened again the attention of parliament in the   th of george ii an act was passed to regulate and restrain paperbills of credit in the four new england governments the governors of those colonies were prohibited under pain of being removed from their governments and for ever rendered incapable of any public office or place of trust from assenting to any act order or vote for the issue of any paperbills of credit and all such acts orders or votes were declared to be ipso facto null and void  in the year      the colonies took up the idea of a landbank which had proved so unsuccessful in england in the reign of king william the american assemblies it appeared to parliament had presumed to publish a scheme for supplying a pretended want of a medium in trade for setting up a bank on land security and to solicit subscriptions to correct this evil an act was passed in the   th of george ii to restrain and prevent such unwarrantable practices and to extend to america the penalties inflicted by a statute of the  th of george i on persons guilty of such practices in these kingdoms they were also subjected by the same act to the penalty and forfeiture ordained by the statute of provision and praemunire of the   th of richard the second  there are several other statutes by which parliament with equal force assert their authority over the colonies in some of these they carry this authority beyond the limits with which they have hitherto circumscribed it in this kingdom in the   th of george ii cap    officers of the army are empowered to enlist in the colonies apprentices and indented servants the persons so enlisted were exempted from arrests in civil actions where the value of the action exceeds not ten pounds to these striking instances of the controuling power of parliament over the colonies may be added the act of   d of george ii cap    by that act every person erecting or working any mill or other engine for slitting or rolling iron or any plating forge or furnace for making steel is subjected to a penalty of  00l to be recovered in any of the courts in westminster hall or in the court of exchequer in scotland  the foregoing recital of statutes binding the colonies prior to the present reign of which the congress so much complain is sufficient to convince the dispassionate that the controuling power of parliament has been perpetually exerted and never disputed there is hardly any object of legislation in which the laws of this country have not bound america taxation has been purposely omitted in the above detail that article as the great object of contest ought to be separately stated i shall therefore throw into one point of view all the instances of the exercise of the power of the british parliament in that case  the first instance of taxation is the act of the   th of charles ii for granting to the crown a duty of tonnage and poundage this act is in point it directs that the duties abovementioned shall be payable upon commodities not only imported into the realm of england but also into the dominions thereunto belonging the colonies are here included in express words it is true indeed that the duties of tonnage and poundage were not collected in america the reason was that the commerce of the plantations was so inconsiderable that the revenue arising from it could not pay the expense of collection  but whatever might have been the reason for not collecting the duties of tonnage and poundage in the colonies the law was certainly understood to extend to america in the year    0 the assembly of the island of jamaica refused to raise levies for the support of government upon this refusal the lords of the council made a minute to confer with the judges upon the question whether the subsidies upon the tonnage and poundage upon goods that may by law or shall be directly carried to jamaica be not payable according to law by his majestys subjects inhabiting that island or trading there by virtue of the acts of tonnage and poundage or other acts made in england unfortunately it does not appear whether the conference was ever held or if it was actually held what was the result  the   th of charles ii cap   is the next act that binds america in point of taxation by that act certain duties are made payable in the plantations upon sugar tobacco cotton wool indigo ginger logwood fustic and other dying woods and cocoanuts exported to any other place except england these duties continue to be paid to this day  in the  th of queen anne an act was passed imposing certain duties on all prizegoods taken in america and imported into any of the colonies these duties were as follows all european goods wine and brandy excepted which have been usually sent to the plantations are to pay there such customs as are payable for the like goods imported into the plantations from great britain other goods taken as prizes shall be liable there to such duties as were payable for the same by any act of assembly in the said plantations  to these acts subjecting his majestys subjects in america to taxes imposed by the british parliament several others may be added the act of the  th of queen anne for establishing a post office the various acts passed for levying and enforcing the collection of the duty of sixpence per month out of seamens wages for the support of greenwich hospital all these acts extend to america they bind the colonies as well as the mother country their authority was never disputed and the taxes imposed by them have been uniformly raised the act of the  d of george ii cap   is still more explicit and decisive in the words it requires the payment of the duties for greenwich hospital by seamen belonging to american ships whether employed upon the high seas or in any port harbor bay or creek within any of the colonies  it appears from this detail of facts that the right of parliament to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever is not a claim founded on mere theory on the contrary that the controuling power of the legislature is warranted by constant usage and uninterrupted practice that the declaratory act of which the americans complain contains no new no assumed powers over the plantations and that there is scarce any channel of legislation through which the british parliament has not exerted its supremacy in as full and ample a manner as it has been exerted over the inhabitants of great britain and all this prior to the present reign in which the congress place the commencement of public ruin  the american congress with a partiality for themselves scarcely consistent with their design of gaining others in the next paragraph of their declaration call the acts which were the consequence of the resistance of their constituents the cause of their rebellion in descending to particulars their first complaint is stated against the extension of the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty and viceadmiralty beyond their former limits by which they allege the subject is deprived of his inherent right of a trial by jury the congress surely forget or it is not consistent with their design to remember that the alterations of which they complain were made at the request of their constituents the reasons assigned for this request were that the courts of admiralty established formerly in the various provinces possessed so little dignity on account of the dependence and poverty of the judges that justice was either sacrificed to connexions or biassed by avarice besides that appeals to great britain could be seldom made on account of the expense and distance to remedy this evil the present establishment of courts of admiralty in america was formed four great courts of viceadmiralty were erected the judges were rendered independent by ample salaries the line of appeal became short easy and obvious and as to trial by jury the whole world knows that the court of admiralty in england never admitted that mode of trial in civil cases  the complaint of the congress with regard to the bill for shutting the port of boston is ridiculous as well as unjust as the inhabitants of that place had it in their own power to remove the grievance the destruction of the east india companys tea at boston is well known to have been the deliberate act of a very great majority of the inhabitants to obtain reparation by the common course of law was impossible where the number of the offenders screened them effectually from justice it was a public crime and the punishment ought to have been general in pursuance of that plan of tenderness which has been fatally lost on the americans the bill for suspending the trade of boston was rendered conditional a door was left open for an immediate reconciliation should the assembly of massachusetsbay make a public grant for repairing the damage sustained by a company of merchants through a public outrage yet the congress stigmatize with the name of injustice a coercive statute rendered absolutely necessary by the shameless depredations of the inhabitants of boston and which statute they themselves had it in their power to terminate in an instant by doing an act of common justice  with equal effrontery and with still less reason the congress exclaim against the alteration made in the form of the government of boston with their usual fallacy in argument the americans wish to establish it as a maxim in polity that charters granted by the crown can neither be reversed or altered by the legislature they might as well go at once to the whole supremacy and save themselves the trouble of thus supporting a cause untenable on any other grounds the three branches of the legislature united make daily alterations in the constitution of great britain and if their supremacy extends over the whole empire they have the same right to alter the constitution of the american colonies if the americans deny this position all argument is at an end and they avow an independence which in their circumstances marks them out for enemies after all this alteration of which the congress affect to complain is no more than putting the inhabitants of massachusetsbay on the same footing with the other colonies they have received in miniature the counterpart of the constitution of the motherkingdom and have they a right or can they wish to be more free than the freest nation in the world  the act for regulating the government of quebec furnishes the congress with an ample field for declamation to inveigh against popery and arbitrary power has been ever a favorite topic with men who wish to profit by the prejudices of the people had the congress attended to the general principles of the british constitution they might have informed themselves that his majesty without the interposition of the two other branches of the legislature might have permitted the inhabitants of canada to remain for ever under french laws there is no maxim in the law of england more generally known or less controverted than that in conquered or ceded countries which have already laws of their own such laws remain in full force till they are altered and changed by the sovereign had his majesty therefore entertained such designs as the congress obliquely lay to his charge why should he call in the aid of the legislature to execute what was already done by the common law the congress will not surely affirm that the system of government established by the legislature in quebec is so arbitrary in itself or so fit for the purposes of despotism as the constitution which subsisted in that province under the french ought they not to consider that no other form of government could have been established so suitable to the disposition of the inhabitants the tenures of their property and the toleration of their religion to all which they had an undoubted right by the terms of their capitulation and the articles of the subsequent treaty of peace  the opposition at home as well as the patriots abroad have found an extensive subject for pathetic eloquence in the form of government now established by law in canada the former have either very treacherous memories or they change without any ceremony their opinions with their situation under the administration of the earl of chatham mr morgan lord shelburnes secretary was sent privately to america as commissioner to settle and regulate a new code for the government of quebec the governor and chief justice of that province if i am not mistaken were joined with morgan in this secret but important commission the measure it is said was considered by the board of trade it was certainly debated if not adopted by the cabinet as far back as the year      during the plenitude of the earl of chathams power lord camden was chancellor and gave his sanction to regulations more allied to despotism than those he reprobates at present the duke of grafton the earl of shelburne general conway and several others of that illustrious band on whose virtues the americans expatiate with rapture approved this popish arbitrary tyrannical system of government lord rockingham had the merit of sending a popish bishop to quebec  yet all these are now true americans strenuous protestants whigs of the ancient mould determined assertors of public freedom avowed enemies to oppression popery and arbitrary power  the congress enumerate among their complaints against the british legislature the resolution of parliament to give its due force to an unrepealed statute passed in the time of henry viii it is declared in the resolution that upon this statute treasons and misprisions of treason committed in any of his majestys dominions beyond sea subject to the crown of great britain may be tried in england though this resolution is considered by the congress as a part of the ideal system of enslavement with which they charge the king and parliament it contains no novelty no uncommon stretch of law a thousand instances of the same kind are upon record long before the present disputes with america began one instance is extremely remarkable i mean the transactions in the case of the insurrection in antigua in the year      all the proceedings were founded on the act of henry viii some of the insurgents were sent to england they were tried upon that statute and that circumstance has established a precedent which cannot be controverted but had even a new law of this kind been made what reason could the american congress have to complain have not the prejudices insurrections and even rebellion of their own countrymen totally interrupted the common course of justice over all the vast continent which they inhabit and shall the generality of the crime be admitted a competent excuse against punishment  from condemning the acts of the legislature the congress pass to complaints against their sovereign as well as his principal servants they allege that the americans have incessantly and ineffectually besieged the throne for ten years yet conceal the reason which was that their demands rather than requests were such as the sovereign could not grant consistent with the powers vested in him by the constitution they complain that fleets and armies have been sent to their country to enforce the coercive laws enacted by the legislature for the establishment of its supremacy yet they pass over in silence the outrages committed by themselves which rendered that measure necessary did they not draw the sword with one hand when the other was stretched forth with petitions for relief from pretended grievances did they not purchase arms ammunition and artillery form magazines enlist soldiers and prepare in every respect for rebellion and war when they affected to speak the language of submission and peace  all these are facts that cannot be controverted the congress know the truth but pursue their plan of deception they hoped in vain they say for moderation in their enemies yet their own conduct has been one continued series of violence oppression and injustice having disclaimed their allegiance to the sovereign disobeyed the acts of the legislature destroyed the property and insulted the persons of the servants of the state assumed the functions of sovereignty and rushed into actual rebellion they complain of a want of moderation in government for exerting the power vested in it by the constitution for restoring tranquillity enforcing legal submission to the laws of the state and for protecting the injured and punishing the guilty  throughout the whole of their strange declaration the american congress appear to adapt their reasonings to the weakness of the prejudiced and their facts to the credulity of the ignorant they affirm that they have uniformly endeavored to procure an accommodation with the mother country yet they reprobate the resolution of the commons on the  0th of february which opened a fair channel for agreement they call the resolution an insidious maneuver calculated to divide the americans and to establish a perpetual auction of taxation where colony should bid against colony all of them uninformed what ransom should redeem their lives and thus to extort from them at the point of the bayonet the unknown sums that should be sufficient to gratify if possible to gratify ministerial rapacity with the miserable indulgence left them of raising in their own mode the prescribed tribute we may learn from this tedious and involved sentence how much the congress have profited by the speeches of patriotism in the british parliament a noted orator who has been suspected of having penned the declaratory bill which the congress alledge contains the whole mass of american grievances used almost the same words in the house of commons on the day the resolution came under debate but former demerits have been forgot in what the american demagogues foolishly construe into present services  to show the nature of the proposition which the congress stigmatize with the name of an insidious maneuver some previous facts must be explained on the second of february a motion was made in the house of commons for an address to his majesty which was soon after presented with the concurrence of the lords in this address the two houses having stated some facts were induced to declare that a rebellion actually existed at that time in the province of massachusets bay that this conduct was the more inexcusable when it was considered with how much temper his majesty and the two houses of parliament had acted in support of the laws and constitution of great britain that they were resolved never so far to desert the trust reposed in them as to relinquish any part of the sovereign authority over all his majestys dominions which the law invested in his majesty and the two houses of parliament that the conduct of the americans was sufficient to convince them of the necessity of this supremacy and power that however they had always been and always should be ready to pay attention and regard to any real grievances which should be laid before them in a dutiful and constitutional manner that they requested his majesty to take the most effectual measures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the supreme legislature and that they were resolved at the hazard of their lives and fortunes to support his majesty against all rebellious attempts in the maintenance of the just rights of his majesty and the two houses of parliament  in this address the two houses of parliament while they held forth the sword in one hand evidently tendered the olive branch with the other the americans themselves were made the arbiters of their own fate the choice of war or peace was left in their own hands but as the offer of parliament to listen to the real grievances of the colonists was deemed too general to form a foundation for an agreement between them and the mother country the minister wishing to conciliate matters with america even contrary to the opinion of many friends to this country laid before the house of commons some explicit propositions which might answer that end accordingly on the twentieth of february the following propositions were introduced to a committee of the whole house by the chancellor of the exchequer that it is the opinion of this committee that when the governor council and assembly or general court of his majestys provinces or colonies shall propose to make provision according to their respective conditions circumstances and situations for contributing their proportion to the common defense such proportion to be raised under the authorities of the general court or general assembly of such province or colony and disposable by parliament and shall engage to make provision also for the support of the civil government and the administration of justice in such province or colony it will be proper if such proposal shall be approved by his majesty in parliament and for so long as such provision shall be made accordingly to forbear in respect of such province or colony to levy any duties tax or assessment or to impose any further duty tax or assessment except only such duties as it may be expedient to impose for the regulation of commerce the nett produce of the duties last mentioned to be carried to the account of such province colony or plantation respectively  this resolution which was carried by a great majority plainly marked the ground for a negotiation and an equitable agreement with the colonies it was moderate comprehensive and explicit it named the persons from whom the proposals must come and those to whom they were to be made the end and purpose of the contribution were explained the appropriation of the expected revenue was specified and precluded every suspicion of its being misapplied though the offer was conditional it was plainly conclusive as long as the americans themselves should adhere to the agreement they had it in their power to tax themselves the great point for which they professed to contend and the only right reserved by the legislature was to determine the quantum of the supply and they alone can determine it as being the supreme power who are the sole judges of what is necessary to support the state the proposition upon the whole was at least as favorable to the pretensions of the americans as to the claims of the mother country the former therefore must have accepted the proposal had what they held forth to the public formed the real principles of their opposition  the minority in parliament who deemed nothing so fatal to their own views as an agreement with the americans upon equitable and consequently permanent terms opposed this proposition as insidious in its nature and for that purpose rendered obscure and perplexed in its language the american demagogues whose influence can only exist in the midst of anarchy and confusion opposed it with similar views the latter indeed have approved so much of the sentiments or rather professions of the former that they have in their declaration echoed back their very words in parliament the argument before went only to the claim of the americans to be permitted in their assemblies to settle the mode of taxation they then demanded an exclusive privilege of fixing the amount or quantum of the supply and now they will give no supply at all but if neither the mode nor the quantum is to be left in the power of parliament what power has parliament left with regard to the taxing of the americans ought the british legislature to lay humbly the wants of the public before the petty legislatures of america and request their aid for the general support of government what would this be but the total emancipation of the colonies from that supremacy for which we contend  the americans formerly declared themselves willing to contribute to the exigences and expenses of the state provided the demand should come by requisition from the king and not by an immediate exertion of parliamentary authority this offer his majesty declined with that patriotism which has uniformly marked his own measures during his reign anxious for the happiness of all his subjects he chose to be the monarch of one great and free nation rather than the sovereign of a number of petty states weakened by their own disunion had his majesty been actuated by those motives of ambition which are not uncommon among princes he would have eagerly closed with the offers of the americans instead of making himself dependent for the maintenance of his dignity upon the grants of one assembly he might have extricated himself from even the fear of pecuniary difficulties by a proper management of many assemblies the representatives of one province might be gratified into the views of the crown from the revenue of another british members might receive the wages of corruption in america and american representatives be sent for the price of their votes to this kingdom  but succeeding events have demonstrated that the americans were not sincere in any one of their declarations in favor of an amicable accommodation the propositions voted on the  0th of february came up to their own former demands yet they evaded them by treating them as insidious the truth is they knew their own demerits toward this country and they could not believe that proposals so highly favorable could have been on her part sincere one good however has resulted from the propositions the colonies by rejecting them have left no doubt remaining concerning their real intentions they confine no longer their claims to the exclusive privilege of taxing themselves they aim evidently at a total independence in all matters whatsoever and more particularly with regard to the act of navigation they have long made secret but most dangerous encroachments on this palladium of our commerce they now publicly avow their resolution to pay no regard to any parliamentary restrictions whether ancient or recent on their commerce they now openly trade all over europe and the obtaining the privilege which they have at length usurped has been the primary cause of their resistance to parliament the manufacturers and merchants of this country have been long no strangers to this american policy yet the congress have the effrontery to expect that the mercantile interest of great britain will espouse their cause  the american congress having in a loose cursory and superficial manner advanced some pretended arguments to justify their rebellion descend to the misrepresentation of facts with the same design they affirm that general gage who had occupied boston as a garrison sent out a large detachment of his army on the   th of april who made an unprovoked assault on the inhabitants of the province of boston at lexington on this allegation of the congress it may be remarked that the rebellious conduct of the town of boston where all the authority of legal government had been long extinguished by the tyranny of a rabble instigated by factious leaders had rendered a force necessary in that place to restore order and tranquillity to protect the innocent and to restrain the excesses of the turbulent and guilty that the military preparations made in all parts of the province and especially at the town of concord with the avowed intention of opposing all legal authority induced and even forced general gage though fatally too late to send out a detachment of the troops under his command to prevent hostilities by seizing the means of carrying them on that some of the inhabitants of the province in warlike array stood in the way of this detachment with arms in their hands and that when ordered to remove in a peaceable manner they made an unprovoked assault on his majestys troops by firing first upon them and killing some and wounding many  the audacity of the congress in asserting falsehoods demands a brief detail of the truth general gage having been informed that arms ammunition cannon and other implements of war had been collected in the town of concord ordered a detachment of the army to march with all possible secrecy to that place he gave orders to the detachment to observe the most strict discipline and to resent no insults offered them by the country people except actual hostilities the generals orders were in truth too implicitly observed there was not one loaded musket in the whole detachment except those in the hands of fifty marines who formed the van when they were fired upon by the country people at lexington the affidavits of the rebels on this subject are impositions and perjuries there is not a man whether officer or soldier in the whole detachment consisting of  00 men but is ready in the most solemn manner to attest the truth of this fact  it were to be wished for the honor of the insurgents that their barbarous cruelty to the wounded soldiers were more problematical than their firing first on the kings troops the soldiers who fell by the first fire of the rebels were found scalped when the detachment returned from concord to lexington bridge two soldiers who lay wounded on the field and had been scalped by the savage provincials were still breathing they appeared by the traces of blood to have rolled in the agonies of this horrid species of death several yards from the place where they had been scalped near these unfortunate men another dreadful object presented itself a soldier who had been slightly wounded appeared with his eyes torn out of their sockets by the barbarous mode of googing a word and practice peculiar to the americans humanity forbids us to dwell longer on this scene of horror the rebels to break the force of accusation began to recriminate they laid several instances of wanton cruelty to the charge of the troops yet nothing is better ascertained than that not one of the soldiers ever quitted the road either upon their march or return from concord  the congress stigmatize the expedition to lexington and concord with the epithets of an unprovoked and wanton assault was the collecting warlike implements at concord raising men throughout the province disciplining troops in every district forming magazines purchasing ammunition and preparing arms no provocation were not the whole country assembled before they knew of this expedition and was not their being so completely provided with the means of repelling hostilities a sufficient proof that they had previously resolved to commence them could ten thousand men the number that attacked though at a prudent distance the troops on their retreat have been collected by accident or called together by a sudden alarm are not the congress conscious to themselves and was not general gage sufficiently apprized that the people of massachusetsbay had determined to begin hostilities had the expedition to concord never happened the truth is the march of the troops had only hastened the execution of the plan of rebellion settled before in the secret councils of the provincial congress  the assertions of the congress concerning transactions within the town of boston are as utterly devoid of truth as their account of what happened in the country the hostile intentions of those within were as apparent as the rebellion of their brethren without was certain the great law of selfdefence must therefore have justified general gage for having deprived the former of arms which they almost avowedly intended to raise against all legal authority after the skirmish at lexington and concord all supplies from the country were cut off from the town of boston many of the inhabitants desired to remove with their effects their request was granted but it was at the same time demanded that they should deliver up their arms this was at first approved by all but great clamours soon after followed such of the inhabitants as were well affected or pretended to be well affected to government alleged that none but the illinclined showed any inclination to remove and that when they should become safe with their effects the town would be set on fire a great demur having also arisen about the meaning of the word effects whether merchandise was included and the general being likewise sensible that the permitting articles of that kind to be carried to the rebels might strengthen them in their resistance he retained the goods but they are still safely kept for the owners should they either continue faithful or seize his majestys mercy and return to their duty  the next paragraph of the declaration as it is not supported by truth is addressed to the passions the congress complain with an attempt at the pathos of the separation of wives from their husbands children from their parents and the aged and sick from their relations and friends but is it not notorious to the whole world that this separation which the congress affect to lament was the necessary consequence of the rebellion of their countrymen did they not surround the town of boston with an armed force with the avowed intention of destroying his majestys forces generals and governor and were the gates to be left open to let ruin enter as one of their own writers expresses himself have the people of boston suffered more hardships than the inhabitants of besieged towns usually suffer have they not even suffered sewer restraints than men in their situation had reason to expect was not dr warren the chairman of the provincial congress a notorious abettor of the insurrection a nominal general in a rebel army permitted to come into boston under pretense of visiting a sick friend on the day preceding the action on bunkershill where he was killed in arms against his king and country is this a mark of those cruel restraints those melancholy separations of which the congress complain but their business is to engage the passions where they can make no impression with their arguments  in the next paragraph of their declaration the congress with their usual want of impartiality and fairness mention the consequences of their own rebellion as the cause of their taking up arms they observe that general gage issued a proclamation declaring all the inhabitants of massachusetsbay rebels suspending the course of the common law and publishing instead thereof the use and exercise of the law martial but did he declare them rebels till they had attacked his majestys troops seized his forts and garrisons besieged his army in the capital of the province and not only interrupted the common course of justice but even totally annihilated all legal authority it is with peculiar effrontery that the congress number the suspension of the common course of justice among their grievances after all law and order had been trodden under foot by their own countrymen  with the same degree of arrogant folly the congress complain that their countrymen were killed on bunkershill that charlestown was burnt to the ground that their ships and vessels have been seized that their supplies of provisions have been intercepted that general carleton is instigating the canadians and indians against them and that domestic enemies are encouraged to attack them all these things may certainly have happened but have they not happened in consequence of their own rebellion have they a right to attack others and have others no right to defend themselves do the inhabitants of massachusetsbay think that as they have broken through all the ties that bind the subject to the sovereign the law of nature and of nations ought also to be suspended to gratify their ambition to flatter their folly to favor their extravagant schemes of independence to the above imaginary catalogue of american grievances may be opposed the just complaints of great britain have not the rebels carried their hostilities to every corner against the parentstate that first gave them existence and reared them to prosperity have they not attacked her troops at lexington and at concord fired upon boston burnt the lighthouse taken ticonderago and crown point and even penetrated into canada and have they not used every artifice to instigate the savages to make war on their sovereign and mother country almost all these injuries preceded the just exertions of this kingdom to punish their rebellion  the conclusion of the declaration though labored contains nothing but empty declamation and therefore merits little notice the same disregard to truth or rather the same attention to misrepresentation which distinguishes the rest of that strange composition is carried down to the end they allege that they are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to tyranny or resistance by force the congress surely forget or it suits their purpose to pass over in silence the favorable perhaps too favorable conditions offered to them by the resolution of the commons in the month of february last the terms couched in that resolution were so obviously advantageous to america that the opposition in parliament declared them insidious or in other words too good to be sincere an amicable settlement had ceased to have been an object with the demagogues abroad and it would have ruined the schemes of the faction at home the former derived their influence consequence and power from anarchy and confusion they could exist only in a storm the restoration of peace and tranquillity must have reduced them to their original insignificance and as for the latter rendered desperate by disappointed ambition they would not hesitate to ruin their country to procure the fall of their rivals  such being the state of opinions among the leaders of faction on both sides of the atlantic resistance by force became naturally the choice of the congress to deceive an unhappy people over whose minds they had established a temporary dominion they boast of their perfect union and their great internal resources and that foreign assistance is attainable as to the first we have no reason to give it implicit credit the show of unanimity which now subsists in america appears from undoubted information to be the effect of fear more than any love for the desperate cause of the rebels men of property are from interest enemies to confusion and the intelligent foreseeing the inevitable issue of hostilities against the invincible power of a mighty empire are averse to a contest that on the side of the americans must terminate in ruin but both are terrified into silence by the tyranny of a misled rabble or their still voice is drowned in the clamours of faction and tumult of party  the internal resources of the americans are as problematical as their unanimity in rebellion consist these mighty resources in a wretched papercurrency established on no ostensible fund of credit and voted by an illegal assembly whose authority is feeble on account of its novelty and transitory as it arises from temporary prejudices should force or even folly stamp a domestic value on the pasteboard dollars of the congress what foreign nation will receive them for its manufactures and commodities are the americans themselves capable of furnishing all the great implements necessary for the prosecution of war can they supply their armies with tents with powder with cannon or with muskets is any one of these articles manufactured in a sufficient quantity in america and how can they be procured in europe with the wretched currency of the general congress  the colonists had not reason been warped by prejudice in every part of their conduct might have foreseen that their commencing a war deprived them instantly of the resources for carrying it on their whole coast is lined it is to be hoped at this very moment with our ships of war to put a total stop to their commerce they have therefore lost at one stroke their whole trade in corn and rice with spain portugal and the mediterranean which at a moderate computation brought annually one million five hundred thousand pounds to north america they have lost the supplying our own west india islands as well as those of other nations with provisions a branch of commerce estimated little short of a million annually they have lost their fishery an article too great for computation and they have lost the exportation to great britain of commodities which would not have answered in any other market had the sea remained open to their navigation  but if the americans have little reason to depend on domestic resources they have still less to hope from foreign aid will france in the present state of her finances involve herself in a ruinous and expensive war to gratify the revenge of a faction in this country or to favor the ambition of demagogues beyond the atlantic will spain give her assistance to raise an independent empire in america will she encourage her own american subjects to rise against her authority by abetting the rebellion of the american subjects of great britain can either branch of the house of bourbon be so blind to its own interest as to wish to see a sovereign state erected so near its settlements which from their proximity their produce and their wealth must in such a case become objects of invasion depredation and conquest what has either france or spain to fear from this kingdom whose interest consists solely in preserving what she has already acquired but have not both every thing to fear should a new sovereignty start up in america in which a want of resources would in some degree justify the providing itself at the expense of wealthy neighbors  having endeavored to terrify great britain with their domestic resources and foreign aids the congress thinking perhaps they had gone too far conclude with assurances that they have not yet determined to dissolve their union with the mother country but that union it appears from the sequel must not be construed into subordination on the part of the americans the general supremacy of the legislature which by pervading the whole british empire renders it one state must not it seems cross the atlantic but in such proportions as may suit the inclinations of the congress they have taken up arms as they openly avow against that supremacy and they will not lay them down till hostilities shall cease on the part of great britain this is the ultimatum offered by the congress withdraw your armies recall your fleets and you may have peace from the americans for as they fight not for conquest they do not yet mean to transfer hostilities into the heart of these kingdoms  the haughty monarch who dreamt of universal monarchy in the last century could scarcely have expressed himself in more insolent terms to the petty princes surrounding his dominions than the congress have done to the powerful empire to which they owe the allegiance of subjects some allowance ought to be made for their ignorance and a great deal for the petulance of men new to consequence and authority but even in that case the insolence of the declaration is calculated to raise indignation as well as contempt the congress however are only the echoes of a desperate faction in this kingdom who have uniformly in their public exhibitions degraded the strength power and authority of great britain to exalt america on the ruins with an effrontery without example in any other age or nation these men assume the name of patriots yet lay the honor dignity and reputation of their country under the feet of her rebellious subjects with a peculiar refinement on parricide they bind the hands of the mother while they plant a dagger in those of the daughter to stab her to the heart and to finish the horrid picture they smile at the mischief they have done and look round to the spectators for applause  it appears upon the whole that the declaration which ought to contain all the argument in favor of the americans contains in fact nothing that does not militate against their cause the right of taxing all the subjects of the empire for the general support of the state is a part of that supremacy which the first principles of the constitution have vested in the british legislature this supremacy has been exerted by parliament and admitted by the americans ever since their ancestors migrated from these kingdoms if they now deny it by that very act they cease to be subjects and become rebels but granting for the sake of argument that taxation is no part of the supremacy of parliament the very conduct of the americans not only justifies but even renders it absolutely necessary that a precedent should be made they own that their internal resources are great the inability of contributing to the necessities of a state from whom they have derived their origin their support their protection and their prosperity is no longer a pretense and if they will give no revenue as subjects they owe a debt as allies they affect to maintain armies by land they threaten to send fleets to sea they allege that their resources are capable of supporting a rebellion against the mother country yet they justify that rebellion by the demand made by the mother country for their bearing a part of their own future expenses  that the former expenses of america have drawn from great britain an incredible treasure may be seen from the following authentic estimate we shall begin this estimate with the accession of the house of hanover to the throne of these kingdoms  l s d from the year      to the year      the money voted by parliament for the forces employed in defense of the colonies amounts to              grants in parliament for rewards encouragement and indemnification to the americans during the last war  0           bounties on american commodities to the end of        0         sums granted to the colonies for the support of their civil government and provincial forces      00     extraordinary expenses for forts garrisons ordnance stores transports carriages provisions may be estimated equal to the expenses of the forces              expenses of fleets and naval stations employed and established in america for its defense may be estimated at  0000000 00 00 annual presents to the american indians for abstaining from hostilities against the colonies and for the cession of lands   0000 00 00           0  0  to this amazing sum might be added by implication the other expenses of the two last wars the former of those wars was undertaken for the protection of the american commerce or rather american smuggling to the spanish colonies we entered into the latter for the defense of the colonists we carried it on for their security and terminated it for their sole advantage the two last wars have cost this country at a moderate computation one hundred and fifty millions to this extraordinary waste of treasure what have the colonies to oppose to balance the account is it a languid commerce which scarcely makes its returns once in three years  we have heard much indeed a great deal too much of this commerce from factious men on both sides of the atlantic this is the mighty engine which they wield over the heads of the ignorant the great bugbear with which they terrify the timid to estimate the value of the american trade with any degree of precision is impossible the accounts kept in the customhouse are no authorities when exports pay no duty a door is opened to false entries the vanity of some merchants the interest of others too frequently induce them to magnify beyond measure the quantity of their export trade besides the mercantile abettors of american resistance thought they served the colonies whilst they gratified their own private views we may conclude that the commerce with north america has been greatly overrated as the total loss of it has not affected this kingdom we ought perhaps to ascribe to its insignificance what we are taught to attribute to an increase in other channels of trade  like all monopolies the commerce with north america such as it has been was much more profitable to the merchant than advantageous to the manufacturer onethird of this commerce with any state in europe from which the returns are annual would have brought equal profit to the manufacturer and would have enabled him to employ an equal number of hands political impostors will not fail to advance magnificent fictions on this head and the ignorant cannot cease to give them credit on a subject where proofs are so difficult to be obtained one may hazard a conjecture the money expended by this nation upon america for the protection of her inhabitants and the encouragement of her commerce would have been more than sufficient to purchase all the manufactures ever exported from great britain to the colonies now in rebellion i mean not to include in this conjectural estimate any sums expended by us in any other part of the world during the two last truly american wars  the americans with a degree of folly scarce excuseable in the most consummate ignorance claim a merit with great britain for the revenue arising from imposts laid upon some of their commodities in this kingdom the chief of these are rice and tobacco the revenue arising from rice is so insignificant that it scarce deserves to be mentioned if exported to the south of cape finisterre rice pays no duty at all the consumption here and the reexportation to the northward are very inconsiderable in like manner tobacco when reexported pays no duty and it is a matter of great doubt whether the frauds committed in the drawbacks may not nearly balance the ostensible revenue arising to the state from the home consumption  but granting a great revenue should arise from rice and tobacco to the state what favor do we owe to our colonies on that head that revenue is paid by ourselves the tax is on the consumer and not upon the planter should siberia supply us with rice and tobacco the price would not probably be greater to the consumer nor the revenue less to the state if the americans claim any merit from those taxes what do we not owe to the emperor of china the revenue from tea is much more considerable than that from rice and tobacco a congress at pekin might accuse us of ingratitude on this subject with as much justice as the assembly lately sitting at philadelphia  it is evident from the above state of facts that the colonies have no claim to an exemption from taxation on account of any advantage that has accrued to this country from their commerce but taxation has now ceased to be any part of the dispute it goes to the whole authority of the mother country the americans offer no longer the very name of obedience but why should i speak of obedience this very congress whose declaration is the subject of this disquisition have passed a vote of independence they have long acted as rebels they now affect to contend as enemies their abettors in this kingdom are no strangers to this circumstance yet they dignify avowed rebellion with the title of a glorious struggle for freedom  such is the conduct of the americans to which that of great britain has all along formed a striking contrast with the indulgence and patience of a parent she soothed flattered and even courted them to a reconciliation in pity to the weakness in condescension to the folly in consideration to the prejudices of a froward child she held out the olive branch when she ought perhaps to have stretched forth the rod of correction her pity her kindness and affection were lost upon the americans they advanced rapidly from claim to claim and construed her forbearance into timidity each act that was repealed furnished a subject for triumph and not an object for gratitude each concession became the foundation of some new demand till at length by assuming all to themselves by rebellion they left the mother country nothing to bestow  in this situation of affairs great britain must pursue one of two lines of conduct with regard to her refractory colonies she must either put up with the loss of all her expense and emancipate them for ever or reduce them to that state of dependence which subjects owe to the supreme authority in every empire as the latter line must of necessity be pursued it ought to be pursued with a mixture of spirit and prudence to be in every respect in a condition to force equitable terms is the best security for their being voluntarily offered but should terms be offered by the rebels the rights of this country must be more regarded in the accommodation than the claims of america to permit the colonies to gain by one rebellion is to sow the seeds of another but if the colonies as communities are not permitted to gain by their refractory conduct i am far from wishing that individuals should lose any part of their rights as british subjects  to propose a plan to the americans in their present political frenzy would be to speak to the winds to make them less free than the other subjects of the state can never be the design of this country to obtain greater privileges can scarcely be their own design if they are not madly bent on independence let them propose the conditions on which they wish to continue subjects but if they are to continue subjects they must perform their duty as such and contribute toward the expense of the state for the general protection the legislature of this kingdom cannot possibly depart from any part of its supremacy over the colonies but it is in the power of the colonies to share in that supremacy if they complain of being taxed without having the privilege of sending members to parliament let them be represented nay more let their representation increase in proportion to the revenue they shall furnish if they wish rather to vote their quota toward the general supply through their own general courts and assemblies the resolution of parliament on that subject is still open to their choice  but as long as they assume the language of a sovereign state this kingdom can enter into no negotiation can meet no compromise nations as well as individuals have a character a certain dignity which they must preserve at the risque of their existence great britain has obeyed the dictates of humanity beyond the limits prescribed by her reputation to tempt her further is full of peril as her indignation begins to rise she has long had reason to complain of american ingratitude and she will not bear longer with american injustice the dangerous resentment of a great people is ready to burst forth they already begin to ask with vehemence is this the return we ought to expect from colonies whom with parental indulgence we have cherished in infancy protected in youth and reared to manhood have we spent in their cause so much treasure and have they the ingratitude to refuse to bear a small portion of our burdens have we spilt so much of the blood of their enemies and do they repay us by imbruing their hands in our own the law of god and of nature is on the side of an indulgent parent against an undutiful child and should necessary correction render him incapable of future offense he has only his own obstinacy and folly to blame  finis

general congress at philadelphia setting forth the causes and necessity of their taking up arms if it was possible for men who exercise their reason to believe that the divine author of our xistence intended a part of the human race to hold an absolute property in and an unbounded power over others marked out by his infinite goodness and wisdom as the objects of a legal domination never rightfully resistible however severe and oppressive the inhabitants of these colonies might at least require from the parliament of great britain some evidence that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that body but a reverence for our great creator principles of humanity and the dictates of common sense must convince all those who reflect upon the subject that government was instituted to promote the welfare of mankind and ought to be administered for the attainment of that end the legislature of great britain however stimulated by an inordinate passion for a power not only unjustifiable but which they know to be peculiarly reprobated by the very citution of that kingdom and desperate of success in any mode of contest where regard should be had to truth law or right have at length deserting those attempted to effect their cruel and impolitic purpose of enslaving these colonies by violence and have thereby rendered it necessary for us to close with their last appeal from reason to arms  yet however blinded that assembly may be by their intemperate rage for unlimited domination so to slight justice and the opinion of mankind we esteem ourselves bound by obligations of respect to the rest of the world to make known the justice of our cause  our forefathers inhabitants of the island of great britain left their native land to seek on these shores a residence for civil and religious freedom at the expense of their blood at the hazard of their fortunes without the least charge to the country from which they removed by unceasing labor and an unconquerable spirit they effected settlements in the distant and inhospitable wilds of america then filled with numerous and warlike nations of barbarians societies or governments vested with perfect legislatures were formed under charters from the crown and an harmonious intercourse was established between the colonies and the kingdom from which they derived their origin the mutual benefits of this un on became in a short time so extraordinary as to excite astonishment it is universally confessed that the amazing increase of the wealth strength and navigation of the realm arose from this source and the minister who so wisely and successfully directed the measures of great britain in the late war publicly declared that these colonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies  toward the conclusion of that war it pleased our sovereign to make a change in his councils  from that fatal moment the affairs of the british empire began to fall into confusion and gradually sliding from the summit of glorious prosperity to which they had been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man are at length distracted by the convulsions that now shake it to its deepest foundation the new ministry finding the brave foes of britain though frequently deseated yet still contending took up the unfortunate idea of granting them a hasty peace and of then subduing her faithful friends  these devoted colonies were judged to be in such a state as to present victories without bloodshed and all the easy emoluments of statuteable plunder the uninterrupted tenor of their peaccable and respectful behavior from the beginning of colonization their dutiful zealous and useful services during the war though so recently and amply acknowledged in the most honorable manner by his majesty by the late king and by parliament could not save them from the meditated innovations parliament was influenced to adopt the pernicious project and assuming a new power over them have in the course of eleven years given such decisive specimens of the spirit and consequences attending this power as to leave no doubt concerning the effects of acquiescence under it they have undertaken to give and grant our money without our consent though we have ever exercised an exclusive right to dispose of our own property statutes have been passed for extending the jurisdiction of courts of admiralty and viceadmiralty beyond their ancient limits for depriving us of the accustomed and inestimable privilege of trial by jury in cases affecting both life and property for suspending the legislature of one of the colonies for interdicting all commerce of another and for altering fundamentally the form of government established by charter and secured by acts of its own legislature solemnly confirmed by the crown for exempting the murderers of colonists from legal trial and in effect from punishment for erecting in a neighboring province acquired by the joint arms of great britain and america a despotism dangerous to our very existence and for quartering soldiers upon the colonists in time of profound peace it has also been resolved in parliament that colonists charged with committing certain offenses shall be transported to england to be tried  but why should we enumerate our injuries in detail by one statute it is declared that parliament can of right make laws to bind us in all cases whatsoever what is to defend us against so enormous so unlimited a power not a single man of those who assume it is chosen by us or is subject to our control or influence but on the contrary they are all of them exempt from the operation of such laws and an american revenue if not diverted from the ostensible purposes for which it is raised would actually lighten their own burdens in proportion as they increase ours we saw the misery to which such despotism would reduce us we for ten years incessantly and ineffectually besieged the throne as supplicants we reasoned we remonstrated with parliament in the most mild and decent language but administration sensible that we should regard these oppressive measures as freemen ought to do sent over fleets and armies to enforce them the indignation of the americans was roused it is true but it was the indignation of a virtuous loyal and affectionate people a congress of delegates from the united colonies was assembled at philadelphia on the  th day of last september we resolved again to offer an humble and dutiful petition to the king and also addressed our fellow subjects of great britain we have pursued every temperate every respectful measure we have even proceeded to break off our commercial intercourse with our fellow subjects as the last peaceable admonition that our attachment to no nation upon earth should supplant our attachment to liberty this we flattered ourselves was the ultimate step of the controversy but the subsequent events have shown how vain is this hope of finding moderation in our enemies  several threatening expressions against the colonies were inserted in his majestys speech our petition though we were told it was a decent one that his majesty had been pleased to receive it graciously and to promise laying it before his parliament was huddled into both houses amongst a bundle of american papers and there neglected the lords and commons in their address in the month of february said that a rebellion at that time actually existed within the province of masschusets bay and that those concerned in it had been countenanced and encouraged by unlawful combinations and engagements entered into by his majestys subjects in several of the other colonies and therefore they besought his majesty that he would take the most effectual measures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the supreme legislature soon after the commercial intercourse of whole colonies with foreign countries and with each other was cut off by an act of parliament by another several of them were entirely proscribed from the fisheries in the seas near their coasts on which they always depended for their sustenance and large reinforcements of ships and troops were immediately sent over to general gage  fruitless were all the entreaties arguments and eloquence of an illustrious band of the most distinguished peers and commoners who nobly and strenuously asserted the justice of our cause to stay or even to mitigate the heedless fury with which these accumulated and unexampled outrages were hurried on equally fruitless was the interference of the city of london of bristol and many other respectable towns in our favor parliament adopted an insidious maneuver calculated to divide us to establish a perpetual auction of taxations where colony should bid against colony all of them uninformed what ransom should redeem their lives and thus to extort from us at the point of the bayonet the unknown sums that should be sufficient to gratify if possible to gratify ministerial rapacity with the miserable indulgence left to us of raising in our own mode the prescribed tribute what terms more rigid and humiliating could have been dictated by remorseless victors to conquered enemies in our circumstances to accept them would be to deserve them  soon after the intelligence of these proceedings arrived on this continent general gage who in the course of the last year had taken possession of the town of boston in the province of massachusetsbay and still occupied it as a garrison on the   th day of april sent out from that place a large detachment of his army who made an unprovoked assault on the inhabitants of the said prevince at the town of lexington as appears by the affidavits of a great number of persons some of whom were officers and soldiers of that detachment murdered eight of the inhabitants and wounded many others from thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of concord where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province killing several and wounded more until compelled to retreat by the country people suddenly assembled to repel this cruel aggression hostilities thus commenced by the british troops have been since prosecuted by them without regard to faith or reputation the inhabitants of boston being confined within that town by the general their governor and having in order to procure their dismission entered into a treaty with him it was stipulated that the said inhabitants having deposited their arms with their own magistrates should have liberty to depart taking with them their other effects they accordingly delivered up their arms but in open violation of honor in defiance of the obligation of treaties which even savage nations esteem sacred the governor ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid that they might be preserved for their owners to be seized by a body of soldiers detained the greatest part of the inhabitants in the town and compelled the few who were permitted to retire to leave their most valuable effects behind  by this perfidy wives are separated from their husbands children from their parents the aged and sick from their relations and friends who wish to attend and comfort them and those who have been used to live in plenty and even elegance are reduced to deplorable distress  the general further emulating his ministerial masters by a proclamation bearing date on the   th day of june after venting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies proceeds to declare them all either by name or description to be rebels and traitors to supersede the course of the common law and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the law martial  his troops have butchered our countrymen have wantonly burnt charles town besides a considerable number of houses in other places our ships and vessels are seized the necessary supplies of provisions are intercepted and he is exerting his utmost power to spread destruction and devastation around him  we have received certain intelligence that general carleton the governor of canada is instigating the people of that province and the indians to fall upon us and we have but too much reason to apprehend that schemes have been formed to excite domestic enemies against us in brief a part of these colonies now feels and all of them are sure of feeling as far as the vengeance of administration can inflict them the complicated calamities of fire sword and famine we are reduced to the alternative of choosing an unconditional submission to the tyranny of irritated ministers or resistance by force the latter is our choice we have counted the cost of this contest and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery honor justice and humanity forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us we cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them  our cause is just our union is perfect our internal resources are great and if necessary foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable we gratefully acknowledge as signal instances of divine favor toward us that his providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy until we were grown up to our present strength had been previously exercised in warlike operations and possessed of the means of defending ourselves with hearts fortified with these animating reflections we most solemnly before god and the world declare that exerting the utmost energy of those powers which our beneficent creator has graciously bestowed upon us the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume we will in defiance of every hazard with unabating firmness and perseverance employ for the preservation of our liberties being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves  lest this declaration should disquiet the minds of our friends and fellow subjects in any part of the empire we assure them that we mean not to dissolve that union which has so long and so happily subsisted between us and which we sincerely wish to see restored necessity has not yet driven us into that desperate measure or induced us to excite any other nation to war against them we have not raised armies with ambitious designs of separating from great britain and establishing independent states we fight not for glory or for conquest we exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies without any imputation or even suspicion of offense they boast of their privileges and civilization and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death  in our own native land in defense of the freedom that is our birthright and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it for the protection of our property acquired solely by the honest industry of our forefathers and ourselves against violence actually offered we have taken up arms we shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed  and not before  with an humble confidence in the mercies of the supreme and impartial judge and ruler of the universe we most devoutly implore his divine goodness to conduct us happily through this great conflict to dispose our adversaries to reconciliation on reasonable terms and thereby to relieve the empire from the calamities of civil war  by order of congress john hancock president attested charles thompson secretary philadelphia july
