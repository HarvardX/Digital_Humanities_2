oroonoko a tragedy  oroonoko or the royal slave a tragedy  altered from southern by francis gentleman  as it was performed at the theater in edinburgh with universal applause  glasgow printed by robert and andrew foulis mdcclx  to james boswell esquire how can the muse with burdened pinions soar no flowers appear among the winters store removed from fortunes vivifying heat almost within the frigid zone of fate can shivering fancy fondly hope to rise through the rough regions of tempestuous skies it is madness to attempt  yet reason proud with godlike energy thus cries aloud  let fools the deity of fortune own  i view alike a cottage or a throne  intrinsic worth alone has charms for me  the worth of virtue and of liberty  rouse then nor let an apathy of soul  thy active freeborn faculties control  behold aright the attributes of state  they are not always happy who are great  invoke content to soothe thy troubled mind  content the opulence of human kind  that like the tuneful herald of the morn  when rosytincturd beams the east adorn  from his grass pallat mounts on cowring wings  and from his height serene  looks down on kings  then pleased returns into his humble bed  and rests while sleep from grandeurs couch is fled  such is content  her sacred aid invoke  sweet as orphean lyre the voice that spoke as that could lull the savage herds to rest so this can calm the troubles of my breast it is done  cares urrowd brow is rendered even the call of reason is the call of heaven and now to justly dedicate those lays which through the parentstock must hope for praise from southernes muse existence must derive must live through him if they should chance to live shall i for some exalted title seek and cringe to fortune not to merit speak no  she disdains a task so meanly low in every shape to flattery a foe but where with honest pleasure she can find sense taste politeness with goodnature joined there gladly will she raise her humble voice nor fears to tell that boswell is her choice francis gentleman glasgow february    0 prologue how difficult the task of those who aim by lays dramatic to arrive at same who fondly hope twill prove a work of ease the appetites of all their guests to please this vain attempt eludes the nicest care for tastes as different as our faces are southern whose tender muse could well impart the noblest feelings to each melting heart and raise by force divine for the distressed griefs tenderest sympathy in every breast who wanted but attention to command the subject passions with a master hand was forced when he adventured on the stage to prostitute his genius to the age an age remarkable for wit and vice when pleasure must be had at any price when wounded virtue hung her languid head and every sense of public shame was fled when hapless poets if they wished to eat must furnish  though regret  a luscious treat this sad necessity even drydens muse with such immoral pieces could abuse in their deformity his beauties fade and all his laurels wither in their shade but now when chaster judgment holds the scales and taste with delicacy joined prevails from ribaldry to rescue virtuous lays must plead some favor though it reach not praise ye caledonian fair in whom we find each charm of person and each grace of mind for virtues sake a feeble genius spare the cause of virtues your peculiar care in you it lies to censure or to save to your protection take the royal slave advertisement though the prologue shows the motive of this alteration it may not be improper to mention that it was first hinted to the author by a noble personage who has eminently distinguished himself in the literary world and who recollected to have heard mr southern declare in his latter days that he most heartily regretted his complying with licentious taste by writing any thing so offensive to modesty as the comic part of his works especially that which was so unnaturally joined to the tragedy of this play  the author thinks himself obliged in gratitude to acknowledge the very candid reception his part of it met with from the polite and judicious audience of edinburgh without one person to recommend it as he chose to lie concealed and this approbation is the more extraordinary as the piece labored under some lamentable deficiencies in the representation  such lines as have been added to gratify curiosity are marked thus   dramatis personae oroonoko aboan governor blandford massingano zinzo capt driver planters and slaves imoinda oroonoko act the first governor and blandford governor  blandford your partial fortune ever smiles  like a kind mistress lavish of her grace  she beams indulgent upon every wish  yet this time though a prince becomes your slave  i envy not but in the former sale  chance crossed the strongest purpose of my heart  your lovely prize the fair clemenes charms  assailed and won my soul  blan  you love her then  gov  too sure i love her more than words can speak  each day the passion more enflames my breast  and though she wears the sable veil of grief  though floods of tears overwhelm her starry eyes  such native beauteous innocence appears  that thought can find no other theme but her  blan  have you revealed your passion told your love  unless some sorrow of unknown import  some mighty woe lies heavy on her heart  her abject state may win her to your will  and then by showing how you wish to please  creating gratitude you will gain her love  gov  my tongue unpractised in the soothing art  but ill befits the tenderness of love  my stubborn temper with reluctance bends  to such soft feelings and i strive in vain  to deck persuasion in attractive phrase  besides i fear some settled care within   but be it as it may she shall be mine  i will luxuriously possess her charms  and cure this raging fever of my soul  blan you have my consent to try all gentle means humanity obliges me to stand her guardian against violence   but see here comes the sordid buccaneer  with a malicious joy upon his brow  to boast the merit of his savage trade  a wretch as ruthless as the prowling wolf  without one human feeling in his breast  yet vaunts that as a christian he has right  to make the most of infidels  he is here  captain driver and planters driv  well lieutenant governor i believe i have done my part this trip i have brought my full number of slaves and some such as dont come every day i was hard drove to bring the matter to bear but dick driver dont go without his errand so here they are i  have delivered them and now my lads it is your business to make the most of them in your way as i have done in mine   gov  your active spirit has served the colony captain and deserves our thanks   driv  nay do you see for that matter governor i want no complementeering i serve the colony and myself i am not one of your what do you callums that love their country better than themselves no no i plow the deep my masters and give chase to fortune with all the sail i can make when i clap her aboard she will soon strike   blan  there you are right captain fortune womanlike must be close pursued and seldom can resist the brave   driv  true spring my bowsprit and so i often told jack handspike he and i were fellowprentices and messmates as honest a fellow jack was as ever knocked off a can of slip but he had a damned troublesome companion called conscience i bid him shake hands and part but i dont know how he would row against wind and tide and now he plies before the mast while i command the charming peggy  as good a seaboat as ever swam but no matter for that he has his conscience he he he   gov but captain where are the slaves  they are long acoming   blan and who is this prince that is fallen to my lot for our lord governor   driv he is the devil of a fellow that i can tell you a prince every inch of him you have paid dear enough for him for all the good he will do you i was forced to clap him in irons and did not think the ship safe neither you are in hostility with the indians they say they threaten you daily you had best have an eye upon him   blan but who is he   driv why he is son and heir to the great king of angola a mischievous monarch in those parts who by his good will would never let any of his neighbors be quiet this son was his general a plaguey sighting fellow i have formerly had dealings with him for slaves which he took prisoners and have got pretty roundly by him but the war being at an end and nothing more to be got by the trade of the country  i made bold to bring the prince along with me   gov how could you do that   blan what steal a prince out of his own country impossible   driv twas hard indeed  however i did it  you must know this oroonoko    blan is that his name   driv ay oroonoko   gov oroonoko   driv he is naturally inquisitive about the men and manners of the white nations so because i could give him some accounts of those parts of the world i grew very much into his favor  when i made my last voyage he had quarreled with his father about some woman and grew so damned surly that he would scarce speak to any body so they desired i would get him on board my ship and try to make him merry on this i invited him i could do no less you know as he had been a friend to me i prepared my entertainment so he came in the evening and brought about twenty friends with him the punch flew about and as many of his companions as i thought would be dangerous i sent dead drunk on shore  the rest we secured and so you have the prince oroonoko     plant gad amercy captain there you was with him in faith  such men as you are fit to be employed in public affairs the plantation will thrive by you     plant ay ay industry ought to be encouraged   driv there is nothing to be done without it boys i have made my fortune this way   gov but captain methinks you have taken a great deal of pains about this prince oroonoko why did you part with him at the rate of common slaves   driv why lieutenant governor i will tell you i did intend to have carried him to england and to have shown him there but i found him troublesome upon my hands and i am glad to be rid of him at any rate  i think i hear them coming    blan many of these here doomed to drag a life of slavery know nothing better they were born slaves and only change their masters but a prince taught only to command betrayed and sold my heart drops blood for him   driv now governor here he comes pray observe him  i did not strip him and his favorite of their finery because it sets em off to the best advantage   slaves pass over two and two enter oroonoko and aboan oro so sir you have kept your word with me   driv i am better christian i thank you than to keep my word with a heathen   oro you are a christian be a christian still if you have any god that teaches you to break your word i need not curse you more let him cheat you as you are false to me ye faithful followers of my better fortune we have been fellow soldiers in the field now we are fellowslaves this last farewell be sure of one thing that will comfort us whatever world we next are thrown upon cannot be worse than this exeunt slaves driv you see governor what a bloody pagan he is but i took care none of his followers should be in the same lot with him for fear they should undertake some desperate action to the danger of the colony   oro live still in fear it is the villains curse and will revenge my chains fear even me who have no power to hurt thee nature abhors and drives thee out from the society and commerce of mankind for breach of faith men live and prosper but in mutual trust a confidence of one anothers truth that thou have violated i have done i know my fortune and submit to it  gov sir i am sorry for your fortune and would help it if i could   blan take off his chains  you know your condition but you are fallen into honorable hands you are the lord governors slave who will use you nobly in his absence it shall be my care to serve you   oro i hear you but i can believe no more  it is not the christian lure of fairfaced smiles  where lurks deceit in friendships borrowed guise  can now ensnare my deep experienced heart  that shame of nature and the human form  who bartered honesty and me for gold  professed as fair and much as you can do  whilst i determined to be just myself  thought others so and thus became a slave  gov captain i am afraid the world wont speak so honorably of this action of yours as you would wish   driv look ye lieutenant governor i dont wish about the matter  i have the money  let the world talk and be damned  i care not   oro i would forget myself  be satisfied to blandford after talking with him aside i am above the rank of common slaves let that content you  the christian there who knows me for his own sake will not discover more  driv i have other matters to mind you have him so much good may do you with your prince oroonoko  exit driver to the planters who stare at oroonoko blan what would you have there you stare as if you never saw a man before  stand farther off   oro let them stare on i am unfortunate but not ashamed of being so no let the guilty blush the white man who betrayed me honest black  disdains to change its color  i am ready where must i go dispose me as you please i am not well acquainted with my fortune but must learn to know it better  so i know you say degrees make all things easy  blan all things shall be easy  oro tear off this pomp and let me know myself the slavish habit best becomes me now hard fare and chains and whips may overpowr the frailer flesh and bow my body down but there is another nobler part of me out of your reach which you can never tame  blan you shall find nothing of this misery you apprehend we are not monsters all  some here the touch of melting pity know  our eyes have tears for merit in distress  our hearts are formed to sympathize in woe  and though your wrongs may fix a general charge  an undistinguished infamy on all  it is christian virtue to delight in good  though christian avarice breaks each social tie  oro  what is your government your boasted laws  compiled to form and civilize your states  if breach of faith is let unpunished pass  the needy wretch who steals a piece of oar  repays the injury with loss of life  while the successful subjects of deceit  who wound our natures in each vital part  receive applause and triumph in their guilt  yet still with selfish arrogance on climes  where simple honesty and nature reigns  you cast the name of savage with contempt  but know proud boasters those unlettered shores  claim brighter virtues far than art ever taught  learning and fraud are equally unknown  blan we hear with pleasure sir and must admire  those sentiments which speak a noble mind  but hope your future treatment may remove  this too just prejudice and gain esteem  you seem unwilling to disclose yourself therefore through fear the mentioning your name should give you new disquiet i presume to call you caesar  oro i am myself  but call me what you please   gov a very good name and fit for your character   oro was caesar then a slave   gov i think he was to pirates too  he was a great conqueror but unfortunate in his friends   oro his friends were christians then   blan no   oro no that is strange   gov and murdered by them  oro i would be caesar there yet i will live   blan live to be happier   oro  no let me manifest a greater soul  than to confide in that deluder hope  at whose false shrine the wretched seek relief  the weakest mind with happiness in view  though distant far can bear the pangs of woe but when upon the weary wing of thought we range the waste of desolate despair nor start a gleam of hope then the trial comes  and nature pleading for existence here  applauds the wretched who can dare to live  blan  your minds disturbed i will intrude no more  but wait upon attend and serve you  oro  do with me what you will  it is equal all  i am a slave  yet still a greater curse  renders the torments of that station worse  but wherefore touch upon my private grief  though you should feel you cannot bring relief exeunt massingano solus  thou nurse of discontent loved solitude  to thy deserted shrine my wishes bend  in thy lone walks on meditations wing  i soar above captivity and chains  again i visit africks golden shores  and fancied freedom balms my wounded mind  in the loved semblance of rejoicing friends  with all the awful charms of martial fame  and milder beauties of domestic bliss   but oh how short this visionary joy  transient and like the lightnings subtle beam  when flashing through the sable gloom of night  so swift the airbuilt column of my joy  dissolves and leaves me in the gulf of woe   sure i must dream  my eyes must play me false  or in my view a well known figure comes  with folded arms and downcast look he moves  wrapped in deep melancholy  it must it must  it cannot but be him i called my friend enter zinzo zinzo   zin  that is my name  but what art thou  that know so well what i would fain forget  mass  what thought presaged thy dubious words confirm  i must be changed indeed when thou forgetst  captivity has grasped with iron hand  and thus deformed the image of thy friend  return five years  sad period of my woes  when last thou saw me in the front of war  with fame and fortune waiting on my nod  then view these sad remains of massingano  zin  illustrious god of day to whom we bend  can it be possible  mass  too certain sure  but why do i delay to clasp the man  whom fate once kind has sent to ease my care  has sent  there friendship feels a pang  to share it too  zin  i blame not fortune but must thank her now  ever since that dreadful day of blood and death  in which thy brother and our country fell  just tribute was allowed thy honored shade  in ceaseless sorrow  and a great revenge  was deeply planned by thy illustrious fire  fierce was the conflict fatal was the event  in consequence of which thou see me here  mass  too fatal sure  oh thou have roused to view  those horrid scenes which tempest shake my soul  lulled by a slavish indolence of thought  my slumbering heart has long forgot its sphere  but now it wakes and catches the alarm  impatience strongly beats in every pulse  each laboring faculty cries out revenge  and all is raging anarchy within   but it is in vain  a lion in the toil  may roar and boldly struggle to be free  while the dull peasant from his fangs secure  in safety bold  laughs at his idle rage  zin  yet hear my friend though tyrant fortune frowns  one gleam of comfort still remains behind  know that thy deadly and victorious foe  by whose fell arm thy valiant brother died  is hither brought and sold a common slave  mass  ha oroonoko  zin  the same my friend  though ever yet invincible in war  to fairfaced treachery he fell a prey  the manner how   mass  no matter for the means  that he is here a slave let me rejoice  oh glorious ruler of the earth and skies  with brighter beams illume this happy day  since the proud enemy of peace is fallen  eternal justice fallen within my reach  and if i not repay with great revenge  the native kindred blood which he has shed  the desolative ruin of my country  may i never see those honored climes again  but after death my exiled shade be doomed  to wander ever in the christian hell  zin  such be the lot of mine if all my power  waits not attendant on your boldest views  but say my friend for much i wish to know  after we parted in the field of blood  by what dire chance you fell the victors prey  mass  remembrance sickens at the dire event  yet i will torture thought to tell thee all  when hostile nations like contending clouds  in dreadful thunder against each other rushed  the tide of battle drove us far apart  onward i flew and dealt destruction round  till i beheld the rival of my fame  at whom i bent the torrent of my rage  long held the conflict doubtful till at length  with force collected and vindictive arm  i threw a poisoned javelin at his heart  nor strength nor aim betrayed my great intent  but to preserve his life and check revenge  the wellknown white his guide and arm of war  received the wound and perished in his arms  zin though disappointed fortune here was kind  mass  it is true by sympathy his heart was stabbed  and i possessed a momentary joy  but soon on every side by crowds assailed  covered with wounds and faint with loss of blood  i sunk beneath the haughty victors feet  it is true he saved me from uplifted swords  but saved for what for something worse than death  to bear the rack of slavery and chains  zin  propose at once the method of revenge  i will lead or follow in the glorious task  though death in all its terrors should oppose  mass  have i not proved thee often in dangers front  but here i shall not need thy honest aid  i must become a christian in my scheme  invert my nature bend my stubborn heart  and work by stratagem to gain my end  thy fraudless bosom knows not arts like these  but here it is common to betray with smiles  and pierce the heart that meets thee as a friend  but let me hence and view this deadly foe  with transport view and hear his galling chains  their clink more sweet than music to my ears  then lay the basis of my great design  and in due season spring the fatal mine exeunt end of the first act act the second oroonoko and blandford oroonoko you know my story and you say you are a friend to my misfortunes that is a name will teach you what you owe yourself and me  blan i will study to deserve to be your friend when once our noble governor arrives with him you will not need my interest he is too generous not to feel your wrongs but be assured i will employ my power and find the means to send you home again  oro i thank you sir  my honest wretched friends sighing their chains are heavy they have hardly found so kind a master may i ask you sir what is become of them perhaps i should not you will forgive a stranger  blan i will enquire and use my best endeavors where they are to have em gently used  oro once more i thank you you offer every cordial that can keep my hopes alive to wait a better day what friendly care can do you have applied but oh i have a grief admits no cure  blan you do not know sir   oro can you raise the dead pursue and overtake the wings of time and bring about again the hours the days the years that made me happy  blan that is not to be done  oro no there is nothing to be done for me kneeling and kissing the earth thou god adored thou ever glorious sun if she be yet on earth send me a beam of thy allseeing power to light me to her or if thy sister goddess has preferred her beauty to the skies to be a star o tell me where she shines that i may stand whole nights and gaze upon her  blan i am rude and interrupt you  oro i am troublesome but pray give me your pardon my swollen heart bursts out its passage and i must complain o can you think of nothing dearer to me dearer than liberty my country friends much dearer than my life that i have lost the tenderest best beloved and loving wife  blan alas i pity you  oro do pity me pitys akin to love and every thought of that soft kind is welcome to my soul i would be pitied here  blan i dare not ask more than you please to tell me but if you think it convenient to let me know your story i dare promise you to bear a part in your distress if not assist you  oro thou honesthearted man i wanted such just such a friend as thou art that would sit still as the night and let me talk whole days of my imoinda o i will tell thee all from first to last and pray observe me well  blan i will most heedfully  oro there was a stranger in my fathers court valued and honored much he was a white the first i ever saw of your complexion he changed his god for ours and so grew great of many virtues and so famed in arms he still commanded all my fathers wars i was bred under him one fatal day the armies joining he before me stepped receiving in his breast a poisoned dart levelled at me he died within my arms i have tired you already  blan pray go on  oro he left an only daughter whom he brought an infant to angola when i came back to the court a happy conqueror humanity obliged me to condole with this sad virgin for a fathers loss lost for my safety i presented her with all the slaves of battle to atone her fathers ghost but when i saw her face and heard her speak i offered up myself to be the sacrifice she bowed and blushed i wondered and adored the sacred power that had subdued me then inspired my tongue inclined her heart and all our talk was love  blan then you were happy  oro o i was too happy i married her and though my countrys custom indulged the privilege of many wives i swore myself never to know but her she grew with child and i grew happier still o my imoinda but it could not last her fatal beauty reached my fathers ears he sent for her to court where cursed court no woman comes but for his amorous use he raging to possess her she was forced to own herself my wife the furious king started at incest but grown desperate not daring to enjoy what he desired in mad revenge which i could never learn he poisoned her or sent her far far off far from my hopes ever to see her more  blan most barbarous of fathers the sad tale has struck me dumb with wonder  oro i have done i will trouble you no farther now and then a sigh will have its way that shall be all  first planter   plant blandford the lieutenant governor is gone to your plantation he desires you would bring the royal slave with you the sight of his fair mistress he says is an entertainment for a prince he would have his opinion of her   oro is he a lover   blan so he says himself he flatters a beautiful slave that i have and calls her mistress   oro must he then flatter her to call her mistress i pity the proud man who thinks himself above being in love what though she be a slave she may deserve him  blan you shall judge of that when you see her sir   oro i go with you  exeunt imoinda sola  it is all in vain  i cannot sooth my woe  nor place nor prospect can afford relief  though jocund nature smiles in every part  all studied arts to heal the unquiet mind  but more perplex and minister fresh pain  though pitys hand has kindly loosed my chains  smoothed stern captivity to gentle smiles  and tried all means to flatter female pride  my widowed heart that mourns its absent mate  shuns the fond service of officious care   when martyred love lies bleeding in the breast  each faculty must feel the pangs of grief  even churlish reason yields its tyrant sway  and melts in streams of pity from the eyes  such hopeless woe is mine  yet nature still  inflexibly denies my only wish  to find a peaceful refuge in the grave  enter governor gov i have disturbed you i confess my fault my fair clemene  but begin again and i will listen to your mournful plaint sweet as the soft complaining nightingales while every word calls out my raptured soul and leaves me silent as the midnight groves speak speak again and let me wonder at the matchless power you have to charm me  imo  if sighs and tears can find the way to please  this heart these eyes may prove the source of joy  but wherefore seek you from a wretch like me  what only can be found in minds at ease  if ought but sorrow you expect to meet  your cheated senses have mistook their way  within this breast in melancholy state  despair and sadness hold their gloomy reign  and exiled pleasure flies the dreary waste  gov you must not weep i come to dry your tears and raise you from your sorrow look upon me look with the eyes of kind indulging love that i may have full cause for what i say i come to offer you your liberty and be myself your slave  my fortune power  all shall be made subservient to your will  what nature can produce or art devise  to rouse you from this lethargy of woe  now waits on your acceptance  imo  it is vain to ask  what i have not alas the power to give  yet gratitude requires to pay my thanks  for proffered kindness and experienced care  but every state is now alike to me  the senses wrapped in moping melancholy  remain unmoved at pleasures sprightly call  desist then timely from such fruitless pains  and if the friendless may demand a boon  to some lone place as gloomy as my thoughts  where barren nature wears eternal frowns  and wintry tempests howl  direct my steps  there more at ease than in the shine of life  let griefworn thought in silence reach the grave  gov  yet hear the voice of pity and of love  no more my fair admit the tyrant grief  to prey upon the roses of thy cheeks  like eastern blasts upon the flowers of spring  dry up the fountain of thy ceaseless tears  and let those eyes in native luster shine  give me thy hand and with enlivening touch  convey soft rapture to my wishing soul   you turn away and are unkindly coy  but i have urged too far to be denied  and to relieve your modesty from pain  must gently force you to comply  imo  oh sir  let me conjure you by each social tie  by whatsoever deity you serve  and all you hold most dear in earth or heaven  wound not my nature in its tenderest part  behold me thrown thus prostrate at your feet  and if my tears have any power to move  oh let them plead the rescue of my fame  or if you cannot purchase peace on cheaper terms  here kill me and remove the cause of pain  gov  nay it is ungrateful to avoid my love  but have a care lest passion turned to hate  should change the kind indulgence you have met  to treatment better fitted to a slave  imo  oh let it come i cannot fear it now  those feeble limbs in slavish garments wrapped  shall gladly toil beneath the scorching sun  or freeze beneath the winters piercing sky  then when the labor of the day is passed  and weary nature sickens for repose  contented rest upon the uncovered ground  still free in mind in spotless virtue rich  gov  it is idle all the virtue which you preach  that foe to every true enjoyment here  is but a phantom of unfeeling minds  once more i take your hand  your modesty  would draw it back  but you would take it ill  if i should let it go  i know you would   i see you must be forced to please yourself  nay if you struggle with me i must take   imo you may my life that i can part with freely but with my virtue never exit gov she is gone   curse on the pride that swells her foolish heart  and stands the bar between me and enjoyment  enter blandford and oroonoko blan governor we dont disturb i hope how has clemene listened to your suit she is thankful for the honor i suppose  gov deaf as the winds to every thing i say still when i speak to her she sighs and weeps something more near than bondage she laments  blan what do her fellow slaves say of her they perhaps may find the cause  gov it is secret still from all some who pretend more wisdom than the rest and hate it is like as she is better used assert she is with child  blan perhaps it is true and if it be so poor wretch i pity her she has lost a husband that perchance was dear and in a case like that you cannot blame her  oro if it be so indeed you cannot blame her  gov no no it is not so or if it were  i still must love her and desiring still i must possess her  blan by fair means governor  gov i will give ten slaves for her  blan she is not mine for the lord governor i drew her lot but

that had been enough to ruin me twas natures fault which made you like the sun the reasonable worship of mankind he could not help his adoration age had not locked his senses up so close but he had eyes that opened to his soul and took your beauties in he felt your power and therefore i forgive his loving you but when i think on his barbarity that could expose you to so many wrongs driving you out to wretched slavery only for being mine  then i confess i wish i could forget the name of son that i might curse the tyrant  imo i will bless him for i have found you here heaven only knows what is reserved for us but if we may guess the future by the past our fortune must be wonderful above the common size of good or ill it must be in extremes extremely happy or extremely wretched  oro it is

can among us you have some enemies that represent you dangerous and would be glad to find a reason in your discontent to fear they watch your looks but there are honest men who are your friends you

my lord  oro if he should not i will not suspect his truth but if i did what shall i get by doubting  abo you secure not to be disappointed but besides there is this advantage in suspecting him when you put off the hopes of other men you will rely upon your godlike self and then you may be sure of liberty  oro be sure of liberty what do thou mean advising to rely upon myself i think i may be sure on it we must wait it is worth a little patience turning to imoinda  abo o my lord  oro what do thou drive at  abo sir another time you would have found it sooner but i see love has your heart and takes up all your thoughts  oro and can thou blame me  abo sir i must not blame you but as our fortune stands there is a passion your pardon royal mistress i must speak that would become you better than your love a brave resentment which inspired by you might kindle and diffuse a generous rage among the slaves to rouse and shake our chains and struggle to be free  oro how can we help ourselves  abo i knew you when you would have found a way how help ourselves the very indians teach us we need but to attempt our liberty and we carry it we have hands sufficient double the number of our masters force ready to be employed what hinders us to set em then at work we want but you to head our enterprise and bid us strike  oro what would you do  abo cut our oppressors throats  oro and you would have me join in your design of murder  abo it deserves a better name but be it what it will it is justified by selfdefence and natural liberty  oro i will hear no more on it  abo i am sorry for it  oro nor shall you think of it  abo not think of it  oro no i command you not  abo remember sir you are a slave yourself and to command is now anothers right not think of it since the first moment they put on my chains i have thought of nothing but the weight of em and how to throw em off can yours sit easy  oro i have a sense of my condition as painful and as quick as yours can be i feel for my imoinda and myself imoinda much the tenderest part of me but though i languish for my liberty i would not buy it at the christian price of black ingratitude they shall not say that we deserved our fortune by our crimes murder the innocent  abo the innocent  oro these men are so whom you would rise against if we are slaves they did not make us slaves but bought us in an honest way of trade as we have done before em bought and sold many a wretch and never thought it wrong they paid our price for us and we are now their property a part of their estate to manage as they please mistake me not i do not tamely say that we should bear all that they could lay upon us but we find the load so light so little to be felt considering they have us in their power and may inflict what grievances they please we ought not to complain  abo my royal lord you do not know the heavy grievances the toils the labors weary drudgeries which they impose burdens more sit for beasts for senseless beasts to bear than thinking men then if you saw the bloody cruelties they execute on every slight offense nay sometimes in their proud insulting sport how worse than dogs they lash their fellow creatures your heart would bleed for em oh could you know how many wretches lift their hands and eyes to you for their relief  oro i pity em and wish i could with honesty do more  abo you must do more and may with honesty o royal sir remember who you are a prince born for the good of other men whose godlike office is to draw the sword against oppression and set free mankind and this i am sure you think oppression now what though you have not felt their miseries never believe you are obliged to them they have their selfish reasons may be now for using of you well but there will come a time when you must have your share of em  oro you see how little cause i have to think so favored in my own person in my friends indulged in all that can concern my care in my imoindas soft society embracing her  abo and therefore you would lie contented down in the forgetfulness and arms of love to get young princes for em  oro say thou ha  abo princes the heirs of empire and the last of your illustrious lineage to be born to pamper up their pride and be their slaves  oro imoinda save me save me from that thought  imo there is no safety from it i have long suffered it with a mothers laboring pains and can no longer kill me kill me now while i am blessed and happy in your love rather than let me live to see you hate me as you must hate me me the only cause the fountain of these flowing miseries  oro shall the dear babe the eldest of my hopes whom i begot a prince be born a slave the treasure of this temple was designed  to enrich a kingdoms fortune shall it here be seized upon by vile unhallowed hands to be employed in uses most profane  abo in most unworthy uses think of that and while you may prevent it o my lord rely on nothing that they promise you they speak you fair i know and bid you wait but think what it is to wait on promises and promises of men who know no tie upon their words against their interest and where is their interest in freeing you  imo o where indeed to lose so many slaves  abo nay grant this man you think so much your friend be honest and intends all that he says he is but one and in a government where he confesses you have enemies that watch your looks what looks can you put on to please those men who are before resolved to read em their own way alas my lord if they incline to think you dangerous they have their knavish arts to make you so and then who knows how far their cruelty may carry their revenge  imo to every thing that does belong to you your friends and me i shall be torn from you forced away helpless and miserable shall i live to see that day again  oro that day shall never come  abo i know you are persuaded to believe the governors arrival will prevent these mischiefs and bestow your liberty but who is sure of that i rather fear more mischiefs from his coming he is young luxurious passionate and amorous such a complexion when made bold by power to countenance all that he is prone to do will know no bounds no law against his lusts if in a fit of his intemperance with a strong hand he shall resolve to seize and force my royal mistress from your arms how can you help yourself  oro ha thou have roused the lion in his den he stalks abroad and the wide forest trembles at his roar i find the danger now my spirits start at the alarm and from all quarters come to man my heart the citadel of love is there a power on earth to force you from me and shall i not resist it nor strike first to keep to save you to prevent that curse this is your cause and shall it not prevail oh you were born always to conquer me now i am fashioned to thy purpose speak what combination what conspiracy would thou engage me in i will undertake all thou would have me now for liberty for the great cause of love and liberty  abo now my great master you appear yourself and since we have you joined in our design it cannot fail us i have mustered up the choicest slaves men who are sensible of their condition and seem most resolved  men whom a train of injuries have roused  to any act that may restore their freedom  or give a fair occasion of revenge  we have unbosomd mutually our griefs  and sworn if you approve a solemn league  oro  when liberty points out the glorious way  thy princes heart can never lag behind  let freedom martial her intrepid sons  and to the verge or through the gulf of fate  i will conduct their animated course  yet do not wish to shed even christian blood  abo  nor i if other means can serve our ends  if not it is done in selfdefence and then  severest justice sanctifies the deed  even fortune hitherto so much our foe  seems to relent  that ship in whose dark womb  the cave of slavery we hither came  lies in our reach within the rivers mouth  and some of those who join in our design  used by their christian tyrants in the trade  know how to steer her through the watery world  oro  how shall i thank thee for thy honest pains  which have devised and laid so bold a plan  summon thy friends and soon as rising morn  shall gild the summit of yon eastern hills  let them assemble westward of the grove  that skirts along the river side there i will appear  and join to put the wished event to proof  if we succeed i shall possess the means  to give my valiant friends a just reward  to place my loved imoinda on a throne  and gild our greatness with domestic bliss  but if an adverse fate should still

to meet  they will not fail i hope  mass  oh doubt them not  the unsuspecting subject of my hate  fired with the pleasing hopes of liberty  and undisturbed possession of his love  precipitately rushes

promise him speak him fair flatter and creep with fawning steps to get within his faith i could betray him then as he has me but am i sure by that to right myself lyings a certain mark of cowardice

represent this spectacle of horror  aboan aboan bloody my ever faithful friend  abo i have no name that can distinguish me from the vile earth where to i am going a poor abject worm that crawled a while upon a bustling world and now am trampled to my dust again  oro i see thee gashd and mangled  abo spare my shame to tell how they have used me but believe the hangmans hand would have been merciful do not you scorn me sir to think i can intend to live under this infamy i do not come for pity to complain i have spent an honorable life with you the earliest servant of your rising fame and would attend it with my latest care my life was yours and so shall be my death you must not live bending and sinking i have dragged my steps thus far to tell you that you cannot live to warn you of those ignominious wrongs whips rods and all the instruments of death which i have felt and are prepared for you this was the duty that i had to pay it is done and now i beg to be discharged  oro what shall i do for thee  abo my body tires and wonnot bear me off to liberty i shall again be taken made a slave a sword a dagger yet would rescue me i have not strength to go to find out death you must direct him to me  oro here he is gives him a dagger the only present i can make thee now and next the honorable means of life i would bestow the honest means of death  abo i cannot stay to thank you if there is a being after this i shall be yours in the next world your faithful slave again this is to try stabs himself i had a living sense of all your royal favors but this last strikes through my heart i wonnot say farewell for you must follow me dies oro in life and death the guardian of my honor follow thee i should have gone before thee then perhaps thy fate had been prevented all his care was to preserve me from the barbarous rage that worried him only for being mine why why ye gods why am i so accursed that it must be a reason of your wrath a guilt a crime sufficient to the fate of any one but to belong to me my friend has found it and my wife will soon my wife the very fears too much for life i cannot support it where imoinda oh going out she meets him running into his arms thou bosom softness down of all my cares i could recline my thoughts upon this breast to a forgetfulness of all my griefs and yet be happy but it wonnot be thou art disordered pale and out of breath if fate pursues thee find a shelter here what is it thou would tell me  imo it is in vain to call him villain  oro call him governor is it not so  imo there is not another sure  oro villains the common name of mankind here but his most properly what what of him i fear to be resolved yet must enquire he had thee in his power  imo i blush to think it  oro blush to think what  imo that i was in his power  oro he could not use it  imo what cannot such men do  oro but did he durst he  imo what he could he dared  oro his own gods damn him then for ours have none no punishment for such unheard of crimes  imo this monster cunning in his flatteries when he had wearied all his useless arts leaped out fierce as a beast of prey to seize me i trembled feared   oro i fear and tremble now what could preserve thee what deliver thee  imo that worthy man you used to call your friend   oro blandford  imo came in and saved me from his rage  oro he was a friend indeed to rescue thee and for his sake i will think it possible a christian may be yet an honest man  imo o did you know what i have struggled through to save me yours sure you would promise me never to see me forced from you again  oro to promise thee o do i need to promise but there is now no farther use of words death is security for all our fears shews aboans body on the floor and yet i cannot trust him  imo aboan  oro mangled and torn resolved to give me time to fit myself for what i must expect groaned out a warning to me and expired  imo for what you must expect  oro would that were all  imo what to be butchered thus  oro just as thou see  imo by barbarous hands to fall at last their prey  oro i have run the race with honor shall i now lag and be overtaken at the goal  imo no  oro i must look back to thee  imo you shannot need i am always present to your purpose say which way would you dispose me  oro have a care you are on a precipice and do not see whither that question leads thee o too soon thou do enquire what the assembled gods have not determined and will latest doom yet this i know of fate this is most certain i cannot as i would dispose of thee and as i ought i dare not oh imoinda  imo alas that sigh why do you tremble so nay then it is bad indeed if you can weep  oro my heart runs over if my gushing eyes betray a weakness which they never knew believe thou only thou could cause these tears the gods themselves conspire with faithless men to our destruction  imo heaven and earth our foes  oro it is not always granted to the great to be most happy if the angry powers repent their favors let em take em back the hopes of empire which they gave my youth by making me a prince i here resign let em quench in me all those glorious fires which kindled at their beams i submit myself to their high pleasure and devoted bow yet lower to continue still a slave hopeless of liberty and if i could live after it give up honor too to satisfy their vengeance to avert this only curse the curse of losing thee  imo if heaven could be appeased these cruel men are not to be entreated or believed o think of that and be no more deceived i must die i know it is fit and i can die with you  oro o thou have banished hence a thousand fears which sicknd at my heart and quite unmannd me  imo your fears for me i know you feared my strength and could not overcome your tenderness to pass this sentence on me and indeed there you were kind as i have always found you as you have ever been it is hard to part but parting thus as the most happy must parting in death makes it the easier you might have thrown me off forsaken me and my misfortunes that had been a death indeed of terror to have trembled at  oro forsaken thee my love and thrown thee off oh let those cruel stars which are my enemies witness against me in the other world if i would leave this mansion of my bliss to be the brightest ruler of their skies embracing her  imo is this the way to part  oro which is the way  imo the god of love is blind and cannot find it but quick make haste our enemies have eyes to find us out and show us the worst way takes up the dagger oro what shall i do  imo this dagger will instruct you gives it him oro ha this dagger like fate it points me to the horrid deed  imo strike strike it home and bravely save us both there is no other safety  oro it must be so  but first a dying kiss this last embrace and now   imo i am ready  oro o where shall i strike is there a smallest grain of that loved body that is not dearer to me than my eyes my bosomed heart and all the lifeblood there bid me cut off these limbs hew off these hands dig out these eyes though i should keep them last to gaze upon thee but to murder thee the joy and charm of every ravished sense my wife forbid it nature  imo it is your wife who on her knees conjures you o in time prevent those mischiefs that are falling on us you may be hurried to a shameful death and i too dragged to the vile governor then i may cry aloud when you are gone where shall i find a friend again to save me  oro it will be so thou unexampled virtue thy resolution has recovered mine and now prepare thee  imo thus with open arms i welcome you and death he drops his dagger and throws himself on the ground oro i cannot bear it o let me dash against the rock of fate dig up this earth tear tear her bowels out to make a grave deep as the center down to swallow wide and bury us together it wonnot be o then some pitying god  if there be one a friend to innocence find yet a way to lay her beauties down gently in death and save me from her blood  imo o rise it is more than death to see you thus i will ease your love and do the deed myself  she takes up the dagger he rises in haste to take it from her oro o hold i charge thee hold  imo though i must own it would be nobler for us both from you  oro oh for a whirlwinds wing to hurry us to yonder cliff which frowns upon the flood that in embraces locked we might plunge in and perish thus in one anothers arms shout imo alas what shout is that  oro i see em coming they shall not overtake us this last kiss and now  farewell  imo farewell  farewell for ever  oro i will turn my face away and do it so now are you ready  imo now but do not grudge me the pleasure in my death of a last look pray look upon me  now i am satisfied  oro so fate must be by this going to stab her he stops short she lays her hand on his in order to give the blow imo nay then i must assist you and since it is the common cause of both it is just that both should be employed in it thus thus it is finished and i bless my fate stabs herself that where i lived i die in these loved arms dies oro she is gone and now all is at an end with me soft lay her down o we will part no more but let me pay the tribute of my grief a few sad tears to thy loved memory and then i follow  but i stay too long a noise again the noise comes nearer hold  before i go there is something would be done  it shall be so and then imoinda i will come all to thee blandford and his party enter before the governor and his party swords drawn on both sides gov you strive in vain to save him he shall die  blan not while i can defend him with my life  gov where is he  oro here is the wretch whom you would have put up your swords and let not civil broils engage you in the cursed cause of one who cannot live and now entreats to die this object will convince you points to imoinda blan it is his wife alas there was no other remedy  gov who did the bloody deed  oro the deed was mine bloody i know it is and i expect your laws should tell me so thus selfcondemned i do resign myself into your hands the hands of justice  but i hold the sword for you and for myself stabs the governor and himself  it is done at length and vengeance smiles applause  now poor remains of all my soul held dear  while life affords perception to my eyes  let me gaze steadfast on thy faded form  and wash with sacred drops of faithful love  the purple streams that tinge that breast of snow  a chilly languor creeps through all my veins  a misty cloud obscures my darkened view  and wraps me round  oh let me find her gods   behold her beauties in the future world   or ever cease to be  oh imoinda  dies blan  in life in death his character maintained  he shone a great example to the world  if the bright fallies of a soul untaught  could cast such luster round  how should we blush  with such advantages in moral life  to grovel in the loathsome shade of vice  humanely just in every thought and act  this princely pagan turned to keen reproach  the tyranny and falsehood which he met  nor can it be that any mode of faith  debased by actions against natures laws  can plead for favor in a future life  wherefore let christians virtues path pursue  nor leave to pagans to be just and true  finis
