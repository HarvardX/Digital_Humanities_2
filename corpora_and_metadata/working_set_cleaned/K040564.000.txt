a lick at a liar or calumny detected  being an occasional letter to a friend from theophilus cibber comedian    it is slander whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue outvenoms all the worms of nile whose breath rides on the posting winds and does belie all corners of the world kings queens and states maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave this viperous slander enters   shakespeares cymbeline sine me  ibis in urbem hei mihi quod domino non licet ire tuo ovid london printed for r griffites in st pauls churchyard price sixpence  the preface of how small concern soever the writer of the following letter may be to the public yet as their kind opinion is of the utmost importance to him and as some scandalous aspersions and malicious representations of him are herein confuted or set in a right light his name being prefixed to it may possibly raise curiosity enough to occasion its being read  these reasons it is suggested will prove a sufficient apology for publishing what was first intended only for the private perusal of a few particular friends  a letter etc i guess business has prevented your calling on me for some time past as i know you do not want good nature besides i am certain you had me in your mind having been informed you were kind enough to speak in my behalf when my character was attacked by a low fellow who unworthily bears the name of a comedian because during a dearth of decent performers he is suffered unnoticed to murder many a part to the reproach of our present sterile stage while he modestly misconstrues the forbearance of the town into an approbation this slanderer whose soul is darker than his dusky countenance which often dingily degrades a genteel comedy by his disgraceful appearance has as i am well informed been very busy in propagating some falsehoods to my prejudice at this most unpardonable juncture when i cannot come abroad to give him an answer if he were worthy one  if his mind had the least tincture of a gentleman a name which indeed neither his birth education or morals give him the least pretensions to he would know that now to utter even a severe truth were an act of inhumanity and that to indulge spleen against the unfortunate is as base as cowardly striking the prostate what he may be pleased to say of me as an actor is delightfully despicable i have too proper a contempt for his mockjudgment not to consider his disapprobation as a compliment and must imagine any one of true taste would regard his praise as the severest satire  were i disposed to throw away my time in drawing this notorious man at full length and paint him in his proper colors which i may possibly be provoked to if he does not learn to restrain his fibbing tongue i could exhibit to view a monster which every one but his scurvy self would start at i should have held him quite beneath my notice as is all he utters but that the appetite of slander in many is too predominant and it is possible when the filthiest fellow throws a profusion of dirt some may chance to stick if not timely thrown off i shall endeavor therefore to wipe away the sooty smears of this chimneysweeper by relating a simple fact which will i flatter myself amply confute the malicious tales of this unprovoked rancorous mortal  i say unprovoked for i am not conscious i was ever guilty of an injury toward him in thought word or deed and as this viperous gnatho has ever to my face affected to be my friend his backbiting appears the more surprisingly injurious and shocking why this bad man has thus endeavored to blacken me i should not readily have been able to account for had not the entertaining inspector furnished me with the following paragraph in his essay on detraction etc  one would imagine by the spirit and eager pleasure with which calumnies are raised and propagated that men supposed they obtained into their own possession all those good qualities of the credit of which they robbed another with those who are warmest in the practice something like this is perhaps the case virtue they place in no esteem farther than as an article of reputation and in this they see it only as owing its luster to comparison they feel a thousand obstacles to raising themselves up to the level of those whom they envy but they see the same end is to be answered by bringing them down to theirs if they cannot add to the merchandise in one scale they will steal away the weights from the other and the balance will this way also appear equal  let me add a line or two more from that writer which seem apropos  he who is himself abandoned and has not virtue to inspire a resolution of reclaiming will snatch at every opportunity of scandal in another and he will urge it as a proof that all mankind are like him only that they are hypocrites  while i am expressing my contempt and detestation of this detractor let me confess my obligation to mr macklin who i understand was candid enough in my absence to contradict on his own knowledge some of the slander uttered against me this he is the more praiseworthy for and the act more particularly merits my regard as there was not any strong intimacy subsisting between us  be so good to make my compliments to him and let him know i have a grateful sense of his behavior to me  there are other chatterers in a coffeehouse i am told who like to villagecurs bark when their fellows do the most of these are the mere faggots of a theater who just serve to fill up the musterroll of a company names that now and then clutter up a playbill with as little significancy as roe and do in a writ or john anokes and tom astiles in a law case when you hear any of em mentioned you no more annex the idea of an actor to the names of the former than you do to the latter the idea of any one breathing might not one cry out with falstaef when they are seen or mentioned  i am a rogue if i am not ashamed of my company  these are a kind of parrots who fancy they entertain while their prating is but the pest of the public society yet they will be heard though they are more disturbing to a rational conversation than the pert and noisy chirpings of caged birds in a small room on a sunshiny day  among these may be one or two perhaps who by a lucky hit in some farcical extravaganza with buffoonery and impudence which with the million too frequently pass for humor and spirit sans judgment or genius gain the applause of a day and then deem themselves actors much as some modern metremongers from the success of a slight sonnet sung with universal applause forsooth at sadlerswells assume the character of poets  these choice brethren of the buskin and sock with which our present theaters too much abound are a sort of things who have no chance for being conspicuous but by the removal or abuse of actors to whom the encouragement and continued approbation of the town may have given an established reputation their little malicious envy is easily accounted for and their cobweb arts presently seen through  pour ces petits hommes du jour je me mocque de ceux but now to answer the two particular lies this bad man has told of me viz that i ran away from ireland in debt and left my bail to pay a debt for me in liverpool  how i succeeded in dublin as an actor you may have heard and a gentleman a wellwisher of mine having published an account of the irish theater in a letter from dublin to a friend in london printed in the inspector or london daily advertiser last summer which i send you enclosed see the appendix p    to that i refer you as far as relates to stage affairs  as to my conduct off the stage i may affirm i lived reputably and decently and my mind being more at ease while i was there for three years than it had been for a long time before i know of no irregularities i gave way to there that could either bring shame to myself or cause my friends to blush for me  i remained in dublin a fortnight after the theater was closed and my contract with the manager was determined i always openly declared i intended for london in the summer  but some private business calling me hither sooner than i expected i commissioned a friend to pay any debts i might accidentally have forgot and immediately after my sailing an advertisement was published and continued to that effect for several days in esdals news letter of which i have some in possession to produce if requisite and now i think i may fairly aver there is no one person there has any demand upon me  but now to return to liverpool  that i was two years since arrested at liverpool is certain  a gentleman there passed his word for my appearance  this he was the more inclineable to do as he knew the original plaintiff was not the best of men and had reason to believe the debt was honestly disputable  i yielded myself to the attorney the next day  the gentleman knowing how much the benefits for i was then acting in a company there depended on my performance and a favored friend of his having one comeing on continued his security to the attorney  some time after i came post to london in order to settle a bill in chancery which i was preparing to justify myself and the opening of the theater in dublin to which i was engaged was so near at hand being pinched in time i was under a necessity of getting thither as fast as possible  in the interim a responsible friend of mine gave the gentleman at liverpool a satisfactory counter security  had things turned out ever so bad as who can answer for law proceedings the gentleman at liverpool could not suffer but the plaintiff dying the affair was at an end  and neither one nor the other of the securities ever did or can sustain any damage  somewhat too much of this  and now i have only to add my request that you would make my compliments to all good natured friends that enquire after me  as the way from westminster hither is now abridgd and the road clean and pleasant i am in hopes having given security for the rules to see some of em at my habitation in falcon court where oh strange to tell i lodge opposite to no less a person than my half name  sake theo  k  g of c  ca  thus sport the fates with all sublunar things and prisoners make of players and of kings when the term comes diu multumque desiderat i may with the convenience of a day  rule contrive to break from this retirement if properly called on and like the roman cincinnatus from the plough once more enter on a scene of public action  dont you smile at the extravagant modesty of the comparison  laugh and welcome  you know i was always odd  however is it not a laudable ambition to be seen in good company i confess i should not be unwilling once more to tread the stage were no other advantage to accrue to me from it but the satisfaction of entertaining a town to whom i have formerly been greatly obliged  yet i cannot pretend to say in my present circumstances i should only do it pro bono publico  as our daily advertisers etc have it  so modern quacks would have it understood they vend their nostrums for the public good no let my motto be prodesse et delectare  which explained as follows shows it belongs to the actors as well as the poets  when from a candid audience we excite applause and laughter on a crowded night we have our profit they have their delight i shall not now trouble you with the epistle i designed for my lord  i had the happiness to meet him as he was going to b  h  th he did me the honor to stop his coach to talk with me near half an hour  you know his condescending affability his good humor and his many other amiable qualities which make even his inferiors happy and endear him as much to mankind in his private life as his great talents make him esteemed and honored in his public station  you will not wonder therefore when i tell you he said many goodnatured things to me and made me some compliments on my theatrical capacity which though my gratitude cannot forget em it will better become me silently to pride my self thereon than vainly to repeat em he confirmed what you had informed me that i was not unenquired after among some of the first distinction  and from what he farther said i have reason to flater myself whenever i play again i shall be honored with a noble appearance  are not you tired with reading i am of writing this long letter  perhaps you will say it is somewhat like my life  light loose negligent and unconnected  whatever may have been my faults or indiscretions i can honesty say with king lear  i have been a man more sinned against than sinful  that i may tire you no farther  fare thee well at once  i am sir your sincere obliged friend and most obedient etc the cibber  appendix a letter sent last june from a gentleman in dublin to his friend in london  referred to in the foregoing epistle page    dublin june  0      sir as i have some business that detains me here longer than i exexpected i shall now give you an epistolary account of the irish theater which i proposed to have reserved as a topic of conversation  know then i have still continued a constant playhunter and have found my time not misemployed i ever thought plays the most rational as well as the most agreeable amusement and the company of the theater royal in dublin is well worthy of encouragement the numerous and polite audiences they have had this season show the whole town are of my mind we have two theaters here but they are both rented by one person that in aungierstreet has the largest and loftiest stage but not being so conveniently situated for the town in general is rarely used unless for assemblies a dramatic opera or now and then a play that in smockalley is chiefly for plays it is a complete pretty house not so large as those of london consequently the decorations cannot be so magnificent but the scenes are very decent and the habits etc extremely handsome  the performances are various and regularly conducted no person whatever being admitted behind the scenes mr sheridan is the chief director and merits the encouragement of the public for his abilities as an actor particularly in the characters of horatio in the fair penitent macbeth hamlet and coriolanus they perform near twice the number of plays here to what they do in london and act near as many nights though their company is not near so large in number some plays have been repeated a dozen times in the season to very crowded audiences particularly the provoked husband the trip to the jubilee and the nonjuror the relapse sir fopling flutter the careless husband the double dealer the distressed mother king john jane shore the mourning bride and henry the  th have been often acted which is greatly owing to the inimitable performance of mrs woffington who charms all but chiefly the judicious in the characters of lady townly sir h wildair and maria this last mentioned part is i think one of the highest drawn characters in comedy and she does the excellent author justice nor is the success of the nonjuror a little owing to the masterly performance of mr cibber who supports the character of dr wolf throughout with a drole dignity a priestly pride insinuating cunning and affected humility as marks the character with true humor spirit and propriety and shows him a just comedian these two comedians in most of their parts excel others but in these they may be said to excel themselves  i always esteemed him a good actor but had not seen him act since the beginning of      when he appeared not in such perfect health as he seems now to enjoy with a happy flow of spirits he has this last winter given great delight in the several characters of lord foppington sir fopling flutter sir francis wronghead beau clincher polonius scrub sir paul pliant clodio don manuel barnaby brittle gomez abel drugger etc in all which he showed a thorough knowledge of life and an unconfined genius he pursues nature and plays them with admirable variety  were i to expatiate on the various merits of the three beforementioned performers i should send you a pamphlet instead of an epistle so shall only add that the contention here concerning woffington has been wherein she shone most whether in tragedy or comedy she is great in both but the latter gives her an opportunity of showing the greater variety and she is so much a mistress of her profession it is scarce easy to determine what cast of parts most properly belong to her since i have beheld her with uncommon admiration as a jane shore an hermione and andromache a constance a lady betty modish and a lady pliant in the space of a few weeks mr sheridan is excellent in maskwell and cibber and woffington are highly entertaining in the drole characters of sir paul and lady phant though my paper is almost full and your patience i doubt not well nigh tired i must mention her extraordinary performance in phoedra her attitudes were gracefully picturesque justly adapted to her various descriptions and passions none seemed forced or studied her countenance was equally expressive and she so well managed her voice she neither wanted power or variety through the whole part her queen catherine also in henry the  th and volumnia in coriolanus were fine performances nor can i decline giving praise to cibber in the character of wolsey which he performed at his second benefit the principal actors here have two each in one season to a vast audience with deserved applause  to conclude of the three performers i have here mentioned i think may be justly said what a late celebrated writer observed of one of them judiciously considered in their various lights they are but barely received as they deserve when the audience appears most favorable to them  i am sir etc  advertisement as i find there are people in the world capable of hearkening to and receiving the grossest and most improbable falsehoods as truth and having fatally experienced the error of negligently suffering such scandal to pass unnoticed or unanswered i now think it an indispensible duty to myself and the public to prosecute such vilifiers as the law directs  in order therefore to bring such vilifiers to justice i hereby offer a reward of five guineas to any creditable person that will bring legal proof of any inventor propogator writer printer or publisher of any scandalous libel etc against me  the
