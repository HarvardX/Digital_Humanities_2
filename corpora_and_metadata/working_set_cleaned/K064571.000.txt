a third discourse on the miracles of our savior  in view of the present controversy between infidels and apostates  litteratos gravissimo somno stertere convincam hieron by thomas woolston sometime fellow of sidneycollege in cambridge  london printed for the author and sold by him next door below the star in aldermanbury and by the booksellers of london and westminster      price one shiling  to the right reverend father in god richard lord bishop of st davids my lord in your sermon before the society for reformation of manners you are pleased to give discourse on christs miracles notice of them a favor that i have longed for from a considerable clergyman but could nor flatter myself with the hopes of receiving it from so great a prelate  some of the inferior clergy whom i despise for their ignorance and malice have before in their conversation represented me as an impious and blasphemous infidel and i have met with affronts for it but i never imagined that any much less your lordship would have ventured such a character of me from the press for fear of a resentment which would not be agreeable surely your lordship has not read my discourses but has taken a report of them upon trust from some ecclesiastical noodle or you could never have been so much mistaken about my design in them  i took myself to be a christian of the same faith with the fathers of the church and without vanity think i have published some tracts in defense of christianity equal if not superior to any thing this age has produced i repeatedly also in my discourses on miracles to obviate the prejudices of an ignorant clergy made solemn protestations of the sincerity of my design not to do service to infidelity but to make way for the demonstration of jesuss messiahship from prophecy but all these asseverations of the integrity of my heart it seems stand for nothing and i dont wonder at it with the clergy who in their principles their oaths and subscriptions are so accustomed to prevaricate with god and man i shall make no more serious protestations of my faith but expect your lordship should soon publish a defense of your foul charge against me that i may see what skill you have in the impious and blasphemous writings of an infidel  and if your railing accusation be not soon followed with a dissertatation of more reason i shall insist on a public reparation of the injury done to my reputation by your vile and slanderous sermon and appeal to the worshipful societies for reformation of manners whether it be not just and reasonable you should do one or the other  now i have laid hold of your lordship than whom i could not have wished for an adversary that will do me more honor to overcome i will hold you fast and you must expect to be teased and insulted from the press if you enter not the lists against me  a clear stage my lord and no favor if you have the sword of the spirit in your hand cut as sharply as you can with it i had conceived a great opinion of your learning and should have been a little apprehensive of the power of it if you had not in your sermon betrayed as great weakness and ignorance as could be in a poor curat or you had never asserted that the greek commentators adhered more strictly to the litteral sense of the holy scriptures as if you knew not that st theophilus of antioch and even origin himself and others the greatest allegorists if a comparison may be made were commentators of the greek church  the sooner your lordship appears from the press the better in as much as you may possibly prevent my publication of more discourses of this kind and that it may not be long first i will accept of a dissertation from you on any two or three of the miracles i have handled as sufficient for all take your choice of them but dont i beseech you touch the miracle of jesuss driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple because it is a hot one and may possibly burn your fingers the miracles that i have most ludicrously and of consequence most offensively handled are the two of this present discourse if you please my lord let them be the easy and short task imposed on you if you can defend the letter of the stories of these two miracles i will quietly give up the rest to you  so heartily thanking your lordship for the favor done me in taking notice of my discourses on miracles which shall be turned to good use and advantage i subscribe myself  my lord your most obliged humble servant tho woolston feb         a third discourse on the miracles of our savior etc my two former discourses having met with a favorable reception i am encouraged to go on and publish another which without any more preface i enter upon by a repetition of the three general heads at first proposed to be spoken to and they were  i to show that the miracles of healing all manner of bodily diseases which jesus was justly famed for are none of the proper miracles of the messiah neither are they so much as a good proof of his divine authority to found a religion  ii to prove that the literal history of many of the miracles of jesus as recorded by the evangelists does imply absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities consequently they either in whole or in part were never wrought as they are commonly believed nowadays but are only related as prophetical and parabolical narratives of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  iii to consider what jesus means when he appeals to his miracles as to a testimony and a witness of his divine authority and to show that he could not properly and ultimately refer to those he then wrought in the flesh but to those mystical ones that he would do in the spirit of which those wrought in the flesh are but mere types and shadows  though i have already spoken what may be thought sufficient to the first of these heads yet i have several things still both from reason and authority to add to it but having not here a convenient place for that purpose i defer it to a better opportunity and so pass immediately to the resumption of my  ii second general head and that is to prove that the literal history of many of the miracles of jesus as recorded by the evangelists does imply absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities consequently they either in whole or in part were never wrought as it is commonly believed nowa days but are only related as prophetical and parabolical narratives of what would be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by him  to this purpose i have taken into examination six of the miracles of jesus viz those    of his driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple    of his exorcising the devils out of the madmen and sending them into the herd of swine    of his transfiguration on the mount    of his healing a woman that had an issue of blood twelve years    of his curing a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and    of his telling the samaritan woman her fortune of having had five husbands and being then an adulteress with another man  whether i have not proved the storys of these miracles either in whole or in part to consist of absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities according to the proposition before us i leave my readers to judge and now will take in hand    a seventh miracle of jesus viz that matt chap xxi mark chap xi of his cursing the figtree for not bearing fruit out of season which miracle upon the bare mention of it appears to be such an absurd foolish and ridiculous if not malicious and illnatured act in jesus that i question whether for folly and absurdity it can be equalled in any instance of the life of a reputed wise man the fathers such as origin st augustine st john of jerusalem and others have all said as smart things as the wittyest infidels can against the letter of this story st augustine hoc factum nisi figuratum stultum invenitur in sermon lxxvii very plainly says that this fact in jesus upon supposition that it was done was a foolish one if therefore i treat this story a little more ludicrously than ordinary and expose the folly of the fact as well as of the modern belief of it i hope their authority and example will plead my excuse for it  jesus was hungary it seems and being disappointed of figs to the satisfaction of his appetite cursed the figtree why so peevish and impatient our divines when they please make jesus the most patient resigned and easy under sufferings troubles and disappointments of any man if he really was so he could hardly have been so much out of humor for want of a few figs to the allay of his hunger but to curse the figtree upon it was as foolishly and passionately done as for another man to throw the chairs and stools about the house because his dinner is not ready at a critical time or before it could be got ready for him  but jesus was hungry some will say and the disappointment provoked him what if he was hungry he should as he knew the return of his appetite have made a better and more certain provision for it where was judas his steward and caterer with his bag of victuals as well as money poor forecast and management amongst them or jesus had nevet trusted to the uncertain fruits of a figtree which he espied at a distance for his breakfast  and if jesus was frustrated of a longdfor meal of figs what need he have so revenged the disappointment on the nulla esset ligni culpa quia lignum sine sensu non habebat culpam augustine in sermon lxxxix senseless and faultless tree was it because he was forced to fast longer than usual and expedient not so i hope neither could not angels if he was in a desert place have administered unto him or could not he miraculously have created bread for himself and his company as he multiplied or increased the loaves for his thousands in the wilderness what occasion then for his being out of humor for want of food if he was of power to provide bread for others on a sudden he might sure have supplied his own necessities and so have kept his temper without breaking into a violent fit of passion upon present want and disappointment  but what is yet worse the time of figs was not yet when jesus looked and longed for them did ever any one here or read of any thing more quaerit poma necesciebat tempus nondum esse quod cultor arboris sciebat creator arboris nesciebat augustini in sermon lxxxix unreasonable than for a man to expect fruit out of season jesus could not but know this before he came to the tree and if he had had any consideration he would not have expected figs on it much less if he had regarded his own reputation as a wise man would he have so resented the want of them what if a yeoman of kent should go to look for pipins in his orchard at easter the supposed time hoc ideo probamus quia passionis domini dies propinquabat et scimus quo tempore passus sit ibid that jesus sought for these figs and because of a disappointment cut down all his trees what then would his neighbors make of him nothing less than a laughing stock and if the story got into our public news he would be the jest and ridicule of mankind how jesus salvd his credit upon this his wild prank and prevented the laughter of the scribes and pharisees upon it i know not but i cannot think of this part of the letter of this story without smiling at it at this day and wonder our divines are not laughed out of countenance for reading it gravely and having jesus in admiration for it  again i would gladly know whose figtree this was and whether jesus had any legal right to the fruit if happily he had found any on it or any leave or authority to smite it with a curse for its unfruitfulness as to the trees being jesuss property that could not be for he was so far from being either landlord or tenant that it is said he had not where to lay his head during the time of his ministry he was but a wanderer like a mendicant friar or an itenerant preacher and before that time was no better than a journeyman carpenter of whose workmanship i wonder the church of rome has no holy relics not so much as a threefootedstool or a pair of nutcrackers consequently he had no house nor land of his own by law much less any figtree and least of all this which he espied at a distance in his travels how then had he any right to the figs if he had met with any i hope he asked leave beforehand of the proprietor or infidels will say of him that if he had had an opportunity he would have been a roborchard and if he had no right to the fruit much less to smite the tree with a curse where was his honor arbor non est just siccata johan hierosol in loc marci his justice his goodness and his honesty in this act the evangelists if they would have us to think jesus did no wrong to any man should have left us somewhat upon record to satisfaction in this case or infidels who have here scope for it will think worse of jesus than possibly he may deserve whether jesus modestly speaking met with any blame or reprimand from the proprietor for his act of execration none can affirm or deny but if any one so spitefully and maliciously should destroy almost any other tree whether fruitful or not of another mans in this country he would have good luck if he escaped the house of correction for it  and what now have our divines to say to all this reasoning against the letter of this story nothing more than that the act of cursing the figtree whether it be at this distance of time reconcilable to reason justice and prudence or not was a supernatural work above the power of nature or art to imitate consequently it was a miracle and they will admire and adore jesus for it and to agree with them at present that it was a real miracle and a supernatural event yet i hope they will acknowledge that if jesus as st augustine si miraculum fuerat tantummodo commendandum et non alquid prophetice figurandum multo clementius dominus et sua misericordia dignius fecerat si quam aridam invenerit viridem redderet sicut languentes sanavit tunc vero e contrario quasi adversus regulam clementiae suae invenit arborem virentem praeter tempus fructus nondum habentem non tamen fructum agricolae negantem et aridam fecit in sermon lxxxix sect   says had instead of cursing the figtree made a dry dead and withered one immediately to bud flourish and revive and in an instant to bring forth ripe fruits out of season it would have pleased them much better such an instance of his power had been an indisputable miracle such an instance of his divine power had carried goodness along with it and none of the foresaid exceptions could have been made to it such an instance of his almighty power had been a demonstration of his being lord of the creation and author of the fruits of the earth for the use of man in their season or he could not have produced them out of season in such an instance of power his divine care and providence against hunger and want would have been visible and it would have been an admonition to us to depend daily upon him for the comforts and necessaries of life such an instance of his power would have been as st augustine says above like his miracles of healing diseases of making the languid sound and the feeble strong and we might more certainly have inferd from one with the other that both were the operations of a good god but this instance of his cursing the figtree in this fashion spoils the credit and sullies the glory of his other miracles it is in its own nature of such a malevolent aspect that its enough to make us suspect the beneficence of christ in his other works and to question whether there might not be some latent poison and diabolical design under the color of his fairer pretenses to almighty power it is so like the malignant practices of witches who as stories go upon envy grudge or distaste smite their neighbors cattle with languishing distempers till they die that it is hard if not impossible to distinguish one from the other in spite and malice if mahomet and not jesus had been the author of this miracle our divines would presently have discovered the devils foot in it and have said that satan drew him into a scrape in the execution of this mad and foolish frolic on purpose to expose him for a wizard and his musselmen of all ages since for fools in believing on him the spirit of christ who is all love and mercy should one would think breath forth nothing but goodness and kindness to mankind but that such a pestilential blast like a mortiferous northeast wind in some seasons should proceed from his mouth to the destruction of another mans harmless and inossensive tree is what none upon earth can account for  our divines one or other of them have published several notable notions about miracles and have laid down good rules to distinguish true from false ones but none of them as far as i perceive have taken any pains to show the consistence of jesuss miracles to their own rules and notions mr chandlerwho as the archbishop see archbishop wakes letter to mr chandler which is handed about town and country says has rightly stated the notion of a miracle among his rules of judging by whom miracles are performed says vindication of the christian religion p    that the things pretended to be done are to be such as that it is consistent with the perfections of god to interest himself in and again they must be such as answer to the character of god as a good and gracious being and again it seems reasonable to believe that whenever the first and best of beings is pleased to send an extraordinary messenger with a revelation of his will he will furnish him with such proofs of his mission as may argue not only the power of him in whose name he comes but his love to mankind and his inclination to do them good i have no dislike to these notions of mr chandler but as it is not to be questioned that he and the archbishop too had this miracle of jesuss cursing the figtree and some others as of his boisterous driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple of his sending the devils into the herd of swine of his turning water into wine for the use of men who had before well drank etc in his view when he gave forth the foresaid rules for acute and learned writers in theology are supposed to have their wits about them so it is to be hoped that he or the archbishop will soon publish somewhat to reconcile these miracles of jesus to their own notions though i dont expect it before latter lammas  but after all it may be questioned if infidels should go about it whether this work of jesus was miraculous and whether there was not more of the craft of man than of the power of god in it or to use mr chandlers ibid words whether it dont look like the little tricks and cunning deceits of impostors st matthew says presently the figtree withered away but this presently is an indeterminate time and may be understood of a day or a week or two as well as of the moment in which the words were spoken let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever st mark says that in the morning as the disciples passed by they saw the figtree dried up from the roots which was at least the day quod sequenti die viderint exaruisse ficum theophylact in locum marci after the curse was uttered so that there was certainly four and twenty hours for its withering and if it is said that the tree dried up from the roots it does not imply that the trunk of it perished or was reduced to nothing but only that the green leaves of the whole and of every part of it were in a withering condition and might not all this be done without a miracle what if jews and infidels should say that jesus being minded to impose on his disciples and followers took a secret opportunity beforehand to lay his capenters ax to the root of this tree and so imperceptibly circumcised it as that the leaves did what they will do wither in a night and a days time god forbid that i should think jesus did so but as to the possibility of such a fraud in an impostor none can doubt of it  i am so far from thinking there was any such fraud in this supposed miracle of jesus that i dont believe it was at all done by him according to the letter and for this i have not only a clear and intrinsic proof from the story itself but the authority of the fathers st ambrose treating on the parable of the figtree in chap xiii st luke intimates that what st matthew and st mark write of jesuss cursing the figtree is but quid sibi vult quod in evangelio suo dominus fici parabolam frequenter inducit habes enim alibi quod jussu domini viriditas omnis hujus ligni frondentis aurerit in loc lucae part of the same parable and st john of jerusalem vidiamus ubi alibi scriptum de is it a ficu in evangelio secundum lucam legimus etc in loc marci hom xii says expressly enough that the three evangelists write of one and the same figtree consequently parabolically and that what st matthew and st mark write of it was no more a literal transaction than the parable in st luke thanks to these holy fathers for their ridding us of the belief of the letter of this story which otherwise might have perplexed us with its absurdities before urged and to their opinion i desire it may be added and considered whether it be not as reasonable in itself to take what the three evangelists write of this figtree as part of one story as well as what they write of the woman with her issue of blood and of jesuss casting the devils out of the madmen and of other miracles which are but several relations of the same story parable or miracle neither is it any argument for a literal transaction of this miracle that the evangelists speak of it as a thing done for as origin says there are some things spoken of in the evangelists as facts which were never transacted so it is of the nature of prophecy and our savior in his whole life prophesied to speak of things to come as if they were already past because such prophecies are not to be understood till after their accomplishment and then the reason of the use of the praeter instead of the future tense in prophecy will be visible but what in my opinion is an absolute demonstration that there is no truth in the letter of this story is what our savior adds upon the disciples wondering at the sudden withering of the figtree saying matthew chap xxi    that if they had faith they should not only do what was done to the figtree but should say to this mountain that was near him i suppose be thou removed and cast into the sea and it shall be done but these things were never literally done by them consequently jesus himself did not literally curse the figtree or the disciples wanted faith for the doing the said miracles which is an absurdity to suppose or jesus talked idly of a promise to invest them with a power they were never to be possessed of but of what ill consequence to religion either of these suppositions is let the old objection in paschasius ratbertus quanquam igitur juxta literam haec facta non legantur ab apostolis sicut quidam paganorum calumniati sunt et garriunt contra nos etiam in suis scriptis asserentes apostolos non habuisse fidem quia montes non transtulerunt neque ficulneas verbo exsiccarunt in loc matthew speak which i shall not stay here to urge and revive but only say at present that if jesus actually cursed a figtree his disciples ought to have done so too and to remove mountains if we adhere to the letter in one case we must in the other also but we are only to look to the mystery in both or st augustine legimus apostolorum miracula nusquam autem legimus arborem ab his arefactam aut montem in mare translatum quaeramus ergo in mysterio ubi factum sit non enim verba domini vacare potuerant in sermon lxxxix will tell us that jesus uttered vain empty and insignificant words and promises  st augustine who believes no more of the letter of this story than i do says that works of jesus are all figurative and of a spiritual signification which is so manifest from his act of cursing the figtree as men must sed futurum aliquid miraculo commendasse multa sunt quae nos admoneant nobisque persuadeant imo ab invitis exterqueant ibid whether they will or not acknowledge it but he is mistaken though there might be none in his time who would question that this supposed fact of jesus had a mystical signification yet if he had lived in our days he would have met with divines who for all the foresaid absurdities and their cogency to drive us to allegory do adhere to the letter only whether the truth credibility and reasonableness of it be defensible or not but then to do justice to st augustins assertion he would have met with others who against their wills interpret this miracle figuratively such as dr hammond and dr whitby who say jesus cursed the figtree by way of type of the destruction of the jewish state which declined and wasted away after the similitude of this withering tree but why then dont these commentators allegorically interpret and apply other miracles of our savior because they think the letter will stand good and abide the test without an allegory and why do they allegorise this miracle only because of the dificulties and absurdities of the letter which they cannot account for and are these reasons good no certainly the evangelists should have made the distinction for them they should have told us which miracles are to be allegorisd and mystically applied and which are not or we are to allegorise all or none at all how came these modern allegorists of this miracle to apply it as they do and to make it a mystical representation of the ruin of the jewish state did they take up this notion of their own heads or did they borrow it of the fathers why in all probability they took the hint from the fathers wherefore then dont they what none of them do cite and acknowledge their authors for it because like men of subtilty they would be thought to devise it of themselves for if they had quoted the fathers for it the fathers would have obliged them upon their authority to allegorise the rest of jesuss miracles in the way that i have interpreted some of them but this would not have agreed with their stomachs for many reasons no thanks then to the aforsaid commentators for their allegorical application of this miracle which they are again to desert or abide the consequence of allegorising others also which for their interests and reputations they will not do therefore let them return again to the letter of this miracle and say for it what is all that is to be said for it with victor antiochenus an apostatical writer of the fifth century porro quando in hunc locum incidimus nemo curiose inquirat aut anxie disputet justene an and secus factum sit sed miraculum editum contempletur et admiretur nam de submersis porcis quoque nonnulli hanc quaestionem moverant factumque justitiae color destitutum praedicare veriti non sunt in loc marci that when we read this passage of scripture concerning the figtree jesus cursed we ought not curiously to enquire whether it was wisely or justly done of jesus or not but we ought to contemplate and admire this miracle as well as that of jesus s drowning the swine notwithstanding some think it void of the face of justice ay ay our divines must allegorise all jesus s miracles or betake themselves to this opinion of victor which this freethinking age will hardly let them quietly rest in so supposing our divines to be what they generally are still ministers of the absurdity of the letter i pass to the consideration of the authority of the fathers and to see whether we cannot learn of them this parable of the figtree  who or what is meant by the figtree seems not to be agreed among the fathers or more properly speaking they are not agreed all of them to apply it always to one and the same thing some as quid arbor fici nisi humanam naturam designet in homil xxxi gregory the great say human nature or mankind is typified by the figtree others as in ficu synogogae positum exemplum est in loc matt st hilary say the jewish church or state is meant by it others as absit a nobis ut jesu veniente ad nos et volente manducare de ficu  ecclesiae non inveniatur fructus in ea in matthew tract xxx origin say it is a type of the church of christ so do the fathers seem to be divided in their opinions but it is without any difference or inconsistency with each other for as there is according to the fathers mystery upon mystery in all the actions of jesus so i believe the figtree here as a type may be properly enough applied to the foresaid three purposes and if the fathers had been asked their opinion in this case i dare say they would have said so too this is certain that origin pote autem ficus illa intelligi populus circumcisionis ibid understands it as applicable to the jewish as well as the christian church and st augustine as occasion offers itself takes it in the foresaid three senses when they understand it as a type of all mankind they say that the three years of its unfruitfulness are to be interpreted of the arbor ficulnea genus humanum est  triennium autem tria sunt tempora unum aute legem alterum sub lege tertium sub gratia st augustine in sermon cx three grand periods of the world the one before the law of moses another under the law and the third under the gospel at the conclusion of which third period as it was an ancient and common opinion jesus in spirit would come to his figtree of mankind and animadvert on them for their unfruitfulness not by any destruction of human nature but by a cessation of its unfruitful state which then will wither away and be turned into a fruitful one against the grand sabbath or acceptable year which is the year signified in the parable that it is to be let alone to bring forth fruit in they that understand the figtree as a type of the jewish state mean by the three years jesus came to it the three years of his preaching among the jews at the end of which after christs passion and resurrection the jewish state like the figtree withered away and for its unfruitfulness was rooted up they that understand the figtree as a figure of the church of christ by the three years mean the apocalyptical twelve hundred and sixty days that is three years and a half of the churchs barren and unfruitful state in the wilderness at the conclusion of which the fathers say jesus will come again to his church or figtree seeking fruit on it  some perhaps may be ready here to interpose with a question and say how will jesus then come to his church i have carefully perused the fathers upon this question and cannot find that they mean any more by christs second or spiritual advent than that clear truth right reason and divine wisdom which are the mystical names of jesus will descend upon the church on the clouds of the law and the prophets to the removal of her unfruitful and unprofitable errors and to enable her to bring forth the fruits of the spirit against the grand sabbath neither can any reasonable man conceive how otherwise jude ver    the lord should come not with ten thousand of his saints as our translation has it but  that is as origin interprets in his holy thousands of allegorists  to criticize upon all the scripture and to convince ministers of the letter of their abominable errors and of their horrid blasphemies spoken preached and printed against the holy ghost or spirit of the law and prophets as to that litteral and common pulpitstory with all its appendages of jesuss second coming on aetherial clouds as on a woolsack in his human though glorious and majestic appearance for the resurrection of mens bodies by sound of a trumpet in the audience of the dead etc it is the most absurd nonsensical and unphilosophical such groundless and worthless stuff have the clergy sold and preached to gods people that ever was told against reason against prophetic and evangelical scripture and against other ancient and good authority it is no place here to multiply testimonies and arguments to either of these purposes which my readers if they do but attend will see no occasion for but if our divines should think i have put a false gloss on the text of st jude above i have a bundle of arguments and testimonies to produce in defense of it at their service  in the parable of st luke it is said lo these three years come i seeking fruit on this figtree as if jesus came annually and successively for three years together but according to the original it ought to be read lo it is three years and   now come or lo the three years are now past and i come and here it is to be noted that whether we understand the figtree as a figure of the church in particular or of mankind in general the mystical number of three years will terminate about the same time against the evangelical sabbath on which the unfruitfulness of the church or of mandind according to the fathers is to have an end put to it  and jesus when he came to the figtree found nothing thereon but leaves only so jesus when he comes to his church will find nothing in her but leaves only and what is here meant by leaves let the fathers such as inveniet infaecundam foliis tantomodo vestitam id est verbis inanibus gloriantem sed fructibus vacuam operibus quippe bonis sterilem in loc matt st hilary st john habentem folia et non fructus verba non sensus scripturas non intelligentiam scripturarum in loc marci of jerusalem and folia sola habentem hoc est apparentem litteram non fructus spiritus in loc matt st theophylact tell us who by leaves understand a vain and empty appearance of wisdom and good works or the words and letter of the scriptures which are the leaves of the oracle without any figs of spiritual interpretations of them and wheher this bent the case of the church at present our divines are to consider the figs that jesus may be supposed to look for at his coming are not only the fruits of the spirit mentioned by st paul but quaerens non sensiles fructus sed intellectilem ex lege et prophetis dulcemque faecundiratem caesarii in dialog  0 spiritual interpretations of the scriptures which st jerome ficus sunt dona dulcissima spiritus sancti spiritualia dogmata et scientia scripturarum in agg cap ii says are mystical figs because as ripe figs are sweet to the palate of our mouths so are they no less delicious to the soul of man  but jesus is said to be hungry after figs so will jesus in spirit hunger for the mystical figs of his church that is as origin esuriit autem jesus semper in justis volens manducare fructum spiritus sancti in eis in matt tract xxx rightly interprets he will earnestly desire like a man that is hungry the fruits of the spirit in his church which will be as grateful to him as figs can be to a man naturally to understand this expression of jesuss hunger literally is such a mean circumstance of life that unless it be what is next to impossible necessarily introductory to some noble transaction it is unfit to be remembered of a saint in history diogenes laertius would have disdained to mention such a frivolous circumstance in the life of a philosopher as this of jesus but if we understand this hunger in jesus mystically and figuratively of his desires of the fruits of the spirit in his church it is sublime and noble and the emblem confessedly proper and instructive  but jesus is said to come to the figtree at an unseasonable time for the time of figs was not yet which expression has been the perplexity of commentators who with all their wit and sagacity cannot get well over it i shall not mention here all or any of their pretended solutions of this difficulty but let us see whether we cannot easily and at once unlose it st marks words are  which are and have been commonly translated for the time of figs is not yet but if we change the point into an interrogation and read thus for was it not the time of figs the difficulty vanishes as certainly as that it is absurd to suppose christ should come to his figtree and look for fruit when he could not reasonably expect any this my solution of this difficulty certainly serves the purpose of the mystical interpretation and if it does not the litteral i answer we are not to heed the letter which seldom or never has any sense or truth in it but by the by it does the litteral too since there are no grounds from the text to think what has been the common opinion that it was about the jewish passover that jesus came to the figtree if this my solution of the difficulty dont please i must say with ad quem locum intelligendum ut oportet expectandum esse eliae ut nonnuquam loquuntur veteres de locis obscurissimis adventum in exercitat sac lib ii cap   heinsius that it must be left as a knot for elias to untie who according to the fructus dulces omne genus de arbore vitae comedendum praebebit elias apud buxtorf synag p     ancient jews is first to gather fruits off this mystical figtree and present them to the intellectual taste of mankind but that my solution is good will appear by what follows  and jesus finding leaves only says in st matthew to the figtree let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever which with its parallel place in st mark is in my opinion a false translation the original is  and ought to be englished not as yet or not until now that i came against the grand age of the sabbath has fruit grown on thee so that the miracle of jesus was to make the figtree of the church fruitful and if her preceding unfruitful state which in st mark jesus is said to curse or rather to devote to ruin wasted away it was by consequence  but what time of day was it that jesus came to the figtree it was in the morning and of what day that is uncertain as to the letter but according to the mystical extent of the three years whether we understand the figtree as a type of the church or of all mankind of all ages it will be on the morning of the great sabbath when upon the appearance of the light of christ like the rising of the sun an unfruitful and erroneous church must needs wither away and the disciples on the said morning will as origin oculis spiritalibus viderunt mysterium fici siccatae matt tract xvi says with their intellectual eyes behold her waste with admiration and then too they under christ will do what is done to the figtree of the church and remove mountains of antichristian power that exalt themselves against him as the fathers interpret and i need not explain  and what is meant by the means which st luke speaks of to make the figtree of the church fruitful on the sabbatical year the year it is to be let alone to bear fruit in there must be digging about it that is effodientes literam legis cyril glaphyr l   p  into the earth of the letter of the scriptures and dunging of it that is calling mittitur ergo cophinus stercoris ad radicem arboris quando pravitatis suae conscientia tangitur memoria cogitationis gregor m in hom xxxi to remembrance her sins and errors of the time past which rationally speaking will make the church to bring forth good fruit  after this fashion is the rest of the parable of the figtree to be allegorized out of the fathers st gregory sed hoc significat ficulnea infructuosa quod mulier inclinata et hoc ficulnea reservata quod mulier erecta hoc autem et octodecem annorum numero signatur quod tertio die dominus vineae ficulneam venisse perhibetur in homil xxxi the great and st augustine make these two stories or parables viz of the figtree and of the woman with her spirit of infirmity as they are blended together in st luke to be figures of the same mystery the eighteen years of the womans infirmity and the three years of the figtrees unfruitfulness they will have to be mystically synchromical and the womans incurvity to the earth is they say significative of the same thing with the unfruitfulness of the figtree and the erection of the woman on the sabbath is of the same import with the reservation of the tree for fruitfulness on that day and let any one see if they dont admirally agree as i have interpreted these two parables  before i dismiss this story of the figtree i cannot but adore the providence of god that the miracle has been hitherto placed in the withering away of the tree if the miracle had been a plain story of a dead and withered trees being made to bring forth leaves and fruit on a sudden this would have been such a manifestly supernatural work and so agreeable to modern notionists about miracles that mens thoughts would have been so absorpt in the consideration of the letter as they would never have extended them to the contemplation of the mystery and our divines would have made such a noise in our ears of the excellency and marvellousness of such a miracle as that there would be no bearing of it but but as the evangelists have in a good measure suppressed all mention of the after fruitfulness of the tree and the story by misconstruction is clogged with the foresaid difficulties and absurdities we are of necessity driven to the search after mystery for good sense and truth in it  and thus have i spoken enough to the miracle of jesuss cursing the figtree which according to the letter is a foolish and absurd story but the mystical operation of which the letter is a shadow will be ravishing marvelous and stupendous and not only a proof of christs power and presence in his church but a demonstration of his messiahship in as much as an infinite number of prophecys upon prophecys will thereupon be discerned to be accomplished or the church cannot bring forth the fruits of the spirit that is spiritual interpretations of the scriptures like ripe figs and so i pass to an    eighth miracle of jesus and that is john chap v of his healing a man of an infirmity of thirty eight years duration at the pool of bethesda that had five porches in which lay a great multitude of impotent folk blind halt withered waiting the troubling of the waters upon the descent of an angel who gave a sanative virtue to them to the curing of any one be his distemper of what kind soever who first stepped down into them  this whole story is what our savior calls a camel of a monstrous size for absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities which our divines and their implicit followers of these last ages have swallowed without chewing whilst they have been straining at knats in theology and hesitating at frivolous and indifferent things of the church of no consequence  as to jesuss miracle in this story which consisted in his healing a man of no body knows what infirmity there neither is nor can be proved any thing supernatural in it or there had been an express description of the disease without which it is impossible to say there was a miraculous cure wrought as far as one may reasonably guess this mans infirmity was more lazyness than lameness and jesus only shamed him out of his pretended illness by bidding him to take up his stool and walk off and not lie any longer like a lazy lubbard and dissembler among the diseased who were real objects of pity and compassion or if he was no dessembler he was only fancyfully sick and jesus by some proper and seasonable talk touched his heart to his relief and so by the help of his own imagination he was cured and went his way this is the worst that can be made of this infirm mans case and the best that can be said of jesuss power in the cure of him as will appear by and by upon examination into it but the other parts of the story of the healing virtue of the waters upon the descent of an angel into them is not only void of all good foundation in history but is a contradiction to common sense and reason as will be manifest after an inquiry into the particulars of it  st john was the beloved disciple of our lord and i hope he loved his master or he was worse than an heathen who loves those who love him but this story and some others that are peculiar to his gospel such as of jesuss telling the samaritan woman her fortune of his healing the blind man with eye salve made of clay and spittle of his turning water into wine for the use of men who had before well drank and of his raising lazarus from the dead are enough to tempt us to think that he wilfully designed either to blast the reputation of his master or to try how far the credulity of men who through blind love were running apace into christianity might be imposed on or he had never related such idle tales which if the priesthood who should be the philosophical part of mankind had not been amply hired into the belief of them would certainly have been rejected with indignation and scorn before now  st john wrote his gospel many years after the other evangelists what then should have been his peculiar business certainly nothing more than to add some remarkable passages of life to jesuss honor which they had omitted and to confirm the truths which they had before reported of him but st john is so far from doing this that the stories he has particularly added are not only derogatory to the honor of jesus but spoil his fame for a worker of miracles which the other evangelists would raise him to by reading the other evangelists one would think that jesus was a healer of all manner of diseases however incurable by art and nature and that wherever he came all the sick and the maimed excepting a few infidels were perfectly cured by him but this story before us will be like a demonstration that jesus was no such worker of miracles and healer of diseases as he is commonly believed to have been and that he wrought not near the number of cures he is supposed to have done much less any great ones the best conception that an impartial reader of the gospel can form of jesus is that he was a tolerable good natural orator and could handsomely harangue the people off hand and was according to the philosophy of the times a good cabalist and his admirers finding him endewed with the gift of utterance which was thought by them more than human they fancied he must have the gift of healing too and would have him to exercise it which he did with success upon the fancies and imaginations of many who magnified his divine power for it and the apostles afterward to help forward the credulity and delusion of the people amplified his fame with extravagant assertions and strange stories of miracles passing the belief of considerate and wise men whether this representation of the case according to the letter of the gospels be false and improbable let my readers judge by the story before us which i come now to dissect and make a particular examination into the several parts of it accordingly it is to be observed  first that this story of the pool of bethesda abstractedly considered from jesuss cure of an infirm man at it has no good foundation in history it merits no mans credit nor will any reasonable person give any heed to it st john is the only author that has made any mention of this story and though his authority may be good and better than another mans in relation to the words and actions of jesus in as much as he was most familiar and conversant with him yet for foreign matters that have no immediate respect to jesuss life he is no more to be regarded than another historian who if he palm upon his readers an improbable tale of senseless and absurd circumstances will have his authority questioned and his story pried into by the rules of criticism and rejected or received as it is found worthy of belief and credit if there had been any truth in this story before us i cannot think but josephus or some other jewish writers it is so remarkable peculiar and astonishing an instance of the angelical care and love to the distressed of jerusalem would have spoken of it but i dont find they have or our modern commentators would have referred to them as to a testimony of the credibility of the gospelhistory josephus has professedly written the history of the jewish nation in which he seems to omit nothing that makes for the honor of his country or for the manifestation of the providence of god over it he tells us of the conversation of angels with the patriarchs and prophets and intermixes extrascriptural traditions as he thought them fit to be transmitted to posterity how came he then and all other jewish writers to forget this story of the pool of bethesda i think we may as well suppose that a writer of the natural history of somersetshire would neglect to speak of the medicinal waters of bath as josephus should omit that story which if true was a singular proof of gods distinguishing care of his peculiar people or an angel had never been frequently as we suppose sent to this relief of the diseased amongst them is then st johns single authority enough to convey this story down to us some may say that there are several prodigies as well as political events of ancient times that though they are reported but by one historian meet with credit and why may not st johns testimony be equal to another writers i grant it and though it is hardly probable but that this story if true before us must have had the fortune to be told by others yet st johns single authority shall pass sooner than another mans if the matter be in itself credible and well circumstancd but were it is blindly imperfectly and with monstrously incredible circumstances related like this before us it ought to be rejected which brings me  secondly to ask what was the true occasion of the angels descent into this pool was it to wash and bath himself or was it to impart an healing quality to the waters for some one diseased person the reason that i ask the first of these two questions is because some ancient readings of v   say vid milli nov test in loc the angel  was washed which supposes some bodily defilement or heat contracted in the caelestial regions that wanted refrigeration or purgation in these waters but how absurd such a thought is needs no proof to impart then compassionately an healing power to the waters for the benefit of the diseased was the sole design of the angels descent into them and god forbid that any should philosophically debate the matter and enquire how naturally the waters derived that virtue from the angels corporal presence the thing was providential and miraculous our divines will say and so let it pass but i may fairly ask why one diseased person only at a time reaped the benefit or why the whole number of impotent folks were not at once healed i have a notable answer presently to be given to these questions but i am afraid beforehand our divines will not approve of it therefore they are to give one of their own and make the matter consistent with the goodness and wisdom of god or the said questions spoil the credit of the story and make an idle and ridiculous romance of it and when their hands are in to make what is impossible a satisfactory answer to the said questions i wish that for the sake of orthodoxy they would determine whether the angel descended with his head or his heels foremost or whether he might not come swauping upon his breast into the waters like a goose into a horsepond but  thirdly how often in the week the month or the year did the angel vouchsafe his descent into the pool and for how many ages before christs advent and why not since and even quare modo non movetur aqua st ambros de sacrament lib c   now was this gracious and angelical favor granted st john should have been particular as to these points which he could not but know philosophers would be curious to enquire about if it was but once in the year as st chrysostom  in sermon contra eberictatem hints little thanks are due to him for his courtesy one would think sometimes that his descent was frequent or such a multitude of impotent folk variously disordered had never attended on it and again at other times one would think that his descent was seldom or the diseased as fast as they came which could not be faster than the angel could dabble himself in the waters had been charitably dismissed with restored health here then is a defect in st johns story and a block at which wise and considerate freethinkers will stumble but  fourthly how came it to pass that there was not better care taken either by the providence of god or of the civil magistrates of jerusalem about the disposal of the angelical favor to this or that poor man according to his necessities or deserts but that he who could fortunately catch the favor was to have it just as he who runs fastest obtains the prize so here the diseased who was most nimble and watchful of the angels descent and could first plunge himself into the pool carried off the gift of sanation an odd and a merry way of conferring a divine mercy and one would think that the angels of god did this for their own diversion more than to do good to mankind just as some throw a bone among a kennel of hounds for the pleasure of seeing them quarrel for it or as others cast a piece of money among a company of boys for the sport of seeing them scramble for it so was the pastime of the angels here it was the opinion of some heathens that homines sunt lusus deorum the gods sport themselves with the miseries of mankind but i never thought before i considered this story that the angels of the god of the jews did so too but if they delighted in it rare sport it was to them as could be to a townmobb for as the poor and distressed wretches were not to be supposed to be of such a polite conversation as in complaisance to give place to their betters or in compassion to make way for the most miserable but upon the sight or sound of the angels fall into the pool would without respect of persons strive who should be first so those who were behind and unlikely to be cured would like an uncivilizd rabble push and press all before them into it what a number then of some hundreds perhaps of poor creatures were at once tumbled into the waters to the diversion of the city mob as well as of gods angels and if one arose out of it with the cure of his disease the rest came forth like drowned rats to the laughter of the foresaid spectators and it was well if there was not sometimes more mischief done than the healing of one could be of advantage to those people believe then this part of the story let him that can if any angel was concerned in this work it was an angel of satan who delights in mischief and if he healed one upon such an occasion he did it by way of bait to draw others into danger of life and limb but as our divines will not i suppose bear the thoughts of it is being a bad angel so i leave them to consider upon our reasonings whether it was credible that either a good or a bad angel was concerned and desire them to remember to give me a better reason why but one at a time was healed  if any pool or cistern of water about this city of london was so blessed with the descent of an angel to such an end the magistrates such is their wisdom would if god did not direct take care of the prudent disposal of the mercy to the best advantage of the diseased and if they sold it to an infirm lord or merchant who could give for it most money to be distributed among other poor and distressed people would it not be wisely done of them to suppose they would leave the angelick favor to the struggle of a multitude is absurd and incredible and why then should we think otherwise of the magistrates of jerusalem away then with the letter of this story and if this be not enough to confute it then  fifthly let us consider to its farther confutation who and what were the impotent folk that lay in the porches of bethesda waiting the troubling of the waters st john says they were blind halt withered and as some manuscripts vid milli nov test in loc have it paralyticks and what did any of these there how could any of them be supposed to be nimble enough of foot to step down first into the waters and carry off the prize of sanation before many others of various distempers though the troubled waters might be of such medicinal force as to heal a man of whatsoever disease he had yet none of the foresaid persons for want of good feet and eyes could expect the benefit of it though the ears of the blind might serve him to hear when the angel plumpt like a stone into the waters yet through want of sight for the guidance of his steps he would by others be jostled out of the right way down into them and if the lame had good eyes to discern the the descent of the angel yet feet were all in all to this purpose consequently these impotent folk specified by st john might as well have slayd at home as resorted to bethesda for cure i know not what fools the diseased of jerusalem of old might be but if there was such a prize of health to be strove for by the distempered of this city i appeal to all men of common sense whether the blind the lame the withered and paralyticks would offer to put in for it st john then forgot himself or else blundered egregiously or put the banter upon us to try how far an absurd tale would pass upon the world with credit there might be if there was any litteral sense in the story many of other distempers but there could be neither blind halt nor withered without such an absurdity as absolutely disparages the story blasts the credit of the relator or rather brings to mind the assertion of st ambrose that the letter of the new as well as the old testament lies abominably if what i have here said does not overthrow the letter of this story then what i have  sixthly to add will do it more effecttually and that is of the certain man that had an infirmity thirty and eight years and lay at this pool for an opportunity to be cured of it though these thirty and eight years are in our english translation praedicated of this mans infirmity yet more truly according to the original are they spoken of the time he lay there and the fathers so understood st johns words what this mans infirmity was we are uncertain for  weakness or infirmity is a general name of all distermpers and may be equally applied to one as well as to another whereupon though we cannot certainly say from this mans infirmity that he was a fool to lay there so long expecting that cure which it was impossible for him to obtain yet what he says to our savior i have no man when the waters are troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me does imply his folly sufficiently or rather the incredibility of the whole story what then did this infirm man at this pool if he had neither legs of his own good enough nor a friend to assist him in the attainment of sanarion was he not a fool if it was possible for any to be so great a one for his patience would it not have been as wisely done of him to wait in the fields so long the falling of the sky that he might catch larks the fathers say this mans infirmity was the palsy but whether they said so for the sake of the mystery or to expose the letter i know not but that distemper after thirty and eight years duration and increase if it was more curable than another at first had in that time undoubtedly so weakened and rendered him incapable to struggle with others for this relief that it is without sense and reason to think he should wait so long for it our divines if they so please may commend this man for his patience but after a few years or rather a few days experience another man would have been convinced of the folly and vanity of his hopes and returned home if he could not put in for this benefit with prospect of success in his more youthful days when the distemper was young too much less reason had he to hope for it in his old age after thirty and eight years affliction unless he dreamed of what was not to be imagined an opportunity without molestation and competition to go off with it whatever then our divines may think of this man and his patience i will not believe there ever was such a fool and for this reason will not suppose st john could literally so romance unless he meant to bambouzle mankind into the belief of the greatest absurdity a man that lies with a grace to deceive others makes his story so hang together as to carry the face and appearance of truth along with it which this of st john that for many ages has been swallowed for the reason before us has not but what is the worst of all against this story is  seventhly that which follows and absolutely destroys the fame and credit of jesus for a worker of miracles and v       jesus went up to jerusalem where there was by the sheepmarket a pool called bethesda having five porches in which lay a great multitude of impotent folk blind halt withered why then did not jesus heal them here was a rare opportunity for the display of his healing and almighty power and why did he not exercise it to the relief of that multitude of impotent folk if he could not cure them there is an end of his power of miracles and if he would not it was want of mercy and compassion in him which way soever we take this case it turns to the dishonor of the holy jesus what then was the reason that of so great a multitude of diseased people jesus exerted his power and extended his mercy on only one poor paralytick st augustine tot jacebant et unus curatus cum posset uno verbo omnes erigere quid ergo intelligendum est nisi quia potestas et bonitas illa magis agebat etc in loc johan puts this question and objection into my mouth and though neither he nor i start it for the service of infidelity but to make way for the mystery yet i know not why infidels may not make use of it till ministers of the letter can give a satisfactory answer and solution to it  the evangelists matthew mark and luke tell such stories of jesuss healing power as would incline us to think he cured all wherever he came he healed they say all manner of diseases among the people and they make mention of particular times and places where all the diseased were healed by him which assertions imply that jesuss healing power was most extensive and excepting to an hardhearted and unbelieving pharisee now and then universal so far that it might be questioned whether any died during the time of his ministry in the places where he came and our divines have so harangued on jesuss miracles as would confirm us in such an opinion but this story in st john confutes and confounds all st john in no place of his gospel talks of jesuss healing of many nor of all manner of diseases much less of all that were diseased which if it be not like a contradiction to the other evangelists is some diminution of their authority and enough to make us suspect that they stretched much in praise of their master and said more to his honor than was strictly true but this place before us is a flat contradiction to them and jesus is not to be supposed to heal many in any place much less all manner of diseases or he had never let such a multitude of poor wretches pass without the exercise of his power and pity on them some good reason then must be given for jesuss conduct here and such a one as will adjust it to the reports of the other evangelists or infidels will think that either they romancd for the honor of their master or that st john in spite told this story to the degradation of him i can conceive no better of this matter according to the letter  the bishop of lichfield very remarkably says defense of christianity p     that jesus wherever he went healed all that came to home without distinction the important halt withered he certainly had this text of st john in his eye when he said so because impotent halt withered are only mentioned here where jesus cured none of them whereupon if his lordship had made but a marginal reference to this text it would have been the best jest and banter with a sneer that ever was put upon jesus and his power of miracles as it is it is a very good one and i desire my readers to take notice of it that his lordship may not lose the credit and praise of it it is sor such circumspection of thought exactness of expression and acuteness of wit that i admire that prelate and must needs say of him whether he ever be translated to canterbury or york or not that he is an arch bishop but to return and go on the conduct of jesus to all appearance is not only blameable his power of healing disputable and his mercy indefensible for that he cured but one infirm man out of a multitude at bethesda but  eighthly and lastly it may reasonably be questioned whether he wrought any miracle in the healing of this one man miracles to say nothing of the ridiculous distinction between divine and diabolical ones are works done out of the course of nature and beyond the imitation of human art of power now whether the cure of this infirm man can be brought under this definition of a miracle may be doubted what this mans infirmity which is a general name for all distempers was we know not how then can we say he was miraculously cured unless we knew his disease to be incurable by art which none can affirm the worst that we know of this mans case is that it was of a long continuance no less than of eight and thirty years and the bishop of lichfield and others in their florid harangues of jesuss works make the cure of such chronical diseases to be miraculous but why so many instances may be given of infirmities of human nature of a long duration which in time and especially in old age wear off if such infirmites dont occur to the memory of our divines i could put them in mind of them and who knows but this was the case of this impotent man whose infirmity jesus observing to be wearing off bid him to be gone and take up his couch for he would soon be made whole  the fathers indeed call this mans infirmity the palsy which in truth is generally worse than better by time and after thirty and eight years must needs be very deplorable and incurable without a miracle but why do they call it the palsy they have no authority for it from the text without which as our litteral doctors will not subscribe to their opinions in other cases so why should i here in short the fathers had never called it the palsy but for the sake of the mystery and i am not bound to own that to have been the distemper any more than it was want of legs for that would be making of miracles for jesus without reason and authority  if jesus here had healed the whole multitude of impotent folk without enquiry what numbers there might be of them i should have believed that he wrought there many great miracles in as much as in such a great multitude there must needs in all probability be some incurable by art or nature but since he cured only this one man it affords matter of speculation whether he was the most or the least diseased amongst them our divines for the sake of the miracle may possibly suppose him to be the most grieviously afflicted of any but infidels on the other hand will say not so but with their cavils will urge that this infirm man was either a dissembler whom jesus shamed out of his pretended disease or that he was only hippish and fancyfully more than really distempered of a long time whom jesus by suitable exhortations and admonitions working upon his imagination persuaded into a belief of his cure and bid him to walk off certain it is that infidels will say it was not a power of miracles in jesus which healed him or he had used it then and there for the sanation of others also  and thus have i finished my invective against the letter of this story which if any are offended at they enjoy what is the most reasonable thing in the world the same liberty to write for the letter which i have used against it and so i pass to the consideration of the opinions and expositions of the fathers on this strange story  the fathers upon whose authority i formed my preceding invective against the letter so universally betake themselves to the mystical interpretation of this story that it may be questioned whether any of them more than myself believed any thing at all of the letter of it st chrysostom who is as much a litteral interpreter of the scriptures as any of them here entirely discards the letter saying admirably thus quis hic curationis modus quid ho cnobis mysterium significatur non  nec  haec sed futura nobis tanquam imagine et figura quadam describuntur ne res nimium incredibilis et in expectata accedente fidei virtute multitudinis  offenderet in loc johan what a strange way and story of healing the diseased is here but what is the mystery of it that we are to look to the matter could not be so simply and unadvisedly transacted literally as it is related there must be somewhat future here as by a type and figure signified or the story it is so incredible in itself will give offense to many st chrysostom was certainly in the right on it and i wonder for which no reason but want of liberty can be given that infidels have not before now with their jests and cavils ridiculed this story st augustine to the same purpose says aqua turbata  credas hoc angelica virtute fieri solere non tamen sine significante aliquo sacramento in loc johan can any one believe that these waters of bethesda were wont to be troubled in this fashion and that there was not mystery and a spiritual signification in it yes i could tell st augustine that our modern divines seem to believe it though he if he was now alive would laugh at them for it but to come to the profound mystery signified by this story which to use the words of cujus rei et cujus signi profundum mysterium quantum dominus donare dignatur loquar ut potero ibid st augustine as god shall enable me i will now speak to  our english version says there is at jerusalem by the sheepmarket a pool how our translators came by the notion of a market here i cannot imagine since there is nothing to favor it in the original which stands thus  by  the fathers understand piscina illa baptismum designat theophyl in loc quaenam igitur haec descriptio futurum erat baptisma plenum maximae potestatis et gratiae purgaturum peccata chrysostom in loc baptism or the spiritual laver of regeneration and who is that for but the flock of christ signified by  so we have another and clearer interpretation of these two words and as to bethesda that is a mystical name of the church which according to the signification of bethesda is the house of grace and if it is said to be at jerusalem it is not to be understood of the old jerusalem but of the new and apostolical jerusalem at the entrance into which the flock of christ will be baptized by the waters of the spirit as in mystical laver  bethesda is said to have five porches that is as the fathers per quinque porticus quinque libros mosis intelligo st theophil antioch in loc quinque porticus sunt quinque libri mosis st august in loc agree the five books of moses which are as so many doors of entrance into the house of wisdom or of the grace of christ  at these five porches of the five books of moses lay a great multitude of impotent folk blind halt withered and who are these mystically the ignorant erroneous and unstable in faith and principle as the fathers often understand them spiritually and what is the reason of these their mystical diseases because as st augustine mosis quinque libros scripsit sed in quinque porticibus piscinam cingentibus languidi jacebant et curari non poterant vide quomodo manet littera convincens eum non salvans iniquum illis enim quinque porticibus in figura quinque librorum prodebantur potius quam sinabantur aegroti ergo quicunque amatis litteram sine gratia in porticibus remanebitis aegri eritis jacentes non convalescentes de littera enim praesumitis in psalm lxx and other fathers say they rest on the letter of the law which throws them into various errors like diseases of different kinds of which they cannot be cured without the descent of the spirit like an angel to instruct them mystically to interpret  with these impotent folk lay a certain man who had an infirmity and who is this infirm man mankind in general say st cyril est figura populi in ultimis temporibus sanandi in loc johan and languidus ille de quo in evangelio legimus quia jacebat typum generis humani habere videbatar in sermon cclxxiv append st augustine and what is his infirmity the fathers call it the paralyticum qui juxta natatoriam jacebat irenaei lib ii cap    palsy because of his instability and unsteadiness in faith and principles which is now the case of of mankind st john calls it  a weakness which being a general name of all distempers we cannot guess what might be here the specifical one but reasonably speaking according to the rule of interpretation this mans infirmity is the same with the womans spirit of infirmity and that is a weakness at the spirit of prophecy which mankind as well as the woman of the church is to be cured of in the perfection of time  and how long did this man with his infirmity lay in these porches of bethesda thirty eight years so has mankind with his weakness at the spirit of prophecy lay eight and thirty hundred tempus et annus sunt centum anni tichonii in reg   years reckoning two thousand under the law and eighteen hundred since under the gospel st augustine quod autem triginta et octo annos in languoribus positus erat do illo quadraginta numero quem supra diximus duo minus habens et quae sunt ista duo nisi duo praecepta dilectio dei et proximi ista duo in quibus tota lex pendet et prophetae si non habuerit languidus et paralyticus jacet in ps lxxxiii has an ingenious and more mystical way of computation of these thirty and eight years which pleases me too but possibly some readers may not so easily apprehend it unless they are well acquainted with the mystery of prophetical numbers  and how is mankind to be cured of his infirmity at the spirit of prophecy by being instructed by the spirit of truth who is to come at the conclusion of the said thirty and eight mystical years to arise and take up his bed and walk that is to raise his thoughts to the contemplation of the divine mysteries of the law and to lift up his bed of the letter on which he has hitherto rested into a sublime sense and then he will walk uprightly and steadily in the faith without wavering like a paralytick  and at what season did jesus come to this infirm man it was at a feast of the jews irenaeus chrysostom theophylact and cyril call it the feast of penticost and the grand feast of penticost is as st cyril quod autem sub finem hebdomadum sanctae pentecostes ipse revertitur hierosolymam figurate et aenigmatice significat futurum nostri salvatoris reversionem ultimis praesentis aevi temporibus in loc johan says upon the place at the perfection of time the time of the evangelical sabbath and of jesuss spiritual advent which will be a time of feasting on intellectual and divine mysteries of seeing visions and of dreaming dreams consequently at that time as the ancient jews and fathers assert mankind will be cured of this infirmity at the spirit of prophecy  and this too is the certain season that the angel will descend and trouble the waters by angel is here meant turbabat angelus  dictus est dominus magni consilii angelus augustine in sermon cxxv sect   the spirit of christ and by waters the fathers understand turbavit aquam id est turbavit populum ejusdem in ps cii the people of all nations but how will the descent of the spirit of truth like an angel trouble these waters that is give any molestations and disturbance to the people is there not a mistake in the oracle if the clergy will be but greater lovers of truth than of their interests if they who should be teachers of forbearance of one another in love will but keep their temper there would be found a mistake in it but alas  lastly the jews as is intimated seem to have been moved with indignation at the cure of the infirm man saying to him v  0 it is the sabbath it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed which literally could not be true the jews were not such precise observers of the sabbath nor so stupid and foolish as st cyril sabbatum est et grabatum non licet tollere quid stupidius aut inertius esse potest in loc johan says as to think the taking up and carrying a stool to be a breach of it but mystically it is to be feared this will be most true and that the clergy who would be jews inwardly and the circumcision in spirit will be bitter enemies to mans exaltation of his couch of the letter of the scriptures on or against the evangelical sabbath and will make it if possible an unlawful work because it will bring to them shame dishonor and loss of interests along with it  after this manner is every other circumstance of this story to be allegorically applied out of the fathers the moral or mystery of the whole in short is this that at the perfection of time signified by the sabbath the pentecost the end of thirty eight years the spirit of truth will descend on mankind to their illumination in prophecy and to the healing of their errors called diseases which is admirably represented by the parable before us that according to the letter has neither reason nor common sense in it  and thus have i spoken to eight of the miracles of jesus and whether i have not showed them in whole or part according to the proposition before us to consist of absurdities improbabilities and incredibilities and whether they are not prophetical and parabolical narratives of what will be mysteriously and more wonderfully done by jesus i appeal to my readers  after another discourse of some other miracles i intend to take into examination the several stories of jesuss raising of the dead as of lazarus jairuss daughter and the widows son of naim which reputedly are jesuss grand miracles but for all the seeming greatness and excellency of them i dont doubt but to give the letter of these stories a toss out of the creed of a considerate and wise man at least show their insufficiency for the purpose for which they have been hitherto applied and if i should afterward by the leave and patience of the bishop of london give my objection against christs resurrection a review and some more force then what will become of the argument of christs power authority and messiahship from his miracles  but besides jesuss miracles i am as opportunity serves to take into consideration some of the historical parts of his life and show them to be no less senseless absurd and ridiculous than his miracles  and why may i not sometimes treat on the parables of jesus and show what nonsensical and absurd things they are according to the expositions of our most famous commentators of these last ages jesus was certainly the absolute and most consummate perfection of a cabalist mystist a parabolist and enigmatist but according to modern commentaries and paraphrases he was the merest idiot and blockhead that ever opened his mouth in that sort of learning to the instruction of mankind and i am obliged a little to speak to the absurdities of christs doctrine and parables because one article of the prosecution against me was for saying that any of the philosophers of the gentiles or any rational man meaning according to modern expositions would make a better teacher than jesus was  what a great deal of work have i upon my hands which if god spare my life and health i intend to go on with if what i have already done in it be not acceptable to the clergy their way to prevent the prosecution of this great undertaking is to battle me upon what is past who knows but they may write if they would try their strength so acutely in defense of the letter of jesuss miracles already discussed as may effectually stop my mouth and prevent my giving them any more trouble of this kind and i suppose i have now gotten an adversary in the bishop of st davids who has already discharged one fools bolt at me  there has nothing been a more common subject of declamation among the the clergy than the reasonableness of christianity which must be understood of the history of christs life and doctrine or the application of the word reasonableness to the christian religion is impertinent but if i proceed as i have begun in this work i shall show chistianity as it is understood to be the most unreasonable and absurd story that ever was told and our modern systems of theology groundless and senseless in almost every part of them mahometanism without offense be it spoken is a more reasonable religion than the christian upon modern schemes and systems  if what i here say is offensive to our divines the press is open for them as well as for myself and they may if they can show their resentment of it thanks unto god and our most excellent civil government for such a liberty of the press a liberty that will lead and conduct us to the fountain of wisdom and philosophy which restraint is a downright enemy to and that this blessing of liberty may be continued for all bishop smalbrook and dr rogerss hobbism is i dare say the desire of the curious inquisitive and philosophical part of mankind if this liberty should be taken away what a notable figure will our divines make from the press and pulpit declaming on the reasonableness excellency and perfection of the christian religion without an adversary and telling their congregations that all their bitterest and acutest enemies can object is clearly answered  the press of late years has been productive of so many cogent and persuasive arguments for liberty of debate and the advocates for this liberty in the judgment of the impartial and considerate have so far gotten the better of their adversaries that i wonder any one can appear in behalf of persecution if i was a bishop or doctor in divinity i shoud think it a disgrace to my station and education to ask the assistance of the civil authority to protect my religion i should judge my self unworthy of the wages and emoluments i enjoyed for the preaching and propagation of the gospel if i was unable to give an answer to any one that asked a reason of my faith or if i was so shallowpated as to think heresy and infidelity punishable by the civil magistrate i should think myself as much obliged to confute by reason as he is to punish by the sword if the bishop of london had taken this course with me if he had published a refutation of my supposed errors as well as endeavored at a prosecution of me for them i had forgiven him the wrongs and injuries done me and made no repeated demands of satisfaction for them  christianity is as i believe founded on a rock of wisdom and what is more has an omnipotent and omniscient god on its side who can incline the hearts of men to believe and open the eyes of their understanding to discern the truth of it consequently there can be no danger in the attempts of our adversaries whether jews turks or domestic infidels against it but persecution implys weakness and impotency in god to defend his own cause or his priests would not move for the help of the arm of flesh in vindication of it and if at this time of day after so many treatises of lnfidels and some of them as yet unanswered against our religion this good cause should be taken out of the hands of god and committed to the care of the civil magistrate if instead of reason the clergy should have recourse to force what will bystanders and even wellwishers to christianity say nothing less than that infidels had gotten the better of christs ministers and beaten them at their own weapons of reason and argument  the two great pleaders for persecution to the disgrace of themselves and dishonor of our religion that have lately arose are dr rogers and the bishop of st davids dr rogerss chief reason against liberty of debate is because as he says it is pernicious to the peace and welfare of the community by unsettling the minds of the people about the religion established but here is no consequence unless it could be proved that such as the great mr grounds and mr scheme have it in their hearts to raise mobbs upon the government and to beat out the brains of the clergy all the harm or rather good they aim at is to exercise the wits of the clergy with their doubts and objections and if the passions of our ecclesiastics are not raised upon it to the doing of violence to these gentlemen the peace of the public will never de disturbed as to myself though i have a vast and numerous party on my side no less than all the fathers and primitive christians for some ages yet as we were peaceable and quiet subjects of old and passively obedient to the emperors of rome so we will continue to the civil authority of this nation we only take the liberty to awaken the clergy out of a lethargy of dullness and ignorance and hope the civil magistrate will consider the goodness and charity of our intentions and guard us against their insults for it  the bishop of st davids sermon before the society for reformation etc p    says it is absurd to assert that the liberties of any nation will allow with impunity a set of distinguished infidels to insult and treat with the greatest contempt and scorn the most sacred and important truths that are openly professed by the whole body of the people of whatever denomination by a set of infidels i suppose he means me and the fathers and by treating with contempt and scorn the most sacred and important truths he means our burlesquing bantering and ridiculing the clergy for their ministry of the letter and for this he would i conceive have incensed the societies for reformation of manners to a prosecution of me and if they had not been wiser and more merciful than their preacher i must have gone to pot but why should the bishop dislike this way of writing dont he know that the fathers of the church used to jest and scoff at the gentiles and their priests for their foolish superstitions dont he know that our reformers banterd and ridiculed popery out of doors and almost within the memory of man it was reckoned but a dull sermon that was not well hummd for its puns and jests on the papists why then should the bistop be against that way of writing which was of good use to the reformers and first christians the grand subject for burlesque and banter in my opinion is infidelity and that bishop who cannot break two jests upon infidels for their one upon christianity has but a small share of wit the christian religion according to the bishop will abide the test of calm and sedate reasoning against it but cannot bear a jest o strange  but to leave these two contenders for persecution to the chastisement of acuter pens what i have here pleaded for liberty is not through any fears of danger to myself but for the love of truth and advancement of christianity which without it cannot be defended propagated and sincerely embraced and therefore hope that the controversy before us between infidels and apostates will be continued by the indulgence of the government till truth arises and shines bright to the dissipation of the mists of error and ignorance like the light of the sun to the dispersion of the darkness of the night i will by gods leave go on to bear my part in the controversy and if it was not more against the interests than reason of the clergy to believe me would again solemnly declare that what i do in it is with a view to the honor of jesus our spiritual messiah to whom be glory for ever amen  finis
