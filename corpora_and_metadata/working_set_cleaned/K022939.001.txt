his last illness amused himself amidst the care of his higher concerns in preparing a corrected and complete edition of his writings  i own the late encroachments upon my constitution make me willing to see the end of all further care about me or my works i would rest for the one in a full resignation of my being to be disposed of by the father of all mercy and for the other though indeed a trifle yet a trifle may be some example i would commit them to the candor of a sensible and reflecting judge rather than to the malice of every shortsighted and malevolent critic or inadvertent and censorious reader and no hand can set them in so good a light etc let cxx to mr w  and with his usual delicacy was even solicitous to prevent any share of the offense they might occasion from falling on the friend whom he had engaged to give them to the public  i also give and bequeath to the said mr warburton the property of all such of my works already printed as he has written or shall write commentaries or notes upon and which i have not otherwise disposed of or alienated and as he shall publish without future alterations  his last will and testament   in discharge of this trust the public has here a complete edition of his works executed in such a manner as i am persuaded would have been to his satisfaction  the editor has not for the sake of profit suffered the authors name to be made cheap by a subscription nor his works to be defrauded of their due honors by a vulgar or inelegant impression nor his memory to be disgraced by any pieces unworthy of his talents or virtue on the contrary he has at a very great expense ornamented this edition with all the advantages which the best artists in paper printing and sculpture could bestow upon it  if the public has waited longer than the deference due to it should have suffered it was owing to a reason which the editor need not make a secret it was his regard to the familyinterests of his deceased friend mr pope at his death left large impressions of several parts of his works unsold the property of which was adjudged to belong to his executors and the editor was willing they should have time to dispose of them to the best advantage before the publication of this edition which has been long prepared should put a stop to the sale  but it may be proper to be a little more particular concerning the superiority of this edition above all the preceding so far as mr pope himself was concerned what the editor has done the reader must collect for himself  the first volume and the original poems in the second are here printed from a copy corrected throughout by the author himself even to the very preface which with several additional notes in his own hand he delivered to the editor a little before his death the juvenile translations in the other part of the second volume it was never his intention to bring into this edition of his works on account of the levity of some the freedom of others and the little importance of any but these being the property of other men the editor had it not in his power to follow the authors intention  the third volume all but the essay on man which together with the essay on criticism the author a little before his death had corrected and published in quarto as a specimen of his projected edition was printed by him in his last illness but never published in the manner it is now given the disposition of the epistle on the characters of men is quite altered that on the characters of women much enlarged and the epistles on riches and taste corrected and improved to these advantages of the third volume must be added a great number of fine verses taken from the authors manuscriptcopies of these poems communicated by him for this purpose to the editor these when he first published the poems to which they belong he thought proper for various reasons to omit some from the manuscriptcopy of the essay on man which tended to discredit fate and to recommend the moral government of god had by the editors advice been restored to their places in the last edition of that poem the rest together with others of the like sort from his manuscriptcopy of the other ethic epistles are here inserted at the bottom of the page under the title of variations  the fourth volume contains the satires with their prologue the epistle to dr arbuthnot and epilogue the two poems entitled mdccxxxviii the prologue and epilogue are here given with the like advantages as the ethic epistles in the foregoing volume that is to say with the variations or additional verses from the authors manuscripts the epilogue to the satires is likewise enriched with many and large notes now first printed from the authors own manuscript  the fifth volume contains a correcter and completer edition of the dunciad than has been hitherto published of which at present i have only this further to add that it was at my request he laid the plan of a fourth book i often told him it was pity so fine a poem should remain disgraced by the meanness of its subject the most insignificant of all dunces bad rymers and malevolent cavillers that he ought to raise and enoble it by pointing his satire against the most pernicious of all minutephilosophers and freethinkers i imagined too it was for the interests of religion to have it known that so great a genius had a due abhorrence of these pests of virtue and society he came readily into my opinion but at the same time told me it would create him many enemies he was not mistaken for though the terror of his pen kept them for some time in respect yet on his death they rose with unrestrained fury in numerous coffeehouse tales and grubstreet libels the plan of this admirable satire was artfully contrived to show that the follies and defects of a fashionable education naturally led to and necessarily ended in freethinking with design to point out the only remedy adequate to so fatal an evil it was to advance the same ends of virtue and religion that the editor prevailed on him to alter every thing in his moral writings that might be suspected of having the least glance toward fate or naturalism and to add what was proper to convince the world that he was warmly on the side of moral government and a revealed will and it would be injustice to his memory not to declare that he embraced these occasions with the most unfeigned pleasure  the sixth volume consists of mr popes miscellaneous pieces in verse and prose amongst the verse several fine poems make now their first appearance in his works and of the prose all that is good and nothing but what is exquisitely so will be found in this edition  the seventh eighth and ninth volumes consist entirely of his letters the more valuable as they are the only true models which we or perhaps any of our neighbors have of familiar epistles this collection is now made more complete by the addition of several new pieces yet excepting a short explanatory letter to col m and the letters to mr a and mr w the latter of which are given to show the editors inducements and the engagements he was under to intend the care of this edition excepting these i say the rest are all here published from the authors own printed though not published copies delivered to the editor  on the whole the advantages of this edition above the preceding are these that it is the first complete collection which has ever been made of his original writings that all his principal poems of early or later date are here given to the public with his last corrections and improvements that a great number of his verses are here first printed from the manuscriptcopies of his principal poems of later date that many new notes of the authors are here added to his poems and lastly that several pieces both in prose and verse make now their first appearance before the public  the authors life deserves a just volume and the editor intends to give it for to have been one of the first poets in the world is but his second praise he was in a higher class he was one of the noblest works of god he was an honest man  a wits a feather and a chiefs a rod  an honest mans the noblest work of god   a man who alone possessed more real virtue than in very corrupt times needing a satirist like him will sometimes fall to the share of multitudes in this history of his life it will be printed in the same form with this and every future edition of his works so as to make a part of them  will be contained a large account of his writings a critique on the nature force and extent of his genius exemplified from these writings and a vindication of his moral character exemplified by his more distinguished virtues his filial piety his disinterested friendships his reverence for the constitution of his country his love and admiration of virtue and what was the necessary effect his hatred and contempt of vice his extensive charity to the indigent his warm benevolence to mankind his supreme veneration of the deity and above all his sincere belief of revelation nor shall his faults be concealed it is not for the interests of his virtues that they should nor indeed could they be concealed if we were so minded for they shine through his virtues no man being more a dupe to the specious appearances of virtue in others in a word i mean not to be his panegyrist but his historian and may i when envy and calumny take the same advantage of my absence for while i live i will freely trust it to my life to confute them may i find a friend as careful of my honest fame as i have been of his together with his works he has bequeathed me his dunces so that as the property is transferred i could wish they would now let his memory alone the veil which death draws over the good is so sacred that to throw dirt upon the shrine scandalizes even barbarians and though rome permitted her slaves to calumniate her best citizens on the day of triumph yet the same petulancy at their funeral would

figit read hic figit preface i am inclined to think that both the writers of books and the readers of them are generally not a little unreasonable in their expectations the first seem to fancy that the world must approve whatever they produce and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to please them at any rate methinks as on the one hand no single man is born with a right of controuling the opinions of all the rest so on the other the world has no title to demand that the whole care and time of any particular person should be sacrificed to its entertainment therefore i cannot but believe that writers and readers are under equal obligations for as much fame or pleasure as each affords the other  every one acknowledges it would be a wild notion to expect perfection in any work of man and yet one would think the contrary was taken for granted by the judgment commonly past upon poems a critic supposes he has done his part if he proves a writer to have failed in an expression or erred in any particular point and can it then be wondered at if the poets in general seem resolved not to own themselves in any error for as long as one side will make no allowances the other will be brought to no acknowledgements in the former editions it was thus  for as long as one side despises a well meant endeavor the other will not be satisfied with a moderate approbation  but the author altered it as these words were rather a consequence from the conclusion he would draw than the conclusion itself which he has now inserted   i am afraid this extreme zeal on both sides is illplaced poetry and criticism being by no means the universal concern of the world but only the affair of idle men who write in their closets and of idle men who read there  yet sure upon the whole a bad author deserves better usage than a bad critic for a writers endeavor for the most part is to please his readers and he fails merely through the misfortune of an ill judgment but such a critics is to put them out of humor a design he could never go upon without both that and an ill temper  i think a good deal may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets what we call a genius is hard to be distinguished by a man himself from a strong inclination and if his genius be ever so great he cannot at first discover it any other way than by giving way to that prevalent propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken the only method he has is to make the experiment by writing and appealing to the judgment of others now if he happens to write ill which is certainly no sin in itself he is immediately made an object of ridicule i wish we had the humanity to reflect that even the worst authors might in their endeavor to please us deserve something at our hands we have no cause to quarrel with them but for their obstinacy in persisting to write and this too may admit of alleviating circumstances their particular friends may be either ignorant or insincere and the rest of the world in general is too well bred to shock them with a truth which generally their booksellers are the first that inform them of this happens not till they have spent too much of their time to apply to any profession which might better fit their talents and till such talents as they have are so far discredited as to be but of small service to them for what is the hardest case imaginable the reputation of a man generally depends upon the first steps he makes in the world and people will establish their opinion of us from what we do at that season when we have least judgment to direct us  on the other hand a good poet no sooner communicates his works with the same desire of information but it is imagined he is a vain young creature given up to the ambition of fame when perhaps the poor man is all the while trembling with the fear of being ridiculous if he is made to hope he may please the world he falls under very unlucky circumstances for from the moment he prints he must expect to hear no more truth than if he were a prince or a beauty if he has not very good sense and indeed there are twenty men of wit for one man of sense his living thus in a course of flattery may put him in no small danger of becoming a coxcomb if he has he will consequently have so much diffidence as not to reap any great satisfaction from his praise since if it be given to his face it can scarce be distinguished from flattery and if in his absence it is hard to be certain of it were he sure to be commended by the best and most knowing he is as sure of being envied by the worst and most ignorant which are the majority for it is with a fine genius as with a fine fashion all those are displeased at it who are not able to follow it and it is to be feared that esteem will seldom do any man so much good as ill will does him harm then there is a third class of people who make the largest part of mankind those of ordinary or indifferent capacities and these to a man will hate or suspect him a hundred honest gentlemen will dread him as a wit and a hundred innocent women as a satirist in a word whatever be his fate in poetry it is ten to one but he must give up all the reasonable aims of life for it there are indeed some advantages accruing from a genius to poetry and they are all i can think of the agreeable power of selfamusement when a man is idle or alone the privilege of being admitted into the best company and the freedom of saying as many careless things as other people without being so severely remarked upon  i believe if any one early in his life should contemplate the dangerous fate of authors he would scarce be of their number on any consideration the life of a wit is a warfare upon earth and the present spirit of the learned world is such that to attempt to serve it any way one must have the constancy of a martyr and a resolution to suffer for its sake i could wish people would believe what i am pretty certain they will not that i have been much less concerned about fame than i durst declare till this occasion when methinks i should find more credit than i could heretofore since my writings have had their fate already and it is too late to think of prepossessing the reader in their favor i would plead it as some merit in me that the world has never been prepared for these trifles by prefaces biased by recommendations dazzled with the names of great patrons wheedled with fine reasons and pretenses or troubled with excuses i confess it was want of consideration that made me an author i writ because it amused me i corrected because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write and i published because i was told i might please such as it was a credit to please to what degree i have done this i am really ignorant i had too much fondness for my productions to judge of them at first and too much judgment to be pleased with them at last but i have reason to think they can have no reputation which will continue long or which deserves to do so for they have always fallen short not only of what i read of others but even of my own ideas of poetry  if any one should imagine i am not in earnest i desire him to reflect that the ancients to say the least of them had as much genius as we and that to take more pains and employ more time cannot fail to produce more complete pieces they constantly applied themselves not only to that art but to that single branch of an art to which their talent was most powerfully bent and it was the business of their lives to correct and finish their works for posterity if we can pretend to have used the same industry let us expect the same immortality though if we took the same care we should still lie under a farther misfortune they writ in languages that became universal and everlasting while ours are extremely limited both in extent and in duration a mighty foundation for our pride when the utmost we can hope is but to be read in one island and to be thrown aside at the end of one age  all that is left us is to recommend our productions by the imitation of the ancients and it will be found true that in every age the highest character for sense and learning has been obtained by those who have been most indebted to them for to say truth whatever is very good sense must have been common sense in all times and what we call learning is but the knowledge of the sense of our predecessors therefore they who say our thoughts are not our own because they resemble the ancients may as well say our faces are not our own because they are like our fathers and indeed it is very unreasonable that people should expect us to be scholars and yet be angry to find us so  i fairly confess that i have served myself all i could by reading that i made use of the judgment of authors dead and living that i omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors both by my friends and enemies but the true reason these pieces are not more correct is owing to the consideration how short a time they and i have to live one may be ashamed to consume half ones days in bringing sense and rhyme together and what critic can be so unreasonable as not to leave a man time enough for any more serious employment or more agreeable amusement  the only plea i shall use for the favor of the public is that i have as great a respect for it as most authors have for themselves and that i have sacrificed much of my own selflove for its sake in preventing not only many mean things from seeing the light but many which i thought tolerable i would not be like those authors who forgive themselves some particular lines for the sake of a whole poem and vice versa a whole poem for the sake of some particular lines i believe no one qualification is so likely to make a good writer as the power of rejecting his own thoughts and it must be this if any thing that can give me a chance to be one for what i have published i can only hope to be pardoned but for what i have burned i deserve to be praised on this account the world is under some obligation to me and owes me the justice in return to look upon no verses as mine that are not inserted in this collection and perhaps nothing could make it worth my while to own what are really so but to avoid the imputation of so many dull and immoral things as partly by malice and partly by ignorance have been ascribed to me i must farther acquit myself of the presumption of having lent my name to recommend any miscellanies or works of other men a thing i never thought becoming a person who has hardly credit enough to answer for his own  in this office of collecting my pieces i am altogether uncertain whether to look upon myself as a man building a monument or burying the dead  if time shall make it the former may these poems as long as they last remain as a testimony that their author never made his talents subservient to the mean and unworthy ends of party or selfinterest the gratification of public prejudices or private passions the flattery of the undeserving or the insult of the unfortunate if i have written well let it be considered that it is what no man can do without good sense a quality that not only renders one capable of being a good writer but a good man and if i have made any acquisition in the opinion of any one under the notion of the former let it be continued to me under no other title than that of the latter  but if this publication be only a more solemn funeral of my remains i desire it may be known that i die in charity and in my senses without any murmurs against the justice of this age or any mad appeals to posterity i declare i shall think the world in the right and quietly submit to every truth which time shall discover to the prejudice of these writings not so much as wishing so irrational a thing as that every body should be deceived merely for my credit however i desire it may then be considered that there are very few things in this collection which were not written under the age of five and twenty so that my youth may be made as it never fails to be in executions a case of compassion that i was never so concerned about my works as to vindicate them in print believing if any thing was good it would defend itself and what was bad could never be defended that i used no artifice to raise or continue a reputation depreciated no dead author i was obliged to bribed no living one with unjust praise insulted no adversary with ill language or when i could not attack a rivals works encouraged reports against his morals to conclude if this volume perish let it serve as a warning to the critics not to take too much pains for the future to destroy such things as will die of themselves and a memento mori to some of my vain contemporaries the poets to teach them that when real merit is wanting it avails nothing to have been encouraged by the great commended by the eminent and favored by the public in general  nov  0      variations in the authors manuscript preface after page v l   it followed thus  for my part i confess had i seen things in this view at first the public had never been troubled either with my writings or with this apology for them i am sensible how difficult it is to speak of ones self with decency but when a man must speak of himself the best way is to speak truth of himself or he may depend upon it others will do it for him i will therefore make this preface a general confession of all my thoughts of my own poetry resolving with the same freedom to expose myself as it is in the power of any other to expose them in the first place i thank god and nature that i was born with a love to poetry for nothing more conduces to fill up all the intervals of our time or if rightly used to make the whole course of life entertaining cantantes licet usque minus via laedet it is a vast happiness to possess the pleasures of the head the only pleasures in which a man is sufficient to himself and the only part of him which to his satisfaction he can employ all day long the muses are amicae omnium horarum and like our gay acquaintance the best company in the world as long as one expects no real service from them i confess there was a time when i was in love with myself and my first productions were the children of self love upon innocence i had made an epic poem and panegyrics on all the princes in europe and thought myself the greatest genius that ever was i cannot but regret those delightful visions of my childhood which like the fine colors we see when our eyes are shut are vanished for ever many trials and sad experience have so undeceived me by degrees that i am utterly at a loss at what rate to value myself as for fame i shall be glad of any i can get and not repine at any i miss and as for vanity i have enough to keep me from hanging myself or even from wishing those hanged who would take it away it was this that made me write the sense of my faults made me correct besides that it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write  at p vii l   in the first place i own that i have used my best endeavors to the finishing these pieces that i made what advantage i could of the judgment of authors dead and living and that i omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors by my friends and by my enemies and that i expect no favor on account of my youth business want of health or any such idle excuses but the true reason they are not yet more correct is owing to the consideration how short a time they and i have to live a man that can expect but sixty years may be ashamed to employ thirty in measuring syllables and bringing sense and rhyme together we spend our youth in pursuit of riches or fame in hopes to enjoy them when we are old and when we are old we find it is too late to enjoy any thing i therefore hope the wits will pardon me if i reserve some of my time to save my soul and that some wise men will be of my opinion even if i should think a part of it better spent in the enjoyments of life than in pleasing the critics  on mr pope and his poems by his grace john sheffield duke of buckingham with age decayed with courts and business tired caring for nothing but what ease required too dully serious for the muses sport and from the critics safe arrived in port i little thought of launching forth again amidst adventurous rovers of the pen and after so much undeserved success thus hazarding at last to make it less encomiums suit not this censorious time itself a subject for satiric rhyme ignorance honored wit and worth defamed folly triumphant and even homer blamed but to this genius joined with so much art such various learning mixed in every part poets are bound a loud applause to pay apollo bids it and they must obey and yet so wonderful sublime a thing as the great iliad scarce could make me sing except i justly could at once commend a good companion and as firm a friend one moral or a mere wellnaturd deed can all desert in sciences exceed it is great delight to laugh at some mens ways but a much greater to give merit praise to mr pope on his pastorals in these more dull as more censorious days when few dare give and fewer merit praise a muse sincere that never flattery knew pays what to friendship and desert is due young yet judicious in your verse are found art strengthening nature sense improved by sound unlike those wits whose numbers glide along so smooth no thought ever interrupts the song laboriously enervate they appear and write not to the head but to the ear our minds unmoved and unconcerned they lull and are at best most musically dull so purling streams with even murmurs creep and hush the heavy hearers into sleep as smoothest speech is most deceitful found the smoothest numbers often are empty sound but wit and judgment join at once in you sprightly as youth as age consummate too your strains are regularly bold and please with unforced care and unaffected ease with proper thoughts and lively images such as by nature to the ancients shown fancy improves and judgment makes your own for great mens fashions to be followed are although disgraceful it is their clothes to wear some in a polished style write pastoral arcadia speaks the language of the mall like some fair shepherdess the sylvan muse should wear those flowers her native fields produce and the true measure of the shepherds wit should like his garb be for the country fit yet must his pure and unaffected thought more nicely than the common swains be wrought so with becoming art the players dress in silks the shepherd and the shepherdess yet still unchanged the form and mode remain shaped like the homely russet of the swain your rural muse appears to justify the long lost graces of simplicity so rural beauties captivate our sense with virgin charms and native excellence yet long her modesty those charms concealed till by mens envy to the world revealed for wits industrious to their trouble seem and needs will envy what they must esteem live and enjoy their spite nor mourn that fate which would if virgil lived on virgil wait whose muse did once like thine in plains delight thine shall like his soon take a higher flight so larks which first from lowly fields arise mount by degrees and reach at last the skies w wycherley  to mr pope on his windsorforest hail sacred bard a muse unknown before salutes thee from the bleak

painted bay thy treasures next arrived and now we boast a nobler cargo on our barren coast from thy luxuriant forest we receive more lasting glories than the east can give wherever we dip in thy delightful page what pompous scenes our busy thoughts engage the pompous scenes in all their pride appear fresh in the page as in the grove they were nor half so true the fair lodona shows the sylvan state that on her border grows while she the wondering shepherd entertains with a new windsor in her watery plains thy juster lays the lucid wave surpass the living scene is in the muses glass nor sweeter notes the echoing forests cheer when philomela sits and warbles there than when you sing the greens and opening glades and give us harmony as well as shades a titians hand might draw the grove but you can paint the grove and add the music too with vast variety thy pages shine a new creation starts in every line how sudden trees rise to the readers sight and make a doubtful scene of shade and light and give at once the day at once the night and here again what sweet confusion reigns in dreary deserts mixed with painted plains and see the deserts cast a pleasing gloom and shrubby heaths

fields inspire thrice happy you and worthy best to dwell amidst the rural joys you sing so well i in a cold and in a barren clime cold as my thought and barren as my rhyme here on the western beach

brought the muses to the sylvan seat reformed the wits unlocked the classic store and made that music which was noise before there with illustrious bards i spent my days nor free from censure nor unknown to praise enjoyed the blessings that his reign bestowed nor envied windsor in the soft abode the golden minutes smoothly danced away and tuneful bards beguiled the tedious day they sung nor sung in vain with numbers fired that maro taught or addison inspired even i essayed to touch the trembling string who could hear them and not attempt to sing roused from these dreams by thy commanding strain i rise and wander through the field or plain led by thy muse from sport to sport i run mark the stretched line or hear the thundering gun ah how i melt with pity when i spy on the cold earth the fluttering pheasant lie his gaudy robes in dazzling lines appear and every feather shines and varies there nor can i pass the generous courser by but while the prancing steed allures my eye he starts he is gone and now i see him fly over hills and dales and now i lose the course nor can the rapid sight pursue the flying horse oh could thy virgil from his orb look down he would view a courser that might match his own fired with the sport and eager for the chase lodonas murmurs stop me in the race who can refuse lodonas melting tale the soft complaint shall over time prevail the tale be told when shades forsake her shore the nymph be sung when she can flow no more nor shall thy song old thames forbear to shine at once the subject and the song divine peace sung by thee shall

join the patriots to the poets praise george lyttelton  pastorals with a discourse on pastoral written in the year mdcciv rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes flumina amem sylvasque inglorius virg a discourse on pastoral poetry written at sixteen years of age p  there are not i believe a greater number of any sort of verses than of those which are called pastorals nor a smaller than of those which are truly so it therefore seems necessary to give some account of this kind of poem and it is my design to comprize in this short paper the substance of those numerous dissertations the critics have made on the subject without omitting any of their rules in my own favor you will also find some points reconciled about which they seem to differ and a few remarks which i think have escaped their observation  the original of poetry is ascribed to that age which succeeded the creation of the world and as the keeping of flocks seems to have been the first employment of mankind the most ancient sort of poetry was probably pastoral fontenelles disc on pastorals p  it is natural to imagine that the leisure of those ancient shepherds admitting and inviting some diversion none was so proper to that solitary and sedentary life as singing and that in their songs they took occasion to celebrate their own felicity from hence a poem was invented and afterward improved to a perfect image of that happy time which by giving us an esteem for the virtues of a former age might recommend them to the present and since the life of shepherds was attended with more tranquillity than any other rural employment the poets chose to introduce their persons from whom it received the name of pastoral  a pastoral is an imitation of the action of a shepherd or one considered under that character the form of this imitation is dramatic or narrative or mixed of both heinsius in theocr p  the fable simple the manners not too polite nor too rustic the thoughts are plain yet admit a little quickness and passion but that short and flowing the expression humble yet as pure as the language will afford neat but not florid easy and yet lively in short the fable manners thoughts and expressions are full of the greatest simplicity in nature  the complete character of this poem consists in simplicity rapin de carm past p   p  brevity and delicacy the two first of which render an eclogue natural and the last delightful  if we would copy nature it may be useful to take this idea along with us that pastoral is an image of what they call the golden age so that we are not to describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really are but as they may be conceived then to have been when the best of men followed the employment to carry this resemblance yet farther it would not be amiss to give these shepherds some skill in astronomy as far as it may be useful to that sort of life and an air of piety to the gods should shine through the poem which so visibly appears in all the works of antiquity and it ought to preserve some relish of the old way of writing the connection should be loose the narrations and descriptions short rapin reflex sur lart poet darist p   refl xxvii p  and the periods concise yet it is not sufficient that the sentences only be brief the whole eclogue should be so too for we cannot suppose poetry in those days to have been the business of men but their recreation at vacant hours  but with a respect to the present age nothing more conduces to make these composures natural than when some knowledge in rural affairs is discovered pref to virg past in dryd virg p  this may be made to appear rather done by chance than on design and sometimes is best shown by inference lest by too much study to seem natural we destroy that easy simplicity from whence arises the delight for what is inviting in this sort of poetry proceeds not so much from the idea of that business as of the tranquillity of a country life  we must therefore use some illusion to render a pastoral delightful and this consists in exposing the best side only of a shepherds life and in concealing its miseries fontenelles disc of pastorals p  nor is it enough to introduce shepherds discoursing together in a natural way but a regard must be had to the subject that it contain some particular beauty in itself and that it be different in every eclogue besides in each of them a designed scene or prospect is to be presented to our view which should likewise have its variety see the forementioned preface p  this variety is obtained in a great degree by frequent comparisons drawn from the most agreeable objects of the country by interrogations to things inanimate by beautiful digressions but those short sometimes by insisting a little on circumstances and lastly by elegant turns on the words which render the numbers extremely sweet and pleasing as for the numbers themselves though they are properly of the heroic measure they should be the smoothest the most easy and flowing imaginable  it is by rules like these that we ought to judge of pastoral and since the instructions given for any art are to be delivered as that art is in perfection they must of necessity be derived from those in whom it is acknowledged so to be it is therefore from the practice of theocritus and virgil the only undisputed authors of pastoral that the critics have drawn the foregoing notions concerning it  theocritus excels all others in nature and simplicity the subjects of his idyllia are purely pastoral but he is not so exact in his persons having introduced reapers thepistai idyl x and alieis idyl xxi p and fishermen as well as shepherds he is apt to be too long in his descriptions of which that of the cup in the first pastoral is a remarkable instance in the manners he seems a little defective for his swains are sometimes abusive and immodest and perhaps too much inclining to rusticity for instance in his fourth and fifth idyllia but it is enough that all others learnt their excellencies from him and that his dialect alone has a secret charm in it which no other could ever attain  virgil who copies theocritus refines upon his original and in all points where judgment is principally concerned he is much superior to his master though some of his subjects are not pastoral in themselves but only seem to be such they have a wonderful variety in them which the greek was a stranger to rapin refl on arist part ii refl xxvii  pref to the ecl in drydens virg p  he exceeds him in regularity and brevity and falls short of him in nothing but simplicity and propriety of style the first of which perhaps was the fault of his age and the last of his language  among the moderns their success has been greatest who have most endeavored to make these ancients their pattern the most considerable genius appears in the famous tasso and our spenser tasso in his aminta has as far excelled all the pastoral writers as in his gierusalemme he has outdone the epic poets of his country but as this piece seems to have been the original of a new sort of poem the pastoral comedy in italy it cannot so well be considered as a copy of the ancients spensers calendar in mr drydens opinion is the most complete work of this kind which any nation has produced ever since the time of virgil dedication to virg ecl p  not but that he may be thought imperfect in some few points his eclogues are somewhat too long if we compare them with the ancients he is sometimes too allegorical and treats of matters of religion in a pastoral style as mantuan had done before him he has employed the lyric measure which is contrary to the practice of the old poets his stanza is not still the same nor always well chosen this last may be the reason his expression is sometimes not concise enough for the tetrastic has obliged him to extend his sense to the length of four lines which would have been more closely confined in the couplet  in the manners thoughts and characters he comes near to theocritus himself though notwithstanding all the care he has taken he is certainly inferior in his dialect for the doric had its beauty and propriety in the time of theocritus it was used in part of greece and frequent in the mouths of many of the greatest persons whereas the old english and country phrases of spenser were either entirely obsolete or spoken only by people of the lowest condition as there is a difference betwixt simplicity and rusticity so the expression of simple thoughts should be plain but not clownish the addition he has made of a calendar to his eclogues is very beautiful since by this besides the general moral of innocence and simplicity which is common to other authors of pastoral he has one peculiar to himself he compares human life to the several seasons and at once exposes to his readers a view of the great and little worlds in their various changes and aspects yet the scrupulous division of his pastorals into months has obliged him either to repeat the same description in other words for three months together or when it was exhausted before entirely to omit it whence it comes to pass that some of his eclogues as the sixth eighth and tenth for example have nothing but their titles to distinguish them the reason is evident because the year has not that variety in it to furnish every month with a particular description as it may every season  of the following eclogues i shall only say that these four comprehend all the subjects which the critics upon theocritus and virgil will allow to be fit for pastoral that they have as much variety of description in respect of the several seasons as spensers that in order to add to this variety the several times of the day are observed the rural employments in each season or time of day and the rural scenes or places proper to such employments not without some regard to the several ages of man and the different passions proper to each age  but after all if they have any merit it is to be attributed to some good old authors whose works as i had leisure to study so i hope i have not wanted care to imitate   the first pastoral or damon

g granville afterward lord lansdown sir william trumbal dr garth lord hallifax lord summers mr mainwaring and others all these gave our author the greatest encouragement and particularly mr walsh whom mr dryden in his postscript to virgil calls the best critic of his age the author says he seems to have a particular genius for this kind of poetry and a judgment that much exceeds his years he has taken very very freely from the ancients but what he has mixed of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them it is not flattery at all to say that virgil had written nothing so good at his age his preface is very judicious and learned letter to mr wycherley ap   0  the lord lansdown about the same time mentioning the youth of our poet says in a printed letter of the character of mr wycherley that if he goes on as he has begun in the pastoral way as virgil first tried his strength we may hope to see english poety vie with the roman etc notwithstanding the early time of their production the author esteemed these as the most correct in the versification and musical in the numbers of all his works the reason for his laboring them into so much softness was doubtless that this sort of poetry derives almost its whole beauty from a natural ease of thought and smoothness of verse whereas that of most other kinds consists in the strength and fullness of both in a letter of his to mr walsh about this time we find an enumeration of several niceties in versification which perhaps have never been strictly observed in any english poem except in these pastorals

by mr congreve though with a little more correctness p  ver   the art of terence and menanders fire this line evidently alludes to that famous character given of terence by caesar tu quoque tu in summis o dimidiate menander poneris et merito puri sermonis amator lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis comica so that the judicious critic sees he should have said  with menanders fire for what the poet meant in this line was that his friend had joined to terences art what caesar thought wanting in terence namely the vis comica of menander besides  and menanders fire is making that the characteristic of menander which was not his character was the having art and comic spirit in perfect conjunction of which terence having only the first he is called the half of menander  ver   whose sense instructs us he was always very careful in his encomiums not to fall into ridicule the trap which weak and prostitute flatterers rarely escape for sense he would willingly have said moral

and the felicities attending it i could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts and those in the pollio of virgil this will not seem surprising when we reflect that the eclogue was taken from a sibylline prophecy on the same subject one may judge that virgil did not copy it line by line but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece i have endeavored the same in this imitation of him though without admitting any thing of my own since it was written with this particular view that the reader by comparing the several thoughts might see how far the images and descriptions of the prophet are superior to those of the poet but as i fear i have prejudiced them by

etc the reader needs only to turn to the passages of isaiah here cited p  remarks ver    ye heavens from high the dewy nectar pour and in soft silence shed the kindly shower his original says drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together  this is a very noble description of divine grace shed abroad in the hearts of the faithful under the gospel dispensation and the poet understood all its force as appears from the two lines preceding these  the ethereal spirit etc the prophet describes this under the image of rain which chiefly fits the first age of the gospel the poet under the idea of dew which extends it to every age and it was his purpose it should be so understood as appears from his expression of soft silence which agrees with the common not the extraordinary effusions of the holy spirit the term of dewy nectar for divine grace is wonderfully happy for he who would moralize the ancient mythology in the manner of bacon must say that by the poetical nectar can be meant only theological grace  ver    ancient fraud i e the fraud of the serpent  ver    he from thick films shall purge the visual ray the fense and language show that by visual ray the poet meant the sight or as milton calls it the visual nerve and no critic would quarrel with the figure which calls the instrument of vision by the name of the cause but though this term be just nay noble and even sublime yet the expression of thick films is faulty and he fell into it by a common neglect of the following rule of good writing that when a figurative term is used whatsoever is predicated of it ought not only to agree to the thing to which the figure is applied but likewise to that from which the figure is taken thick films agree only with the thing to which it is applied namely to the sight or eye and not to that from which it is taken namely a ray of light coming to the eye he should have said thick clouds which would have agreed with both but these inaccuracies are not to be found in his later poems  windsorforest to the right honorable george lord lansdown non

gently steal upon the ear now louder and yet louder rise and fill with spreading sounds the skies exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes in broken air trembling the wild music floats till by degrees remote and small the strains decay and melt away in a dying dying fall ii by music minds an equal temper know nor swell too high nor sink too low if in the breast tumultuous joys arise music her soft assuasive voice applies or when the soul is pressed with cares exalts her in enlivening airs warriors she fires with animated sounds pours balm into the bleeding lovers wounds melancholy lifts her head morpheus rouzes from his bed sloth unfolds her arms and wakes listening envy drops her snakes intestine war no more our passions wage and giddy factions hear away their rage iii but when our countrys cause provokes to arms how martial music every bosom warms so when the first bold vessel dared the seas high on the stern the thracian raised his strain while argo saw her kindred trees descend from pelion to the main transported demigods stood round and men grew heroes at the sound enflamed with glorys charms each chief his sevnfold shield displayed and half unsheathed the shining blade and seas and rocks and skies rebound to arms to arms to arms iv but when through all the infernal bounds which flaming phlegeton surrounds love strong as death the poet led to the pale nations of the dead what sounds were heard what scenes appeared over all the dreary coasts dreadful gleams dismal screams fires that glow shrieks of woe sullen moans hollow groans and cries of tortured ghosts but hark he strikes the golden lyre and see the tortured ghosts respire see shady forms advance thy stone o sysiphus stands still ixion rests upon his wheel and the pale specter dance

restore eurydice to life oh take the husband or return the wife he sung and hell consented to hear the poets prayer stern proserpine relented and gave him back the fair thus song could prevail over death and over hell a conquest how hard and how glorious though fate had fast bound her with styx nine times round her yet music and love were victorious vi but soon too soon the lover turns his eyes again she falls again she dies she dies how will thou now the fatal sisters move no crime was thine if it is no crime to love now under hanging mountains beside the falls of fountains or where hebrus wanders rolling in maeanders all alone unheard unknown he makes his moan and calls her ghost for ever ever ever lost now with furies surrounded despairing confounded he trembles he glows amidst rhodopes snows see wild as the winds over the desert he flies hark haemus resounds with the bacchanals cries  ah see he dies yet even in death eurydice he sung eurydice still trembled on his tongue eurydice the woods eurydice the floods eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung vii music the fiercest grief can charm and fates severest rage disarm music can soften pain to ease and make despair and madness please our joys below it can improve and antedate the bliss above this the divine cecilia found and to her makers praise confined the sound when the full organ joins the tuneful quire the immortal powers incline their ear borne on the swelling notes our souls aspire while solemn airs improve the sacred fire and angels lean from heaven to hear of orpheus now no more let poets tell to bright cecilia greater power is given his numbers raised a shade from hell hers lift the soul to heaven remarks ode for music this is one of the most artful as well as sublime of our poets smaller compositions the first stanza is a description of the various tones and measures in music the second relates their power over the several passions in general the third their use in inspiring the heroic passions in particular the fourth fifth and sixth their power over all nature in the fable of orpheuss expedition to hell which subject of illustration arose naturally out of the preceding mention of the argonautic expedition where orpheus gives an example of the use of music to inspire the heroic passions the seventh and last concludes in praise of music and the advantages of the sacred above the profane  ver   let the loud trumpet sound etc our author in his rules for good writing had said that the sound should be an coho to the sense the graces it adds to the harmony are obvious but we should never have seen all the advantages arising from it had this ode not been written in which one may venture to say is found all the harmony that sound when it comes in aid of sense

athens perishes some tully bleeds remarks these two choruss were composed to enrich a very poor play but they had the usual effect of illadjusted ornaments to make its meanness but the more conspicuous  ver   where heavenly visions plato fired and epicurus lay inspired the propriety of these lines arises from hence that brutus one of the heroes of this play was of the old academy and cassius the other was an epicurean but this had not been enough to justify the poets choice had not platos system of divinity and epicuruss system of morals been the most rational amongst the various sects of greek philosophy  ver    moral truth and mystic song he had expressed himself better had he said  moral truth in mystic song in the antistrophe he turns from philosophy to mythology and

one who writes amiss a fool might once himself alone expose now one in verse makes many more in prose  go just alike yet each believes his own in poets as true genius is but rare true taste as seldom is the critics share both must alike from heaven derive their light these born to judge as well as those to write  and censure freely who have written well authors are partial to their wit it is true but are not critics to their judgment too   nature affords at least a glimmering light the lines though touched but faintly are drawn right but as the slightest sketch if justly traced is by illcolouring but the more disgraced   and some made coxcombs nature meant but fools  and then turn critics in their own defense each burns alike who can or cannot write or with a rivals or an eunuchs spite  and fain would be upon the laughing side if maevius scribble in apollos spite there are who judge still worse than he can write  turned critics next and proved plain fools at last some neither can for wits nor critics pass as heavy mules are neither horse nor ass those halflearnd witlings numerous in our isle as halfformd insects on the banks of nile unfinished things one knows not what to call  to tell em would a hundred tongues require or one vain wits that might a hundred tire  and justly bear a critics noble name be sure yourself and your own reach to know how far your genius taste and learning go launch not beyond your depth but be discreet  nature to all things fixed the limits fit and wisely curbed proud mans pretending wit as on the land while here the ocean gains in other parts it leaves wide sandy plains  the solid power of understanding fails where beams of warm imagination play the memorys soft figures melt away one science only will one genius fit so vast is art so narrow human wit not only bounded to peculiar arts but often in those confined to single parts like kings we lose the conquests gained before by vain ambition still to make them more each might his several province well command   by her just standard which is still the same unerring nature still divinely bright one clear unchanged and universal light life force and beauty must to all impart at once the source and end and test of art art from that fund each just supply provides works without show and without pomp presides in some fair body thus the informing soul with spirits feeds with vigor fills the whole each motion guides and every nerve sustains itself unseen but in the effects remains  want as much more to turn it to its use for wit and judgment often are at strife though meant each others aid like man and wife it is more to guide than spur the muses steed restrain his fury than provoke his speed the winged courser like a generous horse shows most true mettle when you check his course  are nature still but nature methodizd nature like liberty is but restrained by the same laws which first herself ordained  when to repress and when indulge our flights high on parnassus top her sons she showed and pointed out those arduous paths they trod held from afar aloft the immortal prize and urged the rest by equal steps to rise  she drew from them what they derived from heaven the generous critic fanned the poets fire and taught the world with reason to admire then criticism the muses handmaid proved to dress her charms and make her more beloved but following wits from that intention strayed who could not win the mistress wooed the maid against the poets their own arms they turned sure to hate most the men from whom they learned so modern pothecaries taught the art by doctors bills to play the doctors part bold in the practice of mistaken rules prescribe apply and call their masters fools  nor time nor moths ever spoiled so much as they some drily plain without inventions aid write dull receipts how poems may be made these leave the sense their learning to display and those explain the meaning quite away  know well each ancients proper character his fable subject scope in every page religion country genius of his age without all these at once before your eyes  be homers works your study and delight read them by day and meditate by night thence form your judgment thence your maxims bring and trace the muses upward to their spring still with itself compared his text peruse and let your comment be the mantuan muse  a work toutlast immortal rome designed perhaps he seemed above the critics law and but from natures fountains scorned to draw but when texamine every part he came nature and homer were he found the same convinced amazed he checks the bold design and rules as strict his labored work confine as if the stagirite oerlookd each line learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem to copy nature is to copy them  for there is a happiness as well as care music resembles poetry in each are nameless graces which no methods teach and which a masterhand alone can reach  since rules were made but to promote their end some lucky license answer to the full the intent proposed that license is a rule  may boldly deviate from the common track from vulgar bounds with brave disorder part and snatch a grace beyond the reach of art which without passing through the judgment gains the heart and all its end at once attains in prospects thus some objects please our eyes which out of natures common order rise the shapeless rock or hanging precipice  and rise to faults true critics dare not mend but though the ancients thus their rules invade as kings dispense with laws themselves have made moderns beware or if you must offend against the precept never transgress its end let it be seldom and compelled by need and have at least their precedent to plead the critic else proceeds without remorse seizes your fame and puts his laws in force  those freer beauties even in them seem faults some figures monstrous and misshapd appear considered singly or beheld too near which but proportioned to their light or place due distance reconciles to form and grace  his powers in equal ranks and fair array but with the occasion and the place comply conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly those often are stratagems which errors seem   above the reach of sacrilegious hands  destructive war and allinvolving age see from each clime the learned their incense bring hear in all tongues consenting paeans ring in praise so just let every voice be joined and fill the general chorus of mankind  immortal heirs of universal praise whose honors with increase of ages grow as streams roll down enlarging as they flow nations unborn your mighty names shall sound and worlds applaud that must not yet be found oh may some spark of your celestial fire  that on weak wings from far pursues your flights glows while he reads but trembles as he writes to teach vain wits a science little known   mans erring judgment and misguide the mind what the weak head with strongest bias rules is pride the neverfailing vice of fools whatever nature has in worth denied she gives in large recruits of needful pride for as in bodies thus in souls we find what wants in blood and spirits swelled with wind  and fills up all the mighty void of sense if once right reason drives that cloud away truth breaks upon us with resistless day trust not yourself but your defects to know make use of every friend  and every foe little learning is a dangerous thing   and drinking largely sobers us again fired at first sight with what the muse imparts in fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts while from the bounded level of our mind short views we take nor see the lengths behind but more advanced behold with strange surprise new distant scenes of endless science rise  mount over the vales and seem to tread the sky the eternal snows appear already past and the first clouds and mountains seem the last but those attained we tremble to survey the growing labors of the lengthened way the increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes hills peep over hills and alps on alps arise  with the same spirit that its author writ  where nature moves and rapture warms the mind nor lose for that malignant dull delight the generous pleasure to be charmed with wit but in such lays as neither ebb nor flow correctly cold and regularly low that shunning faults one quiet tenor keep we cannot blame indeed  but we may sleep in wit as nature what affects our hearts is not the exactness of peculiar parts it is not a lip or eye we beauty call but the joint force and full result of all thus when we view some wellproportiond dome  no single parts unequally surprise all comes united to the admiring eyes no monstrous height or breadth or length appear the whole at once is bold and regular  thinks what never was nor is nor ever shall be in every work regard the writers end since none can compass more than they intend and if the means be just the conduct true applause in spite of trivial faults is due as men of breeding sometimes men of wit to avoid great errors must the less commit  for not to know some trifles is a praise  still make the whole depend upon a part they talk of principles but notions prize and all to one loved folly sacrifice  a certain bard encountring on the way discoursed in terms as just with looks as sage as ever could dennis of the grecian stage concluding all were desperate sots and fools who durst depart from aristotles rules our author happy in a judge so nice produced his play and begged the knights advice made him observe the subject and the plot the manners passions unities what not all which exact to rule were brought about were but a combat in the lists left out  what leave the combat out exclaims the knight yes or we must renounce the stagirite  not so by heaven he answers in a rage  knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage so vast a throng the stage can never contain  then build a new or act it in a plain  curious not knowing not exact but nice form short ideas and offend in arts as most in manners by a love to parts conceit alone their taste confine and glittering thoughts struck out at every line pleased with a work where nothings just or fit one glaring chaos and wild heap of wit poets like painters thus unskilled to trace the naked nature and the living grace with gold and jewels cover every part and hide with ornaments their want of art  what often was thought but never so well expressed something whose truth convinced at sight we find that gives us back the image of our mind as shades more sweetly recommend the light so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit for works may have more wit than does em good as bodies perish through excess of blood language all their care express and value books as women men for dress their praise is still  the style is excellent the sense they humbly take upon content words are like leaves and where they most abound much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found  its gaudy colors spreads on every place the face of nature we no more survey all glares alike without distinction gay but true expression like the unchanging sun clears and improves whatever it shines upon it gilds all objects but it alters none expression is the dress of thought and still appears more decent as more suitable a vile conceit in pompous words expressed is like a clown in regal purple dressed for different styles with different subjects sort as several garbs with country town and court  ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense such labored nothings in so strange a style amaze the unlearned and make the learned smile  these sparks with awkward vanity display what the fine gentleman wore yesterday and but so mimic ancient wits at best as apes our grandfires in their doublets dressed in words as fashions the same rule will hold alike fantastic if too new or old be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside  and smooth or rough with them is right or wrong in the bright muse though thousand charms conspire her voice is all these tuneful fools admire who haunt parnassus but to please their ear not mend their minds as some to church repair not for the doctrine but the music there these equal syllables alone require   and ten low words often creep in one dull line while they ring round the same unvaryd chimes with sure returns of still expected

into three principals parts or members the first to  0  gives rules for the study of the art of criticism the second from thence to   0 exposes the causes of wrong judgment and the third from thence to the end prescribes the morals of the critic  in order to a right understanding of this poem it will be necessary to observe that though it be entitled simply an essay on criticism yet several of the precepts relate equally to the good writing as well as to the true judging of a poem this is so far from violating the unity of the subject that it rounds and compleats it or from disordering the regularity of the form that it produces the highest beauty which can arise out of method as will appear by the following considerations   it was impossible to give a full and exact idea of the art of poetical criticism without considering at the same time the art of poetry so far as poetry is an art these therefore being closely connected in nature the author has with much judgment reciprocally interwoven the precepts of both through his whole poem   as all the rules of the ancient critics were taken from poets who copied nature this is another reason why every poet should be a critic therefore as the subject is poetical criticism it is frequently addressed to the critical poet and  dly the art of criticism is as necessarily and much more usefully exercised in writing than in judging  but readers have been misled by the modesty of the title which only promises an art of criticism in a treatise and that a complete one of the art both of criticism and poetry this and the not attending to the considerations offered above perhaps was what misled a very candid writer after having given this piece all the praises on the side of genius and poetry which his true taste could not resuse it to say that the observations follow one another like those in horaces art of poetry without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose writer spec no     i do not see how method can hurt any one grace of poetry or what prerogative there is in verse to to dispense with regularity the remark is false in every part of it mr popes essay on criticism the reader will soon see is a regular piece and a very learned critic has lately shown that horace had the same attention to method in his art of poetry  ver   it is hard to say etc the poem opens from   to   with showing the use and seasonableness of the subject its use from the greater mischief in wrong criticism than in ill poetry this only tiring that misleading the reader its seasonableness from the growing number of false critics which now vastly exceeds that of bad poets  ver   it is with our judgments etc the author having shown us the expediency of his subject the art of criticism next inquires from   to    into the necessary qualities of a true critic and observes first that judgment simply and alone is not sufficient to constitute this character because judgment like the artificial measures of time goes different and yet each relies upon his own the reason is conclusive and the similitude extremely just for judgment when alone is always regulated or at least much inflenced by custom fashion and habit and never certain and constant but when sounded upon taste which is the same in the critic as genius in the poet both are derived from heaven and like the sun the natural measure of time always constant and equal  nor need we wonder that judgment alone will not make a critic in poetry when we see that it will not make a poet and on examination we shall find that genius and taste are but one and the same faculty differently exerting itself under different names in the two prosessions of poet and critic for the art of poetry consists in selecting out of all those images which present themselves to the fancy such of them as are truly poetical and the art of criticism in judiciously discerning and fully relishing what it finds so selected it is the same operation of the mind in both cases and consequently exerted by the same faculty all the difference is that in the poet this faculty is eminently joined with a bright imagination and extensive comprehension which provide stores for the selection and can form that selection by proportioned parts into a regular whole in the critic with a solid judgment and accurate discernment which penetrate into the causes of an excellence and can show that excellence in all its variety of lights longinus had taste in an eminent degree so this which is indeed common to all true critics our author makes his distinguishing character thee bold longinus all the nine inspire and bless their critic with a poets fire   ver    let such teach others etc but it is not enough that the critic has these natural endowments to entitle him to the exercise of his art he ought as our author shows us from    to    to give a further test of his qualification by some acquired talents and this on two accounts   because the office of a critic is an exercise of authority   because he being naturally as partial to his judgment as the poet is to his wit his partiality would have nothing to correct it as that of the person judged has therefore some test is reasonable and the best and most unexceptionable is his having written well himself an approved remedy against critical partiality and the surest means of so maturing the judgment as to reap with glory what longinus calls the last and most perfect fruits of much study and experience gap ton logon kpisis polls esti peipas teleytaion epigenna  ver    yet if we look etc but having been so free with this fundamental quality of criticism judgment as to charge it with inconstancy and partiality and as often warped by custom and affection that this may not be mistaken he next explains from    to    the nature of judgment and the accidents occasioning those disorders before objected to it he owns that the seeds of judgment are indeed sown in the minds of most men but by ill culture as it springs up it generally runs wild either on the one hand by false knowledge which pedants call philology or by false reasoning which philosophers call schoollearning or on the other by false wit which is not regulated by sense or by false politeness which is solely regulated by the fashion both these sorts who have their judgments thus doubly depraved the poet observes are naturally turned to censure and reprehension only with this difference that the dunce always affects to be on the reasoning and the fool on the laughing side  and thus at the same time our author proves the truth of his introductory observation that the number of bad critics is vastly superior to that of bad poets  ver    some have at first for wits etc the poet having enumerated in this account of the nature of judgment and its various depravations the several sorts of bad critics and ranked them into two general classes as the first sort namely the men spoiled by false learning are but few in comparison of the other and likewise come less within his main view which is poetical criticism but keep grovelling at the bottom amongst words and letters he thought it here sufficient just to have mentioned them proposing to do them right elsewhere but the men spoiled by false taste are innumerable and these are his proper concern he therefore from    to    subdivides them again into the two classes of the volatile and heavy he describes in few words the quick progress of the one through criticism from false wit to plain solly where they end and the fixed station of the other between the confines of both who under the name of witings have neither end nor measure a kind of half formed creature from the equivocal generation of vivacity and dullness like those on the banks of nile from heat and mud  ver    but you who seek etc our author having thus far by way of introduction explained the nature use and abuse of criticism in a figurative description of the qualities and characters of critics proceeds now to deliver the precepts of the art the first of which from    to    is that he who sets up for a critic should previously examine his own strength and see how far he is qualified for the exercise of his profession he puts him in a way to make this discovery in that admirable direction given    and mark that point where sense and dullness meet he had shown above that judgment without taste or genius is equally incapable of making a critic or a poet in whatsoever subject then the critics taste no longer accompanies his judgment there he may be assured he is going out of his depth this our author finely calls that point where sense and dullness meet and immediately adds the reason of his precept the author of nature having so constituted the mental faculties that one of them can never excel but at the expense of another  from this state and ordination of the mental faculties and the influence and effects they have one on another our poet draws this consequence that no one genius can excel in more than one art or science the consequence shows the necessity of the precept just as the premises from which it is drawn show the reasonableness of it  ver    first follow nature etc the critic observing the directions here given and finding himself qualified for his office is shown next how to exercise it and as he was to attend to nature for a call so he is first and principally to follow her when called and here again in this as in the foregoing precept the poet from    to    shows both the fitness and the necessity of it it is fitness   because nature is the source of poetic art that art being only a representation of nature who is its great exemplar and original   because nature is the end of art the design of poetry being to convey the knowledge of nature in the most agreeable manner   because nature is the test of art as she is unerring constant and still the same hence the poet observes that as nature is the source she conveys life to art as she is the end she conveys force to it for the force of any thing arises from its being directed to its end and as she is the test she conveys beauty to it for every thing acquires beauty by its being reduced to its true standard such is the sense of those two important lines life force and beauty must to all impart at once the source and end and test of art we now come to the necessity of the precept the two great constituent qualities of a composition as such are art and wit but neither of these attains perfection till the first be hid and the other judiciously restrained which is only then when nature is exactly followed for then art never makes a parade nor can wit commit an extravagance art while it adheres to nature and has so large a fund in the resources which nature supplies disposes every thing with so much ease and simplicity that we see nothing but those natural images it works with while itself stands unobserved behind but when art leaves nature deluded either by the bold extravagance of fancy or the quaint odnesses of fashion she is then obliged at every step to come forward in a painful or pompous ostentation in order to cover to soften or to regulate the shocking disproportion of unnatural images in the first case the poet compares art to the soul within informing a beauteous body but we generally find it in the last only like the outward habit bolstering up by the taylors skill the defects of a misshapen one  as to wit it might perhaps be imagined that this needed only judgment to govern it but as he well observes wit and judgment often are at strife though meant each others aid like man and wife they want therefore some friendly mediator or reconciler which is nature and in attending to her the judgment will learn where to comply with the charms of wit and the wit how to obey the sage directions of judgment  ver    those rules of old etc having thus in his first precept to follow nature settled criticism on its true bottom he proceeds to show what assistance may be had from art but lest this should be thought to draw the critic from the foundation where he had before fixed him he previously observes from    to    that those rules of art which he is now about to recommend to his study were not invented by the imagination but discovered in the book of nature and that therefore though they may seem to restrain nature by laws yet as they are laws of her own making the critic is still properly in the very liberty of nature those rules the ancient critics borrowed from the poets who received them immediately from nature just precepts thus srom great examples given these drew from them what they derived from heaven and are both therefore to be well studied  ver    hear how learned greece etc he speaks of the ancient critics first and with great judgment as the previous knowledge of them is necessary for reading the poets with that fruit which the intent here proposed requires but having in the previous observation sufficiently explained the nature of ancient criticism he enters on the subject treated of from    to     with a sublime description of its end which was to illustrate the beauties of the best writers in order to excite others to an emulation of their excellence from the admiration which these ideas raise in him the poet is naturally brought back to reflect on the degeneracy of modern criticism and as the restoring the art to its original integrity and splendour is the great purpose of his poem he first takes notice of those who seem not to understand that nature is exhaustless that new models of good writing may be produced in every age and consequently new rules may be formed from these models in the same manner as the old critics formed theirs from the writings of the ancient poets but these men wanting art and ability to form these new rules are content to receive and file up for use the old ones of aristotle quintilian longinus horace etc with the same vanity and boldness that apothecaries practice with their doctors bills and thus rashly applying them to new originals cases which they did not hit it was no more in their power than their inclination to imitate the candid practice of the ancients when the generous critic fanned the poets fire and taught the world with reason to admire for as ignorance when joined with humility produces stupid admiration on which account it is so commonly observed to be the mother of devotion and blind homage so when joined with vanity as it always is in bad critics it gives birth to every iniquity of impudent abuse and slander see an example for want of a better in a late worthless and now forgotten thing called the life of socrates where the head of the author as a man of wit observed on reading the book has just made a shift to do the office of a camera obscura and represent things in an inverted order himself above and sprat rollin voltaire and every other author of reputation below  ver     you then whose judgment etc he comes next to the ancient poets the other and more intimate commentators of nature and shows from     to     that the study of these must indispensably follow that of the ancient critics as they furnish us with what the critics who only give us general rules cannot supply while the study of a great original poet in his fable subject scope in every page religion country genius of his age will help us to those particular rules which only can conduct us safely through every considerable work we undertake to examine and without which we may cavil indeed as the poet truly observes but can never criticize we might as well suppose that vitruviuss book alone would make a perfect judge of architecture without the knowledge of some great masterpiece of science such as the rotonda at rome or the temple of minerva at athens as that aristotles should make a perfect judge of wit without the study of homer and virgil these therefore he principally recommends to complete the critic in his art but as the latter of these poets has by superficial judges been considered rather as a copyer of homer than an original our author obviates that common error and shows it to have arisen as often error does from a truth viz that homer and nature were the same and how that the ambitious young poet though he scorned to stoop at any thing short of nature when he came to understand this great truth had the prudence to contemplate nature in the place where she was seen to most advantage collected in all her charms in the clear mirror of homer hence it would follow that though virgil studied nature yet the vulgar reader would believe him to be a copier of homer and though he copied homer yet the judicious reader would see him to be an imitator of nature the finest praise which any one who came after homer could receive  ver     some beauties yet no precepts can declare etc our author in these two general precepts for studying nature and her commentators having considered poetry as it is or may be reduced to rule lest this should be mistaken as sufficient to attain perfection either in writing or judging he proceeds from   0 to  0  to point up to those sublimer beauties which rules will never reach that is enable us either to execute or taste and which rise so high above all precept as not even to be described by it but being entirely the gift of heaven art and reason have no further share in their production than just to moderate their operations these sublimities of poetry like the mysteries of religion some of which are above reason and some contrary to it may be divided into two sorts such as are above rules and such as are contrary to them  ver     if where the rules etc the first sort our author describes from     to     and shows that where a great beauty is in the poets view which no stated rules will direct him how to reach there as the purpose of rules is only to promote an end like this a lucky license will supply the want of them nor can the critic fairly object to it since this license for the reason given above has the proper sorce and authority of a rule  ver     great wits sometimes may gloriously offend etc he describes next the second sort the beauties against rule and even here as he observes from     to     the offense is so glorious and the fault so sublime that the true critic will not dare either to censure or reform them yet still the poet is never to abandon himself to his imagination the rules our author lays down for his conduct in this respect are these   that though he transgress the letter of some one particular precept yet that he still adhere to the end or spirit of them all which end is the creation of one uniform perfect whole and   that he have in each instance the authority of the dispensing power of the ancients to plead for him these rules observed this license will be seldom used and only when he is compelled by need which will disarm the critic and screen the transgressor from his laws  ver     i know there are etc but as some modern critics have had the presumption to say that this last rule is only justifying one fault by another our author goes on from     to     to vindicate the ancients and to show that this censure proceeds from rank ignorance as where their partial judgment cannot see that this license is sometimes necessary for the symmetry and proportion of a perfect whole from the point and in the light wherein it must be viewed or where their hasty judgment will not give them time to discover that a deviation from rule is for the sake of attaining some great and admirable purpose  these observations are further useful as they tend to give modern critics an humbler opinion of their own abilities and an higher of the authors they undertake to criticize on which account he concludes with a fine reproof of that common proverb perpetually in the mouths of critics quandoque bonus dormitat homerus misunderstanding the sense of horace and taking quandoque for aliquando those often are stratagems which errors seem nor is it homer nods but we that dream   ver     still green with bays etc but now fired with the name of homer and transported with the contemplation of those beauties which a cold critic can neither see nor conceive the poet from   0 to  0  breaks into a rapturous exclamation on the rare felicity of those few ancients who have risen superior over time and accidents and as it were disdaining any longer to reason with his critics offers this to them as the surest confutation of their censures then with the humility of a supplicant at the shrine of immortals and the sublimity of a poet participating of their fire he turns again to these ancient worthies and apostrophises their manes hail bards triumphant etc   ver  00 to admire superior sense and doubt their own this line concludes the first division of the poem in which we see the subject of the first and second part and likewise the connection they have with one another it serves likewise to introduce the second the effect of studying the ancients as hitherto recommended would be the admiration of their superior sense which if it will not of itself dispose moderns to a diffidence of their own one of the great uses as well as natural fruits of that study the poet to help forward their modesty in his second part shows them in a regular deduction of the causes and effects of wrong judgment their own image and amiable turn of mind  ver  0  of all the causes etc having in the first part delivered rules for perfecting the art of criticism the second is employed in explaining the impediments to it the order of the two parts is judicious for the causes of wrong judgment being pride superficial learning a bounded capacity and partiality those to whom this part is principally addressed would not readily be brought either to see the malignity of the causes or to own themselves concerned in the effects had not the author previously both enlightened and convicted them by the foregoing observations on the vastness of art and narrowness of wit the extensive study of human nature and antiquity and the characters of ancient poetry and criticism the natural remedies to the four epidemic disorders he is now endeavoring to redress  ibid of all the causes etc the first cause of wrong judgment is pride he judiciously begins with it from  00 to     as on other accounts so on this that it is the very thing which gives modern criticism its character whose complexion is abuse and censure he calls it the vice of fools by whom are not meant those to whom nature has given no judgment for he is here speaking of what misleads the judgment but those in whom education and study has made no improvement as appears from the happy similitude of an illnourishd body where the same words which express the cause expres likewise the nature of pride for as in bodies thus in souls we find what wants in blood and spirits swelled with wind it is the business of reason he tells us to dispel the cloud which pride throws over the mind but the mischief is that the rays of reason diverted by selflove sometimes gild this cloud instead of dissipating it so that the judgment by false lights reflected back upon itself is still apt to be a little dazzled and to mistake its object he therefore advises to call in still more helps trust not yourself but your defects to know make use of every friend  and every foe both the beginning and conclusion of this precept are remarkable the question is of the means to subdue pride he directs the critic to begin with a distrust of himself and this is modesty the first mortification of pride and then to seek the assistance of others and make use even of an enemy and this is humility the last mortification of pride for when a man can once bring himself to submit to profit by an enemy he has either already quite subdued his vanity or is in a fair way of so doing  ver     a little learning etc we must here remark the poets skill in his disposition of the causes obstructing true judgment each general cause which is laid down first has its own particular cause in that which follows thus the second cause of wrong judgment superficial learning is what gives birth to that critical pride which he mentioned first  ver     drink deep etc nature and learning are the pole stars of all true criticism but pride hinders the sight of nature and a smattering of letters takes away all sense of the want of learning to avoid this ridiculous situation the poet from     to     advises either to drink deep or not to taste at all for the least sip is enough to make a bad critic while even a moderate draught can never make a good one and yet the labors and difficulties of drinking deep are so great that a young author fired with ideas of fair italy and ambitious to snatch a palm from rome engages in an undertaking as arduous almost as that of hannibal finely illustrated by the similitude of an unexperienced traveller penetrating through the alps  ver     a perfect judge etc the third cause of wrong judgment is a narrow capacity the natural and certain cause of the foregoing defect acquiescence in superficial learning this bounded capacity the poet shows from     to     betrays itself two ways in the matter and in the manner of the work criticized in the matter by judging by parts or by having one favorite part to a neglect of all the rest in the manner by confining the regard only to conceit or language or numbers this is our poets order and we shall follow him as it leads us only just observing one great beauty which runs through this part of the poem it is that under each of these heads of wrong judgment he has intermixed excellent precepts for right we shall take notice of them as they occur  he exposes the folly of judging by parts very artfully not by a direct description of that sort of critic but of his opposite a perfect judge etc nor is the elegance of this conversion inferior to the art of it for as in poetic style one word or figure is still put for another in order to catch new lights from different images and to reflect them back upon the subject in hand so in poetic matter one person or thing may be advantageously employed for another with the same elegance of representation it is observable that our author makes it almost the necessary consequence of judging by parts to find fault and this not without much discernment for the several parts of a complete whole when seen only singly and known only independently must always have the appearance of irregularity often of deformity because the poets design being to create a resultive beauty from the artful assemblage of several various parts into one natural whole those parts must be fashioned with regard to their mutual relations in the stations they occupy in that whole from whence the beauty required is to arise but that regard will occasion so unreducible a form in each part when considered singly as to present a very misshapen appearance  ver     whoever thinks a faultless piece to see he shows next from     to     that to fix our censure on single parts though they happen to want an exactness consistent enough with their relation to the rest is even then very unjust and for these reasons   because it implies an expectation of a faultless piece which is a vain imagination   because no more is to be expected of any work than that it fairly attains its end but the end may be attained and yet these trivial faults committed therefore in spite of such faults the work will merit the praise due to that which attains its end   because sometimes a great beauty is not to be procured nor a notorious blemish to be avoided but by suffering one of these minute and trivial errors   and laftly because the generous neglect of them is a praise as it is the indication of a genius busied about greater matters  ver     most critics fond of some subservient art etc ii the second way in which a narrow capacity as it relates to the matter shows itself is judging by a favorite part the author has placed this from     to     after the other of judging by parts with great propriety it being indeed a natural consequence of it for when men have once left the whole to turn their attention to the separate parts that regard and reverence due only to a whole is fondly transferred to one or other of its parts and thus we see that heroes themselves as well as heromakers even kings as well as poets and critics when they chance never to have had or long to have lost the idea of that which is the only legitimate object of their office the care and conservation of the whole are wont to devote themselves to the service of some favorite part whether it be love of money military glory despotic power etc and all as our author says on this occasion to one loved folly sacrifice this general misconduct much recommends that maxim in good poetry and politics to give a principal attention to the whole a maxim which our author has elsewhere shown to be equally true likewise in morals and religion as being founded in the order of things for if we examine we shall find it arise from this imbecility of our nature that the mind must always have something to rest upon to which the passions and affections may be interestingly directed nature prompts us to seek it in the most worthy object and common sense points out to a whole or system but ignorance and the false lights of the passions confound and dazzle us we stop short and before we get to a whole take up with some part which from thence becomes our favorite  ver     thus critics of less judgment than caprice curious not knowing not exact but nice form short ideas etc   he concludes his observations on those two sorts of judges by parts with this general reflection  the curious not knowing are the first sort who judge by parts and with a microscopic sight as he says elsewhere examine bit by bit the not exact but nice are the second who judge by a favorite part and talk of a whole to cover their sondness for a part as philosophers do of principles in order to obtrude their notions or opinions for them but the fate common to both is to be governed by caprice and not by judgment and consequently to form short ideas or to have ideas short of truth though the latter sort through a fondness to their favorite part imagine that they comprehend the whole in epitome as the famous hero of la mancha mentioned just before used to maintain that knight errantry comprised within itself the quintessence of all science civil and military  ver     some to conceit alone etc we come now to that second sort of bounded capacity which betrays itself in the manner of the work criticized and this our author prosecutes from     to     these are again subdivided into diverse classes  ibid some to conceit alone etc the first from     to  0  are those who confine their attention solely to conceit or wit and here again the critic by parts offends doubly in the manner just as he did in the matter for he not only confines his attention to a part when it should be extended to the whole but he likewise judges salsely of that part and this like the other is unavoidable as the parts in the manner bear the same close relation to the whole that the parts in the matter do to which whole the ideas of this critic have never yet extended hence it is that our author speaking here of those who confine their attention solely to conceit or wit describes the two species of true and false wit because they not only mistake a wrong disposition of true wit for a right but likewise false wit for true he describes false wit first from     to     some to conceit alone etc where the reader may observe our authors skill in representing in a description of salse wit the false disposition of the true as the critic by parts is apt to fall into both these errors  he next describes true wit from     to  0  true wit is nature to advantage dressed etc and here again the reader may observe the same beauty not only an explanation of true wit but likewise of the right disposition of it which the poet illustrates as he did the wrong by ideas taken from the art of painting  ver  0  others for language etc he proceeds secondly to those narrowminded critics whose whole concern turns upon language and shows from  0  to     that this quality where it holds the principal place deserves no commendation   because it excludes qualities more essential and when the abounding verbiage has excluded the sense the writer has nothing to do but to gild over the defect by giving his words all the false coloring in his power    he shows that the critic who busies himself with this quality alone is altogether unable to make a right judgment of it because true expression is only the dress of thought and so must be perpetually varied according to the subject and manner of thinking but those who never concern themselves with the sense can form no judgment of the correspondence between that and the language expression is the dress of thought and still appears more decent as more suitable etc now as these critics are ignorant of this correspondence their whole judgment in language is reduced to the examination of single words of which such as are to his taste are so only in proportion as they smack of antiquity on which our author has therefore bestowed a little raillery concluding with a short and proper direction concerning the use of words so far as regards their novelty and ancientry  ver     but most by numbers judge etc the last sort are those from     to     whose ears are attached only to the harmony of a poem of which they judge as ignorantly and as perversely as the other sort did of eloquence and for the very same reason he first describes that false harmony with which they are so much captivated and shows that it is wretchedly flat and unvaried for smooth or rough with them is right or wrong he then describes the true   as it is in itself constant with a happy mixture of strength and sweetness in contradiction to the roughness and flatness of false harmony and   as it is varied in compliance to the subject where the sound becomes an who to the sense so far as is consistent with the preservation of numbers in contradiction to the monotony of false harmony of this he gives us in the delivery of his precepts four fine examples of smoothness roughness slowness and rapidity the first use of this correspondence of the sound to the sense is to aid the fancy in acquiring a perfecter and more lively image of the thing represented a second and nobler is to calm and subdue the turbulent and selfish passions and to raise and warm the beneficent which he illustrates in the famous adventure of timotheus and alexander where in referring to mr drydens ode on that subject he turns it to a high compliment on that great poet  ver     avoid extremes etc our author is now come to the last cause of wrong judgment partiality the parent of the immediately preceding cause a bounded capacity nothing so much narrowing and contracting the mind as prejudices entertained for or against things or persons this therefore as the main root of all the foregoing he prosecutes at large from     to      first to     he previously exposes that capricious turn of mind which by running men into extremes either of praise or dispraise lays the foundation of an habitual partiality he cautions therefore both against one and the other and shows that excess of praise is the mark of a bad taste and excess of censure of a bad digestion  ver     some foreign writers etc having explained the disposition of mind which produces an habitual partiality be preceeds to expose this partiality in all the shapes in which it appeats both amongst the unlearned and the learned  i in the unlearned it is seen first in an unreasonable fondness for or aversion to our own or foreign to ancient or modern writers and as it is the mob of unlearned readers he is here speaking of he exposes their solly in a very apposite similitude thus wit like faith by each man is applied to one small sect and all are damned beside but he shows from     to  0  that these critics have as wrong a notion of reason as those bigots have of god for that genius is not confined to times or climates but as the common gist of nature is extended throughout all ages and countries that indeed this intellectual light like the material light of the sun itself may not shine at all times in every place with equal splendour but be sometimes clouded with popular ignorance and sometimes again eclipsed by the discountenance of princes yet it shall still recover itself and by breaking through the strongest of these impediments manifest the eternity of its nature  ver  0  some never advance a judgment of their own a second instance of unlearned partiality he shows from  0  to     is mens going always along with the cry as having no fixed or well grounded principles whereon to raise any judgment of their own a third is reverence for names of which sort as he well observes the worst and vilest are the idolizers of names of quality whom therefore he stigmatizes as they deserve our authors temper as well as judgment is here very observable in throwing this species of partiality amongst the unlearned critics his affection for letters would not suffer him to conceive that any learned critic could ever fall to so low a prostitution  ver      the vulgar thus  as often the learned   ii he comes in the second place from     to     to consider the instances of partiality in the learned   the first is singularity for as want of principles in the unlearned necessitates them to rest on the general judgment as always right so adherence to false principles that is to notions of their own misleads the learned into the other extreme of supposing the general judgment always wrong and as before the poet compared those to bigots who made true faith to consist in believing after others so he compares these to schismatics who make it to consist in believing as no one ever believed before which folly he marks with a lively stroke of humor in the turn of the thought so schismatics the plain believers quit and are but damned for having too much wit   the second is novelty and as this proceeds sometimes from fondness sometimes from vanity he compares the one to the passion for a mistress and the other to the pride of being in fashion but the excuse common to both is the daily improvement of their judgment ask them the cause they are wiser still they say now as this is a plausible pretense for their inconstancy and our author has himself afterward laid down the like thought in a precept for a remedy against obstinacy and pride where he says   0 but you with pleasure own your errors past and make each day a critic on the last he has been careful by the turn of the expression in this place to show the difference for time considered only as duration vitiates as frequently as it improves therefore to expect wisdom as the necessary attendant of length of years unrelated to long experience is vain and delusive this he illustrates by a remarkable example where we see time instead of becoming wiser destroying good letters to substitute school divinity in their place  the genius of which kind of learning the character of its professors and the sat which sooner or later always attends whatsoever is wrong or false the poet sums up in those four lines faith gospel all seemed made to be disputed etc and in conclusion he observes that perhaps this mischief from love of novelty might not be so great did it not with the critic infect writers likewise who when they find their readers disposed to take ready wit on the standard of current folly never trouble themselves to make better payment  ver     some valuing those of their own side or mind etc   the third and last instance of partiality in the learned is party and faction which is considered from     to     where he shows how men of this turn deceive themselves when they load a writer of their own side with commendation they fancy they are paying tribute to merit when they are only sacrificing to selflove but this is not the worst he further shows that this party spirit has often very ill effects on science itself while in support of faction it labors to depress some rising genius that was perhaps raised by nature to enlighten his age and country by which he would insinuate that all the base and viler passions seek refuge and find support in party madness  ver     be thou the first etc the poet having now gone through the last cause of wrong judgment and root of all the rest partiality and ended it with the highest instances of it in partyrage and envy this affords him an opportunity from     to   0 of closing his second division in the most graceful manner by concluding from the premises and calling upon the true critic to be careful of his charge which is the protection and support of wit for the defense of it from malevolent censure is its true protection and the illustration of its beauties its true support  he first shows the critic ought to do this service without delay and on these motives   out of regard to himself for there is some merit in giving the world notice of an excellence but none at all in pointing like an idiot to that which has been long in the admiration of men   out of regard to the poem for the short duration of modern works requires they should begin to enjoy their existence early he compares the life of modern wit and of the ancient which survives in an universal language to the difference between the patriarchal age and our own and observes that while the ancient writings live for ever as it were in brass and marble the modern are but like paintings which of how masterly a hand soever have no sooner gained their requisite perfection by the incorporating softening and ripening of their tints which they do in a very few years but they begin to fade and die away   lastly our author shows that the critic ought to do this service out of regard to the poet when he considers the slender dowry the muse brings along with her in youth it is only a short lived vanity and in maturer years an accession of care and labor in proportion to the weight of reputation to be sustained and of the increase of envy to be opposed and concludes his reasoning therefore on this head with that pathetic and insinuating address to the critic from  0  to     ah let not learning etc   ver     but if in noble minds some dregs remain etc so far as to what ought to be the true critics principal study and employment but if the four critical humor must needs have vent he points to its right object and shows from     to     how it may be usefully and innocently diverted this is very observable for our author makes spleen and disdain the characteristic of the false critic and yet here supposes them inherent in the true but it is done with judgment and a knowledge of nature for as bitterness and acerbity in unripe fruits of the best kind are the foundation and capacity of that high spirit race and flavor which we find in them when perfectly concocted by the heat and influence of the sun and which without those qualities would often gain no more by that influence than only a mellow insipidity so spleen and disdain in the true critic improved by long study and experience ripen into an exactness of judgment and an elegance of taste but lying in the false critic remote from the influence of good letters continue in all their first offensive harshness and astringency the poet therefore shows how after the exaltation of these qualities into their state of perfection the very dregs which though precipitated may possibly on some occasions rise and ferment even in a noble mind may be usefully employed in branding obscenity and impiety of these he explains the rise and progress in a beautiful picture of the different geniuss of the reigns of charles ii and william iii the former of which gave course to the most profligate luxury the latter to a licentious impiety these are the criminals the poet assigns over to the caustic hand of the critic but concludes however from     to     with this necessary admonition to take care not to be misled into unjust censure either on the one hand by a pharisaical niceness or on the other by a consciousness of guilt and thus the second division of his essay ends the judicious conduct of which is worthy our observation the subject of it are the causes of wrong judgment these he derives upwards from cause to cause till he brings them to their source an immoral partiality for as he had in the first part traced the muses upward to their spring and shown them to be derived from heaven and the offspring of virtue so has he here pursued this enemy of the muses the bad critic to his low original in the arms of his nursing mother immorality this order naturally introduces and at the same time shows the necessity of the subject of the third and last division which is on the morals of the critic  ver     learn then etc we enter now on the third part the morals of the critic included in candor modesty and goodbreeding this third and last part is in two divisions in the first of which from   0 to     he inculcates these morals by precept in the second from     to the end by example his first precept from     to     recommends candor for its use to the critic and to the writer criticized    the second from     to     recommends modesty which manifests itself by these four signs   silence where it doubts be silent always when you doubt your sense   a seeming diffidence where it knows and speak though sure with seeming diffidence   a free confession of error where wrong but you with pleasure own your errors past   and a constant review and scrutiny even of those opinions which it still thinks right and make each day a critic on the last     the third from     to     recommends good breeding which will not force truth dogmatically upon men as ignorant of it but gently insinuates it into them as not sufficiently attentive to it but as men of breeding are apt to fall into two extremes he prudently cautions against them the one is a backwardness in communicating their knowledge out of a false delicacy and fear of being thought pedants the other and much more common extreme in men of breeding is a mean complacence which such as are worthy of your advice do not want to make it acceptable for those can best bear reproof in particular points who best deserve commendation in general  ver     twere well might critics etc the poet having thus recommended in these general rules of conduct for the judgment the three critical virtues to the heart shows next from     to     on what three sort of writers these virtues together with the advice conveyed under them would be thrown away and which is worse be repaid with obloquy and slander these are the false critic the dull man of quality and the bad poet each of which incorrigible writers he has very justly and exactly characterized  but having drawn the last of them at large and being always attentive to his main subject which is of writing and judging well he reassumes the character of the bad critic whom he had but touched upon before to contrast him with the other and makes the characteristic common to both to be a neverceasing repetition of their own impertinence the poet  still runs on in a raging vein etc  0  etc the critic  with his own tongue still edifies his ears     etc  ver     but where is the man etc ii the second division of this last part which we now come to is of the morals of critics by example for having there drawn a picture of the false critic at large he breaks out into an apostrophe containing an exact and finished character of the true which at the same time serves for an easy and proper introduction to this second division for having asked from     to     where is the man etc he answers from     to     that he was to be found in the happier ages of greece and rome in the persons of aristotle and horace dionysius and petronius quintilian and longinus whose features he has not only exactly delineated but contrasted with a peculiar elegance the profound science and logical method of aristotle being opposed to the plain common sense of horace conveyed in a natural and familiar negligence the study and refinement of dionysius to the gay and courtly ease of petronius and the gravity and minuteness of quintilian to the vivacity and general topics of longinus nor has the poet been less careful in these examples to point out their eminence in the several critical virtues he so carefully inculcated in his precepts thus in horace he particularizes his candor in petronius his good breeding in quintilian his free and copious instruction and in longinus his noble spirit  ver     thus long succeeding critics etc the next period in which the true critic he tells us appeared was at the revival and restoration of letters in the west this occasions his giving a short history from     to   0 of the decline and reestablishment of arts and sciences in italy he shows that they both fell under the same enemy despotic power and that when both had made some little efforts to restore themselves they were soon quite overwhelmed by a second deluge of another kind superstition and a calm of dullness finished upon rome and letters what the rage of barbarism had begun a second deluge learning thus oerrun and the monk finished what the goth begun when things had been long in this condition and all recovery now appeared desperate it was a critic our author shows us for the honor of the art he here teaches who at length broke the charm of dullness dissipated the enchantment and like another hercules drove those cowld and hooded serpents from the hesperian tree of knowledge which they had so long guarded from human approach  ver     at length erasmus etc nothing can be more artful than the application of this example or more happy than the turn of compliment to this admirable man to throw glory quite round his illustrious character he makes it to be as in fact it really was by his assistance chiefly that leo was enabled to restore letters and the fine arts in his pontificate  ver     but see each muse in leos golden days this presents us with the second period in which the true critic appeared of whom he has given us a perfect idea in the single example of marcus hieronymus vida for his subject being poetical criticism for the use principally of a critical poet his example is an eminent poetical critic who had had written of that art in verse  ver   0 but soon by impious arms etc this brings us to the third period after learning had still traveled farther west when the arms of the emperor in the sack of rome by the duke of bourbon had driven it out of italy and forced it to pass the mountains  the examples he gives in this period are of boileau in france and of the lord roscommon and the duke of buckingham in england and these were all poets as well as critics in verse it is true the last instance is of one who was no eminent poet the late mr walsh this small deviation might be well overlooked was it only for its being a pious office to the memory of his friend but it may be farther justified as it was an homage paid in particular to the morals of the critic nothing being more amiable than the character here drawn of this excellent person he being our authors judge and censor as well as friend it gives him a graceful opportunity to add himself to the number of the later critics and with a character of himself sustained by that modesty and dignity which it is so difficult to make consistent this performance concludes  i have given a short and plain account of the essay on criticism concerning which i have but one thing more to acquaint the reader that when he considers the regularity of the plan the masterly conduct of each part the penetration into nature and the compass of learning so conspicuous throughout he should at the same time know it was the work of an author who had not attained the twentieth year of his age  notes ver    let such teach others qui scribit artificiose ab aliis commode scripta facile intelligere poterit cic ad herenn lib   de pictore

expression too is fine it alludes to the condition of idiots and naturalfools who are always on the grin  ver    their generations so equivocal it is sufficient that a principle of philosophy has been generally received whether it be true or false to justify a poets use of it to set off his wit but to recommend his argument he should be cautious how he uses any but the true for falsehood when it is set too near will tarnish the truth he would recommend besides the analogy between natural and moral truth makes the principles of true philosophy the fittest for his use our poet has been careful in observing this rule  ver    and mark that point where sense and dullness meet besides the peculiar sense explained above in the comment the words have still a more general meaning and caution us against going on when our ideas begin to grow obscure as we are apt to do though that obscurity is a monition that we should leave off for it arises either through our small acquaintance with the subject or the incomprehensibility of its nature in which circumstances a genius will always write as heavily as a dunce an observation well worth the attention of all profound writers  ver    thus in the soul while memory prevails the solid power of understanding fails where beams of warm imagination play the memorys soft sigures melt away these observations are collected from an intimate knowledge of human nature the cause of that languor and heaviness in the understanding which is almost inseparable from a very strong and tenacious memory seems to be a want of the proper exercise and activity of that power the understanding being rather passive while the memory is cultivating as to the other appearance the decay of memory by the vigorous exercise of fancy the poet himself seems to have intimated the cause of it in the epithet he has given to the imagination for if according to the atomic philosophy the memory of things be preserved in a chain of ideas produced by the animal spirits moving in continued trains the force and rapidity of the imagination perpetually breaking and dissipating the links of this chain by forming new associations must necessarily weaken and disorder the recollective faculty  ver    would all but stoop to what they understand the expression is delicate and implies what is very true that most men think it a degradation of their genius to

deserve our admiration  nous esmerveillons comme lon fait si grand cas de ce pantheon veu que son edifice nest de si grande industry comme lon cry car chaque petit masson peut bien concevoir la maniere de sa facon tout en un instant car estant la base si massive et les murailles si espoisses ne nous a semble difficile dy adjouster la voute a claire voye pierre belons observations etc the nature of the gothic structures apparently led him into this mistake of the architectonic art in general that the excellency of it consisted in raising the greatest weight on the least assignable support so that the edifice should have strength without the appearance of it in order to excite admiration but to a judicious eye it would have a contrary effect the appearance as our poet expresses it of a monstrous height or breadth or length indeed did the just proportions in regular architecture take off from the grandeur of a building by all the single parts coming united to the eye as this learned traveller seems to insinuate it would be a reasonable objection to those rules on which this masterpiece of art was constructed but it is not so the poet tells us the whole at once is bold and regular   ver     verbal critic is not here used in its common signification of one who retails the sense of single words but of one who deals in large cargos of them without any sense at all  ver     once on a time etc this tale is so very apposite that one would naturally take it to be of the poets own invention and so much in the spirit of cervantes that one might easily mistake it for one of the chief strokes of that incomparable satire but in truth it is neither this nor that but a story taken by our author from the spurious don quixote which shows how proper an use may be made of general reading when if there is but one good thing in a book as in that wretched performance there scarce was more it may be picked out and employed to an excellent purpose  ver     thus critics of less judgment than caprice curious not knowing not exact but nice in these two lines the poet finely describes the way in which bad writers are wont to imitate the qualities of good ones as true judgment generally draws men out of popular opinions so he who cannot get from the crowd by the assistance of this guide willingly follows caprice which will be sure to lead him into singularities again true knowledge is the art of treasuring up only that which from its use in life is worthy of being lodged in the memory but curiosity consists in a vain attention to every thing out of the way and which for its uselessness the world least regards lastly exactness is the just proportion of parts to one another and their harmony in a whole but he who has not extent of capacity for the exercise of this quality contents himself with nicety which is a busying ones self about points and syllables  ver     true wit is nature to advantage dressed etc this definition is very exact mr lock had defined wit to consist in the assemblage of ideas and putting those together with quickness and variety wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity whereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy but that great philosopher in separating wit from judgment as he does in this place has given us and he could therefore gives us no other only an account of wit in general in which false wit though not every species of it is included a striking image therefore of nature is as mr lock observes certainly wit but this image may strike on several other accounts as well as for its truth and amiableness and the philosopher has explained the manner how but it never becomes that wit which is the ornament of true poesy whose end is to represent nature but when it dresses that nature to advantage and presents her to us in the clearest and most amiable light and to know when the fancy has done its office truly the poet subjoins this admirable test viz when we perceive that it gives us back the image of our mind when it does that we may be sure it plays no tricks with us for this image is the creature of the judgment and whenever wit corresponds with judgment we may safely pronounce it to be true  naturam intueamur hanc sequamur id facillime accipiunt animi quod agnoscunt quintil lib viii c    ver     false eloquence like the prismatic glass etc this simile is beautiful for the false coloring given to objects by the prismatic glass is owing to its untwisting by its obliquities those threads of light which nature had put together in order to spread over its works an ingenuous and simple candor that should not hide but only heighten the native complexion of the objects and false eloquence is nothing else but the straining and divaricating the parts of true expression and then daubing them over with what the rhetoricians very properly term colors in lieu of that candid light now lost which was reflected from them in their natural state

offense the sound must seem an echo to the sense  the judicious introduction of this precept is remarkable the poets and even some of the best of them have been so fond of the beauty arising from this trivial precept that in their practice they have violated the very end of it which is the increase of harmony and so they could but raise an echo did not care whose ears they offended by its dissonance to remedy this abuse therefore the poet by the introductory line would infinuate that harmony is always presupposed as observed though it may and ought to be perpetually varied so as to produce the effect here recommended  ver     the sound must seem an echo to the sense lord roscommon says the sound is still a comment to the sense they are both well expressed only this supposes the

years study they could not understand him rightly what then had they for others of inferior note  what indeed but then if so be that most famous j duns was so difficult to be understood for that this is a most classical proof of his great value who doubts i should conceive our good old antiquary to be a little mistaken and that the nailing up this proteus was done by the commissioners in honor of the most famous duns there being no other way of catching the sense of so slippery an author who had eluded the pursuit of three of their most renowned doctors in full cry after him for twenty eight years together and this boccardo in which he was confined seemed very proper for the purpose it being observed that men are never more serious and thoughtful than in that place scribl  ibid thomists

this similitude implies a fact too often verified and of which we need not seek abroad for examples it is that frequently those very authors who have at first done all they could to obscure and depress a rising genius have at length in order to keep themselves in some little credit been reduced to borrow from him imitate his manner and reflect what they could of his splendour nor has the poet been less artful to insinuate also what is sometimes the cause a youthful genius like the sun rising toward the meridian displays too strong and powerful beams for the dirty genius of inferior writers which occasions their gathering condensing and blackening but as he descends from the meridian the time when the sun gives its gilding to the surrounding clouds his rays grow milder his heat more benign and then  even those clouds at last adorn its way reflect new glories and augment the day   ver     so when the faithful pencil etc this similitude in which the poet discovers as he always does on this subject real science in the thing spoken of has still a more peculiar beauty as at the same time that it confesses the just superiority of ancient writings it insinuates one advantage the modern have above them which is this that in these our intimate acquaintance with the occasion of writing and the manners described lets us into all those living and striking graces which may be well compared to that perfection of imitation only given by coloring while the ravage of time amongst the monuments of former ages has left us but the gross substance of ancient wit so much of the form and

prejudice of that deserving author our poet did him this justice when that slander most prevailed and it is now perhaps the sooner for this very verse dead and forgotten p  ver     but where is the man etc the poet by his manner of asking after this character and telling us when he had described it that such once were critics does not encourage us to search for it in modern writers and indeed the discovery of him if it could be made would be but an invidious business i will venture no farther than to name the piece of criticism in which these marks may be found it is entitled q hor fl ars

the excellencies of his author contents himself in offering them to the world with only empty exclamations on their beauties his office is to explain the nature of those beauties show from whence they arise and what effects they produce or in the better and fuller expression of the poet to teach the world with reason to admire   ver     who conquered nature should preside over wit by this is not meant physical nature but moral the force of the observation consists in our understanding it in this sense for the poet not only uses the word nature for human nature throughout this poem but also where in the beginning of it he lays down the principles of the arts he treats of he makes the knowledge of human nature the foundation of all criticism and poetry nor is the observation less true than apposite for aristotles natural enquiries were superficial and ill made though extensive but his logical and moral works are incomparable in these he has unfolded the human mind and laid open all the recesses of the heart and understanding and by his categories not only conquered nature but kept her in tenfold chains not as dullness kept the muses in the dunciad to silence them but as

from hence to the end of this canto were added afterward  ver  0 her guardian sylph when mr pope had projected to give this poem its present form he was obliged to find it with its machinery for as the subject of the epic poem consists of two parts the metaphysical and the civil so this mock epic which is of the satiric kind and receives its grace from a ludicrous imitation of the others pomp and solemnity was to have the same division of the subject and as the civil part is intentionally debased by the choice of an insignificant action so should the metaphysical by the use of some very extravagant system a rule which though neither boileau nor garth have been careful enough to attend to our authors good sense would not suffer him to overlook and that sort of machinery which his judgment taught him was only fit for his use his admirable invention supplied there was but one system in all nature which was to his purpose the rosicrucian philosophy and this by the well directed effort of his imagination he presently seized upon the fanatic alchemists in their search after the great secret had invented a means altogether proportioned to their end it was a kind of theologicalphilosophy made up of almost equal mixtures of pagan platonism christian quietism and the jewish cabbala a composition enough to fright reason from human commerce this general system he tells us he took as he found it in a little french tract called le comte de gabalis this book is written in dialogue and is a delicate and very ingenious piece of raillery of the abbe villiers upon that invisible sect of which the stories that went about at that time made a great deal of noise at paris but as in this satirical dialogue mr p found several whimsies of a very high mysterious kind told of the nature of these elementary beings which were very unfit to come into the machinery of such a sort of poem he has with great judgment omitted them and in their stead made use of the legendary stories of guardian angels and the nursery tales of the fairies which he has artfully accommodated to the rest of the rosicrucian system and to this unless we will be so uncharitable to believe he intended to give a needless scandal we must suppose he referred in these two lines if ever one vision touched thy infant thought of all the nurse and all the priest have taught thus by the most beautiful invention imaginable he has contrived that as in the serious epic the popular belief supports the machinery so in his mock epic the machinery should be contrived to dismount philosophic pride and arrogance  ver    as now your own etc he here forsakes the rosicrucian system which in this part is too extravagant even for poetry and gives a beautiful fiction of his own on the platonic theology of the continuance of the passions in another state when the mind before its leaving this has not been purged and purified by philosophy which furnishes an occasion for much useful satire  ver    is by some sylph embracd here again the author resumes a tenet peculiar to the rosicrucian system but the principle on which it is founded was by no means fit to be employed in such a sort of poem  ver    though honor is the word with men below parody of homer  ver    too conscious of their face i e too sensible of their beauty  ver  0  in the clear mirror the language of the platonists

the utmost caution and under the most solemn seal of secrecy it is here communicated to a woman and in that way of conveyance a woman most delights to make the subject of her conversation that is to say her dreams  ver     and now unveiled etc the translation of these verses containing the description of the toilette by our authors friend dr parnelle deserve for their humor to be here inserted p

flowers be dressed and the green turf lie lightly on thy breast there shall the morn her earliest tears bestow there the first roses of the year shall blow while angels with their silver wings oershade the ground now sacred by thy relics made so peaceful rests without a stone a name what once had beauty titles wealth and fame how loved how honored once avails thee not to whom related or by whom begot a heap of dust alone remains of thee it is all thou art and all the proud shall be poets themselves must fall like those they sung deaf the praised ear and mute the tuneful tongue even he whose soul now melts in mournful lays shall shortly want the generous tear he pays then from his closing eyes thy form shall part and the last pang shall tear thee from his heart lifes idle business at one gasp be over the muse forgot and thou beloved no more prologue to mr addisons tragedy of cato to wake the soul by tender strokes of art to raise the genius and to mend the heart to make mankind in conscious virtue bold live over each scene and be what they behold for this the tragic muse first trod the stage commanding tears to stream through every age tyrants no more their savage nature kept and foes to virtue wondered how they wept our author shuns by vulgar springs to move the heros glory or the virgins love in pitying love we but our weakness show and wild ambition well deserves its woe here tears shall flow from a more generous cause such tears as patriots shed for dying laws he bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise and calls forth roman drops from british eyes virtue confessed in human shape he draws what plato thought and godlike cato was no common object to your sight displays  a brave man struggling in the storms of fate and greatly falling with a falling state while cato gives his little senate laws what bosom beats not in his countrys cause who sees him act but envies every deed who hears him groan and does not wish to bleed even when proud caesar midst triumphal cars the spoils of nations and the pomp of wars ignobly vain and impotently great showed rome her catos figure drawn in state as her dead fathers reverend image past the pomp was darkened and the day overcast the triumph ceased tears gushed from every eye the worlds great victor passed unheeded by her last good man dejected rome adored and honored caesars less than catos sword  and show you have the virtue to be moved with honest scorn the first famed cato viewed rome learning arts from greece whom she subdued your scene precariously subsists too long on french translation and italian song dare to have sense yourselves assert the stage be justly warmed with your own native rage such plays alone should win a british ear  notes ver  0 but what with pleasure this alludes to a famous passage of seneca which mr addison afterward used as a motto to his play when it was printed  ver    britons attend mr pope had written it arise in the spirit of poetry and liberty but mr addison frightened at so daring an expression which he thought squinted at rebellion would have it altered in the spirit of prose and politics to attend  ver    as cato self etc this alludes to the famous story of his going into the theater and immediately coming out again  epilogue to mr rowes jane shore designed for mrs oldfield prodigious this the frailone of our play from her own sex should mercy find today you might have held the pretty head aside peeped in your fans been serious thus and cried the play may pass  but that strange creature shore i cannot  indeed now  i so hate a whore  just as a blockhead rubs his thoughtless skull and thanks his stars he was not born a fool so from a sister sinner you shall hear  how strangely you expose yourself my dear but let me die all raillery apart our sex are still forgiving at their heart and did not wicked custom so contrive wed be the best goodnatured things alive there are it is true who tell another tale that virtuous ladies envy while they rail such rage without betrays the fire within in some close corner of the soul they sin still hoarding up most scandalously nice amidst their virtues a reserve of vice the godly dame who fleshly failings damns scolds with her maid or with her chaplain crams would you enjoy soft nights and solid dinners faith gallants board with saints and bed with sinners well if our author in the wife offends he has a husband that will make amends he draws him gentle tender and forgiving and sure such kind good creatures may be living in days of old they pardoned breach of vows stern catos self was no relentless spouse plu  plutarch what is his name that writes his life tells us that cato dearly loved his wife yet if a friend a night or so should need her he would recommend her as a special breeder to lend a wife few here would scruple make but pray which of you all would take her back though with the stoic chief our stage may ring the stoic husband was the glorious thing the man had courage was a sage it is true and loved his country  but what is that to you those strange examples never were made to fit ye but the kind cuckold might instruct the city there many an honest man may copy cato who never saw naked sword or looked in plato if after all you think it a disgrace that edwards miss thus perks it in your face to see a piece of failing flesh and blood in all the rest so impudently good faith let the modest matrons of the town come here in crowds and stare the strumpet down
