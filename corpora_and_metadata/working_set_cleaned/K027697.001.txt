the life and opinions of tristram shandy gentleman    vol i  the second edition  london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall mdcclx  to the right honorable mr pit sir never poor wight of a dedicator had less hopes from his dedication than i have from this of mine for it is written in a bye corner of the kingdom and in a retired thatched house where i live in a constant endeavor to fence against the infirmities of ill health and other evils of lise by mirth being firmly persuaded that every time a man smiles  but much more so when he laughs that it adds something to this fragment of life  i humbly beg sir that you will honor this book by taking it  not under your protection  it must protect itself but  into the country with you where if i am ever told it has made you smile or can conceive it has beguiled you of one moments pain  i shall think myself as happy as a minister of state  perhaps much happier than any one one only excepted that i have ever read or heard of  i am great sir and what is more to your honor i am good sir your wellwisher and most humble fellowsubject the author  the life and opinions of tristram shandy gent chap i i wish either my father or my mother or indeed both of them as they were in duty both equally bound to it had minded what they were about when they begot me had they duly considered how much depended upon what they were then doing  that not only the production of a rational being was concerned in it but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind  and for aught they knew to the contrary even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn from the humors and dispositions which were then uppermost  had they duly weighed and considered all this and proceeded accordingly  i am verily persuaded i should have made a quite different figure in the world from that in which the reader is likely to see me  believe me good folks this is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it  you have all i dare say heard of the animal spirits as how they are transfused from father to son etc etc  and a great deal to that purpose  well you may take my word that nine parts in ten of a mans sense or his nonsense his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and activity and the different tracks and trains you put them into so that when they are once set a going whether right or wrong it is not a half penny matter  away they go cluttering like heygomad and by treading the same steps over and over again they presently make a road of it as plain and as smooth as a gardenwalk which when they are once used to the devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it  pray my dear quoth my mother have you not forgot to wind up the clock  good g cried my father making an exclamation but taking care to moderate his voice at the same time  did ever woman since the creation of the world interrupt a man with such a silly question pray what was your father saying  nothing  chap ii  then positively there is nothing in the question that i can see either good or bad  then let me tell you sir it was a very unseasonable question at least  because it scattered and dispersed the animal spirits whose business it was to have escorted and gone handinhand with the homunculus and conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception  the homunculus sir in however low and ludicrous a light he may appear in this age of levity to the eye of folly or prejudice  to the eye of reason in scientifick research he stands confessed  a being guarded and circumscribed with rights  the minutest philosophers who by the bye have the most enlarged understandings their souls being inversely as their enquiries show us incontestably that the homunculus is created by the same hand  engendered in the same course of nature  endowed with the same locomotive powers and faculties with us  that he consists as we do of skin hair fat flesh veins arteries ligaments nerves cartileges bones marrow brains glands genitals humors and articulations  is a being of as much activity  and in all senses of the word as much and as truly our fellow creature as my lord chancellor of england  he may be benefited he may be injured  he may obtain redress  in a word he has all the claims and rights of humanity which tully puffendorff or the best ethick writers allow to arise out of that state and relation  now dear sir what if any accident had befallen him in his way alone  or that through terror of it natural to so young a traveller my little gentleman had got to his journeys end miserably spent  his muscular strength and virility worn down to a thread  his own animal spirits ruffled beyond description  and that in this sad disordered state of nerves he had laid down a prey to sudden starts or a series of melancholy dreams and fancies for nine long long months together  i tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind which no skill of the physician or the philosopher could ever afterward have set thoroughly to rights  chap iii to my uncle mr toby shandy do i stand indebted for the preceding anecdote to whom my father who was an excellent natural philosopher and much given to close reasoning upon the smallest matters had often and heavily complained of the injury but once more particularly as my uncle toby well remembered upon his observing a most unaccountable obliquity as he called it in my manner of setting up my top and justifying the principles upon which i had done it  the old gentleman shook his head and in a tone more expressive by half of sorrow than reproach  he said his heart all along foreboded and he saw it verified in this and from a thousand other observations he had made upon me that i should neither think nor act like any other mans child  but alas continued he shaking his head a second time and wiping away a tear which was trickling down his cheeks my tristrams misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the world   my mother who was sitting by looked up  but she knew no more than her backside what my father meant  but my uncle mr toby shandy who had been often informed of the affair  understood him very well  chap iv i know there are readers in the world as well as many other good people in it who are no readers at all  who find themselves ill at ease unless they are let into the whole secret from first to last of every thing which concerns you  it is in pure compliance with this humor of theirs and from a backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living that i have been so very particular already as my life and opinions are likely to make some noise in the world and if i conjecture right will take in all ranks professions and denominations of men whatever  be no less read than the pilgrims progress itself  and in the end prove the very thing which montaigne dreaded his essays should turn out that is a book for a parlourwindow  i find it necessary to consult every one a little in his turn and therefore must beg pardon for going on a little further in the same way for which cause right glad i am that i have begun the history of myself in the way i have done and that i am able to go on tracing every thing in it as horace says ab ovo  horace i know does not recommend this fashion altogether but that gentleman is speaking only of an epic poem or a tragedy  i forget which  besides if it was not so i should beg mr horaces pardon  for in writing what i have set about i shall confine myself neither to his rules nor to any mans rules that ever lived  to such however as do not choose to go so far back into these things i can give no better advice than that they skip over the remaining part of this chapter for i declare before hand it is wrote only for the curious and inquisitive   shut the door  i was begot in the night betwixt the first sunday and the first monday in the month of march in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eighteen i am positive i was  but how i came to be so very particular in my account of a thing which happened before i was born is owing to another small anecdote known only in our own family but now made public for the better clearing up this point  my father you must know who was originally a turkey merchant but had left off business for some years in order to retire to and die upon his paternal estate in the county of  was i believe one of the most regular men in every thing he did whether twas matter of business or matter of amusement that ever lived as a small specimen of this extreme exactness of his to which he was in truth a slave  he had made it a rule for many years of his life  on the first sunday night of every month throughout the whole year  as certain as ever the sunday night came  to wind up a large houseclock which we had standing upon the backstairs head with his own hands  and being somewhere between fifty and sixty years of age at the time i have been speaking of  he had likewise gradually brought some other little family concernments to the same period in order as he would often say to my uncle toby to get them all out of the way at one time and be no more plagued and pestered with them the rest of the month  it was attended but with one misfortune which in a great measure fell upon myself and the effects of which i fear i shall carry with me to my grave namely that from an unhappy association of ideas which have no connection in nature it so fell out at length that my poor mother could never hear the said clock wound up  but the thoughts of some other things unavoidably poppd into her head  and vice versa  which strange combination of ideas the sagacious lock who certainly understood the nature of these things better than most men affirms to have produced more wry actions than all other sources of prejudice whatsoever  but this by the bye  now it appears by a memorandum in my fathers pocketbook which now lies upon the table that on lady day which was on the   th of the same month in which i date my geniture  my father set out upon his journey to london with my eldest brother bobby to fix him at westminster school and as it appears from the same authority that he did not get down to his wife and family till the second week in may following  it brings the thing almost to a certainty however what follows in the beginning of the next chapter puts it beyond all possibility of doubt   but pray sir what was your father doing all december  january and february  why madam  he was all that time afflicted with a sciatica  chap v on the fifth day of november      which to the era fixed on was as near nine calendar months as any husband could in reason have expected  was i tristram shandy gentleman brought forth into this scurvy and disasterous world of ours  i wish i had been born in the moon or in any of the planets except jupiter or saturn because i never could bear cold weather for it could not well have fared worse with me in any of them though i will not answer for venus than it has in this vile dirty planet of ours  which of my conscience with reverence be it spoken i take to be made up of the shreds and clippings of the rest  not but the planet is well enough provided a man could be born in it to a great title or to a great estate or could any how contrive to be called up to public charges and employments of dignity or power  but that is not my case  and therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own market has gone in it  for which cause i affirm it over again to be one of the vilest worlds that ever was made  for i can truly say that from the first hour i drew my breath in it to this that i can now scarce draw it at all for an asthma i got in scating against the wind in flanders  i have been the continual sport of what the world calls fortune and though i will not wrong her by saying she has ever made me feel the weight of any great or signal evil  yet with all the good temper in the world i affirm it of her that in every stage of my life and ate very turn and corner where she could get fairly at me the ungracious duchess has pelted me with a set of as pitiful misadventures and cross accidents as ever small hero sustained  chap vi in the beginning of the last chapter i informed you exactly when i was born  but i did not inform you how no that particular was reserved entirely for a chapter by itself  besides sir as you and i are in a manner perfect strangers to each other it would not have been proper to have let you into too many circumstances relating to myself all at once  you must have a little patience i have undertaken you see to write not only my life but my opinions also hoping and expecting that your knowledge of my character and of what kind of a mortal i am by the one would give you a better relish for the other as you proceed further with me the slight acquaintance which is now beginning betwixt us will grow into familiarity and that unless one of us is in fault will terminate in friendship  o diem praeclarum  then nothing which has touched me will be thought trifling in its nature or tedious in its telling therefore my dear friend and companion if you should think me somewhat sparing of my narrative on my first setting out  bear with me  and let me go on and tell my story my own way  or if i should seem now and then to trifle upon the road  or should sometimes put on a fools cap with a bell to it for a moment or two as we pass along  dont fly off  but rather courteously give me credit for a little more wisdom than appears upon my outside  and as we jogg on either laugh with me or at me or in short do any thing  only keep your temper  chap vii in the same village where my father and my mother dwelt dwelt also a thin upright motherly notable good old body of a midwife who with the help of a little plain good sense and some years full employment in her business in which she had all along trusted little to her own efforts and a great deal to those of dame nature  had acquired in her way no small degree of reputation in the world  by which word world need i in this place inform your worship that i would be understood to mean no more of it than a small circle described upon the circle of the great world of four english miles diameter or thereabouts of which the cottage where the good old woman lived is supposed to be the center  she had been left it seems a widow in great distress with three or four small children in her fortyseventh year and as she was at that time a person of decent carriage  grave deportment  a woman moreover of few words and withal an object of compassion whose distress and silence under it called out the louder for a friendly lift the wife of the parson of the parish was touched with pity and having often lamented an inconvenience to which her husbands flock had for many years been exposed inasmuch as there was no such thing as a midwife of any kind or degree to be got at let the case have been never so urgent within less than six or seven long miles riding which said seven long miles in dark nights and dismal roads the country thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay was almost equal to fourteen and that in effect was sometimes next to having no midwife at all it came into her head that it would be doing as seasonable a kindness to the whole parish as to the poor creature herself to get her a little instructed in some of the plain principles of the business in order to set her up in it as no woman thereabouts was better qualified to execute the plan she had formed than herself the gentlewoman very charitably undertook it and having great influence over the female part of the parish she found no difficulty in effecting it to the utmost of her wishes in truth the parson joined his interest with his wifes in the whole affair and in order to do things as they should be and give the poor soul as good a title by law to practice as his wife had given by institution  he cheerfully paid the fees for the ordinaries license himself amounting in the whole to the sum of eighteen shillings and fourpence so that betwixt them both the good woman was fully invested in the real and corporal possession of her office together with all its rights members and appurtenances whatsoever  these last words you must know were not according to the old form in which such licenses faculties and powers usually ran which in like cases had heretofore been granted to the sisterhood but it was according to a neat formula of didius his own devising who having a particular turn for taking to pieces and new framing over again all kind of instruments in that way not only hit upon this dainty amendment but coaxd many of the old licensed matrons in the neighborhood to open their faculties afresh in order to have this whimwham of his inserted  i own i never could envy didius in these kinds of fancies of his  but every man to his own taste  did not dr kunastrokius that great man at his leisure hours take the greatest delight imaginable in combing of asses tails and plucking the dead hairs out with his teeth though he had tweezers always in his pocket nay if you come to that sir have not the wisest of men in all ages not excepting solomon himself  have they not had their hobbyhorses  their running horses  their coins and their cockleshells their drums and their trumpets their fiddles their pallets  their maggots and their butterflies  and so long as a man rides his hobbyhorse peaceably and quietly along the kings highway and neither compels you or me to get up behind him  pray sir what have either you or i to do with it  chap viii  degustibus non est disputandum  that is there is no disputing against hobbyhorses and for my part i seldom do nor could i with any sort of grace had i been an enemy to them at the bottom for happening at certain intervals and changes of the moon to be both fiddler and painter according as the fly stings  be it known to you that i keep a couple of pads myself upon which in their turns nor do i care who knows it i frequently ride out and take the air  though sometimes to my shame be it spoken i take somewhat longer journies than what a wise man would think altogether right  but the truth is  i am not a wise man  and besides am a mortal of so little consequence in the world it is not much matter what i do so i seldom fret or fume at all about it nor does it much disturb my rest when i see such great lords and tall personages as hereafter follow  such for instance as my lord a b c d e f g h i k l m n o p q and so on all of a row mounted upon their several horses  some with large stirrups getting on in a more grave and sober pace  others on the contrary tucked up to their very chins with whips across their mouths scouring and scampering it away like so many little partycolored devils astride a mortgage  and as if some of them were resolved to break their necks  so much the better  say i to myself  for in case the worst should happen the world will make a shift to do excellently well without them  and for the rest  why  god speed them  even let them ride on without opposition from me for were their lordships unhorsed this very night  it is ten to one but that many of them would be worse mounted by one half before tomorrow morning  not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in upon my rest  but there is an instance which i own puts me off my guard and that is when i see one born for great actions and what is still more for his honor whose nature ever inclines him to good ones  when i behold such a one my lord like yourself whose principles and conduct are as generous and noble as his blood and whom for that reason a corrupt world cannot spare one moment  when i see such a one my lord mounted though it is but for a minute beyond the time which my love to my country has prescribed to him and my zeal for his glory wishes  then my lord i cease to be a philosopher and in the first transport of an honest impatience i wish the hobbyhorse with all his fraternity at the devil  my lord i maintain this to be a dedication notwithstanding its singularity in the three great essentials of matter form and place i beg therefore you will accept it as such and that you will permit me to lay it with the most respectful humility at your lordships feet  when you are upon them  which you can be when you please  and that is my lord when ever there is occasion for it and i will add to the best purposes too i have the honor to be  my lord your lordships most obedient and most devoted and most humble servant tristram shandy   chap ix i solemnly declare to all mankind that the above dedication was made for no one prince prelate pope or potentate  duke marquis earl viscount or baron of this or any other realm in christendom  nor has it yet been hawkd about or offered publicly or privately directly or indirectly to any one person or personage great or small but is honestly a true virgindedication untried on upon any soul living  i labor this point so particularly merely to remove any offense or objection which might arise against it from the manner in which i propose to make the most of it  which is the putting it up fairly to public sale which i now do   every author has a way of his own in bringing his points to bear  for my own part as i hate chaffering and higgling for a few guineas in a dark entry  i resolved within myself from the very beginning to deal squarely and openly with your great folks in this affair and try whether i should not come off the better by it  if therefore there is any one duke marquis earl viscount or baron in these his majestys dominions who stands in need of a tight genteel dedication and whom the above will suit for by the bye unless it suits in some degree i will not part with it  it is much at his service for fifty guineas  which i am positive is twenty guineas less than it ought to be afforded for by any man of genius  my lord if you examine it over again it is far from being a gross piece of daubing as some dedications are the design your lordship sees is good the coloring transparent  the drawing not amiss  or to speak more like a man of science  and measure my piece in the painters scale divided into  0  i believe my lord the outlines will turn out as     the composition as    the coloring as    the expression    and a half  and the design  if i may be allowed my lord to understand my own design and supposing absolute perfection in designing to be as  0  i think it cannot well fall short of    besides all this  there is keeping in it and the dark strokes in the hobbyhorse which is a secondary figure and a kind of background to the whole give great force to the principal lights in your own figure and make it come off wonderfully  and besides there is an air of originality in the tout ensemble  be pleased my good lord to order the sum to be paid into the hands of mr dodsley for the benefit of the author and in the next edition care shall be taken that this chapter be expunged and your lordships titles distinctions arms and good actions be placed at the front of the preceding chapter all which from the words de gustibus non est disputandum and whatever else in this book relates to hobbyhorses but no more shall stand dedicated to your lordship  the rest i dedicate to the moon who by the bye of all the patrons or matrons i can think of has most power to set my book agoing and make the world run mad after it  bright goddess  if thou art not too busy with candid and miss cunegunds affairs  take tristram shandys under thy protection also  chap x whatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favor of the midwife might justly claim or in whom that claim truly rested  at first sight seems not very material to this history  certain however it was that the gentlewoman the parsons wife did run away at that time with the whole of it and yet for my life i cannot help thinking but that the parson himself though he had not the good fortune to hit upon the design first  yet as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was laid before him and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into execution had a claim to some share of it  if not to a full half of whatever honor was due to it  the world at that time was pleased to determine the matter otherwise  lay down the book and i will allow you half a day to give a probable guess at the grounds of this procedure  be it known then that for about five years before the date of the midwifes license of which you have had so circumstantial an account  the parson we have to do with had made himself a countrytalk by a breach of all decorum which he had committed against himself his station and his office  and that was in never appearing better or otherwise mounted than upon a lean sorry jackass of a horse value about one pound fifteen shillings who to shorten all description of him was full brother to rosinante as far as similitude congenial could make him for he answered his description to a hairbreadth in every thing  except that i do not remember it is any where said that rosinante was broken winded and that moreover rosinante as is the happiness of most spanish horses fat or lean  was undoubtedly a horse at all points  i know very well that the heros horse was a horse of chaste deportment which may have given grounds for a contrary opinion but it is as certain at the same time that rosinantes continency as may be demonstrated from the adventure of the yanguesian carriers proceeded from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever but from the temperance and orderly current of his blood  and let me tell you madam there is a great deal of very good chastity in the world in behalf of which you could not say more for your life  let that be as it may as my purpose is to do exact justice to every creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic work  i could not stifle this distinction in favor of don quixotes horse  in all other points the parsons horse i say was just such another  for he was as lean and as lank and as sorry a jade as humility herself could have bestrided  in the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment it was greatly in the parsons power to have helped the figure of this horse of his  for he was master of a very handsome demipeakd saddle quilted on the seat with green plush garnished with a double row of silverheaded studs and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups with a housing altogether suitable of gray superfine cloth with an edging of black lace terminating in a deep black silk fringe poudre dor  all which he had purchased in the pride and prime of his life together with a grand embossed bridle ornamented at all points as it should be  but not caring to banter his beast he had hung all these up behind his study door  and in lieu of them had seriously befitted him with just such a bridle and such a saddle as the figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve  in the several sallies about his parish and in the neighboring visits to the gentry who lived around him  you will easily comprehend that the parson so appointed would both hear and see enough to keep his philosophy from rusting to speak the truth he never could enter a village but he caught the attention of both old and young  labor stood still as he passed  the bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well  the spinningwheel forgot its round  even chuckfarthing and shufflecap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight and as his movement was not of the quickest he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his observations  to hear the groans of the serious  and the laughter of the lighthearted  all which he bore with excellent tranquillity  his character was  he loved a jest in his heart  and as he saw himself in the true point of ridicule he would say he could not be angry with others for seeing him in a light in which he so strongly saw himself so that to his friends who knew his foible was not the love of money and who therefore made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his humor  instead of giving the true cause  he chose rather to join in the laugh against himself and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own bones being altogether as spare a figure as his beast  he would sometimes insist upon it that the horse was as good as the rider deserved  that they were centaurlike  both of a piece at other times and in other moods when his spirits were above the temptation of false wit  he would say he found himself going off fast in a consumption and with great gravity would pretend he could not bear the sight of a fat horse without a dejection of heart and a sensible alteration in his pulse and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon not only to keep himself in countenance but in spirits  at different times he would give fifty humourous and opposite reasons for riding a meekspirited jade of a brokenwinded horse preferably to one of mettle  for on such a one he could sit mechanically and meditate as delightfully de vanitate mundi et fuga saeculi as with the advantage of a deaths head before him  that in all other exercitations he could spend his time as he rode slowly along  to as much account as in his study  that he could draw up an argument in his sermon  or a hole in his breeches as steadily on the one as in the other  that brisk trotting and slow argumentation like wit and judgment were two incompatible movements  but that upon his steed  he could unite and reconcile every thing  he could compose his sermon  he could compose his cough  and in case nature gave a call that way he could likewise compose himself to sleep  in short the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause but the true cause  and he withheld the true one only out of a nicety of temper because he thought it did honor to him  but the truth of the story was as follows in the first years of this gentlemans life and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle were purchased by him it had been his manner or vanity or call it what you will  to run into the opposite extreme  in the language of the county where he dwelt he was said to have loved a good horse and generally had one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for saddling and as the nearest midwife as i told you did not live nearer to the village than seven miles and in a vile country  it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous application for his beast and as he was not an unkindhearted man and every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last  as much as he loved his beast he had never a heart to refuse him the upshot of which was generally this that his horse was either clapped or spavind or greazd  or he was twitterbond or brokenwinded or something in short or other had befallen him which would let him carry no flesh  so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of  and a good horse to purchase in his stead  what the loss in such a balance might amount to communibus annis i would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffic to determine  but let it be what it would the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur till at length by repeated ill accidents of the kind he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration and upon weighing the whole and summing it up in his mind he found it not only disproportioned to his other expenses but withal so heavy an article in itself as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish besides this he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away he could do ten times as much good  and what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together was this that it confined all his charity into one particular channel and where as he fancied it was the least wanted namely to the childbearing and childgetting part of his parish reserving nothing for the impotent  nothing for the aged  nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit where poverty and sickness and affliction dwelt together  for these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expense and there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it  and these were either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his steed upon any application whatever  or else be content to ride the last poor devil such as they had made him with all his aches and infirmities to the very end of the chapter  as he dreaded his own constancy in the first  he very cheerfully betook himself to the second and though he could very well have explained it as i said to his honor  yet for that very reason he had a spirit above it choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies and the laughter of his friends than undergo the pain of telling a story which might seem a panegyric upon himself  i have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend gentleman from this single stroke in his character which i think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of la mancha whom by the bye with all his follies i love more and would actually have gone further to have paid a visit to than the greatest hero of antiquity  but this is not the moral of my story the thing i had in view was to show the temper of the world in the whole of this affair  for you must know that so long as this explanation would have done the parson credit  the devil a soul could find it out  i suppose his enemies would not and that his friends could not  but no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwife and pay the expenses of the ordinarys license to set her up  but the whole secret came out every horse he had lost and two horses more than ever he had lost with all the circumstances of their destruction were known and distinctly remembered  the story ran like wildfire  the parson had a returning fit of pride which had just seized him and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life and if it was so twas plain as the sun at noonday he would pocket the expense of the license ten times told the very first year  so that every body was left to judge what were his views in this act of charity  what were his views in this and in every other action of his life  or rather what were the opinions which floated in the brains of other people concerning it was a thought which too much floated in his own and too often broke in upon his rest when he should have been sound asleep  about ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely easy upon that score  it being just so long since he left his parish  and the whole world at the same time behind him  and stands accountable to a judge of whom he will have no cause to complain  but there is a fatality attends the actions of some men order them as they will they pass through a certain medium which so twists and refracts them from their true directions  that with all the titles to praise which a rectitude of heart can give the doers of them are nevertheless forced to live and die without it  of the truth of which this gentleman was a painful example  but to know by what means this came to pass  and to make that knowledge of use to you i insist upon it that you read the two following chapters which contain such a sketch of his life and conversation as will carry its moral along with it  when this is done if nothing stops us in our way we will go on with the midwife  chap xi yorick was this parsons name and what is very remarkable in it as appears from a most ancient account of the family wrote upon strong vellum and now in perfect preservation it had been exactly so spelt for near  i was within an ace of saying nine hundred years  but i would not shake my credit in telling an improbable truth however indisputable in itself  and therefore i shall content myself with only saying  it had been exactly so spelt without the least variation or transposition of a single letter for i do not know how long which is more than i would venture to say of one half of the best surnames in the kingdom which in a course of years have generally undergone as many chops and changes as their owners  has this been owing to the pride or to the shame of the respective proprietors  in honest truth i think sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other just as the temptation has wrought but a villainous affair it is and will one day so blend and confound us all together that no one shall be able to stand up and swear that his own great grand father was the man who did either this or that  this evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of the yoricks family and their religious preservation of these records i quote which do further inform us that the family was originally of danish extraction and had been transplanted into england as early as in the reign of horwendillus king of denmark in whose court it seems an ancestor of this mr yoricks and from whom he was lineally descended held a considerable post to the day of his death of what nature this considerable post was this record says not  it only adds that for near two centuries it had been totally abolished as altogether unnecessary not only in that court but in every other court of the christian world  it has often come into my head that this post could be no other than that of the kings chief jester  and that hamlets yorick in our shakespeare many of whose plays you know are founded upon authenticated facts  was certainly the very man  i have not the time to look into saxogrammaticuss danish history to know the certainty of this  but if you have leisure and can easily get at the book you may do it full as well yourself  i had just time in my travels through denmark with mr noddys eldest son whom in the year      i accompanied as governor riding along with him at a prodigious rate through most parts of europe and of which original journey performed by us two a most delectable narrative will be given in the progress of this work i had just time i say and that was all to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner in that country  namely that nature was neither very lavish nor was she very stingy in her gifts of genius and capacity to its inhabitants  but like a discreet parent was moderately kind to them all observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favors as to bring them in those points pretty near to a level with each other so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of refined parts but a great deal of good plain household understanding amongst all ranks of people of which every body has a share which is i think very right  with us you see the case is quite different  we are all ups and downs in this matter  you are a great genius  or it is fifty to one sir you are a great dunce and a blockhead  not that there is a total want of intermediate steps  no  we are not so irregular as that comes to  but the two extremes are more common and in a greater degree in this unsettled island where nature in her gifts and dispositions of this kind is most whimsical and capricious fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her goods and chattels than she  this is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to yoricks extraction who by what i can remember of him and by all the accounts i could ever get of him seemed not to have had one single drop of danish blood in his whole crasis in nine hundred years it might possibly have all run out  i will not philosophize one moment with you about it for happen how it would the fact was this  that instead of that cold phlegm and exact regularity of sense and humors you would have looked for in one so extracted  he was on the contrary as mercurial and sublimated a composition  as heteroclite a creature in all his declensions  with as much life and whim and gaite de coeur about him as the kindliest climate could have engendered and put together with all this sail poor yorick carried not one ounce of ballast he was utterly unpractised in the world and at the age of twentysix knew just about as well how to steer his course in it as a romping unsuspicious girl of thirteen so that upon his first setting out the brisk gale of his spirits as you will imagine ran him foul ten times in a day of some bodys tackling and as the grave and more slowpaced were oftenest in his way  you may likewise imagine twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled for aught i know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such fracas  for to speak the truth yorick had an invincible dislike and opposition in his nature to gravity  not to gravity as such  for where gravity was wanted he would be the most grave or serious of mortal men for days and weeks together  but he was an enemy to the affectation of it and declared open war against it only as it appeared a cloak for ignorance or for folly and then whenever it fell in his way however sheltered and protected he seldom gave it much quarter  sometimes in his wild way of talking he would say that gravity was an errant scoundrel and he would add  of the most dangerous kind too  because a fly one and that he verily believed more honest wellmeaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelvemonth than by pocketpicking and shoplifting in seven in the naked temper which a merry heart discovered he would say there was no danger  but to itself  whereas the very essence of gravity was design and consequently deceit  twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth and that with all its pretensions  it was no better but often worse than what a french wit had long ago defined it  viz a mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind  which definition of gravity yorick with great imprudence would say deserved to be wrote in letters of gold  but in plain truth he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the world and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint yorick had no impression but one and that was what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of which impression he would usually translate into plain english without any periphrasis  and too often without much distinction of either personage time or place  so that when mention was made of a pitiful or an ungenerous proceeding  he never gave himself a moments time to reflect who was the hero of the piece  what his station  or how far he had power to hurt him hereafter  but if it was a dirty action  without more ado  the man was a dirty fellow  and so on  and as his comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated either in a bon mot or to be enlivened throughout with some drollery or humor of expression it gave wings to yoricks indiscretion in a word though he never sought yet at the same time as he seldom shunned occasions of saying what came uppermost and without much ceremony  he had but too many temptations in life of scattering his wit and his humor  his gibes and his jests about him  they were not lost for want of gathering  what were the consequences and what was yoricks catastrophe thereupon you will read in the next chapter  chap xii the mortgager and mortgagee differ the one from the other not more in length of purse than the jester and jestee do in that of memory but in this the comparison between them runs as the scholiasts call it upon allfour which by the bye is upon one or two legs more than some of the best of homers can pretend to  namely that the one raises a sum and the other a laugh at your expense and think no more about it interest however still runs on in both cases  the periodical or accidental payments of it just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive till at length in some evil hour  pop comes the creditor upon each and by demanding principal upon the spot together with full interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations  as the reader for i hate your ifs has a thorough knowledge of human nature i need not say more to satisfy him that my hero could not go on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos to speak the truth he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small bookdebts of this stamp which notwithstanding eugeniuss frequent advice he too much disregarded thinking that as not one of them was contracted through any malignancy  but on the contrary from an honesty of mind and a mere jocundity of humor they would all of them be crossed out in course  eugenius would never admit this and would often tell him that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with and he would often add in an accent of sorrowful apprehension  to the uttermost mite to which yorick with his usual carelessness of heart would as often answer with a pshaw  and if the subject was started in the fields  with a hop skip and a jump at the end of it but if close pent up in the social chimney corner where the culprit was barricadod in with a table and a couple of arm chairs and could not so readily fly off in a tangent  eugenius would then go on with his lecture upon discretion in words to this purpose though somewhat better put together  trust me dear yorick this unwary pleasantry of thine will sooner or later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties which no afterwit can extricate thee out of  in these sallies too often i see it happens that a person laughed at considers himself in the light of a person injured with all the rights of such a situation belonging to him and when thou viewest him in that light too and reckons up his friends his family his kindred and allies  and musters up with them the many recruits which will list under him from a sense of common danger  it is no extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokes  thou have got a hundred enemies and till thou have gone on and raised a swarm of wasps about thy ears and art half stung to death by them thou will never be convinced it is so  i cannot suspect it in the man whom i esteem that there is the least spur from spleen or malevolence of intent in these sallies  i believe and know them to be truly honest and sportive  but consider my dear lad that fools cannot distinguish this  and that knaves will not and thou know not what it is either to provoke the one or to make merry with the other  whenever they associate for mutual defense depend upon it they will carry on the war in such a manner against thee my dear friend as to make thee heartily sick of it and of thy life too  revenge from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonor at thee which no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall set right  the fortunes of thy house shall totter  thy character which led the way to them shall bleed on every side of it  thy faith questioned  thy works belied  thy wit forgotten  thy learning trampled on to wind up the last scene of thy tragedy cruelty and cowardice twin ruffians hired and set on by malice in the dark shall strike together at all thy infirmities and mistakes  the best of us my dear lad lie open there  and trust me  trust me yorick when to gratify a private appetite it is once resolved upon that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed it is an easy matter to pick up sticks enew from any thicket where it has strayed to make a fire to offer it up with  yorick scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over to him but with a tear stealing from his eye and a promissory look attending it that he was resolved for the time to come to ride his tit with more sobriety  but alas too late  a grand confederacy with  and  at the head of it was formed before the first prediction of it  the whole plan of the attack just as eugenius had foreboded was put in execution all at once  with so little mercy on the side of the allies  and so little suspicion in yorick of what was carrying on against him  that when he thought good easy man full surely preferment was oripening  they had smote his root and then he fell as many a worthy man had fallen before him  yorick however fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some time till overpowered by numbers and worn out at length by the calamities of the war  but more so by the ungenerous manner in which it was carried on  he threw down the sword and though he kept up his spirits in appearance to the last  he died nevertheless as was generally thought quite broken hearted  what inclined eugenius to the same opinion was as follows  a few hours before yorick breathed his last eugenius stepped in with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him upon his drawing yoricks curtain and asking how he felt himself yorick looking up in his face took hold of his hand  and after thanking him for the many tokens of his friendship to him for which he said if it was their fate to meet hereafter  he would thank him again and again  he told him he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for ever  i hope not answered eugenius with tears trickling down his cheeks and with the tenderest tone that ever man spoke  i hope not yorick said he  yorick replied with a look up and a gentle squeeze of eugeniuss hand and that was all  but it cut eugenius to his heart  come  come yorick quoth eugenius wiping his eyes and summoning up the man within him  my dear lad be comforted  let not all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most wants them  who knows what resources are in store and what the power of god may yet do for thee  yorick laid his hand upon his heart and gently shook his head  for my part continued eugenius crying bitterly as he uttered the words  i declare i know not yorick how to part with thee  and would gladly flatter my hopes added eugenius chearing up his voice that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop  and that i may live to see it  i beseech thee eugenius quoth yorick taking off his nightcap as well as he could with his left hand  his right being still grasped close in that of eugenius  i beseech thee to take a view of my head  i see nothing that ails it replied eugenius then alas my friend said yorick let me tell you that it is so bruised and misshapend with the blows which  and  and some others have so unhandsomely given me in the dark that i might say with sancho panca that should i recover and mitres thereupon be suffered to rain down from heaven as thick as hail not one of em would fit it  yoricks last breath was hanging upon his trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this  yet still it was uttered with something of a cervantick tone  and as he spoke it eugenius could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his eyes  faint picture of those flashes of his spirit which as shakespeare said of his ancestor were wont to set the table in a roar  eugenius was convinced from this that the heart of his friend was broke he squeezed his hand  and then walked softly out of the room weeping as he walked yorick followed eugenius with his eyes to the door  he then closed them  and never opened them more  he lies buried in a corner of his churchyard in the parish of  under a plain marble slabb which his friend eugenius by leave of his executors laid upon his grave with no more than these three words of inscription serving both for his epitaph and elegy  alas poor yorick    ten times in a day has yoricks ghost the consolation to hear his monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones as denote a general pity and esteem for him  a foot way crossing the churchyard close by the side of his grave  not a passenger goes by without stopping to cast a look upon it  and sighing as he walks on  alas poor yorick  entirely black page  entirely black page  chap xiii it is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been parted from the midwife that it is high time to mention her again to him merely to put him in mind that there is such a body still in the world and whom upon the best judgment i can form upon my own plan at present  i am going to introduce to him for good and all but as fresh matter may be started and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and myself which may require immediate dispatch  twas right to take care that the poor woman should not be lost in the mean time  because when she is wanted we can no way do without her  i think i told you that this good woman was a person of no small note and consequence throughout our whole village and township  that her fame had spread itself to the very outedge and circumference of that circle of importance of which kind every soul living whether he has a shirt to his back or no  has one surrounding him  which said circle by the way whenever it is said that such a one is of great weight and importance in the world  i desire may be enlarged or contracted in your worships fancy in a compoundratio of the station profession knowledge abilities height and depth measuring both ways of the personage brought before you  in the present case if i remember i fixed it at about four or five miles which not only comprehended the whole parish but extended itself to two or three of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of the next parish which made a considerable thing of it i must add that she was moreover very well looked on at one large grangehouse and some other odd houses and farms within two or three miles as i said from the smoke of her own chimney  but i must here once for all inform you that all this will be more exactly delineated and explained in a map now in the hands of the engraver which with many other pieces and developments to this work will be added to the end of the twentieth volume  not to swell the work  i detest the thought of such a thing  but by way of commentary scholium illustration and key to such passages incidents or inuendos as shall be thought to be either of private interpretation or of dark or doubtful meaning after my life and my opinions shall have been read over now dont forget the meaning of the word by all the world  which betwixt you and me and in spite of all the gentlemen reviewers in great britain and of all that their worships shall undertake to write or say to the contrary  i am determined shall be the case  i need not tell your worship that all this is spoke in confidence  chap xiv upon looking into my mothers marriage settlement in order to satisfy myself and reader in a point necessary to be cleared up before we could proceed any further in this history  i had the good fortune to pop upon the very thing i wanted before i had read a day and a half straight forwards  it might have taken me up a month  which shows plainly that when a man sits down to write a history  though it be but the history of jack hickathrift or tom thumb he knows no more than his heels what lets and confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his way  or what a dance he may be led by one excursion or another before all is over could a historiographer drive on his history as a muleteer drives on his mule  straight forward  for instance from rome all the way to loretto without ever once turning his head aside either to the right hand or to the left  he might venture to foretell you to an hour when he should get to his journeys end  but the thing is morally speaking impossible for if he is a man of the least spirit he will have fifty deviations from a straight line to make with this or that party as he goes along which he can no ways avoid he will have views and prospects to himself perpetually soliciting his eye which he can no more help standing still to look at than he can fly he will moreover have various accounts to reconcile anecdotes to pick up inscriptions to make out stories to weave in traditions to sift personages to call upon panegyricks to paste up at this door pasquinades at that  all which both the man and his mule are quite exempt from to sum up all there are archives at every stage to be looked into and rolls records documents and endless genealogies which justice ever and anon calls him back to stay the reading of  in short there is no end of it  for my own part i declare i have been at it these six weeks making all the speed i possibly could  and am not yet born  i have just been able and that is all to tell you when it happened but not how  so that you see the thing is yet far from being accomplished  these unforeseen stoppages which i own i had no conception of when i first set out  but which i am convinced now will rather increase than diminish as i advance  have struck out a hint which i am resolved to follow  and that is  not to be in a hurry  but to go on leisurely writing and publishing two volumes of my life every year  which if i am suffered to go on quietly and can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller i shall continue to do as long as i live  chap xv the article in my mothers marriage settlement which i told the reader i was at the pains to search for and which now that i have found it i think proper to lay before him  is so much more fully expressed in the deed itself than ever i can pretend to do it that it would be barbarity to take it out of the lawyers hand  it is as follows   and this indenture further witnesses that the said walter shandy merchant in consideration of the said intended marriage to be had and by gods blessing to be well and truly solemnized and consummated between the said walter shandy and elizabeth mollineux aforesaid and diverse other good and valuable causes and considerations him thereunto specially moving  does grant covenant condescend consent conclude bargain and fully agree to and with john dixon and james turner esqrs the abovenamed trustees etc etc  to wit  that in case it should hereafter so fall out chance happen or otherwise come to pass  that the said walter shandy merchant shall have left off business before the time or times that the said elizabeth mollineux shall according to the course of nature or otherwise have left off bearing and bringing forth children  and that in consequence of the said walter shandy having so left off business shall in despite and against the free will consent and goodliking of the said elizabeth mollineux  make a departure from the city of london in order to retire to and dwell upon his estate at shandyhall in the county of  or at any other country seat castle hall mansion house message or graingehouse now purchased or hereafter to be purchased or upon any part or parcel thereof  that then and as often as the said elizabeth mollineux shall happen to be enceint with child or children severally and lawfully begot or to be begotten upon the body of the said elizabeth mollineux during her said coverture  he the said walter shandy shall at his own proper cost and charges and out of his own proper moneys upon good and reasonable notice which is hereby agreed to be within six weeks of her the said elizabeth mollineuxs full reckoning or time of supposed and computed delivery  pay or cause to be paid the sum of one hundred and twenty pounds of good and lawful money to john dixon and james turner esqrs or assigns  upon trust and confidence and for and unto the use and uses intent end and purpose following  that is to say  that the said sum of one hundred and twenty pounds shall be paid into the hands of the said elizabeth mollineux or to be otherwise applied by them the said trustees for the well and truly hiring of one coach with able and sufficient horses to carry and convey the body of the said elizabeth mollineux and the child or children which she shall be then and there enceint and pregnant with  unto the city of london and for the further paying and defraying of all other incidental costs charges and expenses whatsoever  in and about and for and relating to her said intended delivery and lyingin in the said city or suburbs thereof and that the said elizabeth mollineux shall and may from time to time and at all such time and times as are here covenanted and agreed upon  peaceably and quietly hire the said coach and horses and have free ingress egress and regress throughout her journey in and from the said coach according to the tenor true intent and meaning of these presents without any let suit trouble disturbance molestation discharge hinderance forfeiture eviction vexation interruption or incumberance whatsoever  and that it shall moreover be lawful to and for the said elizabeth mollineux from time to time and as often or often as she shall well and truly be advanced in her said pregnancy to the time heretofore stipulated and agreed upon  to live and reside in such place or places and in such family or families and with such relations friends and other persons within the said city of london as she at her own will and pleasure notwithstanding her present coverture and as if she was a femme sole and unmarried  shall think fit  and this indenture further witnesses that for the more effectually carrying of the said covenant into execution the said walter shandy merchant does hereby grant bargain sell release and confirm unto the said john dixon and james turner esqrs their heirs executors and assigns in their actual possession now being by virtue of an indenture of bargain and sale for a year to them the said john dixon and james turner esqrs by him the said walter shandy merchant thereof made which said bargain and sale for a year bears date the day next before the date of these presents and by force and virtue of the statute for transferring of uses into possession  all that the manor and lordship of shandy in the county of  with all the rights members and appurtenances thereof and all and every the messuages houses buildings barns stables orchards gardens backsides tofts crofts garths cottages lands meadows feedings pastures marshes commons woods

of felons and fugitives felons of themselves and put in exigent deodands free warrens and all other royalties and seignories rights and jurisdictions privileges and hereditaments whatsoever  and also the advowson donation presentation and free disposition of the rectory or parsonage of shandy aforesaid and all and every the tenths tithes glebelands  in three words  my mother was to lay in if she chose it in london  but in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on the part of my mother which a marriage article of this nature too manifestly opened a door to and which indeed had never been thought of at all but for my uncle toby shandy  a clause was added in security of my father which was this  that in case my mother hereafter should at any time put my father to the trouble and expense of a london journey upon false cries and tokens  that for every such instance she should forfeit all the right and title which the covenant gave her to the next turn  but to no more  and so on toties quoties in as effectual a manner as if such a covenant betwixt them had not been made  this by the way was no more than what was reasonable  and yet as reasonable as it was i have ever thought it hard that the whole weight of the article should have fallen entirely as it did upon myself  but i was begot and born to misfortunes  for my poor mother whether it was wind or water  or a compound of both  or neither  or whether it was simply the mere swell of imagination and fancy in her  or how far a strong wish and desire to have it so might mislead her judgment  in short whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter it no way becomes me to decide the fact was this that in the latter end of september      which was the year before i was born my mother having carried my father up to town much against the grain  he peremptorily insisted upon the clause  so that i was doomed by marriage articles to have my nose squeezed as flat to my face as if the destinies had actually spun me without one  how this event came about  and what a train of vexatious disappointments in one stage or other of my life have pursued me from the mere loss or rather compression of this one single member  shall be laid before the reader all in due time  chap xvi my father as any body may naturally imagine came down with my mother into the country in but a pettish kind of a humor the first twenty or fiveandtwenty miles he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself and indeed my mother too about the cursed expense which he said might every shilling of it have been saved  then what vexed him more than every thing else was the provoking time of the year  which as i told you was toward the end of september when his wallfruit and green gages especially in which he was very curious were just ready for pulling  had he been whistled up to london upon a tom fools errand in any other month of the whole year he should not have said three words about it  for the next two whole stages no subject would go down but the heavy blow he had sustained from the loss of a son whom it seems he had fully reckoned upon in his mind and registered down in his pocketbook as a second staff for his old age in case bobby should fail him the disappointment of this he said was ten times more to a wise man than all the money which the journey etc had cost him put together  rot the hundred and twenty pounds  he did not mind it a rush  from stilton all the way to grantham nothing in the whole affair provoked him so much as the condolences of his friends and the foolish figure they should both make at church the first sunday  of which in the satirical vehemence of his wit now sharpened a little by vexation he would give so many humorous and provoking descriptions  and place his rib and self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole congregation  that my mother declared these two stages were so truly tragicomical that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath from one end to the other of them all the way  from grantham till they had crossed the trent my father was out of all kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which he fancied my mother had put upon him in this affair  certainly he would say to himself over and over again the woman could not be deceived herself  if she could  what weakness  tormenting word which led his imagination a thorny dance and before all was over played the duce and all with him  for sure as ever the word weakness was uttered and struck full upon his brain  so sure it set him upon running divisions upon how many kinds of weaknesses there were  that there was such a thing as weakness of the body  as well as weakness of the mind  and then he would do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two together how far the cause of all these vexations might or might not have arisen out of himself  in short he had so many little subjects of disquietude springing out of this one affair all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up in it that my mother whatever was her journey up had but an uneasy journey of it down  in a word as she complained to my uncle toby he would have tired out the patience of any flesh alive  chap xvii though my father traveled homewards as i told you in none of the best of moods  pshawing and pishing all the way down  yet he had the complaisance to keep the worst part of the story still to himself  which was the resolution he had taken of doing himself the justice which my uncle tobys clause in the marriage settlement empowered him nor was it till the very night in which i was begot which was thirteen months after that she had the least intimation of his design  when my father happening as you remember to be a little chagrind and out of temper  took occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed afterward talking over what was to come  to let her know that she must accommodate herself as well as she could to the bargain made between them in their marriage deeds which was to lyein of her next child in the country to balance the last years journey  my father was a gentleman of many virtues  but he had a strong spice of that in his temper which might or might not add to the number  it is known by the name of perseverance in a good cause  and of obstinacy in a bad one of this my mother had so much knowledge that she knew twas to no purpose to make any remonstrance  so she even resolved to sit down quietly and make the most of it  chap xviii as the point was that night agreed or rather determined that my mother should lyein of me in the country she took her measures accordingly for which purpose when she was three days or thereabouts gone with child she began to cast her eyes upon the midwife whom you have so often heard me mention and before the week was well got round as the famous dr maningham was not to be had she had come to a final determination in her mind  notwithstanding there was a scientifick operator within so near a call as eight miles of us and who moreover had expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of midwifery in which he had exposed not only the blunders of the sisterhood itself  but had likewise superadded many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the foetus in cross births and some other cases of danger which belay us in getting into the world notwithstanding all this my mother i say was absolutely determined to trust her life and mine with it into no souls hand but this old womans only  now this i like  when we cannot get at the very thing we wish  never to take up with the next best in degree to it  no that is pitiful beyond description  it is no more than a week from this very day in which i am now writing this book for the edification of the world  which is march         that my dear dear jenny observing i looked a little grave as she stood cheapening a silk of fiveandtwenty shillings a yard  told the mercer she was sorry she had given him so much trouble  and immediately went and bought herself a yardwide stuff of tenpence a yard  it is the duplication of one and the same greatness of soul only what lessened the honor of it somewhat in my mothers case was that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme as one in her situation might have wished because the old midwife had really some little claim to be depended upon  as much at least as success could give her having in the course of her practice of near twenty years in the parish brought every mothers son of them into the world without any one slip or accident which could fairly be laid to her account  these facts though they had their weight yet did not altogether satisfy some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my fathers spirits in relation to this choice  to say nothing of the natural workings of humanity and justice  or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this kind  he felt himself concerned in a particular manner that all should go right in the present case  from the accumulated sorrow he lay open to should any evil betide his wife and child in lyingin at shandyhall  he knew the world judged by events and would add to his afflictions in such a misfortune by loading him with the whole blame of it  alas oday  had mrs shandy poor gentlewoman had but her wish in going up to town just to lyein and come down again  which they say she begged and prayed for upon her bare knees  and which in my opinion considering the fortune which mr shandy got with her  was no such mighty matter to have complied with the lady and her babe might both of em have been alive at this hour  this exclamation my father knew was unanswerable  and yet it was not merely to shelter himself  nor was it altogether for the care of his offspring and wife that he seemed so extremely anxious about this point  my father had extensive views of things  and stood moreover as he thought deeply concerned in it for the public good from the dread he entertained of the bad uses an illfated instance might be put to  he was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject had unanimously agreed and lamented from the beginning of queen elizabeths reign down to his own time that the current of men and money toward the metropolis upon one frivolous errand or another  set in so strong  as to become dangerous to our civil rights  though by the bye  a current was not the image he took most delight in  a distemper was here his favorite metaphor and he would run it down into a perfect allegory by maintaining it was identically the same in the body national as in the body natural where blood and spirits were driven up into the head faster than they could find their ways down  a stoppage of circulation must ensue which was death in both cases  there was little danger he would say of losing our liberties by french politics or french invasions  nor was he so much in pain of a consumption from the mass of corrupted matter and ulcerated humors in our constitution  which he hoped was not so bad as it was imagined  but he verily feared that in some violent push we should go off all at once in a stateapoplexy  and then he would say the lord have mercy upon us all  my father was never able to give the history of this distemper  without the remedy along with it  was i an absolute prince he would say pulling up his breeches with both his hands as he rose from his armchair i would appoint able judges at every avenue of my metropolis who should take cognizance of every fools business who came there  and if upon a fair and candid hearing it appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his own home and come up bag and baggage with his wife and children farmers sons etc etc at his backside they should be all sent back from constable to constable like vagrants as they were to the place of their legal settlements by this means i shall take care that my metropolis tottered not through its own weight  that the head be no longer too big for the body  that the extremes now wasted and pined in be restored to their due share of nourishment and regain with it their natural strength and beauty  i would effectually provide that the meadows and cornfieldsd of my dominions should laugh and sing  that good cheer and hospitality flourish once more  and that such weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of the squirality of my kingdom as should counterpoise what i perceive my nobility are now taking from them  why are there so few palaces and gentlemens seats he would ask with some emotion as he walked across the room throughout so many delicious provinces in france whence is it that the few remaining chateaus amongst them are so dismantled  so unfurnished and in so ruinous and desolate a condition  because sir he would say in that kingdom no man has any countryinterest to support  the little interest of any kind which any man has any where in it is concentrated in the court and the looks of the grand monarch by the sunshine of whose countenance or the clouds which pass across it every french man lives or dies  another political reason which prompted my father so strongly to guard against the least evil accident in my mothers lyingin in the country  was that any such instance would infallibly throw a balance of power too great already into the weaker vessels of the gentry in his own or higher stations  which with the many other usurped rights which that part of the constitution was hourly establishing  would in the end prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestic government established in the first creation of things by god  in this point he was entirely of sir robert filmers opinion that the plans and institutions of the greatest monarchies in the eastern parts of the world were originally all stolen from that admirable pattern and prototype of this household and paternal power  which for a century he said and more had gradually been degenerating away into a mixed government  the form of which however desirable in great combinations of the species  was very troublesome in small ones  and seldom produced any thing that he saw but sorrow and confusion  for all these reasons private and public put together  my father was for having the manmidwife by all means  my mother by no means my father begged and entreated she would for once recede from her prerogative in this matter and suffer him to choose for her  my mother on the contrary insisted upon her privilege in this matter to choose for herself  and have no mortals help but the old womans  what could my father do he was almost at his wits end  talked it over with her in all moods  placed his arguments in all lights  argued the matter with her like a christian  like a heathen  like a husband  like a father  like a patriot  like a man  my mother answered every thing only like a woman which was a little hard upon her  for as she could not assume and fight it out behind such a variety of characters  twas no fair match  twas seven to one  what could my mother do  she had the advantage otherwise she had been certainly overpowered of a small reinforcement of chagrine personal at the bottom which bore her up and enabled her to dispute the affair with my father with so equal an advantage  that both sides sung te deum in a word my mother was to have the old woman  and the operator was to have license to drink a bottle of wine with my father and my uncle toby shandy in the back parlour  for which he was to be paid five guineas  i must beg leave before i finish this chapter to enter a caveat in the breast of my fair reader  and it is this  not to take it absolutely for granted from an unguarded word or two which i have dropped in it  that i am a married man  i own the tender appellation of my dear dear jenny  with some other strokes of conjugal knowledge interspersed here and there might naturally enough have misled the most candid judge in the world into such a determination against me  all i plead for in this case madam is strict justice and that you do so much of it to me as well as to yourself  as not to prejudge or receive such an impression of me till you have better evidence than i am positive at present can be produced against me  not that i can be so vain or unreasonable madam as to desire you should therefore think that my dear dear jenny is my kept mistress  no  that would be flattering my character in the other extreme and giving it an air of freedom which perhaps it has no kind of right to all i contend for is the utter impossibility for some volumes that you or the most penetrating spirit upon earth should know how this matter really stands  it is not impossible but that my dear dear jenny tender as the appellation is may be my child  consider  i was born in the year eighteen  nor is there any thing unnatural or extravagant in the supposition that my dear jenny may be my friend  friend  my friend  surely madam a friendship between the two sexes may subsist and be supported without fie mr shandy  without any thing madam but that tender and delicious sentiment which ever mixes in friendship where there is a difference of sex let me entreat you to study the pure and sentimental parts of the best french romances  it will really madam astonish you to see with what a variety of chaste expression this delicious sentiment which i have the honor to speak of is dressed out  chap xix i would sooner undertake to explain the hardest problem in geometry than pretend to account for it that a gentleman of my fathers great good sense  knowing as the reader must have observed him and curious too in philosophy  wise also in political reasoning  and in polemical as he will find no way ignorant  could be capable of entertaining a notion in his head so out of the common track  that i fear the reader when i come to mention it to him if he is the least of a choleric temper will immediately throw the book by if mercurial he will laugh most heartily at it  and if he is of a grave and saturnine cast he will at first sight absolutely condemn as fanciful and extravagant and that was in respect to the choice and imposition of christian names on which he thought a great deal more depended than what superficial minds were capable of conceiving  his opinion in this matter was that there was a strange kind of magic bias which good or bad names as he called them irresistibly impressed upon our characters and conduct  the hero of cervantes argued not the point with more seriousness  nor had he more faith  or more to say on the powers of necromancy in dishonouring his deeds  or on dulcineas name in shedding luster upon them than my father had on those of trismegistus or archimedes on the one hand  or of nyky and simkin on the other how many caesars and pompeys he would say by mere inspiration of the names have been rendered worthy of them and how many he would add are there who might have done exceeding well in the world had not their characters and spirits been totally depressed and nicodemusd into nothing  i see plainly sir by your looks or as the case happened my father would say  that you do not heartily subscribe to this opinion of mine  which to those he would add who have not carefully sifted it to the bottom  i own has an air more of fancy than of solid reasoning in it  and yet my dear sir if i may presume to know your character i am morally assured i should hazard little in stating a case to you  not as a party in the dispute  but as a judge and trusting my appeal upon it to your own good sense and candid disquisition in this matter  you are a person free from as many narrow prejudices of education as most men  and if i may presume to penetrate further into you  of a liberality of genius above bearing down an opinion merely because it wants friends your son  your dear son  from whose sweet and open temper you have so much to expect  your billy sir  would you for the world have called him judas  would you my dear sir he would say laying his hand upon your breast with the genteelest address  and in that soft and irresistible piano of voice which the nature of the argumentum ad hominem absolutely requires  would you sir if a jew of a godfather had proposed the name for your child and offered you his purse along with it would you have confented to such a desecration of him  o my god he would say looking up if i know your temper right sir  you are incapable of it  you would have trampled upon the offer  you would have thrown the temptation at the tempters head with abhorrence  your greatness of mind in this action which i admire with that generous contempt of money which you show me in the whole transaction is really noble  and what renders it more so is the principle of it  the workings of a parents love upon the truth and conviction of this very hypothesis namely that was your son called judas  the fordid and treacherous idea so inseparable from the name would have accompanied him through life like his shadow and in the end made a miser and a rascal of him in spite sir of your example  i never knew a man able to answer this argument  but indeed to speak of my father as he was  he was certainly irresistible both in his orations and disputations  he was born an orator    persuasion hung upon his lips and the elements of logic and rhetoric were so blended up in him  and withal he had so shrewd guess at the weaknesses and passions of his respondent  that nature might have stood up and said  this man is eloquent in short whether he was on the weak or the strong side of the question twas hazardous in either case to attack him  and yet it is strange he had never read cicero nor quintilian de oratore nor isocrates nor aristotle nor longinus amongst the ancients  nor vossius nor skioppius nor ramus nor farnaby amongst the moderns  and what is more astonishing he had never in his whole life the least light or spark of subtilty struck into his mind by one single lecture upon crackenthorp or burgersdicius or any dutch logician or commentator  he knew not so much as in what the difference of an argument ad ignorantiam and an argument ad hominem consisted so that i well remember when he went up along with me to enter my name at jesus college in   it was a matter of just wonder with my worthy tutor and two or three fellows of that learned society  that a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools should be able to work after that fashion with em  to work with them in the best manner he could was what my father was however perpetually forced upon  for he had a thousand little skeptical notions of the comic kind to defend  most of which notions i verily believe at first entered upon the footing of mere whims and of a vive la bagatelle and as such he would make merry with them for half an hour or so and having sharpened his wit upon em dismiss them till another day  i mention this not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture upon the progress and establishment of my fathers many odd opinions  but as a warning to the learned reader against the indiscreet reception of such guests who after a free and undisturbed entrance for some years into our brains  at length claim a kind of settlement there  working sometimes like yeast  but more generally after the manner of the gentle passion beginning in jest  but ending in downright earnest  whether this was the case of the singularity of my fathers notions  or that his judgment at length became the dupe of his wit  or how far in many of his notions he might though odd be absolutely right  the reader as he comes at them shall decide all that i maintain here is that in this one of the influence of christian names however it gained footing he was serious  he was all uniformity  he was systematical and like all systematick reasoners he would move both heaven and earth and twist and torture every thing in nature to support his hypothesis in a word i repeat it over again  he was serious  and in consequence of it he would lose all kind of patience whenever he saw people especially of condition who should have known better  as careless and as indifferent about the name they imposed upon their child  or more so than in the choice of ponto or cupid for their puppy dog  this he would say looked ill  and had moreover this particular aggravation in it viz that when once a vile name was wrongfully or injudiciously given twas not like the case of a mans character which when wronged might hereafter be cleared  and possibly sometime or other if not in the mans life at least after his death  be somehow or other set to rights with the world but the injury of this he would say could never be undone  nay he doubted even whether an act of parliament could reach it  he knew as well as you that the legislature assumed a power over surnames  but for very strong reasons which he could give it had never yet adventured he would say to go a step further  it was observable that though my father in consequence of this opinion had as i have told you the strongest likings and dislikings toward certain names  that there were still numbers of names which hung so equally in the balance before him that they were absolutely indifferent to him jack dick and tom were of this class these my father called neutral names  affirming of them without a satyr that there had been as many knaves and fools at least as wise and good men since the world began who had indifferently borne them  so that like equal forces acting against each other in contrary directions he thought they mutually destroyed each others effects for which reason he would often declare he would not give a cherrystone to choose amongst them bob which was my brothers name was another of these neutral kinds of christian names which operated very little either way and as my father happened to be at epsom when it was given him  he would often times thank heaven it was no worse andrew was something like a negative quantity in algebra with him  twas worse he said than nothing  william stood pretty high  numps again was low with him  and nick he said was the devil  but of all the names in the universe he had the most unconquerable aversion for tristram  he had the lowest and most contemptible opinion of it of any thing in the world  thinking it could possibly produce nothing in rerum natura but what was extremely mean and pitiful so that in the midst of a dispute on the subject in which by the bye he was frequently involved  he would sometimes break off in a sudden and spirited epiphonema or rather erotesis raised a third and sometimes a full fifth above the key of the discourse  and demand it categorically of his antagonist whether he would take upon him to say he had ever remembered  whether he had ever read  or even whether he had ever heard tell of a man called tristram performing any thing great or worth recording  no  he would say  tristram  the thing is impossible  what could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to publish this notion of his to the world little boots it to the subtle speculatist to stand single in his opinions  unless he gives them proper vent  it was the identical thing which my father did  for in the year sixteen which was two years before i was born he was at the pains of writing an express dissertation simply upon the word tristram  showing the world with great candor and modesty the grounds of his great abhorrence to the name  when this story is compared with the title page  will not the gentle reader pity my father from his soul  to see an orderly and welldisposed gentleman who though singular  yet inoffensive in his notions  so played upon in them by cross purposes  to look down upon the stage and see him baffled and overthrown in all his little systems and wishes to behold a train of events perpetually falling out against him and in so critical and cruel a way as if they had purposedly been planned and pointed against him merely to insult his speculations  in a word to behold such a one in his old age illfitted for troubles ten times in a day suffering sorrow  ten times in a day calling the child of his prayers tristram  melancholy dissyllable of sound which to his ears was unison to nicompoop and every name vituperative under heaven  by his ashes i swear it  if ever malignant spirit took pleasure or busied itself in traversing the purposes of mortal man  it must have been here  and if it was not necessary i should be born before i was christened i would this moment give the reader an account of it  chap xx  how could you madam be so inattentive in reading the last chapter i told you in it that my mother was not a papist  papist you told me no such thing sir madam i beg leave to repeat it over again that i told you as plain at least as words by direct inference could tell you such a thing  then sir i must have missed a page  no madam  you have not missed a word  then i was asleep sir  my pride madam cannot allow you that refuge  then i declare i know nothing at all about the matter  that madam is the very fault i lay to your charge and as a punishment for it i do insist upon it that you immediately turn back that is as soon as you get to the next full stop and read the whole chapter over again  i have imposed this penance upon the lady neither out of wantonness or cruelty but from the best of motives and therefore shall make her no apology for it when she returns back  it is to rebuke a vicious taste which has crept into thousands besides herself  of reading straight forwards more in quest of the adventures than of the deep erudition and knowledge which a book of this cast if read over as it should be would infallibly impart with them  the mind should be accustomed to make wise reflections and draw curious conclusions as it goes along the habitude of which made pliny the younger affirm that he never read a book so bad but he drew some profit from it the stories of greece and rome run over without this turn and application  do less service i affirm it than the history of parismus and parismenus or of the seven champions of england read with it   but here comes my fair lady have you read over again the chapter madam as i desired you  you have and did you not observe the passage upon the second reading which admits the inference  not a word like it then madam be pleased to ponder well the last line but one of the chapter where i take upon me to say it was necessary i should be born before i was christened had my mother madam been a papist that consequence did not follow the romish rituals direct the baptizing of the child in cases of danger before it is born  but upon this proviso that some part or other of the childs body be seen by the baptizer  but the doctors of the sorbonne by a deliberation held amongst them april  0       have enlarged the powers of the midwives by determining that though no part of the childs body should appear  that baptism shall nevertheless be administered to it by injection  par le moyen d une petite canulle  anglice a squirt  it is very strange that st thomas aquinas who had so good a mechanical head both for tying and untying the knots of school divinity  should after so much pains bestowed upon this  give up the point at last as a second la chose impossible  infantes in maternis uteris existentes quoth st thomas baptizari possunt nullo modo  o thomas thomas  if the reader has the curiosity to see the question upon baptism by injection as presented to the doctors of the sorbonne  with their consultation thereupon it is as follows     it is a terrible misfortune for this same book of mine but more so to the republic of letters  so that my own is quite swallowed up in the consideration of it  that this selfsame vile pruriency for fresh adventures in all things has got so strongly into our habit and humors  and so wholly intent are we upon satisfying the impatience of our concupiscence that way  that nothing but the gross and more carnal parts of a composition will go down  the subtle hints and sly communications of science fly off like spirits upwards  the heavy moral escapes downwards and both the one and the other are as much lost to the world as if they were still left in the bottom of the inkhorn  i wish the malereader has not passed by many a one as quaint and curious as this one in which the femalereader has been detected i wish it may have its effects  and that all good people both male and female from her example may be taught to think as well as read  memoire present a messieurs les docteurs de sorbonne vide deventer paris edit  to      p      un chirurgien accoucheur represente a messieurs les docteurs de sorbonne qu il y a des cas quoique tres rares ou une mere ne scauroit accoucher and meme ou lenfant est tellement renferme dans le sein de sa mere qu il ne fait paroitre aucune party de son corpse ce qui seroit un cas suivant les rituels de lui conferer du moins sous condition le bapteme le chirurgien qui consulte pretend par le moyen dune petite canulle de pouvoir baptiser immediatement lenfant sans fair aucun tort a la mere  il demand si ce moyen qu il vient de proposer est permis and legitime et sil peut sen servir dans le cas qu il vient d exposer  reponse le conseil estime que la question proposee souffre de grandes difficultes les theologiens posent dun cote pour principe que le bapteme qui est une naissance spirituelle suppose une premiere naissance il faut etre ne dans le monde pour renaitre en jesus christ comme ils lenseignent s thomas   part quaest    artic    suit cette doctrine comme une verite constante lon ne peut dit ce s docteur baptiser les enfans qui sont renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres et s thomas est fond sur ce que les enfans ne sont point nes and ne peuvent etre comptes parmi les autres hommes dou il conclud quils ne peuvent etre lobject dune action exterieure pour recevoir par leur ministere les sacremens necessaires au salut pueri in maternis uteris existentes nondum prodierant in lucem ut cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant unde non possunt subjici actioni humanae ut per eorum ministerium sacramenta recipiant ad salutem les rituels ordonnent dans la pratique ce que les theologiens ont etabli sur les memes matieres and ils deffendent tous dune maniere uniforme de baptiser les enfans qui sont renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres sils ne font paroitre quelque party de leurs corpse le concours des theologiens and des rituels qui sont les regles des dioceses paroit former une autorite qui termine la question present cependant le conseil de conscience considerant dun cote que le raisonnement des theologiens est uniquement fond sur une raison de convenance and que la deffense des rituels suppose que lon ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres ce qui est contre la supposition present and dun autre cote considerant que les memes theologiens enseignent que lon peut risquer les sacremens qu jesus christ a etablis comme des moyens faciles mais necessaires pour sanctifier les hommes and dailleurs estimant que les enfans renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres pourroient etre capables de salut parce quils sont capables de damnation  pour ces considerations and eu egard a lexpose suivant lequel on assure avoir trouve un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renfermes sans fair aucun tort a la mere le conseil estime que lon pourroit se servir du moyen propose dans la confiance quil a que dieu n a point laisse ces sorts denfans sans aucuns secours and supposant comme il est expose que le moyen dont il sagit est propre a leur procurer le bapteme cependant comme il sagiroit en autorisant la pratique proposee de changer une regle universellement etablie le conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit saddresser a son eveque and a qui il appartient de juger de lutilite and du danger du moyen propose and comme sous le bon plaisir de leveque le conseil estime quil faudroit recourir au pape qui a le droit dexpliquer les regles de leglise et d y deroger dans le cas ou la loi ne scauroit obliger quelque sage and quelque utile que paroisse la maniere de baptiser dont il sagit le conseil ne pourroit lapprouver sans le concours de ces deux autorites on conseile au moins a celui qui consulte de saddresser a son eveque and de lui fair part de la present decision afin que si le prelat enter dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussignes sappuyent il puisse etre autorise dans le cas de necessite ou il risqueroit trop dattendre que la permission fut demandee and accordee demployer le moyen qu il propose si avantageux au salut de lenfant au rest le conseil en estimant que lon pourroit sen servir croit cependant que si les enfans dont il sagit venoient au monde contre lesperance de ceux qui se seroient servis du meme moyen il seroit necessaire de les baptiser sous condition and en cela le conseil se conform a tous les rituels qui en autorisant le bapteme dun enfant qui fait paroitre quelque party de son corpse enjoignent neantmoins and ordonnent de le baptiser

be baptized again  sous condition  and provided in the second place that the thing can be done which mr shandy apprehends it may par le moyen dune petite canulle and sans fair aucun tort au pere  chap xxi  i wonder what is all that noise and running backwards and forwards for above stairs quoth my father addressing himself after an hour and a halfs silence to my uncle toby  who you must know was sitting on the opposite side of the fire smoking his social pipe all the time in mute contemplation of a new pair of blackplushbreeches which he had got on  what can they be doing brother quoth my father  we can scarce hear ourselves talk  i think replied my uncle toby taking his pipe from his mouth and striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of his left thumb as he began his sentence  i think says he  but to enter rightly into my uncle tobys sentiments upon this matter you must be made to enter first a little into his character the outlines of which i shall just give you and then the dialogue between him and my father will go on as well again   pray what was that mans name  for i write in such a hurry i have no time to recollect or look for it  who first made the observation that there was great inconstancy in our air and climate whoever he was twas a just and good observation in him  but the corollary drawn from it namely that it is this which has furnished us with such a variety of odd and whimsical characters  that was not his  it was found out by another man at least a century and a half after him  then again  that this copious storehouse of original materials is the true and natural cause that our comedies are so much better than those of france or any others that either have or can be wrote upon the continent  that discovery was not fully made till about the middle of king williams reign  when the great dryden in writing one of his long prefaces if i mistake not most fortunately hit upon it indeed toward the latter end of queen anne the great addison began to patronize the notion and more fully explained it to the world in one or two of his spectators  but the discovery was not his  then fourthly and lastly that this strange irregularity in our climate producing so strange an irregularity in our characters  does thereby in some sort make us amends by giving us somewhat to make us merry with when the weather will not suffer us to go out of doors  that observation is my own  and was struck out by me this very rainy day march         and betwixt the hours of nine and ten in the morning  thus  thus my fellow laborers and associates in this great harvest of our learning now ripening before our eyes thus it is by slow steps of casual increase that our knowledge physical metaphysical physiological polemical nautical mathematical aenigmatical technical biographical romantical chemical and obstetrical with fifty other branches of it most of em ending as these do in ical have for these two last centuries and more gradually been creeping upwards toward that  of their perfections from which if we may form a conjecture from the advances of these last seven years we cannot possibly be far off  when that happens it is to be hoped it will put an end to all kind of writings whatsoever  the want of all kind of writing will put an end to all kind of reading  and that in time as war begets poverty poverty peace  must in course put an end to all kind of knowledge  and then  we shall have all to begin over again or in other words be exactly where we started   happy thrice happy times i only wish that the era of my begetting as well as the mode and manner of it had been a little altered  or that it could have been put off with any convenience to my father or mother for some twenty or fiveandtwenty years longer when a man in the literary world might have stood some chance   but i forget my uncle toby whom all this while we have left knocking the ashes out of his tobacco pipe  his humor was of that particular species which does honor to our atmosphere and i should have made no scruple of ranking him amongst one of the firstrate productions of it had not there appeared too many strong lines in it of a familylikeness which showed that he derived the singularity of his temper more from blood than either wind or water or any modifications or combinations of them whatever and i have therefore often times wondered that my father though i believe he had his reasons for it upon his observing some tokens of excentricity in my course when i was a boy  should never once endeavor to account for them in this way for all the shandy family were of an original character throughout  i mean the males  the females had no character at all  except indeed my great aunt dinah who about sixty years ago was married and got with child by the coachman for which my father according to his hypothesis of christian names would often say she might thank her godfathers and godmothers  it will seem very strange  and i would as soon think of dropping a riddle in the readers way which is not my interest to do as set him upon guessing how it could come to pass that an event of this kind so many years after it had happened should be reserved for the interruption of the peace and unity which otherwise so cordially subsisted between my father and my uncle toby one would have thought that the whole force of the misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at first  as is generally the case  but nothing ever wrought with our family after the ordinary way possibly at the very time this happened it might have something else to afflict it and as afflictions are sent down for our good and that as this had never done the shandy family any good at all it might lie waiting till apt times and circumstances should give it an opportunity to discharge its office  observe i determine nothing upon this  my way is ever to point out to the curious different tracts of investigation to come at the first springs of the events i tell  not with a pedantic fescue  or in the decisive manner of tacitus who outwits himself and his reader  but with the officious humility of a heart devoted to the assistance merely of the inquisitive  to them i write  and by them i shall be read  if any such reading as this could be supposed to hold out so long to the very end of the world  why this cause of sorrow therefore was thus reserved for my father and uncle is undetermined by me but how and in what direction it exerted itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them after it began to operate is what i am able to explain with great exactness and is as follows  my uncle toby shandy madam was a gentleman who with the virtues which usually constitute the character of a man of honor and rectitude  possessed one in a very eminent degree which is seldom or never put into the catalogue and that was a most extreme and unparalled modesty of nature  though i correct the word nature for this reason that i may not prejudge a point which must shortly come to a hearing and that is whether this modesty of his was natural or acquired  which ever way my uncle toby came by it twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of it and that is madam not in regard to words for he was so unhappy as to have very little choice in them  but to things  and this kind of modesty so possessed him and it arose to such a height in him as almost to equal if such a thing could be even the modesty of a woman that female nicety madam and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy in your sex which makes you so much the awe of ours  you will imagine madam that my uncle toby had contracted all this from this very source  that he had spent a great part of his time in converse with your sex and that from a thorough knowledge of you and the force of imitation which such fair examples render irresistible  he had acquired this amiable turn of mind  i wish i could say so  for unless it was with his sisterinlaw my fathers wife and my mother  my uncle toby scarce exchanged three words with the sex in as many years  no he got it madam by a blow  a blow  yes madam it was owing to a blow from a stone broke off by a ball from the parapet of a hornwork at the siege of namur which struck full upon my uncle tobys groin  which way could that effect it the story of that madam is long and interesting  but it would be running my history all upon heaps to give it you here  it is for an episode hereafter and every circumstance relating to it in its proper place shall be faithfully laid before you  till then it is not in my power to give further light into this matter or say more than what i have said already  that my uncle toby was a gentleman of unparalled modesty which happening to be somewhat subtilized and rarefied by the constant heat of a little familypride  they both so wrought together within him that he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt dinah touched upon but with the greatest emotion  the least hint of it was enough to make the blood fly into his face  but when my father enlarged upon the story in mixed companies which the illustration of his hypothesis frequently obliged him to do  the unfortunate blight of one of the fairest branches of the family would set my uncle tobys honor and modesty obleeding and he would often take my father aside in the greatest concern imaginable to expostulate and tell him he would give him any thing in the world only to let the story rest  my father i believe had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle toby that ever one brother bore toward another and would have done any thing in nature which one brother in reason could have desired of another to have made my uncle tobys heart easy in this or any other point but this lay out of his power   my father as i told you was a philosopher in grain  speculative  systematical  and my aunt dinahs affair was a matter of as much consequence to him as the retrogradation of the planets to copernicus  the backslidings of venus in her orbit fortified the copernican system called so after his name and the backslidings of my aunt dinah in her orbit did the same service in establishing my fathers system which i trust will for ever hereafter be called the shandean system after his  in any other family dishonor my father i believe had as nice a sense of shame as any man whatever  and neither he nor i dare say copernicus would have divulged the affair in either case or have taken the least notice of it to the world but for the obligations they owed as they thought to truth  amicus plato my father would say construing the words to my uncle toby as he went along amicus plato that is dinah was my aunt  sed magis amica veritas  but truth is my sister  this contrariety of humors betwixt my father and my uncle was the source of many a fraternal squabble the one could not bear to hear the tale of family disgrace recorded  and the other would scarce ever let a day pass to an end without some hint at it  for gods sake my uncle toby would cry  and for my sake and for all our sakes my dear brother shandy  do let this story of our aunts and her ashes sleep in peace  how can you  how can you have so little feeling and compassion for the character of our family  what is the character of a family to an hypothesis my father would reply  nay if you come to that  what is the life of a family  the life of a family  my uncle toby would say throwing himself back in his armchair and lifting up his hands his eyes and one leg  yes the life  my father would say maintaining his point how many thousands of em are there every year that comes cast away in all civilized countries at least  and considered as nothing but common air in competition of an hypothesis in my plain sense of things my uncle toby would answer  every such instance is downright murder let who will commit it  there lies your mistake my father would reply  for in foro scientiae there is no such thing as murder  it is only death brother  my uncle toby would never offer to answer this by any other kind of argument than that of whistling half a dozen bars of lillabullero  you must know it was the usual channel through which his passions got vent when any thing shocked or surprised him  but especially when any thing which he deemed very absurd was offered  as not one of our logical writers nor any of the commentators upon them that i remember have thought proper to give a name to this particular species of argument  i here take the liberty to do it myself for two reasons first that in order to prevent all confusion in disputes it may stand as much distinguished for ever from every other species of argument  as the argumentum ad verecundiam ex absurdo ex fortiori or any other argument whatsoever  and secondly that it may be said by my childrens children when my head is laid to rest  that their learned grandfathers head had been busied to as much purpose once as other peoples  that he had invented a name  and generously thrown it into the treasury of the ars logica for one of the most unanswerable arguments in the whole science and if the end of disputation is more to silence than convince  they may add if they please to one of the best arguments too  i do therefore by these presents strictly order and command that it be known and distinguished by the name and title of the argumentum fistulatorium and no other  and that it rank hereafter with the argumentum baculinum and the argumentum ad crumenam and for ever hereafter be treated of in the same chapter  as for the argumentum tripodium which is never used but by the woman against the man  and the argumentum ad rem which contrariwise is made use of by the man only against the woman  as these two are enough in conscience for one lecture  and moreover as the one is the best answer to the other  let them likewise be kept apart and be treated of in a place by themselves  chap xxii the learned bishop hall i mean the famous dr joseph hall who was bishop of exeter in king james the firsts reign tells us in one of his decads at the end of his divine art of meditation imprinted at london in the year    0 by john beal dwelling in aldersgate street that it is an abominable thing for a man to commend himself  and i really think it is so  and yet on the other hand when a thing is executed in a masterly kind of a fashion which thing is not likely to be found out  i think it is full as abominable that a man should lose the honor of it and go out of the world with the conceit of it rotting in his head  this is precisely my situation  for in this long digression which i was accidentally led into as in all my digressions one only excepted there is a masterstroke of digressive skill the merit of which has all along i fear been overlooked by my reader  not for want of penetration in him  but because it is an excellence seldom looked for or expected indeed in a digression  and it is this that though my digressions are all fair as you observe  and that i fly off from what i am about as far and as often too as any writer in great britain yet i constantly take care to order affairs so that my main business does not stand still in my absence  i was just going for example to have given you the great outlines of my uncle tobys most whimsical character  when my aunt dinah and the coachman came across us and led us a vagary some millions of miles into the very heart of the planetary system notwithstanding all this you perceive that the drawing of my uncle tobys character went on gently all the time  not the great contours of it  that was impossible  but some familiar strokes and faint designations of it were here and there touched in as we went along so that you are much better acquainted with my uncle toby now than you was before  by this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by itself two contrary motions are introduced into it and reconciled which were thought to be at variance with each other in a word my work is digressive and it is progressive too  and at the same time  this sir is a very different story from that of the earths moving round her axis in her diurnal rotation with her progress in her elliptick orbit which brings about the year and constitutes that variety and vicissitude of seasons we enjoy  though i own it suggested the thought  as i believe the greatest of our boasted improvements and discoveries have come from some such trifling hints  digressions incontestably are the sunshine  they are the life the soul of reading  take them out of this book for instance  you might as well take the book along with them  one cold eternal winter would reign in every page of it restore them to the writer  he steps forth like a bridegroom  bids all hail brings in variety and forbids the appetite to fail  all the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them so as to be not only for the advantage of the reader but also of the author whose distress in this matter is truly pitiable for if he begins a digression  from that moment i observe his whole work stands stockstill  and if he goes on with his main work  then there is an end of his digression   this is vile work  for which reason from the beginning of this you see i have constructed the main work and the adventitious parts of it with such intersections and have so complicated and involved the digressive and progessive movements one wheel within another that the whole machine in general has been kept agoing  and what is more it shall be kept agoing these forty years if it pleases the fountain of health to bless me so long with life and good spirits  chap xxiii i have a strong propensity in me to begin this chapter very nonsensically and i will not balk my fancy  accordingly i set off thus  if the fixure of momuss glass in the human breast according to the proposed emendation of that archcritick had taken place  first this foolish consequence would certainly have followed  that the very wisest and the very gravest of us all in one coin or other must have paid windowmoney every day of our lives  and secondly that had the said glass been there set up nothing more would have been wanting in order to have taken a mans character but to have taken a chair and gone softly as you would to a dioptrical beehive and looked in  viewed the soul stark naked  observed all her motions  her machinations  traced all her maggots from their first engendering to their crawling forth  watched her loose in her frisks her gambols her capricios and ofter some notice of her more solemn deportment consequent upon such frisks etc  then taken your pen and ink and set down nothing but what you had seen and could have sworn to  but this is an advantage not to be had by the biographer in this planet  in the planet mercury belike it may be so if not better still for him  for there the intense heat of the country which is proved by computators from its vicinity to the sun to be more than equal to that of red hot iron  must i think long ago have vitrified the bodies of the inhabitants as the efficient cause to suit them for the climate which is the final cause so that betwixt them both all the tenements of their souls from top to bottom may be nothing else for aught the soundest philosophy can show to the contrary but one fine transparent body of clear glass bating the umbilical knot  so that till the inhabitants grow old and tolerably wrinkled whereby the rays of light in passing through them become so monstrously refracted  or return reflected from their surfaces in such transverse lines to the eye that a man cannot be seen through  his soul might as well unless for more ceremony  or the trifling advantage which the umbilical point gave her  might upon all other accounts i say as well play the fool out odoors as in her own house  but this as i said above is not the case of the inhabitants of this earth  our minds shine not through the body but are wrapped up here in a dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood so that if we would come to the specific characters of them we must go some other way to work  many in good truth are the ways which human wit has been forced to take to do this thing with exactness  some for instance draw all their characters with wind instruments  virgil takes notice of that way in the affair of dido and aeneas  but it is as fallacious as the breath of fame  and moreover bespeaks a narrow genius i am not ignorant that the italians pretend to a mathematical exactness in their designations of one particular sort of character among them from the forte or piano of a certain wind instrument they use  which they say is infallible  i dare not mention the name of the instrument in this place  it is sufficient we have it amongst us  but never think of making a drawing by it  this is aenigmatical and intended to be so at least ad populum  and therefore i beg madam when you come here that you read on as fast as you can and never stop to make any inquiry about it  there are others again who will draw a mans character from no other helps in the world but merely from his evacuations  but this often gives a very incorrect outline  unless indeed you take a sketch of his repletions too and by correcting one drawing from the other compound one good figure out of them both  i should have no objection to this method but that i think it must smell too strong of the lamp  and be rendered still more operose by forcing you to have an eye to the rest of his nonnaturals  why the most natural actions of a mans life should be called his nonnaturals  is another question  there are others fourthly who disdain every one of these expedients  not from any fertility of his own but from the various ways of doing it which they have borrowed from the honorable devices which the pentagraphic brethren pentagraph an instrument to copy prints and pictures mechanichally and in any proportion of the brush have shown in taking copies  these you must know are your great historians  one of these you will see drawing a fulllength character against the light  that is illiberal  dishonest  and hard upon the character of the man who sits  others to mend the matter will make a drawing of you in the camera  that is most unfair of all  because there you are sure to be represented in some of your most ridiculous attitudes  to avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my uncle tobys character i am determined to draw it by no mechanical help whatever  nor shall my pencil be guided by any one wind instrument which ever was blown upon either on this or on the other side of the alps  nor will i consider either his repletions or his discharges  or touch upon his nonnaturals  but in a word i will draw my uncle tobys character from his hobbyhorse  chap xxiv if i was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all patience for my uncle tobys character  i would here previously have convinced him that there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with as that which i have pitched upon  a man and his hobbyhorse though i cannot say that they act and react exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each other yet doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind and my opinion rather is that there is something in it more of the manner of electrified bodies  and that by means of the heated parts of the rider which come immediately into contact with the back of the hobbyhorse  by long journies and much friction it so happens that the body of the rider is at length filled as full of hobbyhorsical matter as it can hold  so that if you are able to give but a clear description of the nature of the one you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and character of the other  now the hobbyhorse which my uncle toby always rode upon was in my opinion an hobbyhorse well worth giving a description of if it was only upon the score of his great singularity for you might have traveled from york to dover  from dover to penzance in cornwall and from penzance to york back again and not have seen such another upon the road or if you had seen such a one whatever haste you had been in you must infallibly have stopped to have taken a view of him indeed the gait and figure of him was so strange and so utterly unlike was he from his head to his tail to any one of the whole species that it was now and then made a matter of dispute  whether he was really a hobbyhorse or no but as the philosopher would use no other argument to the skeptic who disputed with him against the reality of motion save that of rising up upon his legs and walking a cross the room  so would my uncle toby use no other argument to prove his hobbyhorse was a hobbyhorse indeed but by getting upon his back and riding him about  leaving the world after that to determine the point as it thought fit  in good truth my uncle toby mounted him with so much pleasure and he carried my uncle toby so well  that he troubled his head very little with what the world either said or thought about it  it is now high time however that i give you a description of him  but to go on regularly i only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you first how my uncle toby came by him  chap xxv the wound in my uncle tobys groin which he received at the siege of namur rendering him unfit for the service it was thought expedient he should return to england in order if possible to be set to rights  he was four years totally confined  part of it to his bed and all of it to his room and in the course of his cure which was all that time in hand suffered unspeakable miseries  owing to a succession of exfoliations from the oss pubis and the outward edge of that part of the coxendix called the oss illeum  both which bones were dismally crushed as much by the irregularity of the stone which i told you was broke off the parapet  as by its size  though it was pretty large which inclined the surgeon all along to think that the great injury which it had done my uncle tobys groin was more owing to the gravity of the stone itself than to the projectile force of it  which he would often tell him was a great happiness  my father at that time was just beginning business in london and had taken a house  and as the truest friendship and cordiality subsisted between the two brothers  and that my father thought my uncle toby could no where be so well nursed and taken care of as in his own house  he assigned him the very best apartment in it  and what was a much more sincere mark of his affection still he would never suffer a friend or an acquaintance to step into the house on any occasion but he would take him by the hand and lead him up stairs to see his brother toby and chat an hour by his bed side  the history of a soldiers wound beguiles the pain of it  my uncles visiters at least thought so and in their daily calls upon him from the courtesy arising out of that belief they would frequently turn the discourse to that subject  and from that subject the discourse would generally roll on to the siege itself  these conversations were infinitely kind and my uncle toby received great relief from them and would have received much more but that they brought him into some unforeseen perplexities which for three months together retarded his cure greatly and if he had not hit upon an expedient to extricate himself out of them i verily believe they would have laid him in his grave  what these perplexities of my uncle toby were  it is impossible for you to guess  if you could  i should blush not as a relation  not as a man  nor even as a woman  but i should blush as an author inasmuch as i set no small store by myself upon this very account that my reader has never yet been able to guess at any thing and in this sir i am of so nice and singular a humor that if i thought you was able to form the least judgment or probable conjecture to yourself of what was to come in the next page  i would tear it out of my book  end of the first volume
