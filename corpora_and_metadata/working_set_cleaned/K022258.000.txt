a short tract concerning the doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi showing the particular cases to which it is applicable and that it cannot according to law be effectual for the recovery of manors lands or tenements alienated from the crown  london printed in the year mdcclxxix  extract of a letter from the author of the following tract to  dated the  th of may      which is prefixed to the ms copy of the tract in the hands of the editor  as i have lately heard that it is now disputed whether or not you ought to be excluded from the benefit of the late nullum tempus act for quieting the possessions of the subject i have taken the liberty to enclose for your  perusal a short tract on the general doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi how far the same may be applicable to the point in contest between you and the treasuryboard i cannot pretend to judge because my information concerning that affair arises merely from common report so that of course i must profess myself a stranger to the particular circumstances of the case nevertheless as i happened in the course of my reading the other day to light upon a passage in bracton which to me seemed capable of affording a clear explanation of the nullum tempus doctrine i thought it a duty incumbent on me to send you my thoughts upon it it may indeed be said that bracton is in the hands of every lawyer and that i ought to have known that the learned gentlemen of the law employed by you are already apprized of the passage to which i refer as they must certainly at some time or other have read it nevertheless there is sufficient reason for me to presume that they have entirely overlooked or forgot it in the present case and that even the whole legislature have also either forgot it or else are entirely ignorant of it because the late act of parliament which was made expressly to guard against the mistaken doctrine of nullum tempus must otherwise appear absurd and superfluous  i think it necessary to presume thus much  by way of excuse for having presumed to write to you about business which does not in the least concern me as it might otherwise be deemed impertinent in me to suppose that you have not already the most learned advice that can be procured if the little tract contains any hints that are thought capable of being enforced to your  advantage it will give me real pleasure for indeed i have no greater happiness than that of being serviceable when it lies in my power to any man whatever whether friend or stranger  signed granville sharp  preface when an author pretends to write a treatise on any particular subject he ought to have leisure sufficient to examine and thoroughly consider every thing that has an intimate connection with it but as the writer of this has no such leisure it is necessary for him to declare that he professes no other knowledge of the subject in question than what has occurred to him occasionally in consulting the law books on other points and therefore he offers this little tract to his readers not as a complete and regular system but rather as a groundwork for future enquiries upon the subject by writers who are blessed with more leisure and abilities for such researches than himself and who may perhaps be hereby induced either to build upon the same foundation or to establish a better in its room  a short tract concerning the doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi etc part i the doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi if admitted in an unlimited and general sense is capable of being wrested to the most arbitrary purposes and may seem to authorize the most dangerous and oppressive pretensions and claims on the property of the subject  as a general doctrine therefore it is unreasonable and consequently inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the common law for which reason i never could esteem the nullum tempus doctrine as a maxim of the common law and i have since found that my opinion of it was in some degree right and that the doctrine is so far from being a general maxim that it ought never to be mentioned without its peculiar exceptions lest it should do injury by being applied to improper cases and be mistaken for a maxim to the perversion of justice for the true and proper maxims of the common law demand the utmost deference when they are cited their authority being unquestionable because contra negantem principia vel maxima non est disputandum co lit     doctor and student etc c   p     this maxim may indeed seem applicable to myself for denying that the authority and weight of a maxim is due to the doctrine of nullum tempus etc but i hope to be able in the course of this work to obviate any such imputation and to prove that it really is not a general maxim in order to set this point in a clear light it will be necessary first of all to take a short view of those particular rights of the crown which in law are justly esteemed unalienable and which i apprehend to be as follows  the king is invested by his office with a kind of limited property in the persons of all his free subjects by which he is enabled and indeed bound in duty to claim and free them whenever their persons are unlawfully seized imprisoned or otherwise detained at home or abroad under pretense of right of service whereby their persons are claimed as private property acquired by purchase custom or any other mode of acquisition query how far may this hold good since the making of the habeas corpus act which supposes that a man may be transported against his will if he has signed a written contract sect    this section however gives no authority for such a forcible transportation it only informs us that the act does not extend to give benefit in such case but the common law we may presume will or ought to give benefit in this as in every other case of violence and wrong because lex semper dabit remedium and i have already shown that the right of the crown is unalienable in this kind of property for the maintenance of freedom whatsoever for no claims of this kind upon a freeman are to be favored in law or can possibly be accounted valid because the maxim assures us that liber homo is res quasi sacra which may not be sold item quasi res sacra ut liber homo qui vendi non potest cum libertas non recipiat aestimationem etc bracton lib   p    so that there can be no just claim of property in the person of a freeman except the official right and claim of property vested in the king and as this is limited by the laws for the benefit and freedom of the subject it is for that very reason unalienable from the crown  other unalienable rights of the crown are those which form the public revenue and belong to the kings exchequer all which are included by this author in the term res fiscalis et est res quasi sacra res fiscalis quae dari non potest nec vendi nec ad alium transferri a principe vel a rege regnante  and which he also esteems res quasi sacra to this rule about res fiscalis there are some necessary exceptions which will hereafter be mentioned   there are also several other rights which are inherent in the crown for the public good and cannot therefore be disposed of or alienated viz such as peace justice etc  et quae faciunt ipsam coronam et communem utilitatem recipient sicut est pax et justitia etc  to all such things we may safely apply the doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi  the same is likewise applicable to a few other things even of an inferior or second class i mean such as are nevertheless so far alienable that they may lawfully without damage to the king or his subjects be transferred for a time to other persons  sunt et aliae res quae pertinent ad coronam propter privilegium regis et ita communem non recipient utilitatem quin dari possunt et ad alium transferri quia si transferantur translatio nulli erit damnosa nec ipsi regi sive principi etc  the things ranked in this class of royal property are seawrecks treasures found great fish as whales sturgeons and other royal fish and whosoever pretends to have a right to enjoy the profits arising from these particular things must be able to produce a special warrant for that purpose because prescription even of a very long time is not sufficient to justify the pretension diuturnitas enim temporis in hoc casu injuriam non minuit sed auget nec in primo casu nec in isto currit tempus contra regem nec incumbit ei probatio quia ad ipsum pertineant cum constare debeat singulis quod hujusmodi de jure gentium pertineant ad coronam  but with respect to things of a third class as crownmanors lands tenements etc the case is widely different for the doctrine of nullum tempus etc affects them not at all and i am astonished that so many gentlemen learned in the law whose attention has lately been employed upon this point should have thought it necessary to provide by a special act of parliament against this doctrine when the common law of england that ought always to be preferred when common law and statute law concur the common law shall be preferred   co    has already sufficiently guarded us against the tyrannical construction of the phrase which like a mere bugbear is formidable only whilst misunderstood though it has raised an epidemical panic of which the late act is a proof  sunt etiam aliae res quae pertinent ad coronam quae non sunt ita sacrae quin transferri possunt sicut sunt fundi terrae et tenementa et hujusmodi per quos corona regis roboratur et in quibus currit tempus contra regem sicut contra quamlibet privatam personam  thus we are assured by the authority of an ancient and unexceptionable writer that crown lands are exactly upon the same footing as private freeholds with respect to time or prescription which is the very reverse of the nullum tempus doctrine lately adopted by the treasury  now it is a maxim in law that a quiet and uninterrupted possession for sixty years creates a proper title possessio pacifica pour anns  0 facit jus prin leg et aeq p    see also jenk cent    and therefore as we have before shown that crown manors lands and tenements are exactly upon the same footing with respect to time or prescription as private freeholds we must necessarily conclude that the king entirely loses his title to alienated lands if there are better proofs of such a peaceable possession on the one side than of a continued claim on the other in which case the lands must become wholly and entirely the property of the possessor and even when alienated crown lands are claimed within any shorter term than sixty years the king may not seize for it is a maxim that the king can disseize no man nor be disseized doctor and student item pro maximo habetur in legibus angliae quod nullus potest dominum regem disseisire nec dominus rex aliquem disseisire poterit ita quod liberum tenementum per talem disseisinam transferetur de rege ad alium nec e contra chap   and even though the king cannot be disseized yet this is not to be construed so as to annul that interest which private persons acquire by time in the possession of alienated lands for that is sufficiently established by an act of   edw iii c    which ordains with respect to lands and tenements holden of the king in chief and aliened without license  that the king shall not hold them as forfeit in such case but  there shall be a reasonable fine taken in chancery by due process here is no limited time for possession so that the act is as efficacious for those who have been in possession only   years as for those who have held  0 times   years as above see also   edw iii c      jac c      hen vi c     and    eliz c     by the two last mentioned acts a peaceable and quiet possession for   years creates a right that will justify  keeping possession with force but as the king is not expressly named i conceive that so short a time does not bar his title to any reasonable fines not prohibited by    char ii c    see sect     and   particularly the latter  provided always and be it enacted that any thing herein contained shall not take away nor be construed to take away any fines for alienation due by particular customs of particular manors and places other than fines for alienations of lands or tenements holden immediately of the king in capite because it is a maxim that the king is not bound by statute law unless expressly named  what has hitherto been advanced i hope will be thought sufficient to establish the absolute property of all persons who shall be able to prove a peaceable possession of alienated crown lands unclaimed for  0 years and also that those persons who have held alienated crown lands for more than three years unclaimed have a right to continue in possession on paying a reasonable fine and consequently that the doctrine of nullum tempus etc is by no means effectual for the recovery of manors lands or tenements alienated from the crown and i trust that my candid readers will acknowledge and hold fast this my opinion until they see more authentic vouchers produced in support of the contrary doctrine  signed granville sharp  part ii concerning some precautions and conditions necessary to be observed in the granting of crown lands tenements etc the crown is limited as well in the mode of granting as in the conditions to be granted insomuch that when any grant or lease is made contrary to the rules prescribed by law the same is thereby rendered null and void i shall not pretend to speak of all the particular precautions and conditions necessary to be observed on these occasions but only some few of the most essential which i apprehend have not been so much regarded of late as they ought  the legislature has agreed and laid it down as a rule that all the ancient and military tenures of lands and even soccage in capite of the king and the consequents upon the same have been much more burdensome grievous and prejudicial to the kingdom than they have been beneficial to the king see preamble to    cha ii cap    for this just reason founded on experience the king has ever since been restrained by the law from granting any part of his dominions upon such conditions  i have indeed heard of a foreign island being granted to a noble lord upon some such antiquated conditions whereby he is said to be established as lord paramount with a peculiar unconstitutional authority but this i am willing to presume is merely report and even if it were true the grant would be innocent enough because it is null and void in itself as the king has had no right since    cha ii to make a grant on any other tenure than that of free and common soccage sect   and be it farther enacted etc that all tenures hereafter to be created by the kings majesty his heirs or successors upon any gifts or grants of any manors lands tenements or hereditaments of any estate of inheritance at the common law shall be in free and common socage and shall be adjudged to be in free and common socage only and not by knights service or in capite and shall be discharged of all wardship etc any law statute or reservation to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding  the king is also bound to have respect to former grants because even in cases when the king has granted during pleasure a second grant not mentioning the former shall be void  hen viii c     now in order to set forth more clearly some other circumstances wherein the crown is limited in the mode of granting and in the conditions to be granted i shall beg leave to suppose a case  suppose a crafty and litigious person makes interest with the lordtreasurer or the commissioners of the treasury for a grant of alienated crown lands on condition that he shall at his own expense prove and establish the right of the crown and recover the lands from the present possessor  let us also suppose a lordtreasurer or commissioners of the treasury so regardless of the necessary and legal precautions against abuses in granting crown lands that they approve the clandestine offer and procure a grant from their royal master agreeable to the wishes of the proposer  but what will such an adventurer gain by his parchments whilst the kings courts are worthy to be esteemed courts of justice and law be pleased to observe that my suppositions are now at a stand they extend no farther than the imaginary case already laid down for i am not to suppose or conceive that any learned persons who preside in the kings courts are subject to venal timeserving or the factious spirit of party influence which is the source of the most dangerous partiality because partiality is entirely inconsistent with the high character of judges and must necessarily make shipwreck of their souls  for a partial judge cannot truly be said to have the fear of god before his eyes and as this is the first principle which the common law of england requires and deems absolutely necessary in all ranks of the community but more particularly in judges i am bound in christian charity not to suspect such a legal incapacity in any of them until i am convinced by experience to the contrary  for this reason i have not attempted by declamation and farfetched arguments to establish my opinion nor do i rely on the interest and number of my friends to make it pass current neither do i demand favor of my readers as being a friend to administration but i have founded my opinion merely on the authority of law and whilst our judges as well as juries are susceptible of that just and indispensible fear before mentioned and are in the least mindful of the solemn account which they themselves must one day give so long shall i presume that our courts are impartial and that they will carefully and conscientiously weigh and determine every case that is laid before them according to the known laws of the land and consequently that they would reject with disdain the claim of my supposed adventurer if his pretensions to the alienated lands in question had no better foundation than such a grant as i have supposed the courts would inform the litigious adventurer that his grant is of no signification and cannot convey to him the least right in the alienated lands because the crown is bound to prove and establish its own right in all manors lands etc before it can grant them to any person whatever for both the lordchancellor and the lordtreasurer and consequently the commissioners of the treasury are absolutely restrained by an act of parliament   hen vi c      hen vi c xvi to eschew the dolours grievances and disherisons which daily do happen to many of the kings liegepeople by the escheators for that they take enquests to inquire before them as well by virtue of the kings writs as of their offices favorably and not duly by people not impannelled nor returned to them by the sheriffs of the counties and more often for their private gain and for the disherison of the kings liegepeople than for the profit of the same our lord the king and also for that the lands and tenements of many of the kings liegepeople be seized into the kings hands upon such enquests or let to ferm by the chancellor or treasurer before such enquests be returned in the chancery our lord the king has ordained etc that no escheator or commissioner take in any wise any enquest to enquire but of people returned and impanelled by the sheriff in the county within which he is escheator or commissioner and if any escheator or commissioner take enquests of people which be not impanelled etc that he incur the penalty of  0 l etc and that no lands nor tenements seized into the hand of our lord the king upon such enquests taken before the escheators or commissioners be not in any wise let nor granted to ferm by the chancellor or treasurer of england or any other the kings officer until the same enquests and verdicts be fully returned in the chancery or in the exchequer but all such lands etc shall entirely and continually remain in the hands of our lord the king until the said enquests and verdicts be returned etc  see also    ed iii c    to which this act refers for the form of letting  from letting or granting the kings lands to farm until lawful enquests and verdicts that is from good towns and of good people    ed iii c    or a jury of twelve sufficient men   hen viii c   have been taken thereupon and be fully returned in the chancery or in the exchequer but all such lands and tenements shall entirely and continually remain in the hands of our lord the king until the said enquests and verdicts be returned etc  and when the persons grieved by the same enquests or putting out of their lands and tenements come into the chancery and proffer themselves to traverse the said enquests and then offer to take the same lands or tenements to ferm and if they so do that then the same lands etc be committed to them if they show good evidence etc so that there is no possibility for the crown to make a valid grant upon the conditions before described viz the establishing of the crowns right at the expense of the grantee  and another act was made in the eighteenth year of the same reign cap   expressly as a remedy to prevent such subtle and designing persons from suing to obtain such gifts and grants and ferms by the kings letters patents before any inquisition as above or title found for the king of the same pretending such gifts and grants not comprised and remedied by the said statute etc and if any letters patents be made to the contrary they shall be void and holden for none  so that our adventurers claim founded on a grant made previous to these necessary steps is absolutely null and void of itself and the very conditions of it viz that of establishing the right of the crown at the grantees own expense would afford substantial proof without any farther examination that the crown had neglected all these legal precautions which are absolutely necessary for the foundation and existence of every grant and consequently such a condition is of itself sufficient to render any grant a mere nullity  i must likewise observe that the crown or its ministers have no right to grant lands on any other terms or conditions whatsoever besides those which are prescribed by law utterly void and of none effect says the  st stat of queen anne sect   unless such grant lease etc be made for some term or estate not exceeding one and thirty years or three lives or for some term of years determinable upon one two or three lives and unless such grant etc be made to commence from the date or making thereof which is impossible in the case that i have supposed where the right is afterward to be established by a contest at law  there are also other conditions which are absolutely necessary a reservation must be made of the ancient and most usual rent or more or such rent as has been reserved yielded and paid for the greater part of twenty years before the making of the grant or a reserved rent not under the third part of the clear yearly value and whatever grant is made since the first of queen anne otherwise than according to the tenure and meaning of the said act is absolutely null and void it would be in vain for a treasuryboard to allege in such a case that they abated their legal conditions in consideration of the grantee being bound to prosecute and establish at his own expense the right of the crown an impartial court such as i have described would freely declare that the crown is not empowered to change the above prescribed conditions on any pretense whatsoever being absolutely limited and bound by this statute of  st anne which declares sect   that all gifts grants etc of manors etc or any part thereof contrary to the provisions of this act or any of them shall be null and void without any inquisition scire facias or other proceeding to determine or make void the same  but the most material thing to be considered by a lord chancellor a lord treasurer or a treasuryboard before they presume to reclaim alienated lands etc is what i first of all touched upon viz whether the present possessors of lands etc have enjoyed a quiet possession of sixty years because that creates a good title facit jus as i have already proved and such great officers ought to be aware that rescriptum principis contra jus non valet so that they would betray the honor of their royal master if they were to endeavor to procure his assent to grants of land etc which by time and possession are thus totally and irrecoverably alienated for donatio principis intelligitur sine prejudicio tertii davis     and one should be just before he is generous  the points of law and opinions which i have here laid down may perhaps be capable of perversion for indeed the plainest truths may be wrested and perverted by long sophistical and deceitful arguments  but let my opponents submit their objections to writing as i have done and collate them side by side with mine and it will be impossible for the most subtle prevarication to set aside so many plain and intelligible laws which acquire a collective force by being thus produced together and even if we could suppose an inclination or partiality in any of the kings justices to favor and confirm every act of administration whatsoever be it right or wrong and among the rest such an illegal act of the treasury lords as i have here stated in this supposed grant yet even the most partial of them would find themselves exposed to great difficulty shame and danger by attempting to define away the true meaning of so many positive laws in order to establish such an injustice for the private opinions of the kings justices ought to have no weight neither their will and inclination except when clearly supported by law because they are not allowed an arbitrary or wilful discretion also discretion as it is well described is scire per legem quid sit justum  0 co   0 but merely a legal discretion which is discernere per legem quod sit justum  for discretion is a science or understanding to discern between falsity and truth between right and wrong between shadows and substance between equity and colorable glosses and pretenses and not to do according to their wills and private affections for as one faith talis discretio discretionem confundit   co      if these salutary laws and unalterable maxims have been infringed by any great officer of the present times through misinformation or for want of duly considering the point in question let them but acknowledge their error together with a sincere intention to make what reparation may lie in their power and they will easily regain that public confidence and esteem which they have forfeited by their mistakes for sure i am with sir edw cook that no wise or truehearted englishman that has been persuaded before he was instructed will refuse to be instructed in the truth which he may see with his own eyes lest he should be dissuaded from error wherewith blindfold he has been deceived for miserable is his case and worthy of pity that has been persuaded before he was instructed and now will refuse to be instructed because he will not be persuaded but howsoever applicable the latter part of this quotation may be to any of his majestys late or present ministers yet am i thoroughly persuaded that it will never be justly said of himself  as a man he is indeed liable to be imposed on and may perhaps be persuaded to give his assent to some improper things through the insinuation of mere worldly politicians that the same are absolutely necessary and that he must submit to tread in the beaten tract of state policy howsoever corrupt to avoid the danger of greater evils the necessity of doing evil to avoid a greater evil is a doctrine too generally adopted by worldly politicians and perfectly accords with the ancient iniquitous proposition let us do evil that good may come but the unhappy state of those wretched politicians who give such pernicious counsel is immediately added  whose damnation is just romans iii     if he ever has yielded to such fallacious and dangerous doctrines for no doctrines are so productive of violence and iniquity and consequently so productive of certain ruin our iniquities like the wind have taken us away isaiah lxiv   woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees isaiah x   to states and kingdoms as those which are built on pretended necessity i am persuaded it was for want of conviction that he might safely and with propriety avoid it but the rectitude of his intentions i am convinced will never justly be called in question  that he is a good christian and sincerely wishes to promote the general good of his people i have not the least doubt and therefore if any man has been injured by such an illegal grant as i have described let him find some means of stating the merits of his case in a proper and respectful manner to our gracious sovereign and i will forfeit my life if he does not find redress  my confidence n b this tract is dated in may      is not without foundation i had the honor to stand in his royal presence when he called god and man to witness in the most solemn and affecting manner that can be described that he would rule according to the laws  from that time to this i have entertained the highest personal esteem and respect for him and have really more hopes of the reestablishment of public peace and content from the sincerity and good heart as i conceive of that one man than from the most earnest endeavors of all the other honest and loyal people of england who of themselves without their royal master at their head are by far too few and weak to resist the immense tide of venality and corruption which has almost totally overflowed this once happy island  take away the wicked from before the king and his throne shall be established in righteousness prove
