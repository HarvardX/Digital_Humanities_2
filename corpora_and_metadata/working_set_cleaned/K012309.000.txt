minds as with our bodies none in essence differ yet each knows his own marks of specific character we see that stamp on every mortal  this is he nor varies more our present outward shape this man halfangel and the next halfape than do the mental powers what odds we find between a  s and a in the course of this essay the names of many who have distinguished themselves by their ability will occur but it will not be expected that honor should be done to or mention made of all the successful candidates for celebrity in all countries and ages of the world it will be thought sufficient it is presumed for the illustration of the subject to have produced some of the most eminent and popular names especially among those of our own nation newtons mind ask you the cause first take it for a rule  whatever the man the soul is not a fool she came in due perfection from the skies and all defect in grosser body lies body and soul at best but ill agree  it is spirit wedded to infirmity a disproportioned match and hence proceeds the souls inaction from the bodys needs this truth once state every soul it is plain much on the filmy texture of the brain much on formations that escape our eyes on nice connexions and coherencies and on corporeal organs must depend for her own functions exercise and end hence then the cause of all defects is seen for one wrong movement spoils the whole machine it is hence the several passions take their rise the seeds of virtue and the roots of vice hence notes peculiar or to young or old phlegmatic sanguine amorous or cold and hence from constitution such or such wit will take modes and genius oprate much the youthful bard a gentle sighing swain like ovid warbles in a lovesick strain with weaker passions but with sense more strong the melancholy young pursues his song mixture of humors motley genius shows it is seen methinks in the author means not hereby to throw any reflection on the literary character of the late ingenious and worthy mr hervey whose meditations have done considerable service to religion and will rank him in the first class of elegant writers  proper allowances made for the enthusiasm with which they are a little tinctured and for the exuberance of a sometimes too playful imagination herveys dancing prose why wonder then to mark the sons of rhyme gay serious turgid easy or sublime the soul and body closely thus allied vile is the folly as the sin of pride and one great truth the first of men will fit  that nothing more precarious is than wit behold yon wretch that over your parish strays a babyman a drivler all his days with tongue outlolling and roundrolling eyes he grins against the sun and catches flies  but for some secret flaws we cannot read that check her motions and her flights impede his soul perchance enriched with happiest thought had spoke like tully or like virgil wrote alas all souls are subject to like fate all sympathizing with the bodys state let the fierce fever burn through every vein and drive the madding fury to the brain naught can the fervor of his frenzy cool but aristotles selfs a parish fool nay in proportion lighter ails control the mental virtue and infect the soul ease is best convoy in our voyge to truth  what man ever reasoned with a raging tooth a poet with a genius and without are the same creatures in the pangs of gout hence then we guess nor vain is our surmise why some are fools and none are always wise why genius differs in lifes every stage runs wild with youth and creeps with hobbling age the soul uncumberd with the mortal clay knows no increase of strength nor fears decay a little art this secret may unfold  that what can never die is never old by present powers perfection cease to scan for we may daily mourn the fall of man ah how bright wit possessed of every gift dwindled to folly and went mad in swift the mighty marlbro whose great soul was proved upon the plains of blenheim where unmoved amidst confusion horror and despair he viewed around the dreadful scenes of war in peaceful thought the field of death surveyed to fainting squadrons sent the timely aid inspired repulsed battalions to engage and taught the doubtful battle where to rage even he the springs of nature in decay and all his vital functions worn away unable now to conquer realms or buy with idiot gesture and unmeaning eye sits a spectator in the foremost row and gapes at heroes in a puppetshew eschew presumption every halflearnd elf the noblest writer does not know himself turn mighty miltons sacred volume over it is strength it is majesty or something more his numbers like the almightys thunders roll and strike an aweful pleasure to the soul we joy in ruin and are almost pained to see the latelost paradise regained this work see fentons life of milton prefixed to his edition of paradise lost  the learned dr newton tells us in his life of milton that all that we can assert upon good authority is that he could not endure to hear the paradise regained cried down so much as it was in comparison with the other poem but i believe my reader will agree with me that such a partiality as this will sufficiently warrant what is said in the essay probably i may have more to say upon this subject in another place   himself judged best  tell me who read was not the mighty milton blind indeed genius again by infrence apt we see the same in species differs in degree propensities are strong and few men yet but have a relish for some kind of wit homer is monarch of the epic choir yet virgil snatched a brand of homers fire the daring homers allimpetuous strain like a hot courser bore him over the plain the muse of virgil that affected state speeds not so swiftly but she keeps her rate heats often intense in lucans patriot page and statius muse turns fury in her rage each writer is distinguished in his way grand sophocles or playful seneca bold aeschylus a stately buskin wore and shook the athenian stage with tragic

laughing plautus ran and terence words it like a gentleman all to their favorite art will lay pretense  it is inclination or it is excellence midst clouds of dullness gleams of wit have shone like the faint burstings of an april sun some partly fail as partly they excel  thus rchrdsn we know drew nature well yet should a genius toy as he has done and spin morality like grandison grant you what is past and it will less perplex to ask why woman is the weaker sex or why the extremes of female wits are such they mostly say too little or too much beautys soft frame for other ends designed faints under toil of body or of mind shall dimpled girls the states whole thunder wield and spinsters shake the senate or the field shall tender matrons with mans follies vexed with highstraind treble drive

sway a thousand ways is shown and beauty has an empire of its own kind heaven that gave them beauty all things gave  the soundest scholar is a womans slave yet have we known superior nymphs that can

flying in the face of god the force of reason is of finite length  this giant that attempts beyond his strength our boasted light of nature feeble spark guides for a while but leaves us in the dark as

lewdness riots on the modern stage o shame to arts our poets may defy the bards of old with rome and athens vie may boast invention penetration wit all qualities for either drama fit may touch the passions with enchanting art and take minutest copies of the heart yet of past dramatists be this the praise  they rarely stained with ribaldry their bays genius depends then on the bodys frame  tell me will genius never be the same or will the difference we today espy subsist in souls to all eternity such question put if reason may be bold in humblewise conjecture to unfold she seems to dictate and she fears not blame that things once differing never are the same here or hereafter in what light you will a man you know is soul and body still and still corporeal organs and their use must correspondent faculties produce but body in that happier state refined shall leave its old infirmities behind and every soul be perfect in her kind consult material objects and we see gods power displayed in sweet variety the different seasons different beauties bring it is not one color paints the jolly spring the sun highflaming travels in his might the moon with placid orb adorns the night each insect that eludes the nicest eye one of the myriads floating in the sky his makers praise proclaim as loudly can as oceans tyrant king the great leviathan look through all nature the vast tracts of space each being has it is proper power and place the angelic hosts that round the godhead wait and issue forth his ministers of fate have their respective provinces and know what part to act above and what below messiahs sword to michaels might is given and gabriel is ambassador of heaven hence then from infrence fairly drawn we find that souls will differ and excel in kind but when admitted to the realms of joy what certain office what precise employ shall exercise the several powers of each present conception not presumes to reach enough from general principles to show that one great point of bliss will be  to know to touch perfection in a favorite art and grieve no longer but to know in part to mark where truth in her recesses lies pursue her without toil and grasp her as she flies the

this frail earth in ruin shall be hurled may count the lamps that light a nobler world and subtle gometry shall lend her line and take dimensions of the plan divine what sounds shall flow from

idiots by natural organs ill supplied untutored louts whose parts were never tried hereafter hidden excellence may show and rank with souls that scorned them here below but for the sot that sees yet slights his rule the wilful novice and industrious fool that lulls with sloth or steeps in vice his sense the slave of pleasure or of indolence how wretched is his fate fears he not pain the gnawing viper and the galling chain still wretched is this blockheads fate  for why eternal ignorance is misery the author apprehends this sentiment to be justified by reasonable presumptions and the sense which the following passage of s s will at least admit  he that is unjust let him be unjust still etc rev chapter xx ver     who goodly talents have should talents use with care assiduous but with virtuous views for application sometimes less pretense to merit has than barren indolence nothing fatigues our soul or tires our brain like lust of empire or the thirst of gain and these oerruling in

and was more than king ambition take the scepter and the robe spread thy huge greatness over half the globe lo the world bursts it is natures dying day the sun is dark the planets melt away  now boast thy genius exercise thy parts recount thy feats and recognize thy arts alas thou cursest thy too pregnant brain and knowledge is acute to quicken pain the nature the importance and the end of genius such be wise then and attend how we may best our natural powers improve and qualify the soul for bliss above genius lies hid like metal in the mine till searching education bids it shine it is but a glorious few of deathless name have found without a guide their road to fame nor slight their province if we justly rate who till the mind and genius cultivate much penetration and no little toil must try the strength and temper of the soil some minds richnaturd like a generous field to little culture ample harvests yield others incessant labor must secure they owe their goodly produce to manure our judgment too should mark where talent lies and soon as seen indulge propensities for different objects different fancies strike genius we said before is not alike popes forward muse procured him early fame he lispd in numbers for the numbers came anothers unharmonious tuste is such sooner than poetry he would learn high dutch yet he peculiar talents may display and prove a very wonder in his way why must all mortals seek the selfsame praise is there no garland but a wreath of bays to steep parnassus summit most sublime it is not a shortbreathed pegasus can climb some seem to think that genius may be sold but wit is not like honor bought with gold to foreign regions wealthy thicksculs roam though fools of all men sure should stay at home anothers heir through wickhams school must pass he goes a blockhead and comes home an ass from form to form these dull indocile things proceed in course as tumblers shoot through rings yet these though destitute of hopeful wit twere rashness to pronounce at once unfit for lifes first stations often amongst these we find an able body and an active mind a keen discernment prudence caution care a hand to execute a soul to dare no useful talent then should dormant lie  it is service to the common enemy  and these noscholars may or swell the sail of commerce and attend the shifting gale or deck with great exploits a georgias reign and humble gallic crests and crush the pride of spain others of lively parts but wretched fate want nothing but a fortune to be great sometimes among the vulgar herd we find strong marks and features of a heavenly mind the village swains a wit he knows not how and i have seen philosophy at plough how are our hopes by present chances crossed what oafs make prsns and what wits are lost when now your genius near to ripeness grown begins to glow with raptures all its own ply it with chosen books of various kinds for reading is the food of hungry minds moderate and wholesome will suffice your need it is not how much but how and what you read to rise with appetite is always best gluttons devour much more than they digest it is vain for ever over books to pore reading does much but observation more mere slavish plodding never yet prevailed see yon lank student to his folio nailed he reads at home abroad at meals in bed and has five thousand volumes in his head yet little to perfection has he brought for he has read so much  he never thought the youth more sprightly and the glowing bard that had as lieve go dig as study hard applies by fits and at his fancys call little he reads but has that little all he sees and he enjoys his authors worth gathers his flowers and culls his beauties forth he dwells with transport on a favorite part and clasps each striking passage to his heart your models choose from authors of first rate he cannot write who dares not emulate to father homers sovring poetry rome owes her virgil and our milton we the towering muse of pindar reached the sky and flaccus followed with an eager eye for present times to emulate is all  it is scarce in wit to be original leave books and go to company and then leave company and go to books again the studious mind it is useful to unbend in pleasing converse with a social friend for cordial juices of the purple vine refresh the weary and the dull refine over flowing bowls rebounds the sparkling wit and sure no poet was a milksop yet intemprate revelling alone consumes the mental powers and clouds the brain in fumes horace best handler of the roman lyre in rich falernum quaffd poetic fire a jovial bard how pleasant are his strains how much good humor in his writings reigns he laughs though angry and will still delight his verse is satire but it is not spite how does his muse with free politeness rail while juvenals is threshing with a flail scholars should know all fire in motion lies  whet then your parts with manly exercise dullness sits slumbering in an elbowchair but the gay muses love to take the air   the shades of night are fled before the morn the mountains echo to the cheerful horn men dogs and horses neighings shouts and cries shake with tumultuous jollity the skies the chase grows hot they pant in every vein now climb the steep hills brow now scour along the plain such sports as these enliven they impart warmth to the brain and gladness to the heart yet cautious still indulge the vigorous joy  it should be relaxation not employ but if due aid to genius may be lent sometimes it suffers by impediment unhappy is the bard that deals in rhyme when wit is obsolete and sense a crime when the weak muse in a degenerate age crawls from the press or lamely treads the stage no longer dares to noble heights advance but chimes in song or trifles in romance how shall the genuine bard escape from fools that judge by narrow or by partial rules a thousand witlings maul his mangled name and yelping critics hunt him out of fame how strange a fate in writing few succeed but every mans a critic that can read chance sometimes seems to govern all we see merit in vain prefer a righteous plea false taste caprice and circumstance of times untowardly conspire to damn our rhymes and censure so perversely plays her tricks that she will measure wit by politics to our eternal shame this truth be said  that for whole years even in fact as fair a chance for renown as literary worth will be acknowledged to have in the main it cannot be denied that authors before now have been less indebted to the intrinsic merit of their productions for their reputation than to a powerful patronage or a favorable crisis the world is not invariably just in its decisions i will only detain the reader with one notorious instance mr addisons comedy of the drummer was hardly able to wriggle itself into the world at all while the tragedy of cato by virtue principally of the popular word liberty recommended itself to uncommon applause and was long time the favorite entertainment of the nation for this performance notwithstanding the random panegyric bestowed on it by a few see guardian vol i no    etc gentlemen connected with its author by principle or attached to him by friendship is in point merely of dramatic merit most unquestionably far inferior to the comedy abovementioned in short the fate of writers is too often determined by many supposable contingencies and circumstances and literary reputation is sometimes temporary sometimes posthumous and always in some measure precarious milton was unread if these are plagues still more remain behind wits tell you fortune frowns upon their kind alas what sources of obstruction lie in the great common woe of poverty whose case is hardest it is not quickly said or theirs that work or theirs that write for bread the starveling curate the fat dean supplies one makes divinity and the other buys  who but must wail the state of liberal arts when scholars pawn their coats or fell their parts bards of first note are hirelings every day and the chaste nine turn prostitutes for pay sure of all writers poets should not lack twill spoil your pegasus to make him hack the muse expands her wings before you ask  she loves employment but she hates a task to dryden the proud manager could say  on pain of thirst and hunger bring your play  the play appears in breach of many a rule and want makes dryden sometimes half a fool such from without the causes that we find obstruct the operations of the mind within too genius has its enemies and in ourselves too often our hindrance lies our passions vices follies talents hide intemprance anger hastiness and pride we said debauches will oblivion bring and mix dull lethe with the muses spring the mind is then most vigorous when serene and crude the sentiment that flows from spleen  what then inspires the sharp satyric page often fixed ill nature seldom sudden rage some giddy fancies every object hit alike  you may be prodigal of wit the verse is shortlived that is premature the muse though never slow should still be sure these are thy honors blackmore this thy gain that nonsense came in vollies from thy brain conceit with vapors puffs an empty mind and makes a writer to his errors blind it is the first praise to make the next to mend go court the censure of an able friend procure the sanction of a learned few who knows what mortals may your works review in the former edition the word  review  was printed in italics  of which the author confesses the impropriety  but whether the general question be pertinent or otherwise he leaves to the determination of every candid and impartial reader  true modesty for wit may sometimes pass but every coxcomb is as such an ass the best productions some defects will stain and he affronts mankind who dares be vain o that my strains assistance could impart as far as nature may be helped by art nature to mend all efforts it behooves and what god made it is art alone improves give me this fame kind heaven and though my song ranks me the meanest of the raptured throng i reap fair fruits and gain an honest end not musebefriended but the muses friend the reader will find in the first edition of this poem a few lines of complimental address to the university of oxford a place ever to be mentioned by the author with the utmost gratitude and respect and a few more relative to his own political principles which are all here omitted as totally extraneous to his subject but because the omission of the latter may be liable to misconstruction or lay him open to a charge of tergiversation and desertion of sentiment from more quarters than one it is thought proper to produce the passage in this place with as much of comment on it as will it is hoped be sufficient for his vindication and the satisfaction of the reader  the lines are as follows for me however i covet lasting fame and pant with longings for a poets name yet let my soul confess a nobler aim give me kind heaven still higher points to reach give me to practice what i strive to teach my standing rules of daily conduct be faith honor justice candor charity careless of false reproach or vain applause be worth my eulogy and truth my cause o may i wield an independent pen a friend to virtue not a tool to men in perseverance placing all my glory while tories whigs and all men call me tory warm in my breast may patriot passion glow righteous resentment of my countrys woe with voice and heart for ever may i stand against vermin that devour my native land and in one wish my wishes centered be  that i may live to hail my country free   two of these verses are a parody on a wellknown passage in mr pope and reprobate that gentlemans thereavowed mediocrity of principle  however let stress be laid not on names but things ideas are often affixed to terms with which they are not necessarily connected either by the indiscretion or the violence or the artifice of party men may load the word tory with what imputations they please  but to be as explicit as the occasion seems to require if to profess himself a friend to the constitution in church and state a foe alike to mass and meeting as far as candor will warrant and charity admit if to avow himself zealous equally for the prerogative of the crown the freedom and independence of parliament and the privileges and liberties of the people if to hold the rights of conscience sacred and inviolable and to desire to see every peaceable subject in full possession of his religious sentiments but at the same time to detest those latitudinarian principles publicly maintained and insolently disseminated which manifestly tend to undermine the foundations of all order and ccclesiastical establishment whatsoever if to reverence at all times a constitutional opposition to ministry but to abhor a factious one if to wish to find the love of our country the universal passion and the public good the grand aim and object of all orders and degrees of men among us  if to do and to desire all this and all that this implies constitutes toryism in the whole or in part a tory the author has been from his youth upon the fullest conviction and a tory he hopes to be to the last moment of his existence    the song of deborah an ode judges chap v begin the gladsome shout the loud acclaim begin the universal choir temper in

eternal spring breathed fragrance round their walks and nature smiled as hand in hand they took their unfrequented way grateful they poured their hearts in rapture  grateful praise was then religions better half faith was unborn  twas rich beatitude of sight when god descending from his throne supernal gave illustrious exhibition of himself exchanging conference benign with man  his sovereign and his friend or where was hope when life was bliss and full possession crowned all appetite with joy where charity ere discord had a being when one pair composed society blessed pair conjoined in silken bands of union woven by affection pure and first connubial love but lust of science hellinspird unhinged this fabric of felicity  behold eden is wilderness and man  a worm see this immortal grovels in the dust  and that devotion which was once the vow of cheerful worship or the sacrifice of placid reverence and filial love is now the feeble effort of despair  the plaintive moan of guiltiness abashed  the tear of anguish and the sigh of woe look thou afflicted up  it is thy god unclothed with terrors mark he utters bland redemptions word with pious eagerness devour those healing sounds and catch o catch the balmy dew of grace upon thy soul now faith unfurls her banner at her side hope meekly smiling stands while righteous souls burn with impatience to regain the bliss by human folly forfeited and pant like exiles longing for their native clime but reason was mans law and on the truths traditions handed down from age to age devotion formed her plan  as some large stream that issues limpid from his parent spring rolls headlong on and in his billwy sweep contracts foul tinctures from the lands he laves in his widewinding course tradition thus pure from it is fount deriving

truth shoots his luxuriant branch  religion shows like some delightful but unculturd spot when desolation lays his wasteful hand upon its vernal beauties noisome weeds and brambly trash usurp the goodly soil where flora gayly reigned  now kingly pride and vulgar superstition stored the world with spurious deities while man transferred to creatures vile the prostrate homage due to the supreme creator he to assert his violated honor and maintain an unadulterate faith in early days vouchsafed to terahs offspring to impart his name his will his promise  aftertimes beheld descending deity in clouds of wavy smoke and spiryspreading flame when on mount sinais consecrated brow the almighty monarch special presence gave to israels trembling sons ten thousand saints his high retinue clapped their golden wings and thunders roared and nimble lightnings streaked the gloomy cloud while the big trumpets voice proclaimed his fiery law happily that trump whose louder blast shall from earths clayey womb summon all mortals in the flaming day of general consummation  what should shake devotions basis now  even he the archfiend that subtle tainted pure traditions stream and alienated first mans wavering mind from god to idols  in a world corrupt israel by bent of nature ever prone to novelty and smooth seductions caught the spirital contagion while a few still eminently singular to heaven with pureness of affection unestrangd paid adorations meet illustrious names recorded in the sacred page of truth but better times succeeded hark methinks celestial music charms my ravished ear israls sweet singer wakes his tuneful lyre to sounds harmonious in exalted hymns he celebrates omnipotence he pours terror of pious praise the angelic hosts hear with delight and to gods cloudwrapt throne waft the melodious sacrifice  but see ah see he drops his harp he sweeps no more the vocal sprightly strings he mourns he droops he languishes in heaviness of soul  yet movingly he breathes his humblest strains of penitential sorrow offering now contritions victim in a bleeding heart blessed minstrel whose sweet notes shall one day join in unison with heavens eternal choir accept this

and in dan all israel pay devoir to these fictitious deities  revolters from their king and from their god and now religion through a length of times adultrate and deform for what availed the zeal the pious fervor of a few called down the vengeance of the almightys arm in visitation various till at length the desolating hand of mercless war swept israel off and to a foreign power captived his recreant tribes the hosts of god pine in chaldea  yet he left not there omnipotence unwitnessd o behold the intrepid three who brave defiance hurled in the fierce tyrants teeth serene they walk

insatiate maw of hungry death rescues her genuine sons  now see again the tribes in peace restored judea smiles beneath the hand of culture to the view a second temple rises in its pride and blazing altars to the eternal throne send clouds of fragrancy  jehovah reigns unrivaled by tartarean deities singly confessed supreme  but taintless faith secures not pure devotion  numerous sects divide old

lifeless offerings of a carnal heart or periodic public abstinence atone for stolen luxury  nor more of reason or devotion has the pride of zealots that in mad fanatic rage disclaim all government

blessed as i  strephon ah thyrsis thou art happy far above the neighboring shepherds all in chloes love but phyllida is cold to all i say cold as a blast that nips the buds in may  thyrsis how many a

allpowerful shrine that know what it is to endure but know not what it is to complain nor wish for your anguish a cure and cherish the strongthrobbing pain ii ye nymphs who disclaim prudish arts whose bosoms can hold a warm sigh who kindly discover your hearts by softness that melts in your eye that brighten with smiles your fair brows when gracefully pressed by some youth whose countenance warrants his vows poured all from a fountain of truth iii all lovers attend to my verse for lovers my verse will approve and smile on the lays that rehearse the delicate progress of love but hence ye unfeeling begone still bent private ends to pursue ye wordlings will frown on my song the subjects too tender for you iv the zephyrs gan softly to blow the woods feathered warblers to sing the meads made a beautiful show and gay were the daughters of spring when lone through the thickdaified vale with freedom of fancy i strayed and there muse record the fond tale there first i beheld the dear maid v a bevy of damsels so neat hard by me came tripping to fair  you would have thought they had wings on their feet  but o what a damsel was there they tell us of graces of yore and they talk of a paphian queen but never believe me before so peerless a beauty was seen vi no painter with pencil could trace though dipped in the richest of dies the sweetness that dwelt in that face the brightness that beamed from those eyes no poet though poets they say of all your fine writers are best could tell my hearts feeling that day unless he could read in my breast vii i shall not attempt to recite the raptures that glowed in my mind  she flew like a bird out of sight but left her fair image behind my thought was employed all the day those charms the delectable theme and when on my pillow i lay they pleasingly furnished my dream viii i rose with the larks of the dale indulging my softgrowing care i meant not to go to the vale  but wandered  and found myself there i traversed the lawn to and fro i loaded the welkin with sighs and this you will call folly  but know i wish not again to be wise ix my love had bewildered me quite  i met an acquaintance of mine  he asked me the time of the night  i told him  the nymph was divine engagements i made without end and broke em though ever so new for he may be false to his friend who most to his passion is true x at length to myself thus i said  as pensive i rambled one morn oh could i address the dear maid an angels a stranger to scorn my secret i burn to reveal in language untutored by art  she will pity at least what i feel i long to unburthen my heart love discovered part ii one eve of the sweetbreathing may i first became known to my dear  ye muses remember the day and name it the prime of the year the moments were socially spent the time with discourse was beguiled she looked with a look of content and o how she looked when she smiled ii she marked my respectful distress she construed my halfsmotherd sighs  the beloved have a wonderful guess and lovers can speak with their eyes methought too she joyd that sweet night  that thought gave anxiety ease twas transport to yield her delight an exquisite pleasure to please iii acquaintance augmented the fire that strong in my bosom was blown and soon to my eager desire i met my fair maiden alone the birds cheered the woodlands with song the lilies enameled the grove the brook softly murmured along and sure twas a season for love iv this this was the muchsighd for hour my passion at large to display yet now it was full in my power in vain i strove something to say of matters insipid i talked as though wed no business together and thrice i observed as we walked  indeed it is most excellent weather v doubts fears and an awkward restraint which best our sincerity prove prevented my tender complaint  there is not such a coward as love complacent she seemed all this while myself seemed like one that was chid as though there were pride in a smile or sweetness itself could forbid vi i thought i would take courage next day  i met her again in the grove but strephon was now in the way  a witness is hateful to love he was dressed in his holiday clothes tricked out like a finical ass  i never could bear your trim beaus that make themselves fine in a glass vii he gave himself many an air as great as a lord of the land could prattle and ogle and swear  and once he kissed phyllidas hand  i saw saucy hope in his eye i saw no disdain in her look  if phyllida had not been by i would plunged his curled locks in the brook viii the day i began with delight i closed with a sorrowful breast i wished from my soul for the night  though night could afford me no rest ye mock at such sighs and such groans who never felt jealousys smart there is not a true lover but owns no place is so sore as the heart ix all night i lay tossing perplexed with cares which uncertainties bring now hopeless now mad to be vexed by such a light fluttering thing but reason in vain lends her aid such feelings as these to remove fond lovers are always afraid and trifles are torments in love love declared part iii the morn spread her blush over the plain serene was the region above i willly nourished my pain i sighed and i strayed to the grove but never let lovers despair cause sometimes things happen amiss  for whom should i meet but my fair  and o what a meeting was this ii her eye such a softness possessed her air was so placidly gay it scattered the cloud from my breast as sunshine enlivens the day revived i determined at last to act if i could like a man  my bosom i felt beating fast  i faulterd  but thus i began iii dear phyllida list to the strain humility pours in your ear  ah do not despise a poor swain who shows you his faith in his fear can we hide if we would from the fair the conquests they make with their eyes  then let me my passion declare who cannot my passion disguise iv it is bold an attempting to move a damsel so matchless as you  it may be a folly to love it is not a crime to be true what though with the sprucepowderd cit your corydon pass for a clown  there is much of assurance and wit but little of truth in the town v my cattles a plentiful stock my barns are well loaded with grain and healthy my numerous flock that white with their fleeces the plain but hope i to win thee with these or goods of much value beside ah no  i have ambition to please and only my love is my pride vi i could live with content in a cot with phyllida eased of all care and bless the contemptible lot that happily settled us there soft lodged in my phyllidas arms my bliss would admit no increase parade for the wise has no charms and plenty is nothing to peace vii in phyllidas hand is my fate in phyllidas smile is my joy o do not destroy me with hate  such sweetness can never destroy forgive if you cannot be kind and constant for ever i will be if i am not the man to your mind the world has no woman for me viii i paused and i bowed most profound  her soft hand i tremblingly pressed  she cast her fair eyes on the ground a sigh seemed to scape from her breast then blushing she midly replied here corydon cease the fond strain by strephon thy truth i have tried  tomorrow i will meet you again love rewarded part iv what tongue can the pleasure express the transport expanding the mind when lovers foresee their success and nymphs grow insensibly kind emboldened my joys to pursue my courtship i daily renewed and oh how delightsom to woo when phyllida wished to be wooed ii come  say can you faithfully count the waves that incessantly roar or tell me precise the amount of pebbles that garnish the shore o then you will exactly recite the raptures fond gratitude shows when blessed in his mistresss sight the heart of a swain overflows iii the linnets have tunable throats and larks that soar over the hill and sweetly the nightingales notes the meadows with melody fill but vain are these voices to cheer and powrless that music to move to the sound that enchanted my ear  when phyllida whispered  i love iv one favor i yet had to seek and that was to make her my brides  i asked  and the blush in her cheek with softness bewitching complied my heart had no more to pursue loves task became innocent play and corydon naught had to do but wish a long fortnight away v at length came the morning so bright sure
