and reall profit is reaped from wealth imaginary i have cited only passages exhibiting some kinship in expression to mandevilles epigram the general idea however of the possible usefulness of vice was frequently anticipated in the numerous seventeenthcentury discourses on the passions in these treatises it was shown how the passions although vicious in themselves could none the less be converted into virtues some of these works—pierre nicoles de la charité  de lamour propre essais de morale vol   is an example—continued to term the passions vicious despite their practical utility lay works also preached this moral thus fontenelle wrote avezvous de la peine à concevoir que les bonnes qualités dun homme tiennent à dautres qui sont mauvaises et quil seroit dangereux de le guérir de ses

the psychologizing of virtue into vice cf above i xlvii–xlix lxxxvii–xciii and below ii  0  n   these anticipations however unlike mandeville usually put little stress on the social implications of the value of vice being content to show how the individual could transmute the evil passions of his nature into personal virtue as part of the background for mandevilles phrase there should be considered also the common optimistic belief that somehow good springs from evil see below i    n   for mandevilles own explanation of his phrase see below i     n     the preface the preface the prefaceiii laws and government are to the political bodies of civil societies what the vital spirits and life it self are to the natural bodies of animated creatures and as those that study the anatomy of dead carcases may see that the chief organs and nicest springs more immediately required to continue the motion of our machine are not hard bones strong muscles and nerves nor the smooth white skin that so beautifully ivcovers them but small trifling films and little pipes that are either overlookd or else seem inconsiderable to vulgar eyes so they that   examine into the nature of man abstract from art and education may observe that what renders him a sociable animal consists not in his desire of company goodnature pity affability and other graces of a fair outside but that his vilest and most hateful qualities are the most necessary accomplishments to fit him for the largest and according to the world the happiest and most flourishing societies the following fable in which what i have said is set forth at large was printed above eighta years ago in a six penny pamphlet calld the grumbling hive or knaves turnd honest and being soon after pirated cryd about the streets in a halfpenny sheet  since the first publishing of it i have met with several that either wilfully or ignorantly mistaking the v design would have it that the scope of it was a satyr upon virtue and morality and the whole wrote for the encouragementc of vice this made me resolve whenever it should be reprinted some way or other to inform the reader of the real intent   this little poem was wrote with i do not dignify these few loose lines with the name of poem that i would have the reader expect any poetry in them but barely because they are rhime and i am in reality puzzled what name to give them for they are neither heroick nor pastoral satyr burlesque nor heroicomick to be a tale they want probability and the whole is rather too long for a fable all i can say of them is that they are a story told in dogrel which without the least design of being witty i have endeavourd to do in as easy and familiar a manner as i was able the reader shall be welcome to call them what he pleases twas said of montagne that he was pretty well versd in the defects of manvikind but unacquainted with the excellencies of human nature  if i fare no worse i shall think my self well used   what country soever in the universe is to be understood by the beehive represented here it is evident from what is said of the laws and constitution of it the glory wealth power and industry of its inhabitants that it must be a large rich and warlike nation that is happily governd by a limited monarchy the satyr therefore to be met with in the following lines upon the several professions and callings and almost every degree and station of people was not made to injure and point to a particular persons but only to shew the vileness of the ingredients that all togetherb compose the wholesome mixture of a wellorderd society in order to extol the wonderful power of political wisdom by the help of which so beautiful a machine is raisd from the most contemptible branches viifor the main design of the fable as it is briefly explaind in the moral is to shew the impossibility of enjoying all the most elegant comforts of life that are to be met with in an industrious wealthy and powerful nation and at the same time be blessd with all the virtue and innocence that can be wishd for in a golden   age from thence to expose the unreasonableness and folly of those that desirous of being an opulent and flourishing people and wonderfully greedy after all the benefits they can receive as such are yet always murmuring at and exclaiming against those vices and inconveniences that from the beginning of the world to this present day have been inseparable from all kingdoms and states that ever were famd for strength riches and politeness at the same time to do this i first slightly touch upon some of the faults and corruptions the several professions and callings are generally charged with after that i shew that those very vices of every particular person by skilful management were made subservient to the grandeur and worldly happiness of the whole lastly by setting forth what of necessity must be the consequence of general honesty and virtue and national temperance innocence and content i demonstrate that if mankind could be cured of the failings they are naturally guilty of they would cease to be capable of being raisd into such vast potent and polite societies as they have   been under the several great commonwealths and monarchies that have flourishd since the creation if you ask me why i have done all this cui bono and what good these notions will produce truly besides the readers diversion i believe none at all but if ia was askd what naturally ought to be expected from em i woud answer that in the first place the people who continually find fault with others by reading them would beix taught to look at home and examining their own consciences be made ashamd of always railing at what they are more or less guilty of themselves and that in the next those who are so fond of the ease and comforts and reap all the benefits that are the consequence of a great and flourishing nation would learn more patiently to submit to those inconveniences which no government upon earth can remedy when they should see the impossibility of enjoying any great share of the first without partaking likewise of the latter this i say ought naturally to be expected from the publishing of these notions if   people were to be made better by any thing that could be said to them but mankind having for so many ages remaind still the same notwithstanding the many instructive and elaborate writings by which their amendment has been endeavourd i am not so vain as to hope for betxter success from so inconsiderable a trifle  having allowd the small advantage this little whim is likely to produce i think my self obligd to shew that it cannot be prejudicial to any for what is published if it does no good ought at least to do no harm in order to this i have made some explanatory notes to which the reader will find himself referrd in those passages that seem to be most liable to exceptions the censorious that never saw the grumbling hive will tell me that whatever i may talk of the fable it not taking up a tenth part of the book was only contrivd to introduce the remarks that instead of clearing up the doubtful or  0 obscure places i have only pitchd upon such as i had a mind to expatiate upon and that far from striving to extenuate the errors committed before i have made bad worse and shewn my self a more barefaced champion for vice in the ramxibling digressions than i had done in the fable it self i shall spend no time in answering these accusations where men are prejudiced the best apologies are lost and i know that those who think it criminal to suppose a necessity of vice in any case whatever will never be reconcild to any part of the performance but if this be thoroughly examind all the offence it can give must result from the wrong inferences that may perhaps be drawn from it and which i desire no body to make when i assert that vices are inseparable from great and potent societies and that it is impossible their wealth and grandeur should subsist without i do not say that the particular members of them who are guilty of any should not be continually reprovd or not be punishd for them when they grow into crimes there are i believe few people in    london of those that are at any time a forcd to go afoot but what could wish the xiistreets of it much cleaner than generally they are while they regard nothing but their own clothes and private conveniency but when once they come to consider that what offends them is the result of the plenty great traffick and opulency of that mighty city if they have any concern in its welfare they will hardly ever wish to see the streets of it less dirty for if we mind the materials of all sorts that must supply such an infinite number of trades and handicrafts as are always going forward the vast quantity of victuals drink and fewel that are daily consumd in it theb waste and superfluities that must be produced from them the multitudes of horses and other cattle that are always dawbing the streets the carts coaches and more heavy carriages that are perpetually wearing and breaking the pavement of them and above all the numberless swarmsc of people that are continually harassing and trampling through every part xiiiof them if i say we mind all these we shall find that every    moment must produce new filth and considering how far distant the great streets are from the river side what cost and care soever be bestowd to remove the nastiness almost as fast as tisa made it is impossible london should be more cleanly before it is less flourishing now would i ask if a good citizen in consideration of what has been said might not assert that dirty streets are a necessary evil inseparable from the felicity of london without being the least hindrance to the cleaning of shoes or sweeping of streets and consequently without any prejudice either to the blackguard  or the scavingers but if without any regard to the interest or happiness of the city the question was put what place i thought most pleasant to walk in no body can doubt but before the stinking streets of london i would esteem a fragrant garden or a shady grove in the country xivin the same manner if laying aside all worldly greatness and vainglory i should be askd where i thought it was most probable that    men might enjoy true happiness i would prefer a small peaceable society in which men neither envyd nor esteemd by neighbours should be contented to live upon the natural product of the spot they inhabit to a vast multitude abounding in wealth and power that should always be conquering others by their arms abroad and debauching themselves by foreign luxury at homea thus much i hadb said to the reader in the first editionc and have added nothing by way of preface in the second but since that a violent outcry has been made against the book exactly answering the expectation i always had of the justice the wisdom the charity and fairdealing of those whose goodwill i despaird of it has been presented by the grandjury  and condemnd xvby thousands who never    saw a word of it it has been preachd against before my lord mayor and an utter refutation of it is daily expected from a reverend divine who has calld me names in the advertisements and threatned to answer me in two months time for above five months together  what i have to say for my self the reader will see in my vindication  at the end of the book where he will likewise find the    grandjurys presentment and a letter to the right honourable lord c  which is very rhetorical beyond argument or connexion the author shews a fine talent for invectives and great sagacity in discovering atheism where others can find none he is zealous against wicked books points at the fable of the bees and is very angry with the author he bestows four strong epithets on the enormity of his guilt and by several elegant innuendos to the multitude as the danger there is in suffering such authors to live and the vengeancexvi of heaven upon a whole nation very charitably recommends him to their care considering the length of this epistle    and that it is not wholly levelld at me only i thought at first to have made some extracts from it of what related to my self but finding on a nearer enquiry that what concernd me was so blended and interwoven with what did not i was obligd to trouble the reader with it entire not without hopes that prolix as it is the extravagancy of it will be entertaining to those who have perused the treatise it condemns with so much horrora    the grumbling hive

ever trouble their heads with telling them what they really are  as for my part without any compliment to the courteous reader or my self i believe man besides skin flesh bones c that are obvious to the eye to be a compound of various passions that all of them as they are provoked and come uppermost govern him by turns whether he will or no to  0 shew that these qualifications which we all pretend to be ashamd of are the great support of a flourishing society has been the subject of the foregoing   poem but there being some passages in it seemingly paradoxical i have in the preface promised some explanatory remarks on it which to render more useful i have thought fit to enquire how man no better qualifyd might yet by his own imperfections be taught to distinguish between virtue and vice and here i must desire the reader once for all to take notice that when i say men i mean neither jews nor christians but meer man in the state of nature and ignorance of the true deity       an enquiry into the origin of moral virtue all untaught animals are only sollicitous of pleasing themselves and naturally follow the bent of their own inclinations without considering the good or harm that from their being pleased will accrue to others this is the reason that in the wild state of nature those creatures are fittest to live peaceably together in great numbers that discover the least of understanding and have the fewest appetites to gratify and consequently no species of animals is without the curb of government less capable of agreeing long together in mul  titudes than that of man yet such are his qualities whether good or bad i shall not determine that no creature besides himself can ever be made sociable but being an extraordinary    selfish and headstrong as well as cunning animal however he may be subdued by superior strength it is impossible by force alone to make him tractable and receive the improvements he is capable of the chief thing therefore which lawgivers and other wise men that have laboured for the establishment of society have endeavourd has been to make the people they were to govern believe that it was more beneficial for every body to conquer than indulge his appetites and much better to mind the publick than what seemd his private interest as this has always been a very difficult task so no wit or eloquence has been left untried to compass it and the moralists and philosophers of all ages employed their utmost skill to prove the truth of so useful an assertion but whether mankind would have ever a believd it or not it is not likely that any body could have persuaded them to disapprove of their natural inclinations or prefer the good of others to their own if at the same time he had not shewd them an equivalent to be enjoyd as a reward for the violence which by so doing they of necessity must commit upon themselves those that have undertaken to civilize mankind were not igno  rant of this but being unable to give so many real rewards as would satisfy all persons for every individual action they were forcd to contrive an imaginary one that as a general equivalent for the trouble of selfdenial should serve on all occasions and without costing any thing either to themselves or others be yet a most acceptable recompense to the receivers they thoroughly examind all the strength and frailties of our nature and observing that none were either so savage as not to be charmd with praise or so despicable as patiently to bear contempt justly concluded that flattery must be the most powerful    argument that could be used to human creatures making use of this bewitching engine they extolld the excellency of our nature above other animals and setting forth with unbounded praises the wonders of our sagacity and vastness of understanding bestowd a thousand encomiums on the rationality of our souls by the help of which we were capable of performing the most noble atchievements having by this artful way of flattery insinuated themselves into the hearts of men they began to instruct them in the notions of honour and shame representing the one as the worst of all evils and the other as the highest good to which mortals could aspire which being done they laid before them how unbecoming it was 0 the dignity of such sublime creatures to be sollicitous about gratifying those appetites which they had in common with brutes and at the same time unmindful of those higher qualities that gave them the preeminence over all visible beings they indeed confessd that those impulses of nature were very pressing that it was troublesome to resist and very difficult wholly to subdue them but this they only used as an argument to demonstrate how glorious the conquest of them was on the one hand and how scandalous on the other not to attempt it to introduce moreover an emulation amongst men they divided the whole species into a two classes vastly differing from one another the one consisted of abject lowminded people that always hunting after immediate enjoyment were wholly incapable of selfdenial and without regard to the good of others had no higher aim than their private advantage such as being enslaved by voluptuousness yielded without resistance to every gross desire and madeb no use of their rational faculties but to heighten their sensual pleasurec these vile grovling wretches they said were the dross of their kind and having    only the shape of men differd from brutes in nothing but their outward figure but the other class was made up of lofty highspirited creatures that free from sordid selfishness esteemd the improvements of the mind to be their fairest   possessions and setting a true value upon themselves took no delight but in embellishing that part in which their excellency consisted such as despising whatever they had in common with irrational creatures opposed by the help of reason their most violent inclinations and making a continual war with themselves to promote the peace of others aimd at no less than the publick welfare and the conquest of their own passiona   fortior est qui se quàm qui fortissima vincit   mœnia — — — —   these they calld the true representatives of their sublime species exceeding in worth the first class by more degrees than that it self was superior to the beasts of the field as in all animals that are not too imperfect to discover pride we find that the finest and such as are the most beautiful and valuable of their kind have generally the greatest share of it so in man the most perfect of animals  it is so inseparable from his very essence how cunningly soever some may learn    to hide or disguise it that without it the compound he is made of would want one of the chiefest ingredients which if we consider it is hardly to be doubted but lessons and remonstrances so skilfully adapted to the good opinion man has of himself as those i have mentioned must if scatterd amongst   a multitude not only gain the assent of most of them as to the speculative part but likewise induce several especially the fiercest most resolute and best among them to endure a thousand inconveniences and undergo as many hardships that they may have the pleasure of counting themselves men of the second class and consequently appropriating to themselves all the excellences they have heard of it from what has been said we ought to expect in the first place that the heroes who took such extraordinary pains to master some of their natural appetites and preferrd the good of others to any visible interest of their own would not recedea an inch from the fine notions they had receivd concerning the dignity of rational creatures and having ever the authority of the government on their side with all imaginable vigour assert the esteem that was due to those of the second class as well as their superiority over the rest of their kind in the second that those who wanted a sufficient stock of either pride or resolution to buoy them up in mortifying of what was dearest to them followd the sensual dictates of nature would yet be ashamd of confessing themselves to be those despicable wretches that belongd to the inferior class and were generally reckond to be so little removd from brutes and that therefore in their own defence they would say as others   did and hiding their own imperfections as well as they could cry up selfdenial and publickspiritedness as much as any for it is highly probable that some of them convinced by the real proofs of fortitude and selfconquest    they had seen would admire in others what they found wanting in themselves others be afraid of the resolution and prowess of those of the second class and that all of them were kept in aw by the power of their rulers wherefore it is reasonable to think that none of them whatever they thought in themselves would dare openly contradict what by every body else was thought criminal to doubt of this was or at least might have been the manner after which savage man was broke  from whence it    is evident that the first rudiments of morality broachd by skilful politicians to render men useful to each other as well as tractable were chiefly contrived that the ambitious might reap the more benefit from and govern vast numbers of them with the greater ease and security this foundation of politicks being once laid it is impossible that man should long remain uncivilized for even those who only strove to gratify their appetites being continually crossd by others of the same stamp could not but observe that whenever they checkd their inclinations or but followed them with more circumspection they avoided a world of troubles and often escapd many of the calamities that   generally attended the too eager pursuit after pleasure first they receivd as well as others the benefit of    those actions that were done for the good of the whole society and consequently could not forbear wishing well to those of the superior class that performd them secondly the more intent they were in seeking their own advantage without regard to others the more they were hourly convinced that none stood so much in their waya as those that were most like themselves it being the interest then of the very worst of them more than any to preach up publickspiritedness that they might reap the fruits of the labour and selfdenial of others and at the same time indulge their own appetites with less disturbance they agreed with the rest to call every thing which without regard to the publick man should commit to gratify any of his appetites v i c e if in that action there coud be observed the least prospect that it might either be injurious to any of the society or ever render himself less serviceable to others and to give the name of v i r t u e to every performance by which man contrary to the impulse of nature  should endeavour the benefit of others or the conquest of his own    passions out of a rational  ambition of being good  it shall be objected that no society was ever any  0 ways civilizd before the major part   had agreed upon some worship or other of an overruling power and consequently that the notions of good and evil and the distinction between virtue and vice were never the contrivance of politicians but the pure effect of religion before i answer this objection i must repeat what i have said already that in this enquiry into the origin of moral virtue i speak neither of jews or a christians but man in his state of nature and ignorance of the true deity and then i affirm that the idolatrous superstitions of all other nations and the pitiful notions they had of the supreme being were incapable of exciting man to virtue and good for nothing but to aw and amuse a rude and unthinking multitude it is evident from history that in all considerable societies how stupid or ridiculous soever peoples received notions have been as to the deities they worshippd human nature has ever exerted it self in all its branches and that there is no earthly wisdom or moral virtue but at one time or other men have excelld in it in all monarchies and commonwealths that for riches and power have been any ways remarkable the ægyptians not satisfyd with having deifyd all the ugly monsters they could think on were so silly as to adore the onions of their own sowing  yet at the same time their country was the most famous nursery of arts and sciences in the world and them  selves more eminently skilld in the deepest mysteries of nature than any nation has been since no states or kingdoms under heaven have yielded more or greater patterns in all sorts of moral virtues than the greek and roman empires more especially the latter and yet how loose absurd and ridiculous were their sentiments as to sacred matters for    without reflecting on the extravagant number of their deities if we only consider the infamous stories they fatherd upon them it is not to be denied but that their religion far from teaching men the conquest of their passions and the way to virtue seemd rather contrivd to justify their appetites and encourage their vices  but if we would know what made em excel in fortitude courage and magnanimity we must cast our eyes on the pomp of their triumphs the magnificence of their monuments and arches their trophies statues and inscriptions the variety of their military crowns their honours decreed to the dead publick encomiums on the living and other imaginary rewards they bestowd on men of merit and we shall find that what carried so many of them to the utmost pitch of selfdenial was nothing but their policy in making use of the most effectual means that human pride could be flatterd with   it is visible then that it was not any heathen religion or other idolatrous superstition that first put man upon crossing his appetites and subduing his dearest inclinations but the skilful management of wary politicians and the nearer we search into human nature the more we shall be convinced that the moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride  there is no man of what capacity or penetration soever that is wholly proof against the witchcraft of flattery if artfully performd and suited to his    abilitiesa children and fools will swallow personal praise but those that are more cunning must be managd with greater circumspection and the more general the flattery is the less it is suspected by those it is levelld at what you say in commendation of a whole town is receivd with pleasure by all the inhabitants speak in commendation of letters in general and every man of learning will think himself in particular obliged to you you may safely praise the employment a man is of or the country he was born in because you give him an opportunity of screening the joy he feels upon his own account under the esteem which he pretends to have for others  it is common among cunning men that understand the power which flattery has upon pride when they are afraid they shall   be imposd upon to enlarge tho much against their conscience upon the honour fair dealing and integrity of the family country or sometimes the profession of him they suspect because they know that men often will change their resolution and act against their inclination that they may have the pleasure of continuing to appear in the opinion of some what they are conscious not to be in reality thus sagacious moralists draw men like angels in hopes that the pride at least of some will put em upon copying after the beautiful originals which they are represented to be  when the incomparable sir richard steele b in the    usual elegance of his easy style dwells on the praises of his sublime species and with all the embellishments of rhetoric sets forth the excellency of human nature  it is impossible not to be charmd with his happy turns of thought and the politeness of his expressions but tho i have been often moved by the force of his eloquence and ready to swallow the ingenious sophistry with pleasure yet i could never be so serious but reflecting on his artful encomiums i thought on the tricks made use of by the women that would teach children to be mannerly when an aukward girl before she can either speak or go begins after many intreaties to make the first rude essays of curtsying the nurse falls in an ecstacy of praise   theres a delicate curtsy o fine miss theres a pretty lady mama miss can make a better curtsy than her sister molly the same is echod over by the maids whilst mama almost hugs the child to pieces only miss molly who being four years older knows how to make a very handsome curtsy wonders at the perverseness of their judgment and swelling with indignation is ready to cry at the injustice that is done her till being whisperd in the ear that it is only to please the baby and that she is a woman she grows proud at being let into the secret and rejoicing at the superiority of her understanding repeats what has been said with large additions and insults over the weakness of her sister whom all this while she fancies to be the only bubble among them these extravagant praises would by any one above the capacity of an infant be calld fulsome flatteries and if you will abominable lies yet experience teaches us that by the help of such gross encomiums young misses will be brought to make    pretty curtsies and behave themselves womanly much sooner and with less trouble than they would without them tis the same with boys whom theyll strive to persuade that all fine gentlemen do as they are bid and that none but beggar boys are rude or dirty their clothes nay as soon as the wild brat with his untaught fist begins to fumble for  0his hat the mother to make him pull it off tells him before he is two years old that he is a man and if he repeats that action when she desires him hes presently a captain a lord mayor a king or something higher if she can think of it till eggd on by the force of praise the little urchin endeavours to imitate man as well as he can and strains all his faculties to appear what his shallow noddle imagines he is believd to be  the meanest wretch puts an inestimable value upon himself and the highest wish of the ambitious man is to have all the world as to that particular of his opinion so that the most insatiable thirst after fame that ever heroe was inspired with was never more than an ungovernable greediness to engross the esteem and admiration of others in future ages as well as his own and what mortification soever this truth might be to the second thoughts of an alexander or a cæsar the great recompence in view for which the most exalted minds have with so much alacrity sacrificed their quiet health sensual pleasures and    every inch of themselves has never been any thing else but the breath of man the aerial coin of praise who can forbear laughing when he thinks on all the great men that have been so serious on the subject of that macedonian madman  his capacious soul that mighty heart in one corner of which ac  cording to lorenzo gratian  the world was so commodiously lodged that in the whole there was room for six more who can forbear laughing i say when he compares the fine things that have been said of alexander with the end he proposed to himself from his vast exploits to be proved from his own mouth when the vast pains he took to pass the hydaspes forced him to cry out oh ye athenians could you believe what dangers i expose my self to to be praised by youa   to define then b the reward of glory in the amplest manner the most that can be said of it is that it consists in a superlative felicity which a man who is conscious of having performd a noble action enjoys in selflove whilst he is thinking on the applause he expects of others but here i shall be told that besides the noisy toilsc of war and publick bustle of the ambitious there are noble and generous actions that are performd in silence that virtue being its own reward those who are really good have a satisfaction in their consciousness of being so which is all the recompence    they expect from the most worthy performances that among the heathens there have been men who when they did good to others were so far from coveting thanks and applause that they took all imaginable care to be for ever conceald from those on whom they bestowd their   benefits and consequently that pride has no hand in spurring man on to the highest pitch of selfdenial in answer to this i say that it is impossible to judge of a mans performance unless we are throughly acquainted with the principle and motive from which he acts pity tho it is the most gentle and the least mischievous of all our passions is yet as much a frailty of our nature as anger pride or fear the weakest minds have generally the greatest share of it for which reason none are more compassionate than women and children it must be ownd that of all our weaknesses it is the most amiable and bears the greatest resemblance to virtue nay without a considerable mixture of it the society could hardly subsist but as it is an impulse of nature that consults neither the publick interest nor our own reason it may produce evil as well as good it has helpd to destroy the honour of virgins and corrupted the integrity of judges and whoever acts from it as a principle what good soever he may bring to the society has nothing to boast of but that he has indulged a passion that has happened to be beneficial to the publick there is no merit in saving an innocent babe ready to drop into the fire the action is neither good nor bad and what benefit soever the infant received we only obliged our selves for to have seen it fall and not   strove to hinder it would have caused a pain which selfpreservation compelld us to prevent nor has a rich prodigal that happens to be of a commiserating temper and loves to gratify his passions greater virtue to boast of when he relieves an object of compassion with what to himself is a trifle    but such men as without complying with any weakness of their own can part from what they value themselves and from no other motive but their love to goodness perform a worthy action in silence such men i confess have acquird more refind notions of virtue than those i have hitherto spoke of yet even in these with which the world has yet never swarmd we may discover no small symptoms of pride and the humblest man alive must confess that the reward of a virtuous action which is the satisfaction that ensues upon it consists in a certain pleasure he procures to himself by contemplating on his own worth which pleasure together with the occasion of it are as certain signs of pride as looking pale and trembling at any imminent danger are the symptoms of fear if the too scrupulous reader should at first view condemn these notions concerning the origin of moral virtue and think them perhaps offensive to christianity i hope hell forbear his censures when he shall consider that nothing can render the unsearchable   depth of thea divine wisdom more conspicuous than that man whom providence had designed for society should not only by his own frailties and imperfections be led into the road to temporal happiness but likewise receive from a seeming necessity of natural causes a tincture of that knowledge in which he was afterwards to be made perfect by the true religion to his eternal welfare       remarks remark a remark a a whilst others followd mysteries to which few folks bind prentices page   line    in the education of youth in order to their getting of a livelihood when they shall be arrived at maturity most people look out for some warrantable employment or other of which there are whole bodies or companies in every large society of men by this means all arts and sciences as well as trades and handicrafts are perpetuated in the commonwealth as long as they are found useful the young ones that are daily brought up to em continually supplying the loss of the old ones that die but some of these employments being vastly more creditable than others according to the great difference of the charges required to set up in each of them all prudent parents in the choice of them chiefly consult   their own abilities and the circumstances they are in a man that gives three or four hundred pounds with his son to a great merchant and has not two or three thousand pounds to spare against he is out of his time to begin the world with is much to    blame not to have brought his child up to something that might be followd with less money there are abundance of men of a genteel education that have but very small revenues and yet are forced by their reputable callings to make a greater figure than ordinary people of twice their income if these have any children it often happens that as their indigence renders them incapable of bringing them up to creditable occupations so their pride makes em unwilling to put them out to any of the mean laborious trades and then in hopes either of an alteration in their fortune or that some friends or favourable opportunity shall offer they from time to time put off the disposing of them till insensibly they come to be of age and are at last brought up to nothing whether this neglect be more barbarous to the children or prejudicial to the society i shall not determine at athens all children were forced to assist their parents if they came to want but solon made a law that no son should be obligd to relieve his father who had not bred him up to any calling    some parents put out their sons to good trades very suitable to their then present abilities but happen to dy or fail in the world before their children have finishd their apprenticeships or are made fit for the business they are to follow a great many young men again on the other hand are handsomely provided for and set up for themselves that yet some for want of industry or else a sufficient knowledge in their callings others by indulging their pleasures and some few by misfortunes are reduced to poverty and altogether unable to maintain themselves by the business they were brought up to it is impossible but that the neglects mismanagements and misfortunes i named must very frequently happen in populous places and consequently great numbers of people be daily flung unprovided for into the wide world how  0 rich and potent a commonwealth may be or what care soever a government may take to hinder it how must these people be disposed of the sea i know and armies which the world is seldom without will take off some those that are honest drudges and of a laborious temper will become journeymen to the trades they are of or enter into some other service such of them as studyd and were sent to the university may become schoolmasters tutors and some few of them get into some office or other but   what must become of the lazy that care for no manner of working and the fickle that hate to be confind to any thing those that ever took delight in plays and romances and have a spice of gentility will in all probability throw their eyes upon the stage and if they have a good elocution with tolerable mien turn actors some that love their bellies above anya thing else if they have a good palate and a little knack at cookery will strive to get in with gluttons and epicures learn to cringe and bear all manner of usage and so turn parasites ever flattering the master and making mischief among the rest of the family others who by their own and companions lewdness judge of peoples incontinence will naturally fall to intriguing and endeavour to live by pimping for such as either want leisure or address to speak for themselves those of the most abandond principles of all if they are sly and dextrous turn sharpers pickpockets or coiners if their skill and ingenuity give them leave others again that have observd the credulity of simple women and other foolish people if they have impudence and a little cunning either set up for doctors or else pretend to tell fortunes and every one turning the vices and frailties of others to his own advantage endeavours to pick up a living the easiest and shortest way his talent and abilities will let him      these are certainly the bane of civil society but they are fools who not considering what has been said storm at the remisness of the laws that suffer them to live while wise men content themselves with taking all imaginable care not to be circumvented by them without quarrelling at what no human prudence can prevent remark b remark b b these were calld knaves but bar the name the grave industrious were the same page   line   this i confess is but a very indifferent compliment to all the trading part of the people but if the word knave may be understood in its full latitude and comprehend every body that is not sincerely honest and does to others what he would dislike to have done to himself i dont question but i shall make good the charge to pass by the innumerable artifices by which buyers and sellers outwit one another that are daily allowed of and practised among the fairest of dealers shew me the tradesman that has always discoverd the defects of his goods to those that cheapend them nay where will you find one that has not at one time or other industri 0ously conceald them to the detriment of the buyer where is the merchant that has never against his conscience extolld his wares beyond their worth to make them go off the better decio a man of great figure that had large commissions for sugar from several parts beyond sea treats about a considerable parcel of that commodity with alcander an eminent westindia merchant both understood the market very well but could not agree decio was a man of substance and thought no body    ought to buy cheaper than himself alcander was the same and not wanting money stood for his price while they were driving their bargain at a tavern near the exchange alcanders man brought his master a letter from the westindies that informd him of a much greater quantity of sugars coming for england than was expected alcander now wishd for nothing more than to sell at decios price before the news was publick but being a cunning fox that he might not seem too precipitant nor yet lose his customer he drops the discourse they were upon and putting on a jovial humour commends the agreeableness of the weather from whence falling upon the delight he took in his gardens invites decio to go along with him to his countryhouse that was not above twelve miles from london it was in the month of   may and as it happened upon a saturday in the afternoon decio who was a single man and would have no business in town before tuesday accepts of the others civility and away they go in alcanders coach decio was splendidly entertaind that night and the day following the monday morning to get himself an appetite he goes to take the air upon a pad of alcanders and coming back meets with a gentleman of his acquaintance who tells him news was come the night before that the barbadoes fleet was destroyd by a storm and adds that before he camea out it had been confirmd at lloyds coffeehouse  where it was thought sugars would rise    per cent by changetime decio returns to his friend and immediately resumes the discourse they had broke off at the tavern alcander who thinking himself sure of his chap did not design to have moved it till after dinner was very glad to see himself so happily prevented     but how desirous soever he was to sell the other was yet more eager to buy yet both of them afraid of one another for a considerable time counterfeited all the indifference imaginable till at last decio fired with what he had heard thought delays might prove dangerous and throwing a guinea upon the table struck the bargain at alcanders price the next day they went to london the news provd   true and decio got five hundred pounds by his sugars alcander whilst he had strove to overreach the other was paid in his own coin yet all this is called fair dealing but i am sure neither of them would have desired to be done by as they did to each other remark c remark c c the soldiers that were forcd to fight if they survivd got honour byt page   line    so unaccountable is the desire to be thought well of in men that tho they are draggd into the war against their will and some of them for their crimes and are compelld to fight with threats and often blows yet they would be esteemd for what they would have avoided if it had been in their power whereas if reason in man was of equal weight with his pride he could never be pleasd with praises which he is conscious he dont deserve by honour in its proper and genuine signification we mean nothing else but the good opinion of others  which is counted more or less substantial the more    or less noise or bustle there is made about the demonstration of it and when we say the so  vereign is the fountain of honour it signifies that he has the power by titles or ceremonies or both together to stamp a mark upon whom he pleases that shall be as current as his coin and procure the owner the good opinion of every body whether he deserves it or not the reverse of honour is dishonour or ignominy which consists in the bad opinion and contempt of others and as the first is counted a reward for good actions so this is esteemd a punishment for bad ones and the more or less publick or heinous the manner is in which this contempt of others is shewn the more or less the person so suffering is degraded by it this ignominy is likewise called shame from the effect it produces for tho the good and evil of honour and dishonour are imaginary yet there is a reality in shame as it signifies a passion that has its proper symptoms overrules our reason and requires as much labour and selfdenial to be subdued as any of the rest and since the most important actions of life often are regulated according to the influence this passion has upon us a thorough understanding of it must help to illustrate the notions the world has of honour and ignominy i shall therefore describe it at large first to define the passion of shame i think it may be calld a sorrowful reflexion on our own unworthiness proceeding from an appre  hension that others either do or might if they knew all deservedly despise us  the only objection of weight that can be raisd against this definition is that innocent virgins are often ashamd and blush when they are guilty of no crime and can give no manner of reason for this frailty    and that men are often ashamd for others for or with whom they have neither friendship or affinity and consequently that there may be a thousand instances of shame given to which the words of the definition are not applicable to answer this i would have it first considerd that the modesty of womena is the result of custom and education by which all unfashionable denudations and filthy expressions are renderd frightful and abominable to them and that notwithstanding this the most virtuous young woman alive will often in spite of her teeth have thoughts and confusd ideas of things arise in her imagination which she would not reveal to some people for a thousand worlds then i say that when obscene words are spoken in the presence of an unexperienced virgin she is afraid that some body will reckon her to understand what they mean and consequently that she understands this and that and several things which she desires to be thought ignorant of the reflecting on this and that thoughts are forming to her disadvantage brings upon her that passion which we call shame and what  ever can fling her tho never so remote from lewdness upon that set of thoughts i hinted and which she thinks criminal will have the same effect especially before men as long as her modesty lasts to try the truth of this let them talk as much bawdy as they please in the room next to the same virtuous young woman where she is sure that she is undiscoverd and she will hear if not hearken to it without blushing at all because then she looks upon herself as no party concernd  and if the discourse    should stain her cheeks with red whatever her innocence may imagine it is certain that what occasions her colour is a passion not half so mortifying as that of shame but if in the same place she hears something said of her self that must tend to her disgrace or any thing is named of which she is secretly guilty then tis ten to one but shell be ashamed and blush tho no body sees her because she has room to fear that she is or if all was known should be thought of contemptibly that we are often ashamd and blush for others which was the second part of the objection is nothing else but that sometimes we make the case of others too nearly our own so people shriek out when they see others in danger whilst we are reflecting with too much earnest on the effect which such a blameable action if it was ours would produce in us the spirits and consequently the blood are   insensibly moved after the same manner as if the action was our own and so the same symptoms must appear  the shame that raw ignorant and illbred people tho seemingly without a cause discover before their betters is always accompanied with and proceeds from a consciousness of their weakness and inabilities and the most modest man how virtuous knowing and accomplishd soever he might be was never yet ashamd without some guilt or diffidence such as out of rusticity and want of education are unreasonably subject to and at every turn overcome by this passion we call bashful and those who out of disrespect to others and a false opinion of their own sufficiency have learnd not to be affected with it when they should be are calld impudent or shameless what strange contradictions man is made of the reverse of shame is pride see remark ma yet    no body can be touchd with the first that never felt any thing of the latter for that we have such an extraordinary concern in what others think of us can proceed from nothing but the vast esteem we have for our selves that these two passions  in which the seeds of most virtues are contained are realities in our frame and not imaginary qualities is demonstrable from the plain and different effects that in spite of our reason are produced in us as soon as we are affected with either   when a man is overwhelmd with shame he observes a sinking of the spirits the heart feels cold and condensed and the blood flies from it to the circumference of the body the face glows the neck and part of the breast partake of the fire he is heavy as lead the head is hung down and the eyes through a mist of confusion are fixd on the ground no injuries can move him he is weary of his being and heartily wishes he could make himself invisible but when gratifying his vanity he exults in his pride he discovers quite contrary symptoms his spirits swell and fan the arterial blood a more than ordinary warmth strengthens and dilates the heart the extremities are cool he feels light to himself and imagines he could tread on air his head is held up his eyes rolld about with sprightliness he rejoices    at his being is prone to anger and would be glad that all the world could take notice of hima it is incredible how necessary an ingredient shame is to make us sociable it is a frailty in our nature all the world whenever it affects them submit to it with regret and would prevent it if they could yet the happiness of conversation depends upon it and no society could be polishd if the generality of mankind wereb not subject to it as therefore the sense of shame is troublesome and all creatures are ever labouring for   their own defence it is probable that man striving to avoid this uneasiness would in a great measure conquer his shame by that he was grown up but this would be detrimental to the society and therefore from his infancy throughout his education we endeavour to increase instead of lessening or destroying this sense of shame and the only remedy prescribd is a strict observance of certain rules to avoid those things that might bring this troublesome sense of shame upon him but as to rid or cure him of it the politician would sooner take away his life the rules i speak of consist in a dextrous management of our selves a stifling of our appetites and hiding the real sentiments of our hearts before others those who are not instructed in these rules long before they come to years of maturity seldom make any progress in them afterwards to acquire and bring to perfection the accomplishment i hint at nothing is more assisting than pride and good sense the greediness we have after the esteem of others and the raptures we enjoy in the thoughts of being liked and perhaps admired are equivalents that overpay the conquest of the strongest passions and consequently keep us at a great distance from all such words or actions that can bring shame upon us the passions we chiefly ought to hide for the happiness and embellishment of the society   are lust    pride and selfishness therefore the word modesty has three different acceptations that vary with the passions it conceals as to the first i mean that branch of modesty that has a general pretension to chastity for its object it consists in a sincere and painful endeavour with all our faculties to stifle and conceal before others that inclination which nature has given us to propagate our species the lessons of it like those of grammar are taught us long before we have occasion for or understand the usefulness of them for this reason children often are ashamed and blush out of modesty before the impulse of nature i hint at makes any impression upon them a girl who is modestly educated may before she is two years old begin to observe how careful the women she converses with are of covering themselves before men and the same caution being inculcated to her by precept as well as example it is very probable that at six shell be ashamed of shewing her leg without knowing any reason why such an act is blameable or what the tendency of it is to be modest we ought in the first place to avoid all unfashionable denudations a woman is not to be found fault with for going with her neck bare if the custom of the country allows of it and when the mode  0orders the stays to be cut very low a blooming virgin may without fear of rational censure shew all the world   how firm her pouting breasts that white as snow   on th ample chest at mighty distance grow  but to suffer her ancle to be seen where it is the fashion for women to hide their very feet is a breach  0 of modesty and she is impudent who shews half her face in a country where decency bids her to be veild in the second our language must be chaste and not only free but remote from obscenities that is whatever belongs to the multiplication of our species is not to be spoke of and the least word or expression that tho at a great distance has any relation to that performance ought never to come from our lips thirdly all postures and motions that can any ways sully the imagination that is put us in mind of what i have called obscenities are to be forebore with great caution a young woman moreover that would be thought wellbred ought to be circumspect before men in all her behaviour and never known to receive from much less to bestow favours upon them unless the great age of the man near consanguinity or a vast superiority on either side plead her excuse a young lady of refind education   keeps a strict guard over her looks as well as actions and in her eyes we may read a consciousness that she has a treasure about her not out of danger of being lost and which yet she is resolvd not to part with at any terms thousand satyrs have been made against prudes and as many encomiums to extol the careless graces and negligent air of virtuous beauty but the wiser sort of mankind are well assured that the free and open countenance of the smiling fair is more inviting and yields greater hopes to the seducer than the everwatchful look of a forbidding eye  this strict reservedness is to be complyd with by all young women especially virgins if they value the esteem of the polite and knowing world men may take greater liberty because in them the appetite is more violent and ungovernable had equal harshness of discipline been imposed upon both neither of them could have made the first advances and propagation    must have stood still among all the fashionable people which being far from the politicians aim it was advisable to ease and indulge the sex that sufferd most by the severity and make the rules abate of their rigour where the passion was the strongest and the burthen of a strict restraint would have been the most intolerable for this reason the man is allowd openly to profess the veneration and great esteem   he has for women and shew greater satisfaction more mirth and gaiety in their company than he is used to do out of it he may not only be complaisant and serviceable to them on all occasions but it is reckond his duty to protect and defend them he may praise the good qualities they are possessd of and extol their merit with as many exaggerations as his invention will let him and are consistent with good sense he may talk of love he may sigh and complain of the rigours of the fair and what his tongue must not utter he has the privilege to speak with his eyes and in that language to say what he pleases so it be done with decency and short abrupted glances but too closely to pursue a woman and fasten upon her with ones eyes is counted very unmannerly the reason is plain it makes her uneasy and if she be not sufficiently fortifyd by art and dissimulation often throws her into visible disorders as the eyes are the windows of the soul so this staring impudence flings a raw unexperiencd woman into panick fears that she may be seen through and thata the man will discover or has already betrayd what passes within her it keeps her on a perpetual rack that commands her to reveal her secret wishes and seems designd to extort from her the grand truth which modesty bids her with all her faculties to deny   the multitude will hardly believe the excessive force of education and in the difference of modesty between men and women ascribe that to nature    which a is altogether owing to early instruction miss is scarce three years old but she is b spoke to every day to hide her leg and rebukd in good earnest if she shews it while little master at the same age is bid to take up his coats and piss like a man it is shame and education that containsc the seeds of all politeness and he that has neither and offers to speak the truth of his heart and what he feels within is the most contemptible creature upon earth tho he committed no other fault if a man should tell a woman that he could like no body so well to propagate his species upon as her self and that he found a violent desire that moment to go about it and accordingly offerd to lay hold of her for that purpose the consequence would be that he would be calld a brute the woman would run away and himself never be admitted in any civil company there is no body that has any sense of shame but would conquer the strongest passion rather than be so servd but a man need not conquer his passions it is sufficient that he conceals them virtue bids us subdue but good breeding only requires we should hide our appetites  a fashionable gentleman may have as    violent an inclination to a woman as the brutish fellow but then he   behaves himself quite otherwise he first addresses the ladys father and demonstrates his ability splendidly to maintain his daughter upon this he is admitted into her company where by flattery submissiona presents and assiduity he endeavours to procure her liking to his person which if he can compass the lady in a little while resigns her self to him before witnesses in a most solemn manner at night they go to bed together where the most reservd virgin very tamely suffers him to do what he pleases and the upshot is that he obtains what he wanted without having ever askd for it the next day they receive visits and no body laughs at them or speaks a word of what they have been doing as to the young couple themselves they take no more notice of one another i speak of wellbred people than they did the day before they eat and drink divert themselves as usually and having done nothing to be ashamd of are lookd upon as what in reality they may be the most modest people upon earth what i mean by this is to demonstrate that by being well bred we suffer no abridgement in our sensual pleasures but only labour for our mutual happiness and assist each other in the luxurious enjoyment of all worldly comforts the fine gentleman i spoke of need not practise any greater selfdenial than the savage and the latter acted more according to the laws   of nature and sincerity than the first the man that gratifies his appetites after the manner the custom of the country allows of has no censure to fear if he is hotter than goats or bulls as soon as the ceremony is over let him sate and fatigue himself with joy and ecstacies of pleasure raise and indulge his appetites by turns as extravagantly as his strength and manhood will give him leave he may with safety laugh at the wise men that    should reprove him all the women and above nine in ten of the men are of his side nay he has the liberty of valuing himself upon the fury of his unbridled passion and the more he wallows in lust and strains every faculty to be abandonedly voluptuous the sooner he shall have the goodwill and gain the affection of the women not the young vain and lascivious only but the prudent grave and most sober matrons because impudence is a vice it does not follow that modesty is a virtue it is built upon shame a passion in our nature and may be either good or bad according to the actions performd from that motive shame may hinder a prostitute from yielding to a man before company and the same shame may cause a bashful goodnaturd creature that has been overcome by frailty to make away with her infant passions may do good by chance but there can be no merit but in the conquest of them   was there virtue in modesty it would be of the same force in the dark as it is in the light which it is not this the men of pleasure know very well who never trouble their heads with a womans virtue so they can but conquer her modesty seducers therefore dont make their attacks at noonday but cut their trenches at night   illa verecundis lux est præbenda puellis   qua timidus latebras sperat habere pudor  people of substance may sin without being exposd for their stolen pleasure but servants and the poorer sort of women have seldom an opportunity of concealing a big belly or at least the consequences of it it is possible that an unfortunate girl of good parentage may be left destitute and know noa shift    for a livelihood than to become a nursery or a chambermaid she may be diligent faithful and obliging have abundance of modesty and if you will be religious she may resist temptations and preserve her chastity for years together and yet at last meet with an unhappy moment in which she gives up her honour to a powerful deceiver who afterwards neglects her if she proves with child her sorrows are unspeakable and she cant be reconcild with the wretchedness of her condition the fear of shame attacks her so lively that every thought distracts her   all the family she lives in have a great opinion of her virtue and her last mistress took her for a saint how will her enemies that envied her character rejoice how will her relations detest her the more modest she is now and the more violently the dread of coming to shame hurries her away the more wicked and more cruel her resolutions will be either against her self or what she bears it is commonly imagined that she who can destroy her child her own flesh and blood must have a vast stock of barbarity and be a savage monster different from other women but this is likewise a mistake which we commit for want of understanding nature and the force of passions the same woman that murders her bastard in the most execrable manner if she is married afterwards may take care of cherish and feel all the tenderness for her infant that the fondest mother can be capable of all mothers naturally love their children but as this is a passion and all passions center in selflove so it may be subdued by any superior passion to sooth that same selflove which if nothing had intervend would have bid her fondle her offspring common whores whom all the world knows to be such hardly ever destroy their children nay even those who assist in robberies and murders seldom are guilty of this crime not because they are less cruel or more virtuous but because they   have lost their modesty    to a greater degree and the fear of shame makes hardly any impression upon them  our love to what never was within the reach of our senses is but poor and inconsiderable and therefore women have no natural love to what they bear their affection begins after the birth what they feel before is the result of reason education and the thoughts of duty even when children first are born the mothers love is but weak and increases with the sensibility of the child and grows up to a prodigious height when by signs it begins to express his sorrows and joys makes his wants known and discovers his love to novelty and the multiplicity of his desires what labours and hazards have not women undergone to maintain and save their children what force and fortitude beyond their sex have they not shewn in their behalf but the vilest women have exerted themselves on this head as violently as the best all are prompted to it by a natural drift and inclination without any consideration of the injury or benefit the society receives from it there is no merit in pleasing our selves and the very offspring is often irreparably ruind by the excessive fondness of parents for tho infants for two or three years may be the better for this indulging care of mothers yet afterwards if not moderated it may totally spoil them and many it has brought to the gallows   if the reader thinks i have been too tedious on that branch of modesty by the help of which we endeavour to appear chaste i shall make him amends in the brevity with which i design to treat of the remaining part by which we would make others believe that the esteem we have for them exceeds the value we have for our selves and that we have    no disregard so great to any interest as we have to our own this laudable quality is commonly known by the name of manners and goodbreeding and consists in a fashionable habit acquird by precept and example of flattering the pride and selfishness of others and concealing our own with judgment and dexterity this must be only understood of our commerce with our equals and superiors and whilst we are in peace and amity with them for our complaisance must never interfere with the rules of honour nor the homage that is due to us from servants and others that depend upon us with this caution i believe that the definition will quadrate with every thing that can be alledgd as a piece or an example of either goodbreeding or ill manners and it will be very difficult throughout the various accidents of human life and conversation to find out an instance of modesty or impudence that is not comprehended in and illustrated by it in  0all countries and in all ages a man that asks considerable favours of one who is a stranger to him without consideration is calld impudent because he shews openly his selfishness without having any regard to the selfishness of the other we may see in it likewise the reason why a man ought to speak of his wife and children and every thing that is dear to him as sparinglya as is possible and hardly ever of himself especially in commendation of them a wellbred man may be desirous and even greedy after praise and the esteem of others but to be praisd to his face offends his modesty the reason is this all human creatures before they are yet polishd receive an extraordinary pleasure in hearing themselves praisd this we are all conscious of and therefore when we see a man openly enjoy and feast on this delight in which we have no share it rouses our selfishness and immediately we begin to envy and hate him for this reason the wellbred man conceals    his joy and utterly denies that he feels any and by this means consulting and soothing our selfishness he averts that envy and hatred which otherwise he would have justly to fear when from our childhood we observe how those are ridiculd who calmly can hear their own praises it is possible that we may so strenuously endeavour to avoid that pleasure that in tract of time we grow   uneasy at the approach of it but this is not following the dictates of nature but warping her by education and custom for if the generality of mankind took no delight in being praisd there could be no modesty in refusing to hear it the man of manners picks not the best but rather takes the worst out of the dish and gets of every thing unless it be forcd upon him always the most indifferent share by this civility the best remains for others which being a compliment to all that are present every body is pleasd with it the more they love themselves the more they are forcd to approve of his behaviour and gratitude stepping in they are obligd almost whether they will or not to think favourably of him after this manner it is that the wellbred man insinuates himself in the esteem of all the companies he comes in and if he gets nothing else by it the pleasure he receives in reflecting on the applause which he knows is secretly given him is to a proud man more than an equivalent for his former selfdenial and overpays to selflove with interest the loss it sustaind in his complaisance to others if there are seven or eight apples or peaches among six people of ceremony that are pretty near equal he who is prevaild upon to choose first will take that which if there be any considerable difference a child would know to be the worst this he does to insinuate that he   looks upon those he is with to be of superior merit and that there is not one whom he wishes not better to than he does to himself tis custom and a general practice that makes this modish deceit familiar to us without being shockd at the    absurdity of it for if people had been used to speak from the sincerity of their hearts and act according to the natural sentiments they felt within till they were three or four and twenty it would be impossible for them to assist at this comedy of manners without either loud laughter or indignation and yet it is certain that sucha behaviour makes us more tolerable to one another than we could be otherwise it is very advantageous to the knowledge of our selves to be able well to distinguish between good qualities and virtues the bond of society exacts from every member a certain regard for others which the highest is not exempt from in the presence of the meanest even in an empire but when we are by our selves and so far removd from company as to be beyond the reach of their senses the words modesty and impudence lose their meaning a person may be wicked but he cannot be immodest while he is alone and no thought can be impudent that never was communicated to another a man of exalted pride may so hide it that no body shall be able to discover that he has any and yet receive greater satisfaction   from that passion than another who indulges himself in the declaration of it before all the world good manners have nothing to do with virtue or religion instead of extinguishing they rather inflame the passions the man of sense and education never exults more in his pride than when he hides it with the greatest dexterity  and in feasting on the applause which he is sure all good judges will pay to his behaviour he enjoys a pleasure altogether unknown to the shortsighted surly alderman that shews his haughtiness glaringly in his face pulls off his hat to no body and hardly deigns to speak to an inferior a man may carefully avoid every thing that in the eye of the world is esteemd to be the result of pride without mortifying himself or making the least  0 conquest of his passion it is possible that he only sacrifices the insipid outward part of his pride which none but silly ignorant people take delight in to that part we all feel within and which the men of the highest spirit and most exalted genius feed on with so much ecstacy in silence the pride of great and polite men is no where more conspicuous than in the debates about ceremony and precedency where they have an opportunity of giving their vices the appearance of virtues and can make the world believe that it a is their care their tenderness for the dignity of their office or the ho  nour of their masters what is the result of their own personal pride and vanity this is most manifest in all negotiations of ambassadors and plenipotentiaries and must be known by all that observe what is transacted at publick treaties and it will ever be true that men of the best taste have no relish in their pride as long as any mortal can find out that they are proud remark d remark d d for there was not a bee but b would get more i wont c say than he should but thandc page   line    the vast esteem we have of e our selves and the small value we have for others make us all very unfair judges in our own cases few men can be persuaded that they get too much by those they sell to how extraordinary soever their gains are when at the same time there is hardly a profit so inconsiderable but theyll grudge it to those they buy from for this reason the smallness of the sellers advantage being the greatest persuasive to the buyer    tradesmen are generally forcd to tell lies in their own defence and invent a thousand improbable stories rather than disco  ver what they really get by their commodities some old standers indeed that pretend to more honesty or what is more likely have more pride than their neighbours are used to make but few words with their customers and refuse to sell at a lower price than what they ask at first but these are commonly cunning foxes that are above the world and know that those who have money get often more by being surly than others by being obliging the vulgar imagine they can find more sincerity in the sour looks of a grave old fellow than there appears in the submissive air and inviting complacency of a young biginner but this is a grand mistake and if they are mercers drapers or others that have many sorts of the same commodity you may soon be satisfied look upon their goods and youll find each of them have their private marks which is a certain sign that both are equally careful in concealing the prime cost of what they sell  remark e remark e   e—— —— as your gamesters do who tho at fair play neer will own before the losers what theyve won page   line    this being a general practice which no body can be ignorant of that has ever seen any play there must be something in the make of man that is the occasion of it but as the searching into this will    seem very trifling to many i desire the reader to skip this remark unless he be in perfect good humour and has nothing at all to do that gamesters generally endeavour to conceal their gains before the losers seems to me to proceed from a mixture of gratitude pity and selfpreservation all men are naturally grateful while they receive a benefit and what they say or do while it affects and feels warm about them is real and comes from the heart but when that is over the returns we make generally proceed from virtue good manners reason and the thoughts of duty but not from gratitude which is a motive of the inclination if we consider how tyrannically the immoderate love we bear to our selves obliges   us to esteem every body that with or without design acts in our favour and how often we extend our affection to things inanimate when we imagine them to contribute to our present advantage if i say we consider this it will not be difficult to find out which way our being pleased with those whose money we win is owing to a principle of gratitude the next motive is our pity which proceeds from our consciousness of the vexation there is in losing and as we love the esteem of every body we are afraid of forfeiting theirs by being the cause of their loss lastly we apprehend their envy and so selfpreservation makes that we strive to extenuate first the obligation then the reason why we ought to pity in hopes that we shall have less of their illwill and envy when the passions shew themselves in their full strength they are known by every body when a man in power gives a great place to one that did him a small kindness in his youth we call it gratitude when a woman howls and wrings her hands at the loss of her child the prevalent passion is grief and the uneasiness we feel at the sight of great misfortunes as a mans breaking his legs a or    dashing his brains out is every where calld pity but the gentle strokes the slight touches of the passions are generally overlookd or mistaken   to prove my assertion we have but to observe what generally passes between the winner and the losera the first is always complaisant and if the other will but keep his temper more than ordinarily obliging he is ever ready to humour the loser and willing to rectify his mistakes with precaution and the height of good manners the loser is uneasy captious morose and perhaps swears and storms yet as long as he says or does nothing designedly affronting the winner takes all in good part without offending disturbing or contradicting him losers says the proverb must have leave to rail  all which shews that the loser is thought in the right to complain and for that veryb reason pityd that we are afraid of the losers illwill is plain from our being conscious that we are displeased with those we lose to and envy we always dread when we think our selves happier than others from whence it follows that when the winner endevours to conceal his gains his design is to avert the mischiefs he apprehends and this is selfpreservation the cares of which continue to affect us as long as the motives that first produced them remain but a month a week or perhaps a much shorter time after when the thoughts of the obligation and consequently the winners gratitude are worn off when the loser has recoverd his temper laughs at his loss   and the reason of the winners pity ceases when the winners apprehension of drawing upon him the illwill and envy of the loser is gone that is to say as soon as all the passions are over and the cares    of selfpreservation employ the winners thoughts no longer hell not only make no scruple of a owning what he has won but will if his vanity steps in likewise with pleasure brag of if not exaggerate his gains it is possible that when people play together who are at enmity and perhaps desirous of picking a quarrel or where men playing for trifles contend for superiority of skill and aim chiefly at the glory of conquest nothing shall happen of what i have been talking of different passions oblige us to take different measures what i have said i would have understood of ordinary play for money at which men endeavour to get and venture to lose what they value and even here i know it will be objected by many that tho they have been guilty of concealing their gains yet they never observd those passions which i alledge as the causes of that frailty which is no wonder because few men will give themselves leisure and fewer yet take the right method of examining themselves as they should do it is with the passions in men as it is with colours in cloth it is easy to know a red a green a blue a yellow a black c in 0 as many different places b but it must be an artist that can unravel all the various colours and their proportions that make up the compound of a wellmixd cloth in the same manner may the passions be discoverd by every body whilst they are distinct and a single one employs the whole man but it is very difficult to trace every motive of those actions that are the result of a mixture of passions    remark f remark f f and virtue who from politicks had learnd a thousand cunning tricks was by their happy influence made friends with vice —— page   line    it may be said that virtue is made friends with vice when industrious good people who maintain their families and bring up their children handsomely pay taxes and are several ways useful members of the society get a livelihood by something that chiefly depends on or is very much influencd by the vices of others without being themselves guilty of or accessary to them any otherwise than by way of trade as a druggist may be to poisoning or a swordcutler to bloodshed   thus the merchant that sends corn or cloth into foreign parts to purchase wines and brandies encourages the growth or manufactury of his own country he is a benefactor to navigation increases the customs and is many ways beneficial to the publick yet it is not to be denied but that his greatest dependence is lavishness and drunkenness for if none were to drink wine but such only as stand in need of it nor any body more than his health requird that multitude of winemerchants vintners coopers c that make such a considerable shew in this flourishing city would be in a miserable condition the same may be said not only of card and dicemakers that are the immediate ministers to a legion of vices but a of mercers upholsterers tailors and many others that would be starvd in half a years time if pride and luxury were at once to be banished the nation    remark g remark g   g the worst of all the multitude did something for the common good page   line    this i know will seem to be a strange paradox to many and i shall be askd what benefit the publick receives from thieves and housebreakers they are i own very pernicious to human society and every government ought to take all imaginable care to roota out and destroy them yet if all people were strictly honest and no body would meddle with or pry into any thing but his own half the smiths of the nation would want employment and abundance of workmanship which now serves for ornament as well as defence is to be seen every where both in town and country that would never have been thought of but to secure us against the attempts of pilferers and robbersb if what i have said be thought far fetchd and my assertion seems still a paradox i desire the reader to look upon the consumption of things and hell find that the laziest and most unactive the profligate and most mischievous are all forcd to do something for the common good and whilst their mouths are not   sowd up and they continue to wear and otherwise destroy what the industrious are daily employd about to make fetch and procure in spight of their teeth obligd to help maintain the poor and the publick charges the labour of millions would soon be at an end if there were not other millions as i say in the fable   —— —— —— employd   to see their handyworks destroyd     but men are not to be judgd by the consequences that may succeed their actions but the facts themselves and the motives which it shall appear they acted from if an illnaturd miser who is almost a plumb  and spends but fifty pounds a year tho he has no relation to inherit his wealth should be robbd of five hundred or a thousand guineas it is certain that as soon as this money should come to circulate the nation would be the better for the robbery and receive the same and as real a benefit from it as if an archbishop had left the same sum to the publick yet justice and the peace of the society require that he or they who robbd the miser should be hangd tho there were half a dozen of em concernd thieves and pickpockets steal for a livelihood and either what they can get honestly is not sufficient to keep them or else they have an aversion to constant working they   want to gratify their senses have victuals strong drink lewd women and to be idle when they please the victualler who entertains them and takes their money knowing which way they come at it is very near as great a villain as his guests but if he fleeces them well minds his business and is a prudent man he may get money and be punctual with them he deals with the trusty outclerk whose chief aim is his masters profit sends him in what beer he wants and takes care not to lose his custom while the mans money is good he thinks it no business of his to examine whom he gets it by in the mean time the wealthy brewer who leaves all the management to his servants knows nothing of the matter but keeps his coach treats his friends and enjoys his pleasure with ease and a good conscience he gets an estate builds houses and educates his children in plenty without ever thinking on the labour which wretches perform the shifts fools    make and the tricks knaves play to come at the commodity by the vast sale of which he amasses his great riches a highwayman having met with a considerable booty gives a poor common harlot he fancies ten pounds to newrig her from top to toe is there a spruce mercer so conscientious that he will refuse to sell her a thread sattin tho he knew who she was she must have shoes and stockings gloves the stay   and mantuamaker the sempstress the linen draper all must get something by her and a hundred different tradesmen dependent on those she laid her money out with may touch part of it before a month is at an end the generous gentleman in the mean time his money being near spent venturd again on the road but the second day having committed a robbery near highgate he was taken with one of his accomplices and the next sessions both were condemnd and sufferd the law the money due on their conviction fell to three country fellows on whom it was admirably well bestowd one was an honest farmer a sober painstaking man but reduced by misfortunes the summer before by the mortality among the cattle he had lost six cows out of ten and now his landlord to whom he owd thirty pounds had seizd on all his stock the other was a daylabourer who struggled hard with the world had a sick wife at home and several small children to provide for the third was a gentlemans gardener who maintaind his father in prison where being bound for a neighbour he had lain for twelve pounds almost a year and a half this act of filial duty was the more meritorious because he had for some time been engaged to a young woman whose parents livd in good circumstances but would not give their consent before our gardener had fifty guineas of his own   to shew they received above fourscore pounds each which extricated every one of them out of the    difficulties they laboured under and made them in their opinion the happiest people in the world nothing is more destructive either in regard to the health or the vigilance and industry of the poor than the infamous liquor the name of which derivd from junipera in dutch is now by frequent use and the laconick spirit of the nation from a word of middling length shrunk into a monosyllable  intoxicating gin that charms the unactive the desperate and crazyb of either sex and makes the starving sot behold his rags and nakedness with stupid indolence or banter both in senseless laughter and more insipid jests it is a fiery lake that sets the brain in flame burns up the entrails and scorches every part within and at the same time a lethe of oblivion in which the wretch immersd drowns his most pinching cares and with his reason all anxious reflexion on brats that cry for food hard winters frosts and horrid empty home in hot and adust  tempers it makes men quarrelsome renders em brutes and savages sets em on to fight for nothing and has often been the cause of murder it has broke and destroyd the strongest constitutions thrown em into consumptions and been the   fatal and immediate occasion of apoplexies phrensies and sudden death but as these latter mischiefs happen but seldom they might be overlookd and connivd at but this cannot be said of the many diseases that are familiar to the liquor and which are daily and hourly produced by it such as loss of appetite fevers black and yellow jaundice convulsions stone and gravel dropsies and leucophlegmacies among the doting admirers of this liquid poison  0 many of the meanest rank from a sincere affection to the commodity it self become dealers in it and take delight to help others to what they love themselves as whores commence bawds to make the profits of one trade subservient to the pleasures of the other but as these starvelings commonly drink more than their gains they seldom by selling mend the wretchedness of condition they labourd under while they were only buyers in the fagend and outskirts of the town and all places of the vilest resort its a sold in some part or other of almost every house frequently in cellars and sometimes in the garret the petty traders in this stygian comfort are supplydb by others in somewhat higher station that keep professd brandy shops and are as little to be envyd as the former and among the middling people i know not a more miserable shift for a livelihood thanc their calling whoever would thrive   in it must in the first place be of a watchful and suspicious as well as a bold and resolute temper that he may not be imposed upon by cheats and sharpers nor outbullyd by the oaths and imprecations of hackneycoachmen and footsoldiers in the second he ought to be a dabster at gross jokes and loud laughter and have all the winning ways to allure customers and draw out their money and be well versd in the low jests and ralleries the mob maked use of to banter prudence and frugality he must be affable and obsequious to the most despicable always ready and officious to help a porter down with his load shake hands with a basketwoman pull off his hat to an oysterwench and be familiar with a beggar with patience and good humour he must be able to endure the filthy actions and viler language of nasty drabs and the lewdest rakehells and without a frown or the least aversion bear with all the stench and squalor noise    and impertinence that the utmost indigence laziness and ebriety can produce in the most shameless and abandond vulgar the vast number of the shops i speak of throughout the city and suburbs are an astonishing evidence of the many seducers that in a lawful occupation are accessary to the introduction and increase of all the sloth sottishness want and misery which the abuse of strong waters is the immediate cause of to   lift above mediocrity perhaps half a score men that deal in the same commodity by wholesale while among the retailers tho qualifyd as i requird a much greater number are broke and ruind for not abstaining from the circean cup they hold out to others and the more fortunate are their whole lifetime obliged to take the uncommon pains endure the hardships and swallow all the ungrateful and shocking things i named for little or nothing beyond a bare sustenance and their daily bread the shortsighted vulgar in the chain of causes seldom can see further than one link but those who can enlarge their view and will give themselves the leisure of gazing on the prospect of concatenated events may in a hundred places see good spring up and pullulate from evil as naturally as chickens do from eggs the money that arises from the duties upon malt is a considerable part of the national revenue and should no spirits be distilld from it the publick treasure would prodigiously suffer on that head but if we would set in a true light the many advantages and large catalogue of solid blessings that accrue from and are owing to the evil i treat of we are to consider the rents that are received the ground that is tilld the tools that are made the cattle that are employd and above all the multitude of poor that are maintaind by the variety of la 0bour requireda in husbandry in malting in carriage and    distillation before we can have the a product of malt which we call low wines and is but the beginning from which the various spirits are afterwards to be made besides this a sharpsighted goodhumourd man might pick up abundance of good from the rubbish which i have all flung away for evil he would tell me that whatever sloth and sottishness might be occasiond by the abuse of maltspirits the moderate use of it was of inestimable benefit to the poor who could purchase no cordials of higher prices that it was an universal comfort not only in cold and weariness but most of the afflictions that are peculiar to the necessitous and had often to the most destitute supplyd the places of meat drink clothes and lodging that the stupid indolence in the most wretched condition occasiond by those composing draughts which i complaind of was a blessing to thousands for that certainly those were the happiest who felt the least pain as to diseases he would say that as it caused some so it cured others and that if the excess in those liquors had been sudden death to some few the habit of drinking them daily prolongd the lives of many whom once it agreed with that for the loss sustaind from the insignificant quarrels it created at home we were overpaid in the advantage we receivd from it abroad by upholding the   courage of soldiers and animating the sailors to the combat and that in the two last wars no considerable victory had been obtaind without to the dismal account i have given of the retailers and what they are forcd to submit to he would answer that not many acquired more than middling riches in any trade and that what i had counted so offensive and intolerable in the calling was trifling to those who were used to it that what seemd irksome and calamitous to some was delightful and often ravishing to others as men differd in circumstances    and education he would put me in mind that the profit of an employment ever made amends for the toil and labour that belongd to it nor forget dulcis odor lucri è re qualibet  or to tell me that the smell of gain was fragrant even to nightworkers if i should ever urge to him that to have here and there one great and eminent distiller was a poor equivalent for the vile means the certain want and lasting misery of so many thousand wretches as were necessary to raise them he would answer that of this i could be no judge because i dont know what vast benefit they might afterwards be of to the commonwealth perhaps would he say the man thus raisd will exert himself in the commission of the peace or other station with vigilance and zeal against the dissolute and   disaffected and retaining his stirring temper be as industrious in spreading loyalty and the reformation of manners throughout every cranny of the wide populous town as once he was in filling it with spirits till he becomes at last the scourge of whores of vagabonds and beggars the terrour of rioters and discontented rabbles and constant plague to sabbathbreaking butchers here my goodhumourd antagonist would exult and triumph over me especially if he could instance to me such a bright examplea what an uncommon blessing would he cry out is this man to his country how shining and illustrious his virtue to justify his exclamation he would demonstrate to me that it was impossible to give a fuller evidence of selfdenial in a grateful mind than to see him at the expence of his quiet and hazard of his life and limbs be always harassing and even for trifles persecuting that very class of men to whom he owes his fortune from no other motive than his aversion to idleness and great concern for religion and the publick welfare    remark h remark h   h parties directly opposite assist each other as twere for spight page  0 line   nothing was more instrumental in forwarding the reformation than the sloth and stupidity of the roman clergy yet the same reformation has rousd em from the laziness and ignorance they then labourd under and the followers of luther calvin and others may be said to have reformd not only those whom they drew in to their sentimenta but likewise those whob remaind their greatest opposers  the clergy of england by being severe upon the schismaticks and upbraiding them with want of learning have raised themselves such formidable enemies as are not easily answerd and again the dissenters by prying into the lives and diligently watching all the actions of their powerful antagonists render those of the establishd church more cautious of giving offence than in all probability they would if they had no malicious overlookers to fear it is very much owing to the great number of hugonots that have always been in france since the late utter extirpation of them  that that kingdom has a less dissolute and more learnd   clergy to boast of than any other roman catholick country the clergy of    that church are no where more sovereign than in italy and therefore no where more debauchd nor any where more ignorant than they are in spain because their doctrine is no where less opposd who would imagine that virtuous women unknowingly should be instrumental in promoting the advantage of prostitutes or what still seems the greater paradox that incontinence should be made serviceable to the preservation of chastity and yet nothing is more true a vicious young fellow after having been an hour or two at church a ball or any other assembly where there is a great parcel of handsome women dressd to the best advantage will have his imagination more fired than if he had the same time been poling at guildhall  or walking in the country among a flock of sheep the consequence of this is that hell strive to satisfy the appetite that is raised in him and when he finds honest women obstinate and uncomatable  tis very natural to think that hell hasten to others that are more compliable who woud so much as surmise that this is the fault of the virtuous women they have no thoughts of men in dressing themselves poor souls and endeavour only to appear clean and decent every one according to her qualitya   i am far from encouraging vice and think it would be an unspeakable felicity to a state if the sin of uncleanness could be utterly banishd from it but i am afraid it is impossible the passions of some people are too violent to be curbd by any law or precept and it is wisdom in all governments to bear with lesser inconveniences to prevent greater if courtezans and strumpets were to be prosecuted    with as much rigour as some silly people would have it what locks or bars would be sufficient to preserve the honour of our wives and daughters for tis not only that the women in general would meet with far greater temptations and the attempts to ensnare the innocence of virgins would seem more excusable even to the sober part of mankind than they do now but some men would grow outrageous and ravishing would become a common crime where six or seven thousand sailors arrive at once as it often happens at amsterdam that have seen none but their own sex for many months together how is it to be supposd that honest women should walk the streets unmolested if there were no harlots to be had at reasonable pricesa for which reason the wise rulers of that wellorderd city always tolerate an uncertain number of houses in which women are hired as publickly as horses at a liverystable and there being in this toleration a great deal of   prudence and oeconomy to be seen a short account of it will be no tiresome digression in the first place the houses i speak of are allowed to be no where but in the most slovenly and unpolishd part of the town where seamen and strangers of no repute chiefly lodge and resort the street in which most of them stand is counted scandalous and the infamy is extended to all the neighbourhood round it in the second they are only places to meet and bargain in to make appointments in order to promote interviews of greater secrecy and no manner of lewdness is ever sufferd to be transacted in them which order is so strictly observd that bar the ill manners and noise of the company that frequent them youll meet with no more indecency and generally less lasciviousness there than with us are to be seen at a playhouse thirdly theb female traders that come to these evening exchanges are    always the scum of the people and generally such as in the day time carry fruit and other eatables about in wheelbarrows the habits indeed they appear in at night are very different from their ordinary ones yet they are commonly so ridiculously gay that they look more like the roman dresses of stroling actresses  than gentlewomens clothes if to this you add the aukwardness the hard hands and course breeding of the damsels that wear them there is no great reason to fear that many of   the better sort of people will be tempted by them the musick in these temples of venus is performed by organs  not out of respect to the deity that is worshipd in them but the frugality of the owners whose business it is to procure as much sound for as little money as they can and the policy of the government who endeavour a as little as is possible to encourage the breed of pipers and scrapers all seafaring men especially the dutch are like the element they belong to much given to loudness and roaring and the noise of half a dozen of them when they call themselves merry is sufficient to drown twice the number of flutes or violins whereas with one pair of organs they can make the whole house ring and are at no other charge than the keeping of one scurvy musician which can cost them but little yet notwithstanding the good rules and strict discipline that are observd in these markets of love    the schout  and his officers are always vexing mulcting and upon the least complaint removing the miserable keepers of them which policy is of two great uses first it gives an opportunity to a large parcel of officers the magistrates make use of on many occasions and which they could not be without to squeeze a living out of the immoderate gains accruing from the worst of employments and at the same time punish those necessary profli  gates the bawds and panders which tho they abominate they desire yet not wholly to destroy secondly as on several accounts it might be dangerous to let the multitude into the secret that those houses and the trade that is drove in them are connivd at so by this means appearing unblameable the wary magistrates preserve themselves in the good opinion of the weaker sort of people who imagine that the government is always endeavouring tho unable to suppress what it actually tolerates whereas if they had a mind to rout them out their power in the administration of justice is so sovereign and extensive and they know so well how to have it executed that one week nay one night might send them all a packing in italy the toleration of strumpets is yet more barefacd as is evident from their publick stews at venice and naples impurity is a kind of merchandize and traffick the courtezans at rome and the cantoneras in spain compose a body in the state and are under a legal tax and impost tis well known that the reason why so many good politicians as these tolerate lewd houses is not their irreligion but to prevent a worse evil an impurity of a more execrable kind and to provide for the safety of women of honour about two hundred and fifty years ago says monsieur de st didier  venice being in want of    courtezans the repub  lick was obliged to procure a great number from foreign parts doglioni  who has written the memorable affairs of venice highly extols the wisdom of the republick in this point which secured the chastity of women of honour daily exposed to publick violences the churches and consecrated places not being a sufficient azylum for their chastity  our universities in england are much belyd if in some colleges there was not a monthly allowance ad expurgandos renes  and time was when the monks and priests in germany were allowd concubines on paying a certain yearly duty to their prelate tis  00 generally believd says monsieur bayle  to whom i owe the last paragraph a that avarice was the cause of this shameful indulgence but it is more probable their design was to prevent their tempting modest women and to quiet the uneasiness of husbands whose resentments the clergy do well to avoid from what has been said it is manifest that there is a necessity of sacrificing one part of womankind to preserve the other and prevent a filthiness of a more heinous nature from whence i think i may justly conclude what was the seeming paradox i went about to prove that chastity may be supported by incontinence and the best of virtues want the assistance of the worst of vices remark i remark i  00i the root of evil avarice that damnd illnaturd baneful vicewas slave to prodigality page  0 line   i have joined so many odious epithets to the word avarice in compliance to the vogue of mankind who generally bestow more ill language upon this than upon any other vice and indeed not undeservedly for there is hardly a mischief to be named which it has not produced at one time or other but the true reason why every body exclaims so much against it is that almost every body suffers by it for the more the money is hoarded up by some the scarcer it must  0  grow among the rest and therefore when men rail very much at misers there is generally selfinterest at bottom as there is no living without money so those that are unprovided and have no body to give them any are obligd to do some service or other to the society before they can come at it but every body esteeming his labour as he does himself which is generally not under the value most people that want money only to spend it again presently imagine they do more for it than it is worth men cant  0 forbear looking upon the necessaries of life as their due whether they work or not because they find that nature without consulting whether they have victuals or not bids them eat whenever they are hungry for which reason every body endeavours to get what he wants with as much ease as he can and therefore when men find that the trouble they are put to in getting money is either more or less according as those they would have it from are more or less tenacious it is very natural for them to be angry at covetousness in general for it obliges them either to go without what they have occasion for or else to take greater pains for it than they are willing avarice notwithstanding it is the occasion of so many evils is yet very necessary to the society to glean and gather what has been dropt and scatterd by the contrary vice was it not for avarice spendthrifts would soon want materials and if none would lay up and get faster than they spend very few could spend faster than they get that it is a slave to prodigality as i have calld it is evident from so many misers as we daily see toil and labour pinch and starve themselves to enrich a lavish heir tho these two vices appear very opposite yet they often assist each other florio is an extravagant young blade of a very profuse temper as he is the only son of a very rich father he wants to live high  0 keep horses and dogs  0  and throw his money about as he sees some of his companions do but the old hunks will part with no money and hardly allows him necessaries florio would have borrowd money upon his own credit long ago but as all would be lost if he died before his father no prudent man would lend him any at last he has met with the greedy cornaro who lets him have money at thirty per cent and now florio thinks himself happy and spends a thousand a year where would cornaro ever have got such a prodigious interest if it was not for such a fool as florio who will give so great a price for money to fling it away and how would florio get it to spend if he had not lit of such a greedy usurer as cornaro whose excessive covetousness makes him overlook the great risque he runs in venturing such great sums upon the life of a wild debauchee avarice is no longer the reverse of profuseness than while it signifies that sordid love of money and narrowness of soul that hinders misers from parting with what they have and makes them covet it only to hoard up but there is a sort of avarice which consists in a greedy desire of riches in order to spend them and this often meets with prodigality in the same persons as is evident in most courtiers and great officers both civil and military in their buildings and  0 furniture equipages and entertainments their gallantry is displayd with the greatest profusion while the base actions they submit to for lucre and the many frauds and impositions they are guilty of discover the utmost avarice this mixture of contrary vices comes up exactly to the character of catiline of whom it is said that he was appetens alieni  sui profusus  greedy after the goods of others and lavish of his own  0  remark k remark k k that noble sin —— —— page  0 line    the prodigality i call a noble sin is not that which has avarice for its companion and makes men unreasonably profuse to some of what they unjustly extort from others but that agreeable goodnaturd vice that makes the chimneya smoke and all the tradesmen smile i mean the unmixd prodigality of heedless and voluptuous men that being educated in plenty abhor the vile thoughts of lucre and lavish away only what others took pains to scrape together such as indulge their inclinations at their own expence that have the continual satisfaction of bartering old gold for new pleasures and from the excessive largeness of a diffusive  0 soul are made guilty of despisingb too much what most people overvalue when i speak thus honourably of this vice and treat it with so much tenderness and good manners as i do i have the same thing at heart that made me give so many ill names to the reverse of it viz the interest of the publick for as the avaricious does no good to himself and is injurious to all the world besides except his heir so the prodigal is a blessing to the whole society and injures no body but himself it is true that as most of the first are knaves so the latter are all fools yet they are delicious morsels for the publick to feast on and may with as much justice as the french call the monks the partridges of the women be styled the woodcocks of the society was it not for prodigality nothing could make us amends for the rapine and extortion of avarice in power when a covetous statesman is  0  gone who spent his whole life in fatning himself with the spoils of the nation and had by pinching and plundering heapd up an immense treasure it ought to fill every good member of the society with joy to behold the uncommon profuseness of his son this is refunding to the publick what was robbd from it resuming of grants is a barbarous way of stripping and it is ignoble to ruin a man faster than he does it himself when he sets about it in such good earnest does he not feed an infinite  0 number of dogs of all sorts and sizes tho he never hunts keepa more horses than any nobleman in the kingdom tho he never rides em and give as large an allowance to an illfavourd whore as would keep a dutchess tho he never lies with her is he not still more extravagant in those things he makes use of therefore let him alone or praise him call him publickspirited lord nobly bountiful and magnificently generous and in ab few years hell suffer himself to be stript his own way as long as the nation has its own back again we ought not to quarrel with the manner in which the plunder is repayd abundance of moderate men i know that are enemies to extremes will tell me that frugality might happily supply the place of the two vices i speak of that if men had not so many profuse ways of spending wealth they would not be tempted to so many evil practices to scrape it together and consequently that the same number of men by equally avoiding both extremes might render themselves more happy and be less vicious without than they could with them whoever argues thusc shews himself a better man than he is a politician frugality is like honesty a mean starving virtue that is only fit for small societies of good peaceable men who are contented to be poor so they may be easy but in a large stirring nation you may have soon enough of it tis an idle  0 dreaming  0  virtue that employs no hands and therefore very useless in a trading country where there are vast numbers that one way or other must be all set to work prodigality has a thousand inventions to keep people from sitting still that frugality would never think of and as this must consume a prodigious wealth so avarice again knows innumerable tricks to rake it together which frugality would scorn to make use of authors are always allowd to compare small things to great ones especially if they ask leave first si licet exemplis c but to compare great things to mean trivial ones is unsufferable unless it be in burlesque otherwise i would compare the body politick i confess the simile is very low  to a bowl of punch  avarice should be the souring and prodigality the sweetning of it the water i would call the ignorance folly and credulity of the floating insipid multitude while wisdom honour fortitude and the rest of the sublime qualities of men which separated by art from the dregs of nature the fire of glory has exalted and refind into a spiritual essence should be an equivalent to brandy i dont doubt but a westphalian laplander or any other dull stranger that is unacquainted with the wholesom composition if he was to tastea the several ingredients apart would think it impossible they should make any tolerable liquor the li 0 mons would be too sour the sugar too luscious the brandy hell say is too strong ever to be drank in any quantity and the water hell call a tasteless liquor only fit for cows and horses yet experience teaches us that the  0  ingredients i named judiciously mixta will make an excellent liquor likd of and admird by men of exquisite palates as to our twob vices in particular i could compare avarice that causes so much mischief and is complained of by every body who is not a miser to a griping acid that sets our teeth on edge and is unpleasant to every palate that is not debauchd i could compare the gawdy trimming and splendid equipage of a profuse beau to the glistningc brightness of the finest loaf sugar for as the one by correcting the sharpness preventsd the injuries which a gnawing sour might do to the bowels so the other is a pleasing balsam that heals and makes amends for the smart which the multitude always suffers from the gripes of the avaricious while the substances of both melt away alike and they consume themselves by being beneficial to the several compositions they belong to i could carry on the simile as to proportions and the exact nicety to be observed in them which would make it appear how little any of the ingredients could be spared in either of the mixtures but i will not tire my reader by pursuing too far a ludicrous comparison when  0 i have other matters to entertain him with of greater importance and to sum up what i have said in this and the foregoing remark shall only add that i look upon avarice and prodigality in the society as i do upon two contrary poisons in physick of which it is certain that the noxious qualities being by mutual mischief corrected in both they may assist each other and often make a good medicine between them   0  remark l remark l l —— —— —— while luxury employd a million of the poorc  page  0 line    if every thing is to be luxury as in strictness it ought that is not immediately necessary to make man subsist as he is a living creature there is nothing else to be found in the world no not even among the naked savages of which it is not probable that there are any but what by this time have made some improvements upon their former manner of living and either in the preparation of their eatables the ordering of their huts or otherwise added something to what once sufficed them this definition every body will say is too rigorous i am of the same opinion but if we are to abate  0 one inch of this severity i am afraid we shant know where to stop when people tell us they only desire to keep themselves sweet and clean there is no understanding what they would be at if they made use of these words in their genuine proper literal sense they might soon be satisfyd without much cost or trouble if they did not want water but these two little adjectives are so comprehensive especially in the dialect of some ladies that no body can guess how far they may be stretcht the comforts of life are likewise so various  0  and extensive that no body can tell what people mean by them except he knows what sort of life they lead the same obscurity i observe in the words decency and conveniency and i never understand them unless i am acquainted with the quality of the persons that make use of them people may go to church together and be all of one mind as much as they please i am apt to believe that when they pray for their daily bread the bishop includes several things in that petition which the sexton does not think on by what i have said hitherto i would only shew that if once we depart from calling every thing luxury that is not absolutely necessary to keep a man alive that then there is no luxury at all for if the wants of men are innumerable then what ought to supply them has no bounds what is calld superfluous to some degree of   0people will be thought requisite to those of higher quality and neither the world nor the skill of man can produce any thing so curious or extravagant but some most gracious sovereign or other if it either eases or diverts him will reckon it among the necessaries of life not meaning every bodys life but that of his sacred person it is a receivd notion that luxury is as destructive to the wealth of the whole body politic as it is to that of every individual person who is guilty of it and that a national frugality enriches a country in the same manner as that which is less general increases the estates of private families  i confess that tho  0  i have found men of much better understanding than my self of this opinion i cannot help dissenting from them in this point they argue thus we send say they for example to turkey of woollen manufactury and other things of our own growth a millionsa worth every year for this we bring back silk mohair drugs c to the value of twelve hundred thousand pounds that are all spent in our own country by this say they we get nothing but if most of us would be content with our own growth and so consume but half the quantity of those foreign commodities then those in turkey who would still want the same quantity of our manufactures would be forcd to pay ready money for    the rest and so by the balance of that trade only the nation should get six hundred thousand pounds per annum    0 to examine the force of this argument well suppose what they would have that but half the silk c     shall be consumed in england of what there is now well suppose likewise that those in turkey tho we refuse to buy above half as much of their commodities as we used to do either can or will not be without the same quantity of our manufactures they had before and that theyll pay the balance in money that is to say that they shall give us as much gold or silver as the value of what they buy from us exceeds the value of what we buy from them tho what we suppose might perhaps be done for one year it is impossible it should last buying is bartering and no nation can buy goods of others that has none of her own to purchase them with spain and portugal that are yearly supplyd with new gold and silver from their mines may for ever buy for ready money as long as their yearly increase of gold or silver continues but then money is their growth and the commodity of the country we know that we could not continue long to purchase the goods of other nations if they would not take our manufactures in payment for them and why should we judge otherwise of other nations if those in turkey then had no more money fall from    the skies than we let us see what would be the consequence of what we supposed the six hundred thousand pounds in silk mohair c that are left upon their hands the first     year must make those commodities fall considerably of this the dutch and french will reap the benefita as much as our selves and if we continue to refuse taking their commodities in payment for our manufactures they can trade no longer with us but must content themselves with buying what they want of such nations as are willing to take what we refuse tho their goods are much worse than ours and thus our commerce with turkey must in few years be infallibly lost  but theyll say perhaps that to prevent the ill consequence i have shewd we shallb take the turkish merchandizes as formerly and only bec so frugal as to consume but half the quantity of them our selves and send the rest abroad to be sold to others let us see what this will do and whether it will enrich the nation by the balance of that trade with six hundred thousand pounds in the first place ill grant them that our people at home making use of so much more of our own manufactures those who were employd in silk mohair c will get a living by the various preparations of woollen goods but in the second i cannot allow that the goods can be sold as formerly for suppose the half that is wore at home to be sold at the same rate    as before certainly the other half that is sent abroad will want very much of it for we must send those goods to markets already supplyd and besides that there must be freight insurance provision and all other charges deducted and the merchants in general must lose much more by this half that is reshippd than they got by the half that is consumed here for tho the woollen manufactures are our own product yet they stand     the merchant that ships them off to foreign countries in as much as they do the shopkeeper here that retails them so that if the returns for what he sends abroad repay him not what his goods cost him here with all other charges till he has the money and a good interest for it in cash the merchant must run out and the upshot would be that the merchants in general finding they lost by the turkish commodities they senta abroad would ship no more of our manufactures than what would pay for as much silk mohair cb as would be consumed here other nations would soon find ways to supply them with as much as we should send short and some where or other to dispose of the goods we should refuse so that all we should get by this frugality would be that those in turkey would take but half the quantity of our manufactures of what they do now while we encourage and wear their    merchandizes without which they are not able to purchase ours as i have had the mortification for several years to meet with abundance of sensible people against this opinion and who always thought me wrong in this calculation so i had the pleasure at last to see the wisdom of the nation fall into the same sentiments as is so manifest from an act of parliament made in the year       where the legislature disobliges a     powerful and valuable company  and overlooks very weighty inconveniences at home to promote the     interest of the turkey trade and not only encourages the consumption of silk and mohair but forces the subjects on penalties to make use of them whether they will or nota what is laid to the charge of luxury besides is that it increases avarice and rapine and where they are reigning vices offices of the greatest trust are bought and sold the ministers that should serve the publick both great and small corrupted and the countriesb every moment in danger of being betrayd to the highest biddersc and lastly that it effeminates and enervates the people by which the nations become an easy prey to the first invaders these are indeed terrible things but what is put to the account of luxury belongs to maleadministration and is the fault of bad politicks every government ought    to be thoroughly acquainted with and stedfastly to     pursue the interest of the country good politicians by dextrous management laying heavy impositions on some goods or totally prohibiting them and lowering the duties on others may always turn and divert the course of trade which way they please and as theyll ever prefer if it be equally considerable the commerce with such countries as can pay with money as well as goods to those that can make no returns for what they buy but in the commodities of their own growth and manufacturesa so they will always carefully prevent the traffick with such nations as refuse the goods of others and will take nothing but money for their own but above all theyll keep a watchful eye over the balance of trade in general and never suffer that all the foreign commodities together that are imported in one year shall exceed in value what of their own growth or manufacture is in the same exported to others note that i speak now of the interest of those nations that have no gold or silver of their own growth otherwise this maxim need not to be so much insisted on if what i urgd last be but diligently lookd after and the imports are never allowd to be superior to the exports no nation can ever be impoverishd by foreign luxury and they may improve it as much as they please if they    can but in proportion raise the fund of their own that is to purchase itb trade is the principal but not the only requisite to aggrandize a nation there are other things to be taken care of besides the meum and tuum  must be securd crimes punishd and all other laws concerning the administration of justice wisely contrivd and strictly executed foreign affairs must be likewise prudently managd and the ministry of every     nation ought to have a good intelligence abroad and be well acquainted with the publick transactions of all those countries that either by their neighbourhood strength or interest may be hurtful or beneficial to them to take the necessary measures accordingly of crossing some and assisting others as policy and the balance of power direct the multitude must be awd no mans conscience forcd and the clergy allowd no greater share in state affairs than our saviour has bequeathed them in his testament these are the arts that lead to worldly greatness what sovereign power soever makes a good use of them that has any considerable nation to govern whether it be a monarchy a commonwealth or a mixture of both can never fail of making it flourish in spight of all the other powers upon earth and no luxury or other vice is ever able to shake their constitution—but here i expect a fullmouthd cry against me what    has god never punishd and destroyd great nations for their sins yes but not without means by infatuating their governors and suffering them to depart from either all or some of those general maxims i have mentioned and of all the famous states and empires the world has had to boast of hitherto none ever came to ruin whose destruction was not principally owing to the bad politicks neglects or mismanagements of the rulers there is no doubt but more health and vigour is to be expected among a people and their offspring from temperance and sobriety than there is from gluttony and drunkenness yet i confess that as to luxurys effeminating and enervating a nation i have not such frightful notions now as i have had formerly when we hear or read of things which we are altogether strangers to they commonly bring to our imagination such ideas of what we have seen as according to our apprehension must come the nearest to them and i remember that when i have read     of the luxury of persia egypt and other countries where it has been a reigning vice and that were effeminated and enervated by it it has sometimes put me in mind of the cramming and swilling of ordinary tradesmen at a city feast and the beastlinessa their overgorging themselves is often attended with at other times it has made me think on the distraction of dissolute sailors as i    had seen them in company of half a dozen lewd women roaring along with fiddles before them and was i to have been carried into any of their great cities i would have expected to have found one third of the people sick abed with surfeits another laid up with the gout or crippled by a more ignominious distemper and the rest that could go without leading walk along the streets in petticoats it is happy for us to have fear for ab keeper as long as our reason is not strong enough to govern our appetites and i believe that the great dread i had more particularly against the word to enervate and some consequent thoughts on the etymology of it did me abundance of good when i was a schoolboy but since i have seen something of the world the consequences of luxury to a nation seem not so dreadful to me as they did as long as men have the same appetites the same vices will remain in all large societies some will love whoring and others drinking the lustful that can get no handsome clean women will content themselves with dirty drabs and those that cannot purchase true hermitage or pontack will be glad of more ordinary french claret those that cant reach wine take up with worsec liquors and a foot soldier or a beggar may make himself as drunk with stalebeer or maltspirits as a lord with burgundy champaignd or tockaye    the cheapest and most slovenly way of indulging our passions      does as much mischief to a mans constitution as the most elegant and expensive the greatest excesses of luxury are shewn ina buildings furniture equipages and clothes clean linen weakens a man no more than flannel tapistry fine painting or good wainscot are no more unwholesom than bare walls and a rich couch or a gilt chariot are no more enervating than the cold floor or a country cart the refind pleasures of men of sense are seldom injurious to their constitution and there are many great epicures that will refuse to eat or drink more than their heads or stomachs can bear sensual people may take as great care of themselves as any and the errors of the most viciously luxurious dont so much consist in the frequent repetitions of their lewdness and their eating and drinking too much which are the things which would most enervate them as they do in the operose contrivances the profuseness and nicety they are servd with and the vast expence they are at in their tables and amours but let us once suppose that the ease and pleasures the grandees and the rich people of every great nation live in render them unfit to endure hardships and undergo the toils of war ill allow that most of the common council of the city would make but very in  0different footsoldiers and i believe heartily that if your horse was to be composd of aldermen and such as most of them are a small artillery of squibs would be sufficient to rout them but what have the aldermen the commoncouncil or indeed all people of any substance to do with the war but to pay taxes the hardships and fatigues of war that are personally sufferd fall upon them that bear the brunt of every thing the meanest indigent part of the nation the working slaving people for how excessive soever the plenty and   0 luxury of a nation may be some body must do the work houses and ships must be built merchandizes must be removd and the ground tilld such a variety of labours in every great nation requirea a vast multitude in which there are always loose idle extravagant fellows enough to spare for an army and those that are robust enough to hedge and ditch plow and thrash or else not too much enervated to be smiths carpenters sawyers clothworkers porters or carmen will always be strong and hardy enough in a campaign or two to make good soldiers who where good orders are kept have seldom so much plenty and superfluity come to their share as to do them any hurt the mischief then to be feard from luxury among the people of war cannot extend it    self beyond the officers the greatest of them are either men of a very high birth and princely education or else extraordinary parts and no less experience and whoever is made choice of by a wise government to command an army en chef should have a consummate knowledge in martial affairs intrepidityb to keep him calm in the midst of danger and many other qualifications that must be the work of time and application on men of a quick penetration a distinguishd genius and a world of honour strong sinews and supple joints are trifling advantages not regarded in persons of their reach and grandeur that can destroy cities abedc and ruin whole countries while they are at dinner as they are most commonly men of great age it would be ridiculous to expect a hale constitution and agility of limbs from them so their heads be but active and well furnished tis no great matter what the rest of their bodies are if they cannot bear the fatigue of being on horseback they may ride in coaches or be carried in litters mens conduct and sagacity are never the less for their being cripples     and the best general the king of france has now can hardly crawl along  those that are immediately under the chief commanders must be very nigh of the same abilities and are generally men that have raisd themselves to those posts by their merit the other officers are all of them    in their several stations obliged to lay out so large a share of their pay in fine clothes accoutrements and other things by the luxury of the times calld necessary that they can spare but little money for debauches for as they are advanced and their salaries raisd so they are likewise forced to increase their expences and their equipages which as well as every thing else must still be proportionable to their quality by which means the greatest part of them are in a manner hindred from those excesses that might be destructive to health while their luxury thus turnd another way serves moreover to heighten their pride and vanity the greatest motives to make them behave themselves like what they would be thought to be see remark ra there is nothing refines mankind more than love and honour those two passions are equivalent to many virtues and therefore the greatest schools of breeding and good manners are courts and armies the first b to accomplish the women the other to polish the men what the generality of officers among civilizd nations affect is a perfect knowledge of the world and the rules of honour an air of frankness and humanity peculiar to military men of experience and such a mixture of modesty and undauntedness as may bespeak them both courteous and valiant where good sense is fashionable and a genteel behaviour is in esteem    gluttony and     drunkenness can be no reigning vices what officers of distinction chiefly aim at is not a beastly but a splendid way of living and the wishes of the most luxurious in their several degrees of quality are to appear handsomely and excel each other in finery of equipage politeness of entertainments and the reputation of a judicious fancy in every thing about them but if there should be more dissolute reprobates among officers than there are among men of other professions which is not true yet the most debauchd of them may be very serviceable if they have but a great share of honour it is this that covers and makes up for a multitude of defects in them and it is this that none how abandond soever they are to pleasure dare pretend to be without but as there is no argument so convincing as matter ofa fact let us look back on what so lately happend in our two last wars with france  how many puny young striplings have we had in our armies tenderly educated nice in their dress and curious in their diet that underwent all manner of duties with gallantry and chearfulness those that have such dismal apprehensions of luxurys enervating and effeminating people might in flanders and spain have seen embroiderd beaux with fine lacd shirts and powderd wigs stand as much fire and lead    up to the mouth of a cannon with as little concern as it was possible for the most stinking slovens to have done in their own hair tho it had not been combd in a monthb and met with abundance of wild rakes who had actually impaird their healths and broke their constitutions with     excesses of wine and women that yet behavd themselves with conduct and bravery against their enemies robustness is the least thing requird in an officer and if sometimes strength is of use a firm resolution of mind which the hopes of preferment emulation and the love of glory inspire them with will at a push supply the place of bodily force those that understand their business and have a sufficient sense of honour as soon as they are used to danger will always be capable officers and their luxury as long as they spend no bodys money but their own will never be prejudicial to a nation by all which i think i have proved what i designd in this remark on luxury first that in one sense every thing may be calld so and in another there is no such thing secondly that with a wise administration all people may swim in as much foreign luxury as their product can purchase without being impoverishd by it and lastly that where military affairs are taken care of as they ought and the soldiers well paid and kept in good dis   cipline a wealthy nation may live in all the ease and plenty imaginable and in many parts of it shew as much pomp and delicacy as human wit can invent and at the same time be formidable to their neighbours and come up to the character of the bees in the fable of which i said that   flatterd in peace and feard in wars   they were tha esteem of foreigners   and lavish of their wealth and lives   the balance of all other hives  see what is fartherb said concerning luxury in the remarks m and qc     remark m remark m m and odious pride a million more page  0 line    pride is that natural faculty by which every mortal that has any understanding overvalues and imagines better things of himself than any impartial judge thoroughly acquainted with all his qualities and circumstances could allow him we are possessd of no other quality so beneficial to society and so necessary to render it wealthy and flourishing as this yet it is that which is most gene   rally detested what is very peculiar to this faculty of ours is that those who are the fullest of it are the least willing to connive at it in others whereas the heinousness of other vices is the most extenuated by those who are guilty of em themselves the chaste man hates fornication and drunkenness is most abhorrd by the temperate but none are so much offended at their neighbours pride as the proudest of all and if any one can pardon it it is the most humble from which i think we may justly infer that ita being odious to all the world is a certain sign that all the world is troubled with it  this all men of sense are ready to confess and no body denies but that he has pride in general but if you come to particulars youll meet with few that will own any action you can name of theirs to have proceeded from that principle there are likewise many who will allow that among the sinful nations of the times pride and luxury are the great promoters of trade but they refuse to own the necessity there is that in a more virtuous age such a one as should be free from pride trade would in a great measure decay     the almighty they saya has endowd us with the dominion over all things which the earth and sea produce or contain there is nothing to be found in either but what was made for the use of man and his skill and industry    above other animals were given him that he might render both them and every thing else within the reach of his senses more serviceable to him upon this consideration they think it impious to imagine that humility temperance and other virtues should debar people from the enjoyment of those comforts of life which are not denied to the most wicked nations and so conclude that without pride or luxury the same things might be eat wore and consumed the same number of handicrafts and artificers employd and a nation be every way as flourishing as where those vices are the most predominant as to wearing apparel in particular theyll tell you that pride which sticks much nearer to us than our clothes is only lodgd in the heart and that rags often conceal a greater portion of it than the most pompous attire and that as it cannot be denied but that there have always been virtuous princes who with humble hearts have wore their splendid diadems and swayd their envied scepters void of ambitionb for the good of others so it is very probable that silver and gold brocades and the richest embroideries may without a thought of pride be wore by many whose quality and fortune are suitable to them may not say they a good man of extraordinary revenues make every year a greater variety of suits than    it is possible he should wear out and yet have no other ends than to set the poor at work to encourage trade and by employing many to promote the welfare of his country and considering food and raiment to be necessaries and the two chief articles to which all our worldly cares are extended why     may not all mankind set aside a considerable part of theira income for the one as well as the other without the least tincture of pride nay is not every member of the society in a manner obliged according to his ability to contribute toward the maintenance of that branch of trade on which the whole has so great a dependence besides that to appear decently is a civility and often a duty which without any regard to our selves we owe to those we converse with these are the objections generally made use of by haughty moralists who cannot endure to hear the dignity of their species arraignd but if we look narrowly into them they may soon be answered if we had nob vices i cannot see why any man should ever make more suits than he has occasion for tho he wasc never so desirous of promoting the good of the nation for tho in the wearing of a wellwrought silk rather than a slight stuff and the preferring curious fine cloth to coarse he had no other view but the setting of more people to work and consequent   ly the publick welfare yet he could consider clothes no otherwise than lovers of their country do taxes now they may pay em with alacrity but no body gives more than his due especially where all are justly rated according to their abilities as it could no otherwise be expected in a very virtuous age besides that in such golden times no body would dress above his condition no body pinch his family cheat or overreach his neighbour to purchase finery and consequently there would not be half the consumption nor a third part of the people employd as now there are but to make this more plain and demonstrate that for the support of trade there can be nothing equivalent to pride i shall examine the several views men have in outward apparel and set forth what daily experience may teach every body as to dress     clothes were originally made for two ends to hide our nakedness and to fence our bodies against the weather and other outward injuries to these our boundless pride has added a third which is ornament for what else but an excess of stupid vanity could have prevaild upon our reason to fancy that ornamental which must continually put us in mind of our wants and misery beyond all other animals that are ready clothed by nature herself it is indeed to be admired how so sensible a creature as man that pretends   0to so many fine qualities of his own should condescend to value himself upon what is robbd from so innocent and defenceless an animal as a sheep or what he is beholdena for to the most insignificant thing upon earth a dying worm yet while he is proud of such trifling depredations he has the folly to laugh at the hottentots on the furthest promontory of africk who adorn themselves with the guts of their dead enemies  without considering that they are the ensigns of their valour those barbarians are fine with the true spolia opima and that if their pride be more savage than ours it is certainly less ridiculous because they wear the spoils of the more noble animal but whatever reflexions may be made on this head the world has long since decided the matter handsome apparel is a main point fine feathers make fine birds and people where they are not known are generally honourd according to their clothes and other accoutrements they have about them from the richness of them we judge of their wealth and by their ordering of them we guess at their understanding      it is this which encourages every body who is conscious of his little merit if he is any ways able to wear clothes above his rank especially in large and populous cities where obscure men may hourly meet with fifty strangers to one acquaintance and consequently have the     pleasure of being esteemd by a vast majority not as what they are but what they appear to be which is a greater temptation than most people want to be vain whoever takes delight in viewing the various scenes of low life may on easter whitsuna and other great holidays meet with scores of people especially women of almost the lowest rank that wear good and fashionable clothes if coming to talk with them you treat them more courteously and with greater respect than what they are conscious they deserve theyll commonly be ashamed of owning what they are and often you may if you are a little inquisitive discover in them a most anxious care to conceal the business they follow and the places they live in the reason is plain while they receive those civilities that are not usually paid them and which they think only due to their betters they have the satisfaction to imagine that they appear what they would be which to weak minds is a pleasure almost as substantial as they could reap from the very accomplishments of their wishes this golden dream they are unwilling to be disturbed in and being sure that the meanness of their condition if it is known must sink em very low in your opinion they hug themselves in their disguise and take all imaginable precaution not to forfeit by a useless discovery the esteem which they flatter themselves    that their good clothes have drawn from you tho every body allows that as to apparel and manner of living we ought to behave our selves suitable to our conditions and follow the examples of the most sensible and prudent among our equals in rank     and fortune yet how few that are not either miserably covetous or else proud of singularity have this discretion to boast of we all look above our selves and as fast as we can strive to imitate those that some way or other are superior to us the poorest labourers wife in the parish who scorns to wear a strong wholesom frize as she might will half starve her self and her husband to purchase a secondhand gown and petticoat that cannot do hera half the service because forsooth it is more genteel the weaver the shoemaker the tailor the barber and every mean working fellow that can set up with little has the impudence with the first money he gets to dress himself like a tradesman of substance the ordinary retailer in the clothing of his wife takes pattern from his neighbour that deals in the same commodity by wholesale and the reason he gives for it is that twelve years ago the other had not a bigger shop than himself the druggist mercer draper and other creditable shopkeepers can find no difference between themselves and    merchants and therefore dress and live like them the merchants lady who cannot bear the assurance of those mechanicks flies for refuge to the other end of the town and scorns to follow any fashion but what she takes from thenceb this haughtiness alarms the court the women of quality are frightend to see merchants wives and daughters dressd like themselves this impudence of the city they cry is intolerable mantuamakers are sent for and the contrivance of fashions becomes all their study that they may have always new modes ready to take up as soon as those saucy cits shall begin to imitate those in being the same emulation is continued through the several degrees of quality to an incredible expence till at last the princes great favourites and those of the first rank of all having nothing else left to outstrip some of their inferiors are forcd to lay out vast   0 estates in pompous equipages magnificent furniture sumptuous gardens and princely palaces to this emulation and continual striving to outdo one another it is owing that after so many various shiftings and changings of modes in trumping up new ones and renewing of old ones there is still a plus ultra left for the ingenious it is this or at least the consequence of it that sets the poor to work adds spurs to industry and encourages the skilful artificer to search after further improvements     it may be objected that many people of good fashion who have been usd to be well dressd out of custom wear rich clothes with all the indifferency imaginable and that the benefit to trade accruing from them cannot be ascribed to emulation or pride to this i answer that it is impossible that those who trouble their heads so little with their dress could ever have wore those rich clothes if both the stuffs and fashions had not been first invented to gratify the vanity of others who took greater delight in fine apparel than they besides that every body is not without pride that appears to be soa all the symptoms of that vice are not easily discoverd they are manifold and vary according to the age humour circumstances and often constitution of the people     the cholerick city captain seems impatient to come to action and expressing his warlike genius by the firmness of his steps makes his pike for want of enemies tremble at the valour of his arm his martial finery as he marches along inspires him with an unusual elevation of mind by which endeavouring to forget his shop as well as himself he looks up at the balconies with the fierceness of a saracen conqueror while the phlegmatick alderman now become venerable both for his age and his authority contents himself with being thought a considerable man and knowing no easier    way to express his vanity looks big in his coach where being known by his paultry livery he receives in sullen state the homage that is paid him by the meaner sort of people the beardless ensign counterfeits a gravity above his years and with ridiculousa assurance strives to imitate the stern countenance of his colonel flattering himself all the while that by his daring mien youll judge of his prowess the youthful fair in a vast concern of being overlookd by the continual changing of her posture betrays a violent desire of being observd and catching as it were at every bodys eyes courts with obliging looks the admiration of her beholders the conceited coxcomb on the contrary displaying an air of sufficiency is wholly taken up with the contemplation of his own perfections and in publick places discovers such a disregard to others that the ignorant must imagine he thinks himself to be alone these and such like are all manifest tho different tokens of pride that are obvious to all the world but mans vanity is not always so soon found out when we perceive an air of humanity and men seem not to be employed in admiring themselves norb altogether unmindful of others we are apt to pronounce em void of pride when perhaps they are only fatigud with gratifying their vanity and become languid from a satiety of enjoyments that out        ward show of peace within and drowsy composure of careless negligence with which a great man is often seen in his plain chariot to loll at ease are not always so free from art as they may seem to be nothing is more ravishing to the proud than to be thought happy  the wellbred gentleman places his greatest pride in the skill he has of covering it with dexterity and some are so expert in concealing this frailty that when they are the most guilty of it the vulgar think them the most exempt from it thus the dissembling courtier when he appears in state assumes an air of modesty and good humour and while he is ready to burst with vanity seems to be wholly ignorant of his greatness well knowing that those lovely qualities must heighten him in the esteem of others and be an addition to that grandeur which the coronets about his coach and harnesses with the rest of his equipage cannot fail to proclaim without his assistance and as in these pride is overlookd because industriously conceald so in others again it is denied that they have any when they shew or at least seem to shew it in the most publick manner the wealthy parson being as well as the rest of his profession debarrd from the gaiety of laymen makes it his business to look out for an admirable black and the finest cloth that money can purchase and distinguishes himself by the fulness of his noble and spotless    garment his wigs are as fashionable as that form he is forced to comply with will admit of but as he is only stinted in their shape so he takes care that for goodness of hair and colour few noblemen shall be able to match em his body is ever clean as well as     his clothes his sleek face is kept constantly shavd and his handsome nails are diligently pared his smooth white hand and a brilliant of the first water mutually becoming honour each other with double graces what linen he discovers is transparently curious and he scorns ever to be seen abroad with a worse beaver than what a rich banker would be proud of on his weddingday to all these niceties in dress he adds a majestick gate and expresses a commanding loftiness in his carriage yet common civility notwithstanding the evidence of so many concurring symptoms wont allow us to suspect any of his actions to be the result of pride considering the dignity of his office it is only decency in him what would be vanity in others and in good manners to his calling we ought to believe that the worthy gentleman without any regard to his reverend person puts himself to all this trouble and expence merely out of a respect which is due to the divine order he belongs to and a religious zeal to preserve his holy function from the contempt of scoffers with all my heart nothing of all this shall be calld pride let me    only be allowd to say that to our human capacities it looks very like it but if at last i should grant that there are men who enjoy all the fineries of equipage and furniture as well as clothes and yet have no pride in them it is certain that if all should be such that emulation i spoke of before must cease and consequently trade which has so great a dependence upon it suffer in every branch for to say that if all men were truly virtuous they might without any regard to themselves consume as much out of zeal to serve their neighbours and promote the publick good as they do now out of selflove and emulation is a miserable shift and an unreasonable supposition as there have been good people in all ages so without doubt we are not destitute of them in this but let us enquire of the periwigmakers and tailors in what gentlemen      even of the greatest wealth and highest quality they ever could discover such publickspirited views ask the lacemen the mercers and the linendrapers whether the richest and if you will the most virtuous ladies if they buy with ready money or intend to pay in any reasonable time will not drive from shop to shop to try the market make as many words and stand as hard with them to save a groat or sixpence in a yard as the most necessitous jilts in town if it be urgd that if there are not it is possible there might be such people    i answer that it is as possible that cats instead of killing rats and mice should feed them and go about the house to suckle and nurse their young ones or that a kite should call the hens to their meat as the cock does and sit brooding over their chickens instead of devouring em but if they should all do so they would cease to be cats and kites it is inconsistent with their natures and the species of creatures which now we mean when we name cats and kites would be extinct as soon as that could come to pass remark n remark n na envy it self and vanity were ministers of industry page  0 line    envy is that baseness in our nature which makes us grieve and pine at what we conceive to be a happiness in others i dont believe there is a human creature in his senses arrivd to maturity that at one time or other has not been carried away by this passion in good earnest and yet i never met with any one that dared own he was guilty of it but in jest  that we are so generally ashamed of this vice     is owing to  0 that strong habit of hypocrisy by the help of which we have learned from our cradle to hide even from our selves the vast extent of selflove and all its different branches it is impossible man should wish better for another than he does for himself unless where he supposes an impossibility that himself should attain to those wishes and from hence we may easily learn after whata manner this passion is raised in us in order to it we are to consider first that as well as we think of our selves so ill we often think of our neighbour with equal injustice and when we apprehend that others do or will enjoy what we think they dont deserve it afflicts and makes us angry with the cause of that disturbance secondly that we are ever employd in wishing well for our selves every one according to his judgment and inclinations and when we observe something we like and yet are destitute of in the possession of others it occasions first sorrow in us for not having the thing we like this sorrow is incurable while we continue our esteem for the thing we want but as selfdefence is restless and never suffers us to leave any means untried how to remove evil from us as far and as well as we are able experience teaches us that nothing in nature more alleviates this sorrow than our anger against those who are possessd of what we esteem and want this latter passion therefore we    cherish and cultivate to save or relieve our selves at least in part from the uneasiness we felt from the first envy then is a compound of grief and anger the degrees of this passion depend chiefly on the nearness     or remoteness of the objects as to circumstances if one who is forced to walk on foot envies a great man for keeping a coach and six it will never be with that violence or give him that disturbance which it may to a man who keeps a coach himself but can only afford to drive with four horses the symptoms of envy are as various and as hard to describe as those of the plague at some time it appears in one shape at others in another quite different among the fair the disease is very common and the signs of it very conspicuous in their opinions and censures of one another in beautiful young women you may often discover this faculty to a high degree they frequently will hate one another mortally at first sight from no other principle than envy and you may read this scorn and unreasonable aversion in their very countenances if they have not a great deal of art and well learnd to dissemble in the rude and unpolishd multitude this passion is very barefaced especially when they envy others for the goods of fortune they rail at their betters rip up their faults    and take pains to misconstrue theira most commendable actions they murmur at providence and loudly complain that the good things of this world are chiefly enjoyd by those who do not deserve them the grosser sort of them it often affects so violently that if they were not withheld by the fear of the laws they would go directly and beat those their envy is levelld at from no other provocation than what that passion suggests to them the men of letters labouring under this distemper discover quite different symptoms when they envy a person for his parts and erudition their chief care is industriously to conceal their frailty which generally is attempted by denying and depreciating the good qualities they envy they carefully peruse his works and are displeasd withb every fine passage they     meet with they look for nothing but his errors and wish for no greater feast than a gross mistake in their censures they are captious as well as severe make mountains of molehills and will not pardon the least shadow of a fault but exaggerate the most trifling omission into a capital blunder envy is visible in brutebeasts horses shew it in their endeavours of outstripping one another and the best spirited will run themselves to death before theyll suffer another before them in dogs this passion is likewise plainly to be seen those who are used to be caressd    will never tamely bear that felicity in others i have seen a lapdog that would choke himself with victuals rather than leave any thing for a competitor of his own kind and we may often observe the same behaviour in those creatures which we daily see in infants that are froward and by being overfondled made humoursome if out of caprice they at any time refuse to eat what they have askd for and we can but make them believe that some body else nay even the cat or the dog is going to take it from them they will make an end of their oughts with pleasure and feed even against their appetite if envy was not rivetted in human nature it would not be so common in children and youth would not be so generally spurrd on by emulation those who would derive every thing that is beneficial to the society from a good principle ascribe the effects of emulation in schoolboys to a virtue of the mind as it requires labour and pains so it is evident that they commit a selfdenial who act from that disposition but if we look narrowly into it we shall find that this sacrifice of ease and pleasure is only made to envy and the love of glory if there was not something very like this passion mixd with that pretended virtue it would be impossible to raise and increase it by the same means that create envy the boy who receives a reward for    the superiority of his     performance is conscious of the vexation it would have been to him if he should have falln short of it this reflexion makes him exert himself not to be outdone by those whom now he looks upon as his inferiors and the greater his pride is the more selfdenial hell practise to maintain his conquest the other who in spite of the pains he took to do well has missd of the prize is sorry and consequently angry with him whom he must look upon as the cause of his grief but to shew this anger would be ridiculous and of no service to him so that he must either be contented to be less esteemd than the other boy or by renewing his endeavours become a greater proficient and it is ten to one but the disinterested goodhumourd and peaceable lad will choose the first and so become indolent and unactive while the covetous peevish and quarrelsome rascal shall take incredible pains and make himself a conqueror in his turn envy as it is very common among painters so it is of great use for their improvement i dont mean that little dawbers envy great masters but most of them are tainted with this vice against those immediately above them if the pupil of a famous artist is of a bright genius and uncommon application he first adores his master but as his own skill increases he begins insensibly to envy what he    admired before to learn the nature of this passion and that it consists in what i have named we are but to observe that if a painter by exerting himself comes not only to equal but toa exceed the man he envied his sorrow is gone and all his anger disarmed and if he hated him before he is now glad to be friends with him if the other will condescend to it married women who are guilty of this vice which few are not are always endeavouring to raise the same passion in their spouses and where they have prevaild envy and emulation have kept more men in     bounds and reformd more ill husbands from sloth from drinking and other evil courses than all the sermons that have been preachd since the time of the apostles as every body would be happy enjoy pleasure and avoid pain if he could so selflove bids us look on every creature that seems satisfied as a rival in happiness and the satisfaction we have in seeing that felicity disturbd without any advantage to our selves but what springs from the pleasure we have in beholding it is calld loving mischief for mischiefs sake and the motive of which that frailty is the result malice another offspring derived from the same original for if there was no envy there could be no malice when the passions lie dormant we have no apprehension of them and often people think they have    not such a frailty in their nature because that moment they are not affected with it a gentleman well dressd who happens to be dirtyd all over by a coach or a cart is laughd at and by his inferiors much more than his equals because they envy him more they know he is vexd at it and imagining him to be happier than themselves they are glad to see him meet with displeasures in his turn but a young lady if she be in a serious mood instead of laughing at pities him because a clean man is a sight she takes delight in and there is no room for envy at disasters we either laugh or pity those that befal them according to the stock we are possessd of either of malice or compassion if a man falls or hurts himself so slightly that it moves not the lattera we laugh and here our pity and malice shake us alternately indeed sir i am very sorry for it i beg your pardon for laughing i am the silliest creature in the world then laugh againb and againc i am indeed very sorry and so on some are so malicious they would laugh if a man broke his leg and others are so compassionate that they can   0 heartily pity a man for the least spot in his clothes but no body is so savage that no compassion can touch him nor any man so goodnaturd as never to be affected with any malicious pleasure how strangely our passions govern us we envy a man for being rich and then perfectly hate    him but if we come to be his equals we are calm and the least condescension in him makes us friends but if we become visibly superior to him we can pity his misfortunes the reason why men of true good sense envy less than others is because they admire themselves with less hesitation than fools and silly people for tho they do not shew this to others yet the solidity of their thinking gives them an assurance of their real worth which men of weak understanding can never feel within tho they often counterfeit it the ostracism of the greeks was a sacrifice of valuable men made to epidemick envy and often applied as an infallible remedy to cure and prevent the mischiefs of popular spleen and rancour a victim of state often appeases the murmurs of a whole nation and afterages frequently wonder at barbarities of this nature which under the same circumstances they would have committed themselves they are compliments to the peoples malice which is never better gratifyd than when they can see a great man humbled we believe that we love justice and to see merit rewarded but if men continue long in the first posts of honour half of us grow weary of them look for their faults and if we can find none we suppose they hide them and tis much if the greatest part of us dont wish them discarded this foul play the best of men ought ever to ap   prehend from all who are not their immediate friends or acquaintance because nothing is more tiresome to us than the repetition of praises we have no manner of share in the more a passion is a compound of many others the more difficult it is to define it and the more it is     tormenting to those that labour under it the greater cruelty it is capable of inspiring them with against others therefore nothing is more whimsical or mischievous than jealousy which is made up of love hope fear and a great deal of envy the last has been sufficiently treated of already and what i have to say of fear the reader will find under remark r so that the better to explain and illustrate this odd mixture the ingredients i shall further speak of in this place are hope and love hoping is wishing with some degree of confidence that the thing wishd for will come to pass  the firmness and imbecillity of our hope depend entirely on the greater or lesser degree of our confidence and all hope includes doubt for when our confidence is arrivd to that height as to exclude all doubts it becomes a certainty and we take for granted what we only hopd for before a silver inkhorn may pass in speech because every body knows what we mean by it but a certain hope cannot for a man who makes use of an epithet that destroys the essence of the substantive he joins it to can have no meaning    at all and the more clearly we understand the force of the epithet and the nature of the substantive the more palpable is the nonsense of the heterogeneous compound the reason therefore why it is not so shocking to some to hear a man speak of certain hope as if he should talk of hot ice or liquid oak is not because there is less nonsense containd in the first than there is in either of the latter but because the word hope i mean the essence of it is not so clearly understood by the generality of the people as the words and essences of ice and oak are      love in the first place signifies affection such as parents and nurses bear to children and friends to one another it consists in a liking and wellwishing to the person beloved we give an easy construction to his words and actions and feel a proneness to excuse and forgive his faults if we see any his interest we make on all accounts our own even to our prejudice and receive an inward satisfaction for sympathizing with him in his sorrows as well as joys what i said last is not impossible whatever it may seem to be for when we are sincere in sharing with another in his misfortunes selflove makes us believe that the sufferings we feel must alleviate and lessen those of our friend and while this fond reflexion is soothing our pain a secret pleasure arises from our grieving for the person we love    0secondly by love we understand a strong inclination in its nature distinct from all other affections of friendship gratitude and consanguinity that persons of different sexes after liking bear to one another it is in this signification that love enters into the compound of jealousy and is the effect as well as happy disguise of that passion that prompts us to labour for the preservation of our species this latter appetite is innate both in men and women who are not defective in their formation as much as hunger or thirst tho they are seldom affected with it before the years of puberty could we undress nature and pry into her deepest recesses we should discover the seeds of this passion before it exerts itself      as plainly as we see the teeth in an embryo before the gums are formd there are few healthy people of either sex whom it has made no impression upon before twenty yet as the peace and happiness of the civil society require that this should be kept a secret never to be talkd of in publick so among wellbred people it is counted highly criminal to mention before company any thing in plain words that is relating to this mystery of succession by which means the very name of the appetite tho the most necessary for the continuance of mankind is become odious and the proper epithets commonly joind to lust are filthy and abominable    this impulse of nature in people of strict morals and rigid modesty often disturbs the body for a considerable time before it is understood or known to be what it is and it is remarkable that the most polishd and best instructed are generally the most ignorant as to this affair and here i can but observe the difference between man in the wild state of nature and the same creature in the civil society in the first men and women if left rude and untaught in the sciences of modes and manners would quickly find out the cause of that disturbance and be at a loss no more than other animals for a present remedy besides that it is not probable they would want either precept or example from the more experiencd but in the second where the rules of religion law and decency are to be followd and obeyd before any dictates of nature the youth of both sexes are to be armd and fortifyd against this impulse and from their infancy artfully frightend from the most remote approaches of it the appetite it self and all the symptoms of it tho they are plainly felt and understood are to be stifled with care and severity and in women flatly disownd and if there be occasion with obstinacy denyd even when themselves are visibly affected by them if it throws them into distempers they must be cured by physick or else patiently bear     them in silence and it is the    interest of the society to preserve decency and politeness that women should linger waste and die rather than relieve themselves in an unlawful manner and among the fashionable part of mankind the people of birth and fortune it is expected that matrimony should never be enterd upon without a curious regard to family estate and reputation and in the making of matches the call of nature be the very last consideration those then who would make love and lust synonimous confound the effect with the cause of it yet such is the force of education and a habit of thinking as we are taught that sometimes persons of either sex are actually in love without feeling any carnal desires or penetrating into the intentions of nature the end proposed by her without which they could never have been affected with that sort of passion that there are such is certain but many more whose pretences to those refind notions are only upheld by art and dissimulation those who are really such platonick lovers are commonly the palefaced weakly people of cold and phlegmatick constitutions in either sex the hale and robust of bilious temperament and a sanguine complexion  never entertain any love so spiritual as to exclude all thoughts and wishes that relate to the bodya but if the most seraphick lovers would know the original of their inclination let them but    suppose that another should have the corporal enjoyment of the person beloved and by the tortures theyll suffer from that refiexion they will soon discover the nature     of their passions whereas on the contrary parents and friends receive a satisfaction in reflecting on the joys and comforts of a happy marriage to be tasted by those they wish well to the curious that are skilld in anatomizing the invisible part of man will observe that the more sublime and exempt this love is from all thoughts of sensuality the more spurious it is and the more it degenerates from its honest original and primitive simplicity the power and sagacity as well as labour and care of the politician in civilizing the society has been no where more conspicuous than in the happy contrivance of playing our passions against one another by flattering our pride and still increasing the good opinion we have of ourselves on the one hand and inspiring us on the other with a superlative dread and mortal aversion against shame the artful moralists have taught us chearfully to encounter our selves and if not subdue at least so to conceal and disguise our darling passion lust that we scarce know it when we meet with it in our own breasts oh the mighty prize we have in view for all our selfdenial can any man be so serious as to abstain from laughter when he considers that for so much deceit and insin   cerity practisd upon our selves as well as others we have no other recompense than the vain satisfaction of making our species appear more exalted and remote from that of other animals than it really is and we in our consciences know it to be yet this is fact and in it we plainly perceive the reason why it was necessary to render odious every word or action by which we might discover the innate desire we feel to perpetuate our kind and why tamely to submit to the violence of a furious appetite which it isa painful to resist and innocently to obey the most pressing demand of nature without guile or hypocrisy like other creatures      should be branded with the ignominious name of brutality what we call love then is not a genuine but an adulterated appetite or rather a compound a heap of several contradictory passions blended in one as it is a product of nature warpd by custom and education so the true origin and first motive of it as i have hinted already is stifled in wellbred people and almost concealed from themselves all which is the reason that as those affected with it vary in age strength resolution temper circumstances and manners the effects of it are so different whimsical surprizing and unaccountable it is this passion that makes jealousy so troublesome and the envy of it often so fatal    those who imagine that there may be jealousy without love do not understand that passion men may not have the least affection for their wives and yet be angry with them for their conduct and suspicious of them either with or without a cause but what in such cases affects them is their pride the concern for their reputation they feel a hatred against them without remorse when they are outrageous they can beat them and go to sleep contentedly such husbands may watch their dames themselves and have thema observed by others but their vigilance is not so intense they are not so inquisitive or industrious in their searches neither do they feel that anxiety of heart at the fear of a discovery as when love is mixd with the passions what confirms me in this opinion is that we never observe this behaviour between a man and his mistress for when his love is gone and he suspects her to be false he leaves her and troubles his head no more about her whereas it is the greatest difficulty imaginable even to a man of sense to part with a mistress as long as he loves her what ever faults she may be guilty of if in his anger he strikes her he is uneasy after it his love makes him reflect on the     hurt he has done her and he wants to be reconcild to her again he may talk of hating her and many times from his heart wish her hangd but if    he cannot get entirely rid of his frailty he can never disintangle himself from her tho she is represented in the most monstrous guilt to his imagination and he has resolved and swore a thousand times never to come near her again there is no trusting hima even when he is fully convincd of her infidelity if his love continues his despair is never so lasting but between the blackest fits of it he relents and finds lucid intervals of hope he forms excuses for her thinks of pardoning and in order to it racks his invention for possibilities that may make her appear less criminal remark o remark o ob real pleasures comforts ease page    line    that the highest good consisted in pleasure was the doctrine of epicurus who yet led a life exemplary for continence sobriety and other virtues which made people of the succeeding ages quarrel about the signification of pleasure those who argued from the temperance of the philosopher said that the delight epicurus meant was being virtuous so erasmus in his colloquies tells us that there are no greater epicures than pious christians  others that    reflected on the dissolute manners of the greatest part of his followers would have it that by pleasures he could have understood nothing but sensual ones and the gratification of our passions i shall not decide their quarrel but am of opinion that whether men be good or bad what they take delight in is     their pleasure and not to look out for any further etymology from the learned languages i believe an englishman may justly call every thing a pleasure that pleases him  and according to this definition we ought to dispute no more about mens pleasures than their tastes trahit sua quemque voluptas  the worldlyminded voluptuous and ambitious man notwithstanding he is void of merit covets precedence every where and desires to be dignifyd above his betters he aims at spacious palaces and delicious gardens his chief delight is in excelling others in stately horses magnificent coaches a numerous attendance and dearbought furniture to gratify his lust he wishes for genteel young beautiful women of different charms and complexionsa that shall adore his greatness and be really in love with his person his cellars he would have stored with the flower of every country that produces excellent wines his tableb he desires may be servd with many courses and each of them contain a choice variety of dainties not easily    purchasd and ample evidences of elaborate and judicious cookery while harmonious musick and wellcouchd flattery entertain his hearing by turns he employs even in the meanest trifles none but the ablest and most ingenious workmen that his judgment and fancy may as evidently appear in the least things that belong to him as his wealth and quality are manifested in those of greater value he desires to have several sets of witty facetious and polite people to converse with and among them he would have some famous for learning and universal knowledge for his serious affairs he wishes to find men of parts and experience     that should be diligent and faithful those that are to wait on him he would have handy mannerly and discreet of comely aspect and a graceful mien what he requires in them besides is a respectful care of every thing that is his nimbleness without hurry dispatch without noise and an unlimited obedience to his orders nothing he thinks more troublesome than speaking to servants wherefore he will only be attended by such as by observing his looks have learnd to interpret his will from his slightest motions he loves to see an elegant nicety in every thing that approaches him and in what is to be employd about his person he desires a superlative cleanliness to be irreligiouslya observd the chief officers of hisb houshold he would have to    be men of birthc honour and distinction as well as order contrivance and oeconomy for tho he loves to be honourd by every body and receives the respects of the common people with joy yet the homage that is paid him by persons of quality is ravishing to him in a more transcendent manner while thus wallowing in a sea of lust and vanity he is wholly employd in provoking and indulging his appetites he desires the world should think him altogether free from pride and sensuality and put a favourable construction upon his most glaring vices nay if his authority can purchase it he covets to be thought wise brave generous goodnaturd and endud with all the virtues he thinks worth having he would have us believe that the pomp and luxury he is servd with are as many tiresome plagues to him and all the grandeur he appears in is an ungrateful burden which to his sorrow is inseparable from the high sphere he moves in that his noble mind so much exalted above vulgar capacities aims at higher ends and cannot relish such worthless enjoyments that the highest of his ambition is to promote the   0 publick welfare and his greatest pleasure to see his country flourish and every body in it made happy these are calld real pleasures by the vicious and earthlyminded and whoever is able either by his skill or fortune after this refind   0manner at once to enjoy the world and the good opinion of it is counted extremely happy by all the most fashionable part of the people but on the other side most of the ancient philosophers and grave moralists especially the stoicks would not allow any thing to be a real good that was liable to be taken from them by others they wisely considerd the instability of fortune and the favour of princes the vanity of honour and popular applause the precariousness of riches and all earthly possessions and therefore placed true happiness in the calm serenity of a contented mind free from guilt and ambition a mind that having subdued every sensual appetite despises the smiles as well as frowns of fortune and taking no delight but in contemplation desires nothing but what every body is able to give to himself a mind that armda with fortitude and resolution has learnd to sustain the greatest losses without concern to endure pain without affliction and to bear injuries without resentment many have ownd themselves arrivd to this height of selfdenial and then if we may believe them they were raisd above common mortals and their strength extended vastly beyond the pitch of their first nature they could behold the anger of threatning tyrants and the most imminent dangers without terror and preservd their tranquillity in the midst of tor   ments death it self they could meet with intrepidity and left the world with no greater reluctance than they had shewd fondness at their entrance into it these among the ancients have always bore the     greatest sway yet others that were no fools neither have exploded those precepts as impracticable calld their notions romantick and endeavourd to prove that what these stoicks asserted of themselves exceeded all human force and possibility and that therefore the virtues they boasted of could be nothing but haughty pretencea full of arrogance and hypocrisy yet notwithstanding these censures the serious part of the world and the generality of wise men that have livd ever since to this day agree with the stoicks in the most material points as that there can be no true felicity in what depends on things perishable that peace within is the greatest blessing and no conquest likeb that of our passions that knowledge temperance fortitude humility and other embellishments of the mind are the most valuable acquisitions that no man can be happy but he that is good and that the virtuous are only capable of enjoying real pleasures i expect to be askd why in the fable i have calld those pleasures real that are directly opposite to those which i own the wise men of all ages have extolld as the most valuable my answer is because i dont call things pleasuresc    which men say are best but such as they seem to be most pleased with  how can i believe that a mans chief delight is in the embellishments of the mind when i see him everd employd about and daily pursue the pleasures that are contrary to them john never cuts any pudding but just enough that you cant say he took none this little bit after much chomping and chewing you see goes down with him like choppd hay  after that he falls     upon the beef with aa voracious appetite and crams himself up to his throat is it not provoking to hear john cry every day that pudding is all his delight and that he dont value the beef of a farthing i could swagger about fortitude and the contempt of riches as much as seneca himself and would undertake to write twice as much in behalf of poverty as ever he did for the tenth part of his estate  i could teach the way to his summum bonum as exactly as i know my way home i could tell people that to extricate themselves from all worldly engagements and to purify the mind they must divest themselves of their passions as men take out the furniture when they would clean a room thoroughly and i am clearly of the opinion that the malice and most severe strokes of fortune can do no more injury to a mind thus stript of all fears wishes and inclinations than a blind horse can do in an empty barn in the the   ory of all this i am very perfect but the practice is very difficult and if you went about picking my pocket offerd to take the victuals from before me when i am hungry or made but the least motion of spitting in my face i dare not promise how philosophically i should behave my self but that i am forced to submit to every caprice of my unruly nature youll say is no argument that others are as little masters of theirs and therefore i am willing to pay adoration to virtue wherever i can meet with it with a proviso that i shall not be obliged to admit any as such where i can see no selfdenial or to judge of mens sentiments from their words where i have their lives before me i have searchd through every degree and station     of men and confess that i have found no where more austerity of manners or greater contempt of earthly pleasures than in some religious houses where people freely resigning and retiring from the world to combat themselves have no other business but to subdue their appetites what can be a greater evidence of perfect chastity and a superlative love to immaculate purity in men and women than that in the prime of their age when lust is most raging they should actually seclude themselves from each others company and by a voluntary renunciation debar themselves for life not only from uncleanness but    even the most lawful embraces those that abstain from flesh and often all manner of food one woud think in the right way to conquer all carnal desires and i could almost swear that he dont consult his ease who daily mauls his bare back and shoulders with unconscionable stripes and constantly roused at midnight from his sleep leaves his bed for his devotion who can despise riches more or shew himself less avaricious than he who wont so much as touch gold or silver no not with his feet  or can any mortal shew himself less luxurious or more humble than the man that making poverty his choice contents himself with scraps and fragments and refuses to eat any bread but what is bestowd upon him by the charity of others such fair instances of selfdenial would make me bow down to virtue if i was not deterrd and warnd from it by so many persons of eminence and learning who unanimously tell me that i am mistaken and all i have seen is farce and hypocrisy that what seraphick love they may pretend to there is nothing but discord among them and that how penitential the nuns and friars may appear in their several convents      they none of them sacrifice their darling lusts that among the women they are not all virgins that pass for such and that if i was to be let into their secrets and    examine some of their subterraneous privacies i should soon bea convinced by scenes of horror that some of them must have been mothers  that among the men i should find calumny envy and illnature in the highest degree or else gluttony drunkenness and impurities of a more execrable kind than adultery it self and as for the mendicant orders that they differ in nothing but their habits from other sturdy beggars who deceive people with a pitiful tone and an outward shew of misery and as soon as they are out of sight lay by their cant indulge their appetites and enjoy one another if the strict rules and so many outward signs of devotion observd among those religious orders deserve such harsh censures we may well despair of meeting with virtue any where else for if we look into the actions of the antagonists and greatestb accusers of those votaries we shall not find so much as the appearance of selfdenial the reverend divines of all sects even of the most reformed churches in all countries take care with the cyclops evangeliphorusc first ut ventri bene sit and afterwards ne quid desit iis quæ sub ventre sunt  to these     theyll desire you to add convenient houses handsome furniture good fires in winter pleasant gardens in summer neat clothes and money enough to bring up their children precedency in all companies    respect from every body and then as much religion as you please the things i have named are thea necessary comforts of life which the most modest are not ashamd to claim and which they are very uneasy without they are tis true made of the same mould and have the same corrupt nature with other men born with the same infirmities subject to the same passions and liable to the same temptations and therefore if they are diligent in their calling and can but abstain from murder adultery swearing drunkenness and other hainous vices their lives are called unblemishd and their reputations unspotted their function renders them holy and     the gratification of so many carnal appetites and the enjoyment of so much luxurious ease notwithstanding they may set upon themselves what value their pride and parts will allow them all this i have nothing against but i see no selfdenial without which there can be no virtue is it such a mortification not to desire a greater share of worldly blessings than what every reasonable man ought to be satisfyd with or is there any mighty merit in not being flagitious and forbearing indecencies that are repugnant to good manners and which no prudent man would be guilty of tho he had no religion at all i know i shall be told that the reason why the clergy are so violent in their resentments    when at any time they are but in the least affronted and shew themselves so void of all patience when their rights are invaded is their great care to preserve their calling their profession from contempt not for their own sakes but to be more serviceable to others tis the same reason that makes ema sollicitous about the comforts and conveniences of life for should they suffer themselves to be insulted over be content with a coarser diet and wear more ordinary clothes than other people the multitude who judge from outward appearances would be apt to think that the clergy was no more the immediate care of providence than other folks and so not only undervalue their persons but despise likewise all the reproofs and instructions that came from em this is an admirable plea and as it is much made use of ill try the worth of it i am not of the learned dr echards opinion that poverty is one of those things that bring the clergy into contempt  any further than as it may be an     occasion of discovering their blind side for when men are always struggling with their low condition and are unable to bear the burthen of it without reluctancy it is then they shew how uneasy their poverty sits upon them how glad they would be to have their circumstances meliorated and what a real value they have for the good things of this world    he that harangues on the contempt of riches and the vanity of earthly enjoyments in a rusty threadbare gown because he has no other and would wear his old greasy hat no longer if any body would give him a better that drinks smallbeer at home with a heavy countenance but leaps at a glass of wine if he can catch it abroad that with little appetite feeds upona his own coarse mess but falls to greedily where he can please his palate and expresses an uncommon joy at an invitation to a splendid dinner tis he that is despised not because he is poor but because he knows not how to be so with that content and resignation which he preaches to others and so discovers his inclinations to be contrary to his doctrine but when a man from the greatness of his soul or an obstinate vanity which will dob as well resolving to subdue his appetites in good earnest refuses all the offers of ease and luxury that can be made to him and embracing a voluntary poverty with chearfulness rejects whatever may gratify the senses and actually sacrifices all his passions to his pride in acting this part the vulgar far from contemning will be ready to deify and adore him how famous have the cynick philosophers made themselves only by refusing to dissimulate and make use of superfluities did not the most ambitious monarch the world ever bore condescend to visit diogenes in his tub and re   turn to a studyd incivility the highest compliment a man of his pride was able to make     mankind are very willing to take one anothers word when they see some circumstances that corroborate what is told them but when our actions directly contradict what we say it is counted impudence to desire belief if a jolly hale fellow with glowing cheeks and warm hands newly returnd from some smart exercise or else the cold bath tells us in frosty weather that he cares not for the fire we are easily induced to believe him especially if he actually turns from it and we know by his circumstances that he wants neither fuel nor clothes but if we should hear the same from the mouth of a poor starvd wretch with swelld hands and a livid countenance in a thin ragged garment we should not believe a word of what he said especially if we saw him shaking and shivering creep toward the sunny bank and we would conclude let him say what he could that warm clothes and a good fire would be very acceptable to him the application is easy and therefore if there be any clergy upon earth that would be thought not to care for the world and to value the soul above the body let them only forbear shewing a greater concern for their sensual pleasures than they generally do for their spiritual ones and they may rest satisfyd that no poverty while they bear it with fortitude will ever bring   0them into contempt how mean soever their circumstances may be let us suppose a pastor that has a little flock entrusted to him of which he is very careful he preaches visits exhorts reproves among his people with zeal and prudence and does them all the kind offices that lie in his power to make them happy there is no doubt but those under his care must be very much obligd to him now well suppose once more that this good man by the help of a little selfdenial is contented to live upon half his income accepting only of twenty pounds a year instead of     forty which he could claim and moreover that he loves his parishioners so well that he will never leave them for any preferment whatever no not a bishoprick tho it be offerd i cant see but all this might be an easy task to a man who professes mortification and has no value for worldly pleasures yet such a disinterested divine i dare promise notwithstanding the great degeneracy of mankind will be lovd esteemd and have every bodys good word nay i would swear that tho he should yet further exert himself give above half of his small revenue to the poor live upon nothing but oatmeal and water lie upon straw and wear the coarsest cloth that could be made his mean way of living would never be reflected on or be a disparagement either to himself or the order he belongd to but that on the    contrary his poverty would never be mentioned but to his glory as long as his memory should last but says a charitable young gentlewoman tho you have the heart to starve your parson have you no bowels of compassion for his wife and children pray what must remain of forty pounds a year after it has been twice so unmercifully split or would you have the poor woman and the innocent babes likewise live upon oatmeal and water and lie upon straw you unconscionable wretch with all your suppositions and selfdenials nay is it possible tho they should all live at your own murdring rate that less than ten pounds a year could maintain a family——dont be in a passion good mrs abigail    0 i have a greater regard for your sex than to prescribe such a lean diet to married men but i confess i forgot the wives and children the main reason was because i thought poor priests could have no occasion for them who could imagine that the parson who is to teach others by example as well as precept was not able to withstand those desires which the wicked world it self calls unreasonablea what is the reason when a prentice marries before he is out of his time that unless he meets with a good fortune all his relations are angry with him and every body blames him nothing else but because at that time he has no money at his disposal and    being bound to his masters service has no leisure and perhaps little capacity to provide for a family what must we say to a parson that has twenty or if you will forty pounds a year that being bound more strictly to all the services a parish and his duty require has little time and generally much less ability to get any more is it not very unreasonableb he should marry but why should a sober young man who is guilty of no vice be debarrd from lawful enjoyments right marriage is lawful and so is a coach but what is that to people that have not money enough to keep one if he must have a wife let him look out for one with money or wait for a greater benefice or something else to maintain her handsomely and bear all incident charges but no body that has any thing her self will have him and he cant stay he has a very good stomach and all the symptomsc of health tis not every body that can live without a woman tis better to marry than burn      ——what a world of selfdenial is here the sober young man is very willing to be virtuous but you must not cross his inclinations he promises never to be a deerstealer upon condition that he shall have venison of his own and no body must doubt but that if it came to the push he is qualifyd to suffer martyrdoma tho he owns that he has not strength enough patiently tob bear a scratchd finger    when we see so many of the clergy to indulge their lust a brutish appetite run themselves after this manner upon an inevitable poverty which unless they could bear it with greater fortitude than they discover in all their actions must of necessity make them contemptible to all the world what credit must we givec them when they pretend that they conform themselves to the world not because they take delight in the several decencies conveniences and ornaments of it but only to preserve their function from contempt in order to be more useful to others have we not reason to believe that what they say is full of hypocrisy and falshood and that concupiscence is not the only appetite they want to gratify that the haughty airs and quick sense of injuries the curious elegance in dress and niceness of palate to be observd in most of them that are able to shew them are the results of pride and luxury in them as they are in other people and that the clergy are not possessd of more intrinsick virtue than any other profession i am afraid that by this time i have given many of my readers a real displeasure by dwelling so long upon the reality of pleasure but i cant help it there is one thing comes into my head to corroborate what i have urgd already which i cant forbear mentioning it is this those who govern others throughout the    world are at least as wise as the     people that are governd by them generally speaking if for this reason we woulda take pattern from our superiors we have but to cast our eyes on all the courts and governments in the universe and we shall soon perceive from the actions of the great ones which opinion they side with and what pleasures those in the highest stations of all seem to be most fond of for if it be allowable at all to judge of peoples inclinations from their manner of living none can be less injurd by it than those who are the most at liberty to do as they please if the great ones of the clergy as well as the laity of any country whatever had no value for earthly pleasures and did not endeavour to gratify their appetites why are envy and revenge so raging among them and all the other passions improvd and refind upon in courts of princes more than any where else and why are their repasts their recreations and whole manner of living always such as are approvd of coveted and imitated by the most sensual people of that same country if despising all visible decorations they were only in love with the embellishments of the mind why should they borrow so many of the implements and make use of the most darling toys of the luxurious why should a lordtreasurer or a bishop or even the grand signior or the pope of rome to be good and    virtuous and endeavour the conquest of his passions have occasion for greater revenues richer furniture or a more numerous attendance as to personal service than a private man what virtue is it the exercise of which requires so much pomp and superfluity as are to be seen by all men in power a man has as much opportunity to practise temperance that has but one dish at a meal as he that is constantly servd with three courses and a dozen dishes in each one may exercise as much patience and be as full of selfdenial     on a few flocks without curtains or tester as in a velvet bed that is sixteen foot high the virtuous possessions of the mind are neither charge nor burden a man may bear misfortunes with fortitude in a garret forgive injuries afoota and be chaste tho he has not a shirt to his back and therefore i shall never believe but that an indifferent skuller if he was entrusted with it might carry all the learning and religion that one man can contain as well as a barge with six oars especially if it was but to cross from lambeth to westminster or that humility is so ponderous a virtue that it requires six horses to draw it  to say that men not being so easily governd by their equals as by their superiors it is necessary that to keep the multitude in awe those who rule over us should excel others in outward appearance and conse   quently that all in high stations should have badges of honour and ensigns of power to be distinguishd from the vulgar is a frivolous objection this in the first place can only be of use to poor princes and weak and precarious governments that being actually unable to maintain the publick peace are obliged with a pageant shew to make up what they want in real power so the governor of batavia in the eastindies is forced to keep up a grandeur and live in ab magnificence above his quality to strike a terror in the natives of java who if they had skill and conduct are strong enough to destroy ten times the number of their masters but great princes and states that keep large fleets at sea and numerous armies in the field have no occasion for such stratagems for what makes em formidable abroad will never fail to be their security at home secondly     what must protect the lives and wealth of people from the attempts of wicked men in all societies is the severity of the laws and diligent administration of impartial justice theft housebreaking and murther are not to be prevented by the scarlet gownsa of the aldermen the gold chains of the sheriffs the fine trappings of their horses or any gaudy shew whatever those pageant ornaments are beneficial another way they are eloquent lectures to prentices and the use of them is to animate not to deter butb men of abandond    principles must be awd by rugged officers strong prisons watchful jailors the hangman and the gallows if london was to be one week destitute of constables and watchmen to guard the houses anights half the bankers would be ruind in that time and if my lord mayor had nothing to defend himself but his great twohanded sword the huge cap of maintenance and his gilded mace he would soon be stripd in the very streets of the city of all his finery in his stately coach but let us grant that the eyes of the mobility are to be dazzled with a gaudy outside if virtue was the chief delight of great men why should their extravagance be extended to things not understood by the mob and wholly removed from publick view i mean their private diversions the pomp and luxury of the diningroom and the bedchamber and the curiosities of the closet few of the vulgar know that there is wine of a guinea the bottle that birds no bigger than larks are often sold for half a guinea apiece or that a single picture may be worth several thousand pounds besides is it to be imagind that unless it was to please their own appetitesc men should put themselves to such vast expences for a political shew and be so sollicitous to gain the esteem of those whom they so much despise in every thing else if we     allow that the splendor and all the elegancy of a court area insipid and only tiresome to the prince himself and are    altogether made use of to preserve royal majesty from contempt can we say the same of half a dozen illegitimate children most of them the offspring of adultery by the same majesty got educated and made princes at the expence of the nation therefore it is evident that this awing of the multitude by a distinguishd manner of living is only a cloke and pretence under which great men would shelter their vanity and indulge every appetite about them without reproach a burgomaster of amsterdam in his plain black suit followd perhaps by one footman is fully as much respected and better obeyd than a lord mayor of london with all his splendid equipage and great train of attendance where there is a real power it is ridiculous to think that any temperance or austerity of life should ever render the person in whom that power is lodgd contemptible in his office from an emperor to the beadle of a parish cato in his government of spain in which he acquitted himself with so much glory had only three servants to attend him  do we hear that any of his orders were ever slighted for this notwithstanding that he lovd his bottle and when that great man marchd on foot thro the scorching sands of libya and parchd up with thirst refusd to touch the water that was brought him before all his soldiers had drank  do we ever read that this heroick forbearance weakned his authority or lessend    him in the esteem of his army but what need we go so far off there has not these many ages been a prince less inclind to     pomp and luxury than the† present king of sweden who enamourd with the title of hero has not only sacrificd the lives of his subjects and welfare of his dominions but what is more uncommon in sovereigns his own ease and all the comforts of life to an implacable spirit of revenge yet he is obeyd to the ruin of his people in obstinately maintaining a war that has almost utterly destroyd his kingdom  †this was wrote in     athus i have provd that the real pleasures of all men in nature are worldly and sensual if we judge from their practice i say all men in nature because devout christians who alone are to be excepted here being regenerated and preternaturally assisted by the divine grace cannot be said to be in nature how strange it is that they should all so unanimously deny it ask not only the divines and moralists of every nation but likewise all that are rich and powerful about real pleasure and theyll tell you with the stoicks that there can be no true felicity in things mundane and corruptible but then look upon their lives and you will find they take delight in no other what must we do in this dilemma shall we be so uncharitable as judging from mens actions to say that all the world prevaricates   0and that this is not their opinion let them talk what they will or shall we be so silly as relying on what they say to think them sincere in their sentiments and so not believe our own eyes or shall we rather endeavour to believe our selves and them too and say with montagne     that they imagine and are fully persuaded that they believe what yet they do not believe these are his words some impose on the world and would be thought to believe what they really dont but much the greater number impose upon themselves not considering nor thoroughly apprehending what it is to believe  but this is making all mankind either fools or impostors which to avoid there is nothing left us buta to say what mr bayle has endeavourd to prove at large in his reflexions on comets that man is so unaccountable a creature as to act most commonly against his principle  and this is so far from being injurious     that it is a compliment to human nature for we must say either this or worse this contradiction in the frame of man is the reason that the theory of virtue is so well understood and the practice of it so rarely to be met with if you ask me where to look for those beautiful shining qualities of prime ministers and the great favourites of princes that are so finely painted in dedications addresses epitaphs funeral sermons and inscriptions i answer there and no where else where would    you look for the excellency of a statue but in that part which you see of it tis the polishd outside only that has the skill and labour of the sculptor to boast of whats out of sight is untouchd would you break the head or cut open the breast to look for the brains or the heart youd only shew your ignorance and destroy the workmanship this has often made me compare the virtues of great men to your large china jars they make a fine shew and are ornamental evena to a chimney one would by the bulk they appear in and the value that is set upon emb think they might be very useful but look into a thousand of them and youll find nothing in them but dust and cobwebs     remark p remark p pa —— —— the very poor livd better than the rich before page    line    if we trace the most flourishing nations in their origin we shall find that in the remote beginnings of every society the richest and most considerable men among them were a great while destitute of a great many comforts of life that are now enjoyd by the meanest and most humble wretches so that    many things which were once lookd upon as the invention of luxury are now allowd even to those that are so miserably poor as to become the objects of publick charity nay counted so necessary that we think no human creature ought to want them in the first ages man without doubt fed on the fruits of the earth without any previous preparation and reposed himself naked like other animals on the lap of their common parent whatever has contributed since to make life more comfortable as it must have been the result of thought experience and some labour so it more or less deserves the name of luxury the more or less trouble it required and deviated from the primitive simplicity our admiration is extended no farther than tob what is new to us and we all overlook the excellency of things we are used to be they never so curious a man would be laughd at that should discover luxury in the plain dress of a poor creature that walks along in a thick parish gown and a course shirt underneath it and yet what a number of people how many different trades and what a variety of skill and tools must be employed to have the most ordinary yorkshire cloth what depth of thought and ingenuity what   0 toil and labour and what length of time must it have cost before man could learn    from a seed to raise and prepare so useful a product as linen must that society not be vainly curious among whom this admirable commodity after it is made shall not be thought fit to be used even by the poorest of all before it is brought to a perfect whiteness which is not to be procurd but by the assistance of all the elements joind to a world of industry and patience i have not done yet can we reflect not only on the cost laid out upon this luxurious invention but likewise on the little time the whiteness of it continues in which part of its beauty consists that every six or seven days at farthesta it wants cleaning and while it lasts is a continual charge to the wearer can we i say reflect on all this and not think it an extravagant piece of nicety that even those who receive alms of the parish should not only have whole garments made of this operose manufacture but likewise that as soon as they are soild to restore them to their pristine purity they should make use of one of the most judicious as well as difficult compositions that chymistry can boast of with which dissolvd in water by the help of fire the most detersive and yet innocent lixivium is prepard that human industry has hitherto been able to invent it is certain time was that the things i speak of would have bore those lofty expressions    and in which every body would have reasond after the same manner but the age we live in would call a man fool who should talk of extravagance and nicety if he saw a poor woman after having wore her crown cloth smock a whole week wash it with a bit of stinking soap of a groat a pound the arts of brewing and making bread have by slow degrees been brought to the perfection they now areb in but to have invented them at once and     à priori would have required more knowledge and a deeper insight into the nature of fermentation than the greatest philosopher has hitherto been endowed with yet the fruits of both are now enjoyd by the meanest of our species and a starving wretch knows not how to make a more humble or a more modest petition than by asking for a bit of bread or a draught of small beer man has learnd by experience that nothing was softer than the small plumes and down of birds and found that heapd together they would by their elasticity gently resist any incumbent weight and heave up again of themselves as soon as the pressure is over to make use of them to sleep upon was no doubt first invented to compliment the vanity as well as ease of the wealthy and potent but they are long since become so common that almost every body lies upon featherbeds and to substitute flocks in the room of them is counted a misera   ble shift of the most necessitous what a vast height must luxury have been arrivd to before it could be reckond a hardship to repose upon the soft wool of animals from caves huts hovels tents and barracks with which mankind took up at first we are come to warm and wellwrought houses and the meanest habitations to be seen in cities are regular buildings contrivd by persons skilld in proportions and architecture if the ancient britons and gauls should come out of their graves with what amazement woud they gaze on the mighty structures every where raisd for the poor should they behold the magnificence of a chelseycollege  a greenwichhospital       or what surpasses all them a des invalides at paris and see the care the plenty the superfluities and pomp which people that have no possessions at all are treated with in those stately palaces those who were once the greatest and richest ofa the land would have reason to envy the most reduced of our species now another piece of luxury the poor enjoy that is not lookd upon as such and which there is no doubt but the wealthiest in a golden age would abstain from is their making use of the flesh of animals to eat in what concerns the fashions and manners of the ages men live in they never examine into the real worth or merit of the cause and generally    judge of things not as their reason but custom directb them time was when the funeral rites in the disposing of the dead were performd by fire and the cadavers of the greatest emperors were burnt to ashes then burying the corps in the ground was a funeral for slaves or madec a punishment for the worst of malefactors now nothing is decent or honourable but interring and burning the body is reservd for crimes of the blackest dye at some times we look upon trifles with horror at other times we can behold enormities without concern if we see a man walk with his hat on in a church though out of service time it shocks us but if on a sunday night we meet half a dozen fellows drunk in the street the sight makes little or no impression upon us if a woman at a merrymaking dresses in mans clothes it is reckond a frolick amongst friends and he that finds too much fault with it is counted censorious upon the stage it isd done without reproach and     the most virtuous ladies will dispense with it in an actress tho every body has a full view of her legs and thighs but if the same woman as soon as she has petticoats on again should show her leg to a man as high as her knee it would be a very immodest action and every body will call her impudent for it    i have often thought if it was not for this tyranny which custom usurps over us that men of any tolerable goodnature could never be reconcild to the killing of so many animals for their daily food as long as the bountiful earth so plentifully provides them with varieties of vegetable dainties i know that reason excites our compassion but faintly and therefore i would not wonder how men should so little commiserate such imperfect creatures as crayfish oysters cockles and indeed all fish in general as they are mute and their inward formation as well as outward figure vastly different from ours they express themselves unintelligibly to us and therefore tis not strange that their grief should not affect our understanding which it cannot reach for nothing stirs us to pity so effectually as when the symptoms of misery strike immediately upon our senses and i have seen people movd at the noise a live lobster makes upon the spit that could have killd half a dozen fowls with pleasure but in such perfect animals as sheep and oxen in whom the heart the brain and nerves differ so little from ours and in whom the separation of the spirits  from the blood the organs of sense and consequently feeling it self are the same as they are in human creatures i cant imagine how a man not hardned in blood and massacre is able to see a vio   lent death and the pangs of it without concern in answer to this most people will think it sufficient to say that all things being allowd to be made for the service of man there can be no cruelty in putting     creatures to the use they were designd for but i have heard men make this reply while their nature within them has reproachd them with the falshood of the assertion there is of all the multitude not one man in ten but what will own if he was not brought up in a slaughterhouse that of all trades he could never have been a butcher and i question whether ever any body so much as killed a chicken without reluctancy the first time some people are not to be persuaded to taste of any creatures they have daily seen and been acquainted with while they were alive others extend their scruple no further than to their own poultry and refuse to eat what they fed and took care of themselves yet all of them will feed heartily and without remorse on beef mutton and fowls when they are bought in the market in this behaviour methinks there appears something like a consciousness of guilt it looks as if they endeavourd to save themselves from the imputation of a crime which they know sticks somewhere by removing the cause of it as far as they can from themselves and i can discover in it some strong remains of primitive    pity and innocence which all the arbitrary power of custom and the violence of luxury have not yet been able to conquer what i build upon i shall be told is a folly that wise men are not guilty of i own it but while it proceeds from a real passion inherent in our nature it is sufficient to demonstrate that we are born with a repugnancy to the killing and consequently the eating of animals for it is impossible that a natural appetite should ever prompt us to act or desire others to do what we have an aversion to be it as foolish as it will every body knows that surgeons in the cure of dangerous wounds and fractures the extirpationsa of limbs and other dreadful operations are often     compelld to put their patients to extraordinary torments and that the more desperate and calamitous cases occur to them the more the outcries and bodily sufferings of others must become familiar to them for this reason our english law out of a most affectionate regard to the lives of the subject allows them not to be of any jury upon life and death as supposing that their practice it self is sufficient to harden and extinguish in them that tenderness without which no man is capable of setting a true value upon the lives of his fellowcreatures now if we ought to have no concern for what we do to brute beasts and there was not imagind to be any   0cruelty in killing them why should of all callings butchers and only they jointly with surgeons be excluded from being jurymen by the same law  i shall urge nothing of what pythagoras and many other wise men have said concerning this barbarity of eating flesh i have gone too much out of my way already and shall therefore beg the reader if he would have any more of this to run over the following     fable or else if he be tired to let it alone with an assurance that in doing of either he shall equally oblige me a roman merchant in one of the carthaginian wars was cast away upon the coast of africk himself and his slave with great difficulty got safe ashore but going in quest of relief were met by aa lion of a mighty size it happened to be one of the breed that rangd in æsops days and one that could not only speak several languages but seemd moreover very well acquainted with human affairs the slave got upon a tree but his master not thinking himself safe there and having heard much of the generosity of lions fell down prostrate before him with all the signs of fear and submission the lion who had lately filld his belly bids him rise and for a while lay by his fears assuring him withal that he should not be touchd if he could give him any tolerable reasons why he    should not be devoured the merchant obeyed and having now received some glimmering hopes of safety gave a dismal account of the shipwrack he had suffered and endeavouring from thence to raise the lions pity pleaded his cause with abundance of good rhetorick but observing by the countenance of the beastb that flattery and fine words made very little impression he betook himself to arguments of greater solidity and reasoning from the excellency of mans nature and abilities remonstrated how improbable it was that the gods should not have designed him for a better use than to be eat by savage beasts upon this the lion became more attentive and vouchsafed now and then a reply till at last the following dialogue ensued between them oh vain and covetous animal said the lion whose pride and avarice can make him leave his native soil where his natural wants might be plentifully supplyd and try rough seas and dangerous     mountains to find out superfluities why should you esteem your species above ours and if the gods have given you a superiority over all creatures then why beg you of an inferior our superiority answerd the merchant consists not in bodily force but strength of understanding the gods have endued us with a rational soul which tho invisible is much the better part of us i desire to touch nothing of you but what is good to eat    but why do you value your self so much upon that part which is invisible because it is immortal and shall meet with rewards after death for the actions of this life and the just shall enjoy eternal bliss and tranquillity with the heroes and demigods in the elysian fields what life have you led i have honoured the gods and studyd to be beneficial to man then why do you fear death if you think the gods as just as you have been i have a wife and five small children that must come to want if they lose me i have two whelps that are not big enough to shift for themselves that are in want now and must actually be starvd if i can provide nothing for them your children will be provided for one way or other at least as well when i have eat you as if you had been drownd as to the excellency of either species the value of things among you has ever increasd with the scarcity of them and to a million of men there is hardly one lion besides that in the great veneration man pretends to have for his kind there is little sincerity farther than it concerns the share which every ones pride has in it for himself tis a folly to boast of the tenderness shewn and attendance given to your young ones or the excessive and lasting trouble bestowd in the education of ema man being born the most necessitous and most helpless animal this is only an instinct of nature which in all creatures has ever proportiond    the care of the parents to the wants and imbecillities of the offspring but if ab man had a real value for his kind how is it possible     that often ten thousand of them and sometimes ten times as many should be destroyd in few hours for the caprice of two all degrees of men despise those that are inferior to them and if you could enter into the hearts of kings and princes you would hardly find any but what have less value for the greatest part of the multitudes they rule over than those have for the cattle that belonga to them why should so many pretend to derive their race tho but spuriously from the immortal gods why should all of them suffer others to kneel down before them and more or less take delight in having divine honours payd them but to insinuate that themselves are of a more exalted nature and a species superior to that of their subjects savage i am but no creature can be calld cruel but what either by malice or insensibility extinguishes his natural pity the lion was born without compassion we follow the instinct of our nature the gods have appointed us to live upon the waste and spoil of other animals and as long as we can meet with dead ones we never hunt after the living tis only man mischievous man that can make death a sport  nature taught your stomach to crave nothing but vegetables but your violent fondness to change and greater eagerness after    novelties have prompted you to the destruction of animals without justice or necessity perverted your nature and warpd your appetites which way soever your pride or luxury have calld them the lion has     a ferment within him that consumes the toughest skin and hardest bones as well as the flesh of all animals without exception your squeamish stomach in which the digestive heat is weak and inconsiderable wont so much as admit of the most tender parts of them unless above half the concoction has been performd by artificial fire beforehand and yet what animal have you spared to satisfy the caprices of a languid appetite languid i say for what is mans hunger if compard to the lions yours when it is at the worsta makes you faint mine makes me mad oft have i tried with roots and herbs to allay the violence of it but in vain nothing but large quantities of flesh can any ways appease it yet the fierceness of our hunger notwithstanding lions have often requited benefits received but ungrateful and perfidious man feeds on the sheep that clothes him and spares not her innocent young ones whom he has taken into his care and custody if you tell me the gods made man master over all other creatures what tyranny was it then to destroy them out of wantonness no fickle timorous animal the gods have made you for society    and designd that millions of you when well joind together should compose the strong leviathan  a single lion bears some sway in the creation but what is single man a small and inconsiderable part a trifling atom of one great beast what nature designs she executes and tis not safe to judge of what she purposd but from the effects she shews if she had intended that man as man from a superiority of species should   0 lord it over all other animals the tiger nay the whale and eagle would have obeyd his voice but if your wit and understanding exceeds ours ought not the lion in deference to that superiority to follow the maxims of men with whom nothing is more sacred than that the reason of the strongest is ever the most prevalent  whole multitudes of you have conspird and compassd the destruction of one after they had ownd the gods had made him their superior and one has often ruind and cut off whole multitudes whom by the same gods he had sworn to defend and maintain man never acknowledgd superiority without power and why should i the excellence i boast of is visible all animals tremble at the sight of the lion not out of panick fear the gods have given me swiftness to overtake and strength to conquer whatever comes near me where is there a creature that has teeth and claws like mine behold the thickness of these massy jawbones    consider the width of them and feel the firmness of this brawny neck the nimblest deer the wildest boar the stoutest horse and strongest bull are my prey wherever i meet them  thus spoke the lion and the merchant fainted away the lion in my opinion has stretchd the point too far yet when to soften the flesh of male animals we have by castration prevented the firmness their tendons and every fibre would have come to without it i confess i think it ought to move a human creature when he reflects upon the cruel care with which they are fatned for destruction when a large and gentle bullock after having resisted a ten times greater force of blows than would have killd his murderer falls stunnd at last and his armd head is fastend to the ground with cords as soon as the wide wound is made and the jugulars are cut asunder what mortal     cana without compassion hear the painful bellowings intercepted by his blood the bitter sighs that speak the sharpness of his anguish and the deep sounding grones with loud anxiety fetchd from the bottom of his strong and palpitating heart look on the trembling and violent convulsions of his limbs see while his reeking gore streams from him his eyes become dim and languid and behold his strugglings gasps and last efforts for life the certain signs of his approaching fate when a creature has given    such convincing and undeniable proofs of the terrors upon him and the pains and agonies he feels is there a follower of descartes so inurd to blood as not to refute by his commiseration the philosophy of that vain reasoner  remark q remark q qb —— —— —— for frugally they now livd on their salary page    line   when people have small comings in and are honest withal it is then that the generality of them begin to be frugal and not before frugality in     ethicks is calld that virtue from the principle of which men abstain from superfluities and despising the operose contrivances of art to procure either ease or pleasure content themselves with the natural simplicity of things and are carefully temperate in the enjoyment of them without any tincture of covetousness frugality thus limited is perhaps scarcer than many may imagine but what is generally understood by it is a quality more often to be met with and consists in a medium between profuseness and avarice rather leaning to the latter as this prudent oeconomy which some people call    saving is in private families the most certain method to increase an estate soa some imagine that whether a country be barren or fruitful the same method if generally pursued which they think practicable will have the same effect upon a whole nation  and that for example the english might be much richer than they are if they would be as frugal as some of their neighbours this i think is an error which to prove i shall first refer the reader to what has been said upon this head in remark l and then go on thus experience teaches us first that as people differ in their views and perceptions of things so they vary in their inclinations one man is given to covetousness another to prodigality and a third is only saving secondly that men are never or at least very seldom reclaimed from their darling passions either by reason or precept and that if any thing ever draws em from what they are naturally propense to it must be a change in their circumstances or their fortunes     if we reflect upon these observations we shall find that to render the generality of a nation lavish the product of the country must be considerable in proportion to the inhabitants and what they are profuse of cheap that on the contrary to make a nation generally frugal the necessaries of life must be scarce and consequently dear and that therefore let the best politician do what he    can the profuseness or frugality of a people in general must always depend upon and will in spite of his teeth be ever proportiond to the fruitfulness and product of the country the number of inhabitants and the taxes they are to bear  if any body would refute what i have said let hima only prove from history that there ever was in any country a national frugality without a national necessity let us examine then what things are requisite to aggrandize and enrich a nation the first desirable blessings for any society of men areb a fertile soil and a happy climate a mild government and more land than people these things will render man easy loving honest and sincere in this condition they may be as virtuous as they can without the least injury to the publick and consequently as happy as they please themselves but they shall have no arts or sciences or be quiet longer than their neighbours will let them they must be poor ignorant and almost wholly destitute of what we call the comforts of life     and all the cardinal virtues together wont so much as procure a tolerable coat or a porridgepot among themc for in this state of slothful ease and stupid innocence as you need not fear great vices so you must not expect any considerable virtues man never exerts himself but when he is rousd by his desires while they lie dormant and there is nothing to raise them  00his excellence and abilities will be for ever undiscoverd and the lumpish machine without the influence of his passions may be justly compard to a huge windmill without a breath of air would you render a society of men strong and powerful you must touch their passions divide the land tho there be never so much to spare and their possessions will make them covetous rouse them tho but in jest from their idleness with praises and pride will set them to work in earnest teach them trades and handicrafts and youll bring envy and emulation among them to increase their numbers set up a variety of manufactures and leave no ground uncultivated let property be inviolably secured and privileges equal to all men suffer no body to act but what is lawful and every body to think what he pleases for a country where every body may be maintained that will be employd and the other maxims are observd must always be throngd and can never want people as long as there is any in the world would you have them bold and warlike turn to military discipline make good use of their fear and flatter their vanity with art and assiduity but would you moreover render them an opulent knowing and polite nation teach em commerce with foreign countries and if possible get into the sea which to compass spare no labour nor indus 0 try and let no difficulty deter you from it then promote navigation cherish the merchant and encourage trade in every branch of it this will bring riches and where they are arts and sciences will soon follow and by the help of what i have named and good     management it is that politicians can make a people potent renownd and flourishing but would you have a frugal and honest society the best policy is to preserve men in their native simplicity strive not to increase their numbers let them never be acquainted with strangers or superfluities but remove and keep from them every thing that might raise their desires or improve their understanding great wealth and foreign treasure will ever scorn to come among men unless youll admit their inseparable companions avarice and luxury where trade is considerable fraud will intrude to be at once wellbred and sincere is no less than a contradiction and therefore while man advances in knowledge and his manners are polishd we must expect to see at the same time his desires enlargd his appetites refind and his vices increasd the dutch may ascribe theira present grandeur to the virtue and frugality of their ancestors as they please but what made that contemptible spot of ground so considerable among the principal powers of europe has been their political wisdom in postponing every  0 thing to merchandize and navigation the unlimited liberty of conscience that is enjoyd among them and the unwearied application with which they have always made use of the most effectual means to encourage and increase trade in general they never were noted for frugality before philip ii of spain began to rage over them with that unheardof tyranny their laws were trampled upon their rights and large immunities taken from them and their constitution torn to pieces several of their chief nobles were condemnd and executed without legal form of process complaints and remonstrances were punishd as severely as resistance and those that escaped being massacred were plundered by ravenous soldiers as this was intolerable to a people that had always been used to the     mildest of governments and enjoyd greater privileges than any of the neighbouring nations so they chose rather to die in arms than perish by cruel executioners if we consider the strength spain had then and the low circumstances those distressd states were in there never was heard of a more unequal strife yet such was their fortitude and resolution that only seven of those provinces  uniting themselves together maintaind against the greatest and bestdisciplind nation in europe the most tedious and bloody war that is to be met with in ancient or modern historya  0 rather than to become a victim to theb spanish fury  they were contented to live upon a third part of their revenues and lay out far the greatest part of their income in defending themselves against their merciless enemies these hardships and calamities of a war within their bowels first put them upon that extraordinary frugality and the continuance under the same difficulties for above fourscore years could not but render it customary and habitual to them but all their arts of saving and penurious way of living could never have enabled them to make head against so potent an enemy if their industry in promoting their fishery and navigation in general had not helpd to supply the natural wants and disadvantages they labourd under the country is so small and so populous that there is not land enough though hardly an inch of it is unimprovd to feed the tenth part of the inhabitants holland it self is full of large rivers and lies lower than the sea which would run over it every tide and wash it away in one winter if it was not kept out by vast banks and huge walls the repairs of     those as well as their sluices keys mills and other necessaries they are forcd to make use of to keep themselves from being drownd are a greater expence to them one year with another than could be raisd by a general land tax of four shillings in the  0 pound if to be deducted from the neat produce of the landlords revenue is it aa wonder that people under such circumstances and loaden with greater taxes besides than any other nation should be obliged to be saving but why must they be a pattern to others who besides that they are more happily situated are much richer within themselves and have to the same number of people above ten times the extent of ground the dutch and we often buy and sell at the same markets and so far our views may be said to be the same otherwise the interests and political reasonsb of the two nations as to the private oeconomy of either are very different it is their interest to be frugal and spend little because they must have every thing from abroad except butter cheese and fish and therefore of them especially the latter they consume three times the quantity which the same number of people do here it is our interest to eat plenty of beef and mutton to maintain the farmer and further improve ourc land of which we have enough to feed our selves and as many more if it was better cultivated the dutch perhaps have more shipping and more ready money than we but then thosed are only to be considered as the tools they work with so a carrier may have more horses than a man of ten times his worth and a banker that has not above fifteen or sixteen hundred pounds  0 in the world may have generally more ready cash by him than a gentleman of two thousand a year he that keeps three or four stagecoaches to get his bread is to a gentleman that keeps a coach for his pleasure what     the dutch are in comparison to us having nothing of their own but fish they are carriers and freighters to the rest of the world while the basis of our trade chiefly depends upon our own product another instance that what makes the bulk of the people saving are heavy taxes scarcity of land and such things that occasion a dearth of provisions may be given from what is observable among the dutch themselves in the province of holland there is a vast trade and an unconceivable treasure of money the land is almost as rich as dung it self and as i have said once already not an inch of it unimprovd in gelderland and overyssel theres hardly any trade and very little money the soil is very indifferent and abundance of ground lies waste then what is the reason that the same dutch in the two latter provinces tho poorer than the first are yet less stingy and more hospitable nothing but that their taxes in most things are less extravagant and in proportion to the number of people theya have a great deal more ground what they save in holland they save out of their bellies tis eatables  0 drinkables and fewel that their heaviest taxes are upon but they wear better clothes and have richer furniture than youll find in the other provinces those that are frugal by principle are so in every thing but in holland the people are only sparing in such things as are daily wanted and soon consumed in what is lasting they are quite otherwise in pictures and marble they are profuse in their buildings and gardens they are extravagant to folly in other countries you may meet with stately courts and palaces of great extent that belong to princes which no body can expect in a commonwealth where so much equality is observd as there is in this but in all europe you shall find no private buildings so sumptuously magnificent as a great many of the     merchants and other gentlemens houses are in amsterdam and some other great cities of that small province and the generality of those that build there lay out a greater proportiona of their estates on the houses they dwell in than any people upon the earth the nation i speak of was never in greater straits nor their affairs in a more dismal posture sinceb they were a republick than in the year      and the beginning of       what we know of their oeconomy and constitution with any certainty has been chiefly owing to sir william temple whose obser 0 vations upon their manners and government itc is evident from several passages in his memoirs were made about that time  the dutch indeed were then very frugal but since those days and that their calamities have not been so pressing tho the common people on whom the principal burthen of all excises and impositions liesd are perhaps much as they were a great alteration has been made among the better sort of people in their equipages entertainments and whole manner of living those who would have it that the frugality of that nation flows not so much from necessity as a general aversion to vice and luxury will put us in mind of their publick administration and smalness of salaries their prudence in bargaining for and buying stores and other necessaries the great care they take not to be imposed upon by those that serve them and   0 their severity against them that break their contracts but what they would ascribe to the virtue and honesty of ministers is wholly due to their strict regulations concerning the management of the publick treasure from which their admirable form of government will not suffer them to depart and indeed one good man may take anothers word if they so agree but a whole nation ought never to trust to any honesty but what is built upon necessity for unhappy is the people and their constitution will be ever precarious whose  0 welfare must depend upon the virtues and consciences of ministers and politicians the dutch generally endeavour to promote as much frugality among their subjects as tis possible not because it is a virtue but because it is generally speaking their interest as i have shewd before for as this latter changes so they alter their maxims as will be plain in the following instance as soon as their eastindia ships come home the company pays off the men and many of them receive the greatest part of what they have been earning in seven or eight and some fifteen or sixteen years time these poor fellows are encouragd to spend their money with all profuseness imaginable and considering that most of them when they set out at first were reprobates that under the tuition of a strict discipline and a miserable diet have been so long kept at hard labour without money in the midst of danger it cannot be difficult to make them lavish as soon as they have plenty they squander away in wine women and musick as much as people of their taste and education are well capable of and are sufferd so they but abstain from doing of mischief to revel and riot with greater licentiousness than is customary to be allowd to others you may in some cities see them accompanied with three or four lewd women few of them sober run roaring through the streets by broad daylight      0 with a fidler before them and if the money to their thinking goes not fast enough these ways theyll find out others and sometimes fling it among the mob by handfuls this madness continues in most of them while they have any thing left which never lasts long and for this reason by a nickname they are called lords of six weeks that being generally the time by which the company has other ships ready to depart where these infatuated wretches their money being gone are forcd to enter themselves again and may have leisure to repent their folly in this stratagem there is a double policy first if these sailors that have been inured to the hot climates and unwholesome air and diet should be frugal and stay in their own country the company would be continually obligd to employ fresh men of which besides that they are not so fit for their business hardly one in two ever lives in some places of the eastindies which would often prove a great charge as well as disappointment to them the second is that the large sums so often distributed among those sailors are by this means made immediately to circulate throughout the country from whence by heavy excisesa and other impositions the greatest part of it is soon drawn back into the publick treasure   0to convince the champions for national frugality by another argument that what they urge is impracticable well suppose that i am mistaken in every thing which in remark l i have said in behalf of luxury and the necessity of it to maintain trade after that let us examine what a general frugality if it was by art and management to be forcd upon people whether they have occasion for it or not would produce in suchb a nation as ours well grant then that all the people in great britain shall consume but four fifths of what they do now and so lay byc one fifth part of their income i shall not speak     of what influence this would have upon almost every trade as well as the farmer the grazier and the landlord but favourably suppose what is yet impossible thata the same work shall be done and consequently the same handicrafts be employd as there are now the consequence would be that unless money should all at once fall prodigiously in value and every thing else contrary to reason grow very dear at the five years end all the working people and the poorest of labourers for i wont meddle with any of the rest wouldb be worth in ready cash as much as they now spend in a whole year which by the by would be more money than ever the nation had at once let us now overjoyd with this increase of wealth take a view of the condition the    working people would be in and reasoning from experience and what we daily observe of them judge what their behaviour would be in such a case every body knows that there is a vast number of journeymen weavers tailors clothworkers and twenty other handicrafts who if by four days labour in a week they can maintain themselves will hardly be persuaded to work the fifth and that there are thousands of labouring men of all sorts who will tho they can hardly subsist put themselves to fifty inconveniences disoblige their masters pinch their bellies and run in debt to make holidays when men shew such an extraordinary proclivity to idleness and pleasure what reason have we to think that they would ever work unless they were obligd to it by immediate necessity      when we see an artificer that cannot be drove to his work before tuesday because the monday morning he has two shillings left of his last weeks pay why should we imagine he would go to it at all if he had fifteen or twenty pounds in his pocket what would at this rate become of our manufactures if the merchant would send cloth abroad he must make it himself for the clothier cannot get one man out of twelve that used to work for him if what i speak of was only to befal the journeymen shoemakers and no body else in less than a twelvemonth half of us would go barefoot the chief and    most pressing use there is for money in a nation is to pay the labour of the poor and when there is a real scarcity of it those who have a great many workmen to pay will always feel it first yet notwithstanding this great necessity of coin it woud be easier where property was well secured to live without money than without poor for who would do the work for this reason the quantity of circulating coin in a country ought always to be proportiond to the number of hands that are employd and the wages of labourers to the price of provisionsa from whence it is demonstrable that whateverb procures plenty makes labourersc cheap where the poor are well managed who as they ought to be kept from starving so they should receive nothing worth saving if here and there one of the lowest class by uncommon industry and pinching his belly lifts himself above the condition he was brought up in no body ought to hinder him nay it is undeniably the wisest course for every person in the society and for every private family to be frugal but it is the interest of all rich     nations that the greatest part of the poor should almost never be idle and yet continually spend what they get all men as sir william temple observes very well  are more prone to ease and pleasure than they are to labour when they are not prompted to ita by pride or avarice and those    that get their living by their daily labour are seldom powerfullyb influencd by either so that they have nothing to stir them up to be serviceable but their wants which it is prudence to relieve but folly to cure the only thing then that can render the labouringc man industrious is a moderate quantity of money for as too little will according as his temper is either dispirit or make him desperate so too much will make him insolent and lazy a man would be laughd at by most people who should maintain that too much money could undo a nation yet this has been the fate of spain  to this the learned don diego savedra ascribes the ruin of his country  the fruits of the earth in former     ages had made spain so rich that king lewis xi of france being come to the court of toledo  was astonishd at its splendour and said that he had never seen any thing to be compard to it either in europe or asia he that in his travels to the holyland had run through every province of them in the kingdom of castille alone if we may believe some writers therea were for the holy war from all parts of the world got together one hundred thousand foot ten thousand horse and sixty thousand carriages for baggage which alonso iii  maintaind at his own charge and paid every day as well soldiers as officers and princes every one according to his rank and dignity nay down to the reign of fer   dinand and isabella who equippd columbus and some time after spain was a fertile country where trade and manufactures flourished and had a knowing industrious people to boast of but as soon as that mighty treasure that was obtaind with more hazard and cruelty than the world till then had known and which to come at by the spaniards own confession  had cost the lives of twenty millions of     indians as soon i say as that ocean of treasure came rolling in upon them it took away their senses and their industry forsook them the farmer left his plough the mechanick his tools the merchant his comptinghouse and every body scorning to work took his pleasure and turnd gentleman they thought they had reason to value themselves above all their neighbours and now nothing but the conquest of the world would serve them  the consequence of this has been that other nations have supplyd what their own sloth and pride denyd them and when every body saw that notwithstanding all the prohibitions the government could make against the exportation of bullion the spaniard would part with his money and bring it you aboard himself at the hazard of his neck all the world endeavoured to work for spain gold and silver being by this means yearly divided and shared among all the trading countries have made all things dear and most nations of    europe industrious except their owners who ever since their mighty acquisitions sit with their arms across and wait every year with impatience and anxiety the arrival of their revenues from abroad to pay others for what they have spent already and thus by too much money the making of colonies and other mismanagements of which it was the occasion spain is from a fruitful and wellpeopled country with all its mighty titles and possessions made a barren and empty thoroughfare thro which gold and silver pass from america to the rest of the world and the nation from a rich acute diligent and laborious become a slow idle proud and beggarly people so much for spain the next country where money may be called the product     is portugal and the figure which that kingdom with all its gold makes in europe i think is not much to be envied the great art then to make a nation happy and what we call flourishing consists in giving every body an opportunity of being employd which to compass let a governments first care be to promote as great a variety of manufactures arts and handicrafts as human wit can invent and the second to encourage agriculture and fishery in all their branches that the whole earth may be forcd to exert it self as well as man for as the one is an infallible maxim to draw vast multitudes of people into    a nation so the other is the only method to maintain them it is from this policy and not the trifling regulations of lavishness and frugality which will ever take their own course according to the circumstances of the people that the greatness and felicity of nations must be expected for let the value of gold and silver either rise or fall the enjoyment of all societies will ever depend upon the fruits of the earth and the labour of the people  both which     joined together are a more certain a more inexhaustible and a more real treasure than the gold of brazil or the silver of potosi  remark r remark r ra no honour now c page    line    honour in its figurative sense is a chimera without truth or being an invention of moralists and politicians and signifies a certain principle of virtue  not related to religion found in some men that keeps em close to their duty and engagements whatever they be as for example a man of honour enters into a conspiracy with others to murder a king he is obliged to go thorough stitch    with it and if overcome by remorse or goodnature he startles at the enormity of his purpose discovers the plot and turns a witness against his accomplices he then forfeits his honour at least     among the party he belonged to the excellency of this principle is that the vulgar are destitute of it and it is only to be met with in people of the better sort as some oranges have kernels and others not tho the outside be the same in great families it is like the gout generally counted hereditary and all lords children are born with it in some that never felt any thing of it it is acquired by conversation and reading especially of romances in others by preferment but there is nothing that encourages the growth of it more than a sword and upon the first wearing of one some people have felt considerable shoots of it in four and twenty hours the chief and most important care a man of honour ought to have is the preservation of this principle and rather than forfeit it he must lose his employments and estate nay life it self for which reason whatever humility he may shew by way of goodbreeding he is allowd to put an inestimable value upon himself as a possessor of this invisible ornament the only method to preserve this principle is to live up to the rules of honour which are laws he is to walk by himself is obligd always to be faithful to his trust to    prefer the publick interest to his own not to tell lies nor defraud or wrong any body and from others to suffer no affront which is a term of art for every action designedly done to undervalue him the men of ancient honour of which i reckon don quixote to have been the last upon record were very nice observers of all these laws and a great many more than i have named but the moderns seem to be more remiss they have a profound veneration for the last of em but they pay not an equal obedience to any of the other and whoever will but strictly comply with that i hint at shall have abundance of trespasses against all the rest connivd at a man of honour is always counted impartial and a man of sense of course for no body ever heard of  00 a man of honour that was a fool for this reason he has nothing to do with the law and is always allowd to be a judge in his own case and if the least injury be done either to himself or his friend his relation his servant his dog or any thing which he is pleased to take under his honourable protection satisfaction must be forthwith demanded and if it proves an affront and he that gave it likewise a man of honour a battle must ensue from all this it is evident that a man of honour must be possessed of courage and that without it his    other principle would be no more than a sword without a point let us therefore examine what courage consists in and whether it be as most people will have it a real something that valiant men have in their nature distinct from all their other qualities or not there is nothing so universally sincere upon earth as the love which all creatures that are capable of any bear to themselves and as there is no love but what implies a care to preserve the thing beloved so there is nothing more sincere in any creature than his will wishes and endeavours to preserve himself this is the law of nature by which no creature is endued with any appetite or passion but what either directly or indirectly tends to the preservation either of himself or his species the means by which nature obliges every creature continually to stir in this business of selfpreservation are grafted in him and in man calld desires which either compel him to crave what he thinks will sustain or please him or command him to avoid what he imagines might displease hurt or destroy him these desires or passions have all their different symptoms by which they manifest themselves to those they disturb and from that variety of disturbances they make within us their various denominations have been given them as has been shewn already in pride and shame   0the passion that is raisd in us when we apprehend that mischief is approaching us is calld fear the  0  disturbance it makes within us is always more or less violent in proportion not of the danger but our apprehension of the mischief dreaded whether real or imaginary our fear then being always proportiond to the apprehension we have of the danger it follows that while that apprehension lasts a man can no more shake off his fear than he can a leg or an arm in a fright it is true the apprehension of danger is so sudden and attacks us so lively as sometimes to take away reason and senses that when tis over we often dont remember that we had any apprehension at all but from the event tis plain we had it for how could we have been frightend if we had not apprehended that some evil or other was coming upon us most people are of opinion that this apprehension is to be conquerd by reason but i confess i am not those that have been frightend will tell you that as soon as they could recollect themselves that is make use of their reason their apprehension was conquerd but this is no conquest at all for in a fright the danger was either altogether imaginary or else it is past by that time they can make use of their reason and therefore if they find there is no danger it is no wonder that they should not apprehend any but when the dan   ger is permanent let them then make use of their reason and theyll find that it may serve them to examine the greatness and reality of the danger and that if they find it less than they imagind thea apprehension will be lessend accordingly but if the danger proves real and the same in every circumstance as they took it to be at first then their reason instead of diminishing will rather increase their apprehension  while this fear lasts no creature  0  can fight offensively and yet we see brutes daily fight obstinately and worry one another to death so that some other passion must be able to overcome this fear and the most contrary to it is anger which to trace to the bottom i must beg leave to make another digression no creature can subsist without food nor any species of them i speak of the more perfect animals continue long unless young ones are continually born as fast as the old ones die therefore the first and fiercest appetite that nature has given them is hunger the next is lust the one prompting them to procreate as the other bids them eat now if we observe that anger is that passion which is raisd in us when we are crossd or disturbd in our desires and that as it sums up all the strength in creatures so it was given them that by it they might exert themselves more vigorously in endeavouring to remove overcome or destroy    whatever obstructs them in the pursuit of selfpreservation we shall find that brutes unless themselves or what they love or the liberty of either are threatend or attackd have nothing worth notice that can move them to anger but hunger or lust tis they that make them more fierce for we must observe that the appetites of creatures are as actually crossd while they want and cannot meet with what they desire tho perhaps with less violence as when hinderd from enjoying what they have in view what i have said will appear more plainly if we but mind what no body can be ignorant of which is this all creatures upon earth live either upon the fruits and product of it or else the flesh of other animals their fellowcreatures the latter which we call beasts of prey nature has armd accordingly and given them weapons and  0  strength to overcome and tear asunder those whom she has designd for their food and likewise a much keener appetite than to other animals that live upon herbs c for as to the first if a cow lovd mutton as well as she does grass being made as she is and having no claws or talons and but one row of teeth before that are all of an equal length she would be starvd even among a flock of sheep secondly as to their voraciousness if experience did not teach it us our reason might in the first place it is highly probable that the hunger which can make a    creature fatigue harass and expose himself to danger for every bit he eats is more piercing than that which only bids him eat what stands before him and which he may have for stooping down in the second it is to be considered that as beasts of prey have an instinct by which they learn to crave trace and discover those creatures that are good food for them so the others have likewise an instinct that teaches them to shun conceal themselves and run away from those that hunt after them from hence it must follow that beasts of prey tho they could almost eat for ever go yet more often with empty bellies than other creatures whose victuals neither fly from nor oppose them this must perpetuate as well as increase their hunger which hereby becomes a constant fuel to their anger if you ask me what stirs up this anger in bulls and cocks that will fight to death and yet are neither animals of prey nor very voracious i answer lust those creatures whose rage proceeds from hunger both male and female attack every thing they can master and fight obstinately against all but the animals whose fury is provokd by a venereal ferment being generally males exert themselves chiefly against other males of the same species they may do mischief by chance to other creatures but the main objects of their hatred are their rivals and it is against them only that their    prowess and fortitude  0  are shewn we see likewise in all those creatures of which the male is able to satisfy a great number of females a more considerable superiority in the male expressd by nature in his make and features as well as fierceness than is observd in other creatures where the male is contented with one or two females dogs tho become domestick animals are ravenous to a proverb and those of them that will fight being carnivorous would soon become beasts of prey if not fed by us what we may observe in them is an ample proof of what i have hitherto advanced those of a true fighting breed being voracious creatures both male and female will fasten upon any thing and suffer themselves to be killd before they give over as the female is rather more salacious than the male so there is no difference in their make at all what distinguishes the sexes excepted and the female is rather the fiercest of the two a bull is a terrible creature when he is kept up but where he has twenty or more cows to range among in a little time hell become as tame as any of them and a dozen hens will spoil the best game cock in england harts and deer are counted chaste and timorous creatures and so indeed they are almost all the year long except in rutting time and then on a sudden they become bold to admiration and often make at the keepers themselves    that the influence of those two principal appetites hunger and lust upon the temper of animals is not so whimsical as some may imagine may be partly demonstrated from what is observable in our selves for though our hunger is infinitely less violent than that of wolves and other ravenous creatures yet we see that people who are in health and have a tolerable stomach are more fretful and sooner put out of humour for trifles when they stay for their victuals beyond their usual hours than at any other time and again tho lust in man is not so raging as it is in bulls and other salacious creatures yet nothing  0  provokes men and women both sooner and more violently to anger than what crosses their amours when they are heartily in love and the most fearful and tenderly educated of either sex have slighted the greatest dangers and set aside all other considerations to compass the destruction of a rival hitherto i have endeavourd to demonstrate that no creature can fight offensively as long as his fear lasts that fear cannot be conquerd but by another passion that the most contrary to it and most effectual to overcome it is anger that the two principal appetites which disappointed can stir up this lastnamed passion are hunger and lust and that in all brute beasts the proneness to anger and obstinacy in fighting generally depend upon the violence of either or both those appetites together    from whence it must follow that what we call prowess or natural courage in creatures is nothing but the effect of anger  and that all fierce animals must be either very ravenous or very lustful if not both let us now examine what by this rule we ought to judge of our own species from the tenderness of mans skin and the great care that is required for years together to rear him from the make of his jaws the evenness of his teeth the breadth of his nails and the slightness of both it is not probable that nature should have designd him for rapine for this reason his hunger is not voracious as it is in beasts of prey neither is he so salacious as other animals that are calld so and being besides very industrious to supply his wants he can have no reigning appetite to perpetuate his anger and must consequently be a timorous animal what i have said last must only be understood of man in his savage state for if we examine him as a member of a society and a taught animal we shall find him quite another creature as soon as his  0  pride has room to play and envy avarice and ambition begin to catch hold of him he is rousd from his natural innocence and stupidity as his knowledge increases his desires are enlargd and consequently his wants and appetites are multiplyd hence it must follow that he will be often crossd in the pursuit of them    and meet with abundance more disappointment to stir up his anger in this than his former condition and man would in a little time become the most hurtful and noxiousa creature in the world if let alone whenever he could overpower his adversary if he had no mischief to fear but from the person that angerd him the first care therefore of all governments is by severe punishments to curb his anger when it does hurt and so by increasing his fears prevent the mischief it might produce when various laws to restrain him from using force are strictly executed selfpreservation must teach him to be peaceable and as it is every bodys business to be as little disturbd as is possible his fears will be continually augmented and enlargd as he advances in experience understanding and foresight the consequence of this must be that as the provocations he will receive to anger will be infinite in the civilizd state so his fears to damp it will be the same and thus in a little time hell be taught byb his fears to destroy his anger and by art to consult in an opposite methodc the same selfpreservation for which nature before had furnished him with anger as well as the rest of his passions the only useful passion then that man is possessd of toward the peace and quiet of a society is his fear and the more you work    upon it the more orderly and governable hell be for how useful soever anger may be to man as he is a single creature by himself yet the society has no manner of occasion  0  for it but nature being always the same in the formation of animals produces all creatures as like to those that beget and bear them as the place she forms them in and the various influences from without will give her leave and consequently all men whether they are born in courts or forests are susceptible of anger when this passion overcomes as among all degrees of people it sometimes does the whole set of fears man has he has true courage  and will fight as boldly as a lion or a tiger and at no other time and i shall endeavour to prove that whatever is calld courage in man when he is not angry is spurious and artificial it is possible by good government to keep a society always quiet in it self but no body can insure peace from without for ever the society may have occasion to extend their limits further and enlarge their territories or others may invade theirs or something else will happen that man must be brought to fight for how civilizd soever men maya be they never forget that force goes beyond reason the politician now must alter his measures and take off some of mans fears he must strive to persuade him that all what was told him before of the barbarity of kil   ling men ceases as soon as these men are enemies to the publick and that their adversaries are neither so good nor so strong as themselves these things well managd will seldom fail of drawing the hardiest the most quarrelsome and the most mischievous in to combat but unless they are better qualifyd i wont answer for their behaviour there if once you can make them undervalue their enemies you may soon  0  stir them up to anger and while that lasts theyll fight with greater obstinacy than any disciplind troops but if any thing happens that was unforeseen and a sudden great noise a tempest or any strange or uncommon accident that seems to threaten em intervenes fear seizes em disarms their anger and makes em run away to a man this natural courage therefore as soon as people begin to have more wit must be soon exploded in the first place those that have felt the smart of the enemys blows wont always believe what is said to undervalue him and are often not easily provokd to anger secondly anger consisting in an ebullition of the spirits is a passion of no long continuance ira furor brevis est  and the enemies if they withstand the first shock of these angry people have commonly the better of it thirdly as long as people are angry all counsel and discipline are lost upon them and they can never be brought to   0use art or conduct in their battles anger then without which no creature has natural courage being altogether useless in a war to be managd by stratagem and brought into a regular art the government must find out an equivalent for courage that will make men fight whoever woulda civilize men and establish them intob a body politick must be thoroughly acquainted with all the passions and appetites strength and weaknesses of their frame and understand how to turn their greatest frailties to the advantage of the publick in the enquiry into the origin of moral virtue i have shewn how easily men were inducd to believe any thing that is said in their praise if therefore a lawgiver or politician whomc they have a great veneration for should tell them that the generality of men had within them a principle of valour distinct from anger or any other passion that made them to despise danger and face death it self  0  with intrepedity and that they who had the most of it were the most valuable of their kind it is very likely considering what has been said that most of them tho they felt nothing of this principle would swallow it for truth and that the proudest feeling themselves movd at this piece of flattery and not well versd in distinguishing the passions might imagine that they felt it heaving in their breasts by mistaking pride for cou   rage if but one in ten can be persuaded openly to declare that he is possessd of this principle and maintain it against all gainsayers there will soon be half a dozen that shall assert the same whoever has once ownd it is engaged the politician has nothing to do but to take all imaginable care to flatter the pride of those that brag of and are willing to stand by it a thousand different ways the same pride that drew him in first will ever after oblige him to defend the assertion till at last the fear of discovering the reality of his heart comesa to be so great that it outdoes the fear of death it self do but increase mans pride and hisb fear of shame will ever be proportiond to it for the greater value a man sets upon himself the more pains hell take and the greater hardships hell undergo to avoid shame the great art then to make man courageous is first to make him own this principle of valour within and afterwards to inspire him with as much horror against shame as nature has given him against death and that there are things to which man has or may have a stronger aversion than he has to death is evident from suicide  he that makes death his choice must look upon it as less terrible than what he shuns by it for whether the evil dreaded be present or to come real or imaginary no body would kill himself wilfully but to avoid something lucretia held out bravely    against all the attacks of the ravisher even when he threatened her life which shews that she   0 valud her virtue beyond it but when he threatend her reputation with eternal infamy she fairly surrenderd and then slew herself a certain sign that she valued her virtue less than her glory and her life less than either the fear of death did not make her yield for she resolvd to die before she did it and her compliance must only be considerd as a bribe to make tarquin forbear sullying her reputation so that life had neither the first nor second place in the esteem of lucretia  the courage then which is only useful to the body politick and what is generally calld true valour is artificial and consists in a superlative horror against shame by flattery infused into men of exalted pride  as soon as the notions of honour and shame are received among a society it is not difficult to make men fight first take care they are persuaded of the justice of their cause for no man fights heartily that thinks himself in the wrong  then shew them that their altars their possessions wives children and every thing that is near and dear to them is concerned in the present quarrel or at least may be influenced by it hereafter then put feathers in their caps and distinguish them from others talk of publickspiritedness the love of their country facing an enemy with intrepidity    despising deatha the bed of honour and such like highsounding words and every proud man will take up arms and fight himself to death before hell turn tail if     it be by daylight one man in an army is a check upon another and a hundred of them that single and without witness would be all cowards are for fear of incurring one anothers contempt made valiant by being together to continue and heighten this artificial courage all that run away ought to be punishd with ignominy those that fought well whether they did beat or were beaten must be flatterd and solemnly commended those that lost their limbs rewarded and those that were killd ought above all to be taken notice of artfully lamented and to have extraordinary encomiums bestowed upon them for to pay honours to the dead will ever be a sure method to make bubbles of the living when i say that the courage made use of in the wars is artificial i dont imagine that by the same art all men may be made equally valiant as men have not an equal share of pride and differ from one another in shape and inward structure it is impossible they should be all equally fit for the same uses some men will never be able to learn musick and yet make good mathematicians others will play excellently well upon the violin and yet be coxcombs as long as they live let them converse    with whom they please but to shew that therea is no evasion i shall prove that setting aside what i said of artificial courage already what the greatest heroe differs in from the rankest coward is altogether corporeal and depends upon the inward make of man what i mean is calld constitution by which is understood the orderly or disorderly mixture of the fluids in ourb body that constitution which favours courage consists in the natural strength elasticity and due contexture of the finer spirits and upon them wholly depends what we call stedfastness resolution and obstinacy it is the only ingredient that is common to natural and artificial bravery and is to either what size is to white walls which hinders them from     coming off and makes them lasting that some people are very much others very little frightend at things that are strange and sudden to them is likewise altogether owing to the firmness or imbecillity in the tone of the spirits pride is of no use in a fright because while it lasts we cant think which being counted a disgrace is the reason people are always angry with any thing that frightens them as soon as the surprize is over and when at the turn of a battle the conquerors give no quarter and are very cruel it is a sign their enemies fought well and had put them first into great fears    that resolution depends upon this tone of the spirits appears likewise from the effects of strong liquors the fiery particles whereof crowding into the brain strengthen the spirits their operation imitates that of anger which i said before was an ebullition of the spirits it is for this reason that most people when they are in drink are sooner touchd and more prone to anger than at other times and some raving mad without any provocation at all it is likewise observd that brandy makes men more quarrelsome at the same pitch of drunkenness than wine because the spirits of distilld waters have abundance of fiery particles mixt with them which the other has not the contexture of spirits is so weak in some that tho they have pride enough no art can ever make them fight or overcome their fears but this is a defect in the principle of the fluids as other deformities are faults of the solids  these pusillanimous people are never thoroughly provokd to anger where there is any danger and drinking ever makes em bolder     but seldom so resolute as to attack any unless they be women or children or such who they know dare not resist this constitution is often influenced by health and sickness and impaird by great losses of blood sometimes it is corrected by diet and it is this which the duke de la rochefocault means when he says vanity shame and above all consti   tution make up very often the courage of men and virtue of women  there is nothing that more improves the useful martial courage i treat of and at the same time shews it to be artificial than practice for when men are disciplind come to be acquainted with all the tools of death and engines of destruction whena the shouts the outcries the fire and smoke the grones of wounded and ghostlyb looks of dying men with all the various scenes of mangled carcases andc bloody limbs tore off begin to be familiar to them their fears abate apace not that they are now less afraid to die than before but being used so often to see the same dangers they apprehend the reality of them less than they did as they are deservedly valued for every siege they are at and every battle they are in it is impossible but the several actions they share in must continually become as many solid steps by which their pride mounts up and thus their fear of shame which as i said before will always be proportiond to their pride increasing as the apprehension of the danger decreases it is no wonder that most of them learn to discover little or no fear and some great generals are able to preserve a presence of mind and counterfeit a calm serenity within the midst of all the noise horror and confusion that attend a battle    so silly a creature is man as that intoxicated with the fumes of vanity he can feast on the thoughts of the praises that shall be paid his memory in future     ages with so much ecstasy as to neglect his present life nay court and covet death if he but imagines that it will add to the glory he had acquired before there is no pitch of selfdenial that a man of pride and constitution cannot reach nor any passion so violent but hell sacrifice it to another which is superior to it and here i cannota but admire at the simplicity of some good men who when they hear of the joy and alacrity with which holy men in persecutions have sufferd for their faith imagine that such constancy must exceed all human force unless it was supported by some miraculous assistance from heaven as most people are unwilling to acknowledge all the frailties of their species so they are unacquainted with the strength of our nature and know not that some men of firm constitution may work themselves up into enthusiasm  by no other help than the violence of their passions yet it is certain that there have been men who only assisted with pride and constitution to maintain the worst of causes have undergone death and torments with as much chearfulness as the best of men animated with piety and devotion ever did for the true religion    to prove this assertion i could produce many instances but one or two will be sufficient jordanus bruno of nola who wrote that sillyb piece of blasphemy calld spaccio della bestia triumphante  and the infamous vanini  were both executed for openly professing and teaching of atheism the latter might     have been pardond the moment before the execution if he would have retracted his doctrine but rather than recant he chose to be burnt to ashes as he went to the stake he was so far from shewing any concern that he held his hand out to a physician whom he happend to know desiring him to judge of the calmness of his mind by the regularity of his pulse and from thence taking an opportunity of making an impious comparison uttered a sentence too execrable to be mentiond  to these we may join one mahomet effendi who as sir paul ricaut tells us was put to death at constantinople for having advancd some notions against the existence of a god he likewise might have savd his life by confessing his error and renouncing it for the future but chose rather to persist in his blasphemies saying tho he had no reward to expect the love of truth constraind him to suffer martyrdom in its defence      i have made this digression chiefly to shew the strength of human nature and what meer man may perform by pride and constitution alone man may certainly be as violently    rousd by his vanity as a lion is by his anger and not only this avarice revenge ambition and almost every passion pity not excepted when they are extraordinary may by overcoming fear serve him instead of valour and be mistaken for it even by himselfa as daily experience must teach every body that will examine and look into the motives from which some men act but that we may more clearly perceive what this pretended principle is really built upon let us look into the management of military affairs and we shall find that pride is no where so openly encouraged as there as for clothes the very lowest of the commission officers have them richer or at least more gay and splendid than are generally wore by other people of four or five times their income most of them and especially those that have families and can hardly subsist would be very glad all europe over to be less expensive that way but it is a force put upon them to uphold their pride which they dont think on but the ways and means to rouse mans pride and catch him by it are no where more grosly conspicuous than in the treatment which the common soldiers receive whose vanity is to be workd upon because there must be so many at the cheapest rate imaginable things we are accustomd to we dont mind or else what mortal that never had seen a soldier could look without laughing upon a man accoutred with   0so much paltry gaudiness and affected fineryb the coarsest manufacture that can be made of wool     dyd of a brickdust colour goes down with him because it is ina imitation of scarlet or crimson cloth and to make him think himself as like his officer as tis possible with little or no cost instead of silver or gold lace his hat is trimd with white or yellow worsted which in others would deserve bedlamb yet these fine allurements and the noise made upon a calfs skin have drawn in and been the destruction of more men in reality than all the killing eyes and bewitching voices of women ever slew in jest to day the swineherd puts on his red coat and believes every body in earnest that calls him gentleman and two days after serjeant kite  gives him a swinging wrap with his cane for holding his musket an inch higher than he should do as to the real dignity of the employment in the two last wars officers when recruits were wanted were allowd to list fellows convicted of burglary and other capital crimes which shews that to be made a soldier is deemd to be a preferment next to hanging a trooper is yet worse than a footsoldier for when he is most at ease he has the mortification of being groom to a horse that spends more money than himself when a man reflects on all this the usage they generally receive from their officers their pay and    thec care that is taken of them when they are not wanted must he not wonder how wretches can be so silly as to be proud of being calld gentlemen soldiers yet if theyd were not no art discipline or money would be capable of making them so brave as thousands of them are if we will mind what effects mans bravery without any other qualifications to sweeten him would have     out of an army we shall find that it would be very pernicious to the civil society for if man could conquer all his fears you would hear of nothing but rapes murthers and violences of all sorts and valiant men would be like giants in romances politicks therefore discovered in men a mixtmettle principle which was a compound of justice honesty and all the moral virtues joind to courage and all that were possessd of it turned knightserrant of course they did abundance of good throughout the world by taming monsters delivering the distressd and killing the oppressors but the wings of all the dragons being clipt the giants destroyed and the damsels every where set at liberty except some few in spain and italy who remaind still captivated by their monsters the order of chivalry to whom the standard of ancient honour belonged has been laid aside some time  it was like their armours very massy and heavy the many virtues a   bout it made it very troublesome and as ages grewa wiser and wiser the principle of honour in the beginning of the last century wad melted over again and brought to a new standard they put in the same weight of courage half the quantity of honesty and a very little justice but not a scrap of any other virtue which has made it very easy and portable to what it was however such as it isb there would be no living without itc in a large nation it is the tye of society and though we are beholdend to our frailties for the chief ingredient of it there is no virtue at least that i am acquainted with that has been half so     instrumental to the civilizing of mankind whoa in great societies would soon degenerate into cruel villains and treacherous slaves were honour to be removed from among them as to the duelling part which belongs to it i pity the unfortunate whose lot it is but to say that those who are guilty of it go by false rules or mistake the notions of honour is ridiculous for either there is no honour at all or it teaches men to resent injuries and accept of challenges you may as well deny that it is the fashion what you see every body wear as to say that demanding and giving satisfaction is against the laws of true honour those that rail at duelling dont consider the benefit the society receives from that fashion if every illbred fellow might    use what language he pleasd without being called to an account for it all conversation would be spoild some grave people tell us that the greeks and romans were such valiant men and yet knew nothing of duelling but in their countrys quarrel this is very true but for that reason the kings and princes in homer gave one another worse language than our porters and hackney coachmen would be able to bear without resentment would you hinder duelling pardon no body that offends that way and make the laws against it as severe as you can but dont take away the thing it self the custom of it this will not only prevent the frequency of it but likewise by rendring the most resolute and most powerful cautious and circumspect in their behaviour polish and brighten society in general nothing civilizes a man equally as his fear and if not all as my lord rochester said at least most men would be cowards if they durst  the dread of   0 being called to an account keeps abundance in awe and there are thousands of mannerly and wellaccomplishd gentlemen in europe who would have been insolent and insupportable coxcombs without it besides if it was out of fashion to ask satisfaction for injuries which the law cannot take hold of there would be twenty times the mischief done there is now or else you must have twenty times the con   stables and other officers to keep the peace i confess that though it happens but seldom it is a calamity to the people and generally the families it falls upon but there can be no perfect happiness in this world and all felicity has an allay the act it self is uncharitable but when above thirty in a nation destroy themselves in one year and not half that number are killed by others i dont think the people can be said to love their neighbours worse than themselves it is strange that a nation should grudge to see perhaps half a dozen men sacrificd in a twelvemonth to obtain so valuable a blessing as the politeness of manners the pleasure of conversation and the happiness of company in general that is often so willing to expose and sometimes loses as many thousands in a few hours without knowing whether it will do any good or not i would have no body that reflects on the mean original of honour complain of being gulld and made a property by cunning politicians but desire every body to be satisfied that the governors of societies and those in high stations are greater bubbles to pride than any of the rest if some great men had not a superlative     pride and every body understood the enjoyment of life who would be a lord chancellor of england a prime minister of state in france or what gives more fatigue and not a sixth part of the profit of either a    grand pensionary of holland  the reciprocal services which all men pay to one another are the foundation of the society the great ones are not flatterd with their high birth for nothing tis to rouse their pride and excite them to glorious actions that we extol their race whether it deserves it or not and some men have been complimented with the greatness of their family and the merit of their ancestors when in the whole generation you could not find two but what were uxorious fools silly biggots noted poltrons or debauchd whoremasters the established pride that is inseparable from those that are possessed of titles already makes them often strive as much not to seem unworthy of them as the working ambition of others that are yet without renders them industrious and indefatigable to deserve them when a gentleman is made a baron or an earl it is as great a check upon him in many respects as a gown and cassock are to a young student that has been newly taken into orders the only thing of weight that can be said against modern honour is that it is directly opposite to religion the one bids you bear injuries with patience the other tells you if you dont resent them you are not fit to live religion commands you to leave all revenge to god honour bids you trust your revenge to no body but your self even where the law    would do it for you religion mainly forbids murther honour openly justifies it religion bids you not shed     blood upon any account whatever honour bids you fight for the least trifle religion is built on humility and honour upon pride how to reconcile them must be left to wiser heads than mine  the reason why there are so few men of real virtue and so many of real honour is because all the recompence a man has of a virtuous action is the pleasure of doing it which most people reckon but poor pay but the selfdenial a man of honour submits to in one appetite is immediately rewarded by the satisfaction he receives from another and what he abates of his avarice or any other passion is doubly repaid to his pride besides honour gives large grains of allowance and virtue none a man of honour must not cheat or tell a lye he must punctually repay what he borrows at play though the creditor has nothing to shew for it but he may drink and swear and owe money to all the tradesmen in town without taking notice of their dunning a man of honour must be true to his prince and country while he is in their service but if he thinks himself not well used he may quit it and do them all the mischief he     can a man of honour must never change his religion for interest but he may be as debauchd as he pleases and never practise    any he must make no attempts upon his friends wife daughter sister or any body that is trusted to his care but he may lie with all the world besides remark s remark s sa no limner for his art is famd stonecutters carvers are not namd page    line    it is without doubt that among the consequences of a national honesty and frugality it would be one not to build any new houses or use new materials as long as there were old ones enough to serve by this three parts in four of masons carpenters bricklayers c would want employment and the building trade being once destroyed what would become of limning carving and other arts that are ministring to luxury and have been carefully forbid by those lawgivers that preferred a good and honest to a great and wealthy society and endeavoured to render their subjects rather virtuous than rich by a law of lycurgus it was enacted that the cielings of the spartan houses should only be wrought by the ax and their gates and doors only smoothed by the saw and this says plutarch was not    without mystery for if epaminondas could say with so good a grace inviting some of his friends to his table come gentlemen be secure treason would never come to such a poor dinner as this why might not this great lawgiver in all probability have thought that such ill favourd houses would never be capable of receiving luxury and superfluity     it is reported as the same author tells us that king leotichidas the first of that name was so little usd to the sight of carvd work that being entertained at corinth in a stately room he was much surprized to see the timber and cieling so finely wrought anda asked his host whether the trees grew so in his country  the same want of employment would reach innumerable callings and among the rest that of the b   weaversc that joind rich silk d with plate   and all the trades subordinate as the fable has it   would be one of the first that should have reason to complain for the price of land and houses being by the removal of the vast numbers that had left the hive sunk very low on the one side and every body abhorring all other ways of gain but such as were strictly honest on the other it is    not probable that many without pride or prodigality should be able to wear cloth of gold and silver or rich brocades the consequence of which would be that not only the weaver but likewise the silverspinner the flatter  the wiredrawer the barman  and the refiner would in a little time be affected with this frugality     remark t remark t t a — —— — to live great had made her husband rob the state page  0 line   what our common rogues when they are going to be hanged chiefly complain of as the cause of their untimely end is next to the neglect of the sabbath their having kept company with ill women meaning whores and i dont question but that among the lesser villains many venture their necks to indulge and satisfy their low amours but the words that have given occasion to this remark may serve to hint to us that among the great ones men are often put upon such dangerous projects and forced into such pernicious measures by their wives as the most subtle mistress never could have persuaded   0them to i have shewn already that the worst of women and most profligate of the sex did contribute to the consumption of superfluities as well as the necessaries of life and consequently were beneficial to many peaceable drudges that work hard to maintain their families and have no worse design than an honest livelihood —let them be banished notwithstanding says a good man when every strumpet is gone and the land wholly freed from lewdness god almighty will pour such blessings upon it as will vastly exceed the profits that are now got by harlots—this perhaps would be true but i can make it evident that with or without prostitutes nothing could make amends for the detriment trade would sustain if all those of that sex who enjoy the happy state of matrimony should act and behave themselves as a sober wise man could wish them     the variety of work that is performd and the number of hands employd to gratify the fickleness and luxury of women is prodigious and if only the married ones should hearken to reason and just remonstrances think themselves sufficiently answerd with the first refusal and never ask a second time what had been once denied them if i say married women would do this and then lay out no money but what their husbands knew and freely allowed of the consumption of a thou   sand things they now make use of would be lessened by at least a fourth part let us go from house to house and observe the way of the world only among the middling people creditable shopkeepers that spend two or three hundred a year and we shall find thea women when they have half a score suits of clothes two or three of them not the worse for wearing will think it a sufficient plea for new ones if they can say that they have never a gown or petticoat but what they have been often seen in and are known by especially at church i dont speak now of profuse extravagant women but such as are counted prudent and moderate in their desires if by this pattern we should in proportion judge of the highest ranks where the richest clothes are but a trifle to their other expences and not forget the furniture of all sorts equipages jewels and buildings of persons of quality we shouldb find the fourth part i speak of a vast article in trade and that the loss of it would be a greater calamity to such a nation as ours than it is possible to conceive any other a raging pestilence not excepted for the death of half a million of people could not cause a tenth part of the disturbance to the kingdom that the same number of poor unemployd would certainly create if at once they were to    be added to those that already one way or other are a burthen to the society     some few men have a real passion for their wives and are fond of them without reserve others that dont care and have little occasion for women are yet seemingly uxorious and love out of vanity they take delight in a handsome wife as a coxcomb does in a fine horse not for the use he makes of it but because it is his the pleasure lies in the consciousness of an uncontrolable possession and what follows from it the reflexion on the mighty thoughts he imagines others to have of his happiness the men of either sort may be very lavish to their wives and often preventing their wishes croud new clothes and other finery upon them faster than they can ask it but the greatest part are wiser than to indulge the extravagances of their wives so far as to give them immediately every thing they are pleasd to fancy it is incredible what vast quantity of trinkets as well as apparel are purchasd and used by women which they could never have come at by any other means than pinching their families marketting and other ways of cheating and pilfering from their husbands others by ever teazing their spouses tire them into compliance and conquer even obstinate churls by perseverance and their assiduity of asking a third sort are outrageous at a denial and    by downright noise and scolding bully their tame fools out of any thing they have a mind to while thousands by the force of wheedling know how to overcome the best weighd reasons and the most positive reiterated refusals the young and beautiful especially laugh at all remonstrances and denials and few of them scruple to employ the most tender minutes of wedlock to promote a sordid interest here had i time i could inveigh with warmth against those base those wicked women who calmly play their arts and false deluding charms against our strength and prudence and act the harlots with their husbands nay she is worse than whore who impiously prophanes and     prostitutes the sacred rites of love to vile ignoble ends that first excites to passion and invites to joys with seeming ardour then racks our fondness for no other purpose than to extort a gift while full of guile in counterfeited transports she watches for the moment when men can least deny i beg pardon for this start out of my way and desire the experienced reader duly to weigh what has been said as to the main purpose and after that call to mind the temporal blessings which men daily hear not only toasted and wishd for when people are merry and doing of nothing but likewise gravely and solemnly prayd for in churches and other religious assemblies by clergymen of all sorts    and sizes and as soon as he shall have laid these things together and from what he has observd in the common affairs of life reasond upon them consequentially without prejudice i dare flatter my self that he will be obligd to own that a considerable portion of what the prosperity of london and trade in general and consequently the honour strength safety and all the worldly interest of the nation consist in depends entirely on the deceit and vile stratagems of women and that humility content meekness obedience to reasonable husbands frugality and all the virtues together if they were possessd of them in the most eminent degree could not possibly be a thousandth part so serviceable to make an opulent powerful and what we call a flourishing kingdom than their most hateful qualities i dont question but many of my readers will be startled at this assertion when they look on the consequences that may be drawn from it and i shall be askd whether people may not as well be virtuous in a populous rich wide extended kingdom as in a small indigent state or principality that is poorly a inhabited and if that be impossible whether it is     not the duty of all sovereigns to reduce their subjects as to wealth and numbers as much as they can if i allow they may i own my self in the wrong and if i affirm the other    my tenets will justly be calld impious or at least dangerous to all large societies as it is not in this place of the book only but a great many others that such queries might be made even by a wellmeaning reader i shall here explain my self and endeavour to solve those difficulties which several passages might have raisd in him in order to demonstrate the consistency of my opinion to reason and the strictest morality i lay down as a first principle that in all societies great or small it is the duty of every member of it to be good that virtue ought to be encouragd vice discountenancd the laws obeyd and the transgressors punishd after this i affirm that if we consult history both ancient and modern and take a view of what has past in the world we shall find that human nature since the fall of adam has always been the same and that the strength and frailties of it have ever been conspicuous in one part of the globe or other without any regard to ages climates or religion i never said nor imagind that man could not be virtuous as well in a rich and mighty kingdom as in the most pitiful commonwealth but i own it is my sense that no society can be raisd into such a rich and mighty kingdom or so raisd subsist in their wealth and power for any considerable time without the vices of man    this i imagine is sufficiently provd throughout the book and as human nature still continues the same as it has always been for so many thousand years we have no great reason to suspect a future change in it while the world endures now i cannot see what immoralitya there is in shewing a man the origin and power of those passions which so often even   0 unknowingly to himself hurry him away from his reason or that there is any impiety in putting him upon his guard against himself and the secret stratagems of selflove and teaching him the difference between such actions as proceed from a victory over the passions and those that are only the result of a conquest which one passion obtains over another that is between real and counterfeited virtue it is an admirable saying of a worthy divine that tho many discoveries have been made in the world of selflove there is yet abundance of terra incognita left behind  what hurt a do i do to man if i make him more known to himself than he was before but we are all so desperately in love with flattery that we can never relish a truth that is mortifying and i dont believe that the immortality of the soul a truth broachd long before christianity would have ever found such a general reception in human capacities as it has had it not been a pleasing one that extolld and was a compliment to the whole spe   cies the meanest and most miserable not excepted every one loves to hear the thing well spoke of that he has a share in even bailiffs goalkeepers and the hangman himself would have you think well of their functions nay thieves and housebreakers have a greater regard to those of their fraternity than they have for honest people and i sincerely believe that it is chiefly selflove that has gained this little treatise as it was before the last b impression so many enemies   every one looks upon it as an affront done to himself because it detracts from the dignity     and lessens the fine notions he had conceivd of mankind the most worshipful company he belongs to when i say that societies cannot be raisd to wealth and power and the top of earthly glory without vices i dont think that by so saying i bid men be vicious any more than i bid em be quarrelsome or covetous when i affirm that the profession of the law could not be maintaind in such numbers and splendor if there was not abundance of too selfish and litigious people  but as nothing would more clearly demonstrate the falsity of my notions than that the generality of the people should fall in with them so i dont expect the approbation of the multitude i write not to many nor seek for any wellwishers but among the few that can think abstractly and have their minds elevated    above the vulgar if i have shewn the way to worldly greatness i have always without hesitation preferrd the road that leads to virtue would you banish fraud and luxury prevent profaneness and irreligion and make the generality of the people charitable good and virtuous break down the printingpresses melt the founds and burn all the books in the island except those at the universities where they remain unmolested and suffer no volume in private hands but a bible knock down foreign trade prohibit all commerce with strangers and permit no ships to go to sea that ever will return beyond fisherboats restore to the clergy the king and the barons their ancient privileges prerogatives and possessionsa build new churches and convert all the coin you can come at into sacred utensils erect monasteries and almshouses     in abundance and let no parish be without a charityschool enact sumptuary laws and let your youth be inured to hardship inspire them with all the nice and most refined notions of honour and shame of friendship and of heroism and introduce among them a great variety of imaginary rewards then let the clergy preach abstinence and selfdenial to others and take what liberty they please for themselves let them bear the greatest sway in the management of stateaffairs and no man be made lordtreasurer but a bishop     by such pious endeavours and wholsome regulations the scene would be soona alterd the greatest part of the covetous the discontented the restless and ambitious villains would leave the land vast swarms of cheating knaves would abandon the city and be dispersd throughout the country artificers would learn to hold the plough merchants turn farmers and the sinful overgrown jerusalem without famine war pestilence or compulsion be emptied in the most easy manner and ever after cease to be dreadful to her sovereigns the happy reformd kingdom would by this means be crowded in no part of it and every thing necessary for the sustenance of man be cheap and abound on the contrary the root of so many thousand evils money would be very scarce and as little wantedb where every man should enjoy the fruits of his own labour and our own dear manufacture unmixd be promiscuously wore by the lord and the peasant it is impossible that such a change of circumstances should not influence the manners of a nation and render them temperate honest and sincere and from the next generation we might reasonably expect a more healthy and robust offspring than the present an harmless     innocent and wellmeaning people that would never dispute the doctrine of passive obedience  nor any other orthodox principles   0but be submissive to superiors and unanimous in religious worship here i fancy my self interrupted by an epicure who not to want a restorative diet in case of necessity is never without live ortelans and i am told that goodness and probity are to be had at a cheaper rate than the ruin of a nation and the destruction of all the comforts of life that liberty and property may be maintaind without wickedness or fraud and men be good subjects without being slaves and religious tho they refusd to be priestrid that to be frugal and saving is a duty incumbent only on those whose circumstances require it but that a man of a good estate does his country a service by living up to the income of it that as to himself he is so much master of his appetites that he can abstain from any thing upon occasion that where true hermitage was not to be had he could content himself with plain bourdeaux if it had a good body that many a morning instead of st lawrence he has made aa shift with fronteniac and after dinner given cyprus wine and even madera when he has had a large company and thought it extravagant to treat with tockay but that all voluntary mortifications are superstitious only belonging to blind zealots and enthusiasts hell quote my lord shaftsbury against me and tell me that people may be virtuous and sociable without selfdenial  that    it is an affront to virtue to make it inaccessible that i make a bugbear     of it to frighten men from it as a thing impracticable but that for his part he can praise god and at the same time enjoy his creatures with a good conscience neither will he forget any thing to his purpose of what i have said page     hell ask me at last whether the legislature the wisdom of the nation it self while they endeavour as much as a possible to discourage profaneness and immorality and promote the glory of god do not openly profess at the same time to have nothing more at heart than the ease and welfare of the subject the wealth strength honour and what else is calld the true interest of the country and moreover whether the most devout and most learned of our prelates in their greatest concern for our conversion when they beseech the deity to turn their own as well as our hearts from the world and all carnal desires do not in the same prayer as loudly sollicit him to pour all earthly blessings and temporal felicity on the kingdom they belong to these are the apologies the excuses and common pleas not only of those who are notoriously vicious but the generality of mankind when you touch the copyhold of their inclinations and trying the real value they have for spirituals would actually strip them of what their minds are wholly bent    upon ashamed of the many frailties they feel within all men endeavour to hide themselves their ugly nakedness      from each other and wrapping up the true motives of their hearts in the specious cloke of sociableness and their concern for the publick good they are in hopes of concealing their filthy appetites and the deformity of their desires while they are conscious within of the fondness for their darling lusts and their incapacity barefacd to tread the arduous rugged path of virtue as to the two last questions i own they are very puzzling to what the epicure asks i am obligd to answer in the affirmative and unless i would which god forbid arraign the sincerity of kings bishops and the whole legislative power the objection stands good against me all i can say for myself is that in the connexion of the facts there is a mystery past human understanding and to convince the reader that this is no evasion i shall illustrate the incomprehensibility of it in the following parable in old heathen times there was they say a whimsical country where the people talkd much of religion and the greatest part as to outward appearance seemd really devout the chief moral evil among them was thirst and to quench it a damnable sin yet they unanimously agreed that every one was born thirsty more or less small beer in modera   tion was allowd to all and he was counted an hypocrite a cynick or a madman who pretended that one could live altogether without it yet those who owned they loved it and drank it to excess were counted wicked all this while the beer it self was reckond a blessing from heaven and there was no harm in the use of it all the enormity lay in the abuse the motive of the heart that made them drink it he that took the least drop of it to quench his thirst committed a heinous crime while others drank large quantities without any guilt so they did it indifferently and for no other reason than to mend their complexion they brewd for other countries as well as their     own and for the small beer they sent abroad they received large returns of westphaliahams neatstongues hungbeef and boloniasausages redherrings pickledsturgeon cavear anchoves and every thing that was proper to make their liquor go down with pleasure those who kept great stores of small beer by them without making use of it were generally envied and at the same time very odious to the publick and no body was easy that had not enough of it come to his own share the greatest calamity they thought could befal them was to keep their hops and barley upon their hands and the more they yearly consumed of them the more they reckond the country to flourish    the government had manya very wise regulations concerning the returns that were made for their exports encouraged very much the importation of salt and pepper and laid heavy duties on every thing that was not well seasond and might any ways obstruct the sale of their own hops and barley those at helm when they acted in publick shewd themselves on all accounts exempt and wholly divested from thirst made several laws to prevent the growth of it and punish the wicked who openly dared to quench it if you examind them in their private persons and pryd narrowly into their lives and conversations they seemd to be more fond or at least drank larger draughts of small beer than others but always under pretence that the mending of complexions required greater quantities of liquor in them than it did in those they ruled over and that what they had chiefly at heart without any regard to themselves was to procure great plenty of small beer among the subjects in general and a great demand for their hops and barley as no body was debarrd from small beer the clergy made use of it as well as the laity and some of them very plentifully yet all of them desired to     be thought less thirsty by their function than others and never would own that they drank any but to mend their complexions in their religious assemblies they were more sincere for as soon as they    came there they all openly confessd the clergy as well as the laity from the highest to the lowest that they were thirsty that mending their complexions was what they minded the least and that all their hearts were set upon small beer and quenching their thirst whatever they might pretend to the contrary what was remarkable is that to have laid hold of those truths to any ones prejudice and made use of those confessions afterwards out of their temples would have been counted very impertinent and every body thought it an heinous affront to be calld thirsty tho you had seen him drink small beer by whole gallons the chief topicks of their preachers was the great evil of thirst and the folly there was in quenching it they exhorted their hearers to resist the temptations of it inveighd against small beer and often told them it was poison if they drank it with pleasure or any other design than to mend their complexions in their acknowledgments to the gods they thankd them for the plenty of comfortable small beer they had receivd from them notwithstanding they had so little deservd it and continually quenchd their thirst with it whereas they were so thorowly satisfyd that it was given them for a better use having beggd pardon for those offences they desired the gods to lessen their thirst and give them strength to resist the importunities of it yet    in the midst of their sorest repentance and mosta humble supplications they never forgot small beer and prayd that they might continue to have it in great plenty with a solemn promise that how neglectful soever they might hitherto have been in this point they would for the future not drink a drop of it with any other design than to mend their complexions     these were standing petitions put together to last and having continued to be made use of without any alterations for several hundred years together it was thought by some that the gods who understood futurity and knew that the same promise they heard in june would be made to them the january following did not rely much more on those vows than we do on those waggish inscriptions by which men offer us their goods today for money and tomorrow for nothing they often began their prayers very mystically and spoke many things in a spiritual sense yet they never were so abstract from the world in them as to end one without beseeching the gods to bless and prosper the brewing trade in all its branches and for the good of the whole more and more to increase the consumption of hops and barley  remark v remark v    va content the bane of industry page    line   i have been told by many that the bane of industry is laziness and not content therefore to prove my assertion which seems a paradox to some i shall treat of laziness and content separately and afterwards speak of industry that the reader may judge     which it is of the two former that is most opposite to the latter laziness is an aversion to business generally attended with an unreasonable desire of remaining unactive and every body is lazy who without being hinderd by any other warrantable employment refuses or puts off any business which he ought to do for himself or others we seldom call any body lazy but such as we reckon inferior to us and of whom we expect some service children dont think their parents lazy nor servants their masters and if a gentleman indulges his ease and sloth so abominably that he wont put on his own shoes though he is young and slender no body shall call him lazy for it if he can keep but a footman or some body else to do it for him    mr dryden has given us a very good idea of superlative slothfulness in the person of a luxurious king of egypt  his majesty having bestowed some considerable gifts on several of his favourites is attended by some of his chief ministers with a parchment which he was to sign to confirm those grants first he walks a few turns to and fro with a heavy uneasiness in his looks then sets himself down like a man thats tired and at last with abundance of reluctancy to what he was going about he takes up the pen and falls a complaining very seriously of the length of the word ptolemy and expresses a great deal of concern that he had not some short monosyllable fora his name which he thought woud save him a world of trouble we often reproach others with laziness because we are guilty of it our selves some days ago as two young women sat knotting together says one to the other there comes a wicked cold through that door you are the nearest to it sister pray shut it the   0 other who was the youngest vouchsafd indeed to cast an eyea towards the door but sat still and said nothing the eldest spoke again two or three times and at last the other making her no answer nor offering to stir she got up in a pet and shut the door herself coming back to sit down again she gave the younger a very hard look and said lord sister betty    i would not be so lazy as you are for all the world which she spoke so earnestly that it brought a colour in her face the youngest should have risen i own but if the eldest had not overvalued her labour she would have shut the door herself as soon as the cold was offensive to her without making any words of it she was not above a step farther from the door than her sister and as to age there was not eleven months difference between them and they were both under twenty i thought it a hard matter to determine which was the laziest of the two there are a thousand wretches that are always working the marrow out of their bones for next to nothing because they are unthinking and ignorant of what the pains they take are worth while others who are cunning and understand the true value of their work refuse to be employd at under rates not because they are of an unactive temper but because they wont beat down the price of their labour a country gentleman sees at the back side of the exchange a porter walking to and fro with his hands in his pockets pray says he friend will you step for me with this letter as far as bowchurch and ill give you a penny ill go with all my heart says tother but i must have twopence master which the gentleman refusing to give the fellow turnd his back and told him hed rather play for nothing   0than work for nothing the gentleman thought it an unaccountable piece of laziness in a porter rather to saunter up and down for nothing than to be     earning a penny with as little trouble some hours after he happend to be with some friends at a tavern in threadneedlestreet where one of them calling to mind that he had forgot to send for a bill of exchange that was to go away with the post that night was in great perplexity and immediately wanted some body to go for him to hackney with all the speed a imaginable it was after ten in the middle of winter a very rainy night and all the porters thereabouts were gone to bed the gentleman grew very uneasy and said whatever it cost him that somebody he must send at last one of the drawers seeing him so very pressing told him that he knew a porter who would rise if it was a job worth his while worth his while said the gentleman very eagerly dont doubt of that good lad if you know of any body let him make what haste he can and ill give him a crown if he be back by twelve oclock upon this the drawer took the errand left the room and in less than a quarter of an hour came back with the welcome news that the message would be dispatchd with all expedition the company in the mean time diverted themselves as they had done before but when it began to be towards twelve the watches were pulld out and the porters return    was all the discourse some were of opinion he might yet come before the clock had struck others thought it impossible and now it wanted but three minutes of twelve when in comes the nimble messenger smoking hot with his clothes as wet as dung with the rain and his head all over in a bath of sweat he had nothing dry about him but the inside of his pocketbookb out of which he took the bill he had been for and by the drawers direction presented it to the gentleman it belonged to who being very well pleasd with the dispatch he had made gave him the crown he had promisd while another filld him a bumper and the whole company     commended his diligence as the fellow came nearer the light to take up the wine the country gentleman i mentiond at first to his great admiration knew him to be the same porter that had refusd to earn his penny and whom he thought the laziest mortal alive thea story teaches us that we ought not to confound those who remain unemployd for want of an opportunity of exerting themselves to the best advantage with such as for want of spirit hug themselves in their sloth and will rather starve than stir without this caution we must pronounce all the world more or less lazy according to their estimation of the reward they are to purchase with their labour    and then the most industrious may be calld lazy content i call that calm serenity of the mind which men enjoy while they think themselves happy and rest satisfyd with the station they are in it implies a favourable construction of our present circumstances and a peaceful tranquillity which men are strangers to as long as they are sollicitous about mending their condition this is a virtue of which the applause is very precarious and uncertain for according as mens circumstances vary theyll either be blamd or commended for being possessd of it a single man that works hard at a laborious trade has a hundred a year left him by a relation this change of fortune makes him soon weary of working and not having industry enough to put himself forward in the world he resolves to do nothing at all and live upon his income as long as he lives within compass pays for what he has and offends no body he shall be calld an honest quiet man the victualler his landlady the tailor and others divide what he has between them and the society is every year the better for his revenue whereas if he should follow     his own or any other trade he must hinder others and some body would have the less for what he should get and therefore tho he should be the idlest fellow in the world lie    abed fifteen hours in four and twenty and do nothing but sauntring up and down all the rest of the time no body would discommend him and his unactive spirit is honoured with the name of content but if the same man marries gets three or four children and still continues of the same easy temper rests satisfied with what he has and without endeavouring to get a penny indulges his former sloth first his relations afterwards all his acquaintance will be alarmd at his negligence they foresee that his income will not be sufficient to bring up so many children handsomely and are afraid some of them may if not a burden become a disgrace to them when these fears have been for some time whispered about from one to another his uncle gripe takes him to task and accosts him in the following cant what nephew no business yet fy upont i cant imagine how you do to spend your time if you wont work at your own trade there are fifty ways that a man may pick up a penny by you have a hundred a year tis true but your charges increase every year and what must you do when your children are grown up i have a better estate than you my self and yet you dont see me leave off my business nay i declare it might i have the world i could not lead the life you do tis no business of mine i own but every body cries tis a shame a a young man as you are    that has his limbs and his health should not turn his handsb to something or other if these admonitions do not reform him in a little time and he continues half a year longer without employment hell become a discourse to the whole neighbourhood and for the same qualifications that once got him the name of a quiet contented     man he shall be calld the worst of husbands and the laziest fellow upon earth from whence it is manifest that when we pronounce actions good or evil we only regard the hurt or benefit the society receives from them and not the persona who commits them see page    diligence and industry are often used promiscuously to signify the same thing but there is a great difference between them a poor wretch may want neither diligence nor ingenuity be a saving painstaking man and yet without striving to mend his circumstances remain contented with the station he lives in but industry implies besides the other qualities a thirst after gain and an indefatigable desire of meliorating our condition when men think either the customary profitsb of their calling or else the share of business they have too small they have two ways to deserve the name of industrious and they must be either ingenious enough to find out uncommon and yet warrantable methods to increase their business or their profit or else supply that defect by a multiplicity of    occupations if a tradesman takes care to provide his shop and gives due attendance to those that come to it he is a diligent man in his business but if besides that he takes particular pains to sell to the same advantage a better commodity than the rest of his neighbours or if by his obsequiousness or some other good quality getting into a large acquaintance he uses all possible endeavours of drawing customers to his house he then may be called industrious a cobler though he is not employed half of his time if he neglects no business and makes dispatch when he has any is a diligent man but if he runs of errands when he has no work or makes but shoepins and serves as a watchman anights he deserves the name of industrious if what has been said in this remark be duly weighd     we shall find either that laziness and content are very near akin or if there be a great difference between them that the latter is more contrary to industry than the former remark x remark x    xa to make a great an honest hive page    line   this perhaps might be done where people are contented to be poor and hardy but if they would likewise enjoy their ease and the comforts of the world and be at once an opulent potent and flourishing as well as a warlike nation it is utterly impossible i have heard people speak of the mighty figure the spartans made above all the commonwealths of greece notwithstanding their uncommon frugality and other exemplary virtues but certainly there never was a nation whose greatness was more empty than theirs the splendor they lived in was inferior to that of a theatre and the only thing they could be proud of was that they enjoyd nothing they were indeed both feared and esteemed abroad they were so famed for valour and skill in martial affairs that their neighbours did not only court their friendship and assistance in their wars but were satisfied and thought themselves sure of the victory if they could but get a spartan general to command their armies but then their discipline was so rigid and their manner of living so austere    and void of all comfort that the most temperate man among us would refuse to submit to the harshnessb of such uncouth laws there was a perfect equality among them gold and silver coin were cried down their current money was made of iron to render it of     a great bulk and little worth to lay up twenty or thirty pounds required a pretty large chamber and to remove it nothing less than a yoke of oxen another remedy they had against luxury was that they were obliged to eat in common of the same meat and they so little allowed any body to dine or sup by himself at home that agis one of their kings having vanquished the athenians and sending for his commons at his return home because he desired privately to eat with his queen was refused by the polemarchi  in training up their youth their chief care says plutarch was to make them good subjects to fit them to endure the fatigues of long and tedious marches and never to return without victory from the field when they were twelve years old they lodgd in little bands upon beds made of the rushes which grew by the banks of the river eurotas and because their points were sharp they were to break them off with their hands without a knife if it were a hard winter they mingled some thistledown with their rushes to keep them warm see plutarch in the life of    lycurgus   from all these circumstances it is plain that no nation on earth was less effeminate but being debarred from all the comforts of life they could have nothing for their pains but the glory of being a warlike people inured to toils and hardships which was a happiness that few people would have cared for upon the same terms and though they had been masters of the world as long as they enjoyed no more of it englishmen would hardly have     envyd them their greatness  what mena want nowadays has sufficiently been shewn in remark ob where i have treated of real pleasures remark y remark y yc td enjoy the worlds conveniencies page    line   that the words decency and conveniency were very ambiguous and not to be understood unless we were acquainted with the quality and circumstances of the persons that made use of them hase been hinted already in remark l the goldsmith mercer or any other of the most creditable shopkeepers that has three or four thousand pounds to set up with must have two dishes of meat every day and something extraordinary for    sundays his wife must have a damask bed against her lyingin and two or three rooms very well furnished the following summer she must have a house or at least very good lodgings in the country a man that has a being out of town must have a horse his footman must have another if he has a tolerable trade he expects in eight or ten years time to keep his coach which notwithstanding he hopes that after he has     slaved as he calls it for two or three and twenty years he shall be worth at least a thousand a year for his eldest son to inherit and two or three thousand pounds for each of his other children to begin the world with and when men of such circumstances pray for their daily bread and mean nothing more extravagant by it they are counted pretty modest people call this pride luxury superfluity or what you please it is nothing but what ought to be in the capital of a flourishing nation those of inferior condition must content themselves with less costly conveniencies as others of higher rank will be sure to make theirs more expensive some people call it but decency to be served in plate and reckon a coach and six among the necessary comforts of life and if a peer has not above three or four thousand a year his lordship is counted poora   0since the first edition of this book several have attackd me with demonstrations of the certain ruin which excessive luxury must bring upon all nations who yet were soon answered when i shewed them the limits within which i had confined it and therefore that no reader for the future may misconstrue me on this head i shall point at the cautions i have given and the provisos i have made in the former as well as this present impression and which if not overlooked must prevent all rational censure and obviate several objections that otherwise might be made against me i have laid down as maxims never to be departed from that the † poor should be kept strictly to work and that it was prudence to relieve their wants but folly to cure them that agriculture  and fishery should be promoted in all their branches in order to render provisions      and consequently labour cheap i have named ‡ ignorance as a necessary ingredient in the mixture of society from all which it is manifest that i could never have imagined that luxury was to be made general through every part of a kingdom i have likewise    required † that property should be well secured justice impartially administred and in every thing the interest of the nation taken care of but what i have insisted on the most and repeated more than once is the great regard that is to be had to the balance of trade and the care the legislature ought to take that the yearly  imports never exceed the exports and where this is observed and the other things i spoke of are not neglected i still continue to assert that no foreign luxury can undo a country the height of it is never seen but in nations that are vastly populous and there only in the upper part of it and the greater that is the larger still in proportion must be the lowest the basis that supports all the multitude of working poor those who would too nearly imitate others of superior fortune must thank themselves if they are ruind this is nothing against luxury for whoever can subsist and lives above his income is a fool some persons of quality may keep three or four coaches and six and at the same time lay up money for their children while a young shopkeeper is undone for keeping one sorry horse it is impossible there should be a rich nation without prodigals yet i never knew a city so full of spendthrifts but    there were covetous people enough to answer their number as an old merchant breaks for havinga been extravagant or careless a great while so a young beginner falling into the same business gets an estate by being saving or more industrious before he is forty yearsb   0 old besides that the frailties of men often work by contraries some narrow souls can never thrive because they are too stingy while longer heads amass great wealth by spending their money freely and seeming to despise it but the vicissitudes of fortune are necessary and the most lamentable are no more detrimental to society than the death of the individual members of it christnings are a proper balance to burials those who immediately lose by the misfortunes of others are very sorry complain and make a noise but the others who get by them as there always are such hold their tongues because it is odious to be thought the better for the losses and calamities of our neighbour the various ups and downs compose a wheel that always turning round gives motion to the whole machine philosophers that dare extend their thoughts beyond the narrow compass of what is immediately before them look on the alternate changes in the civil society no otherwise than they do on the risings and fallings of the lungs the latter of which are asa much a part of respiration in the more perfect animals as the first so that    the fickle breath of neverstable fortune is to the body politick the same as floating air is to a living creature avarice then and prodigality are equally necessary to the society that in some countries men are more generally lavish than in others proceeds from the difference inb circumstances that dispose to either vice and arise from the condition of the social body as well as the temperament of the natural i beg pardon of the attentive reader if here in behalf of short memories i repeat some things the substance of which they have already seen in remark q more money than land heavy taxes and scarcity of provisions industry laboriousness an active and stirring spirit illnature and saturninec temper old age     wisdom trade riches acquired by our own labour and liberty and property well secured are all things that dispose to avarice on the contrary indolence content goodnature a jovial temper youth folly arbitrary power money easily got plenty of provisions and the uncertainty of possessions are circumstances that render men prone to prodigality where there is the most of the first the prevailing vice will be avarice and prodigality where the other turnsa the scale but a national frugality there never was nor never will be without a national necessity    sumptuary laws may be of use to an indigent country after great calamities of war pestilence or famine when work has stood still and the labour of the poor been interrupted but to introduce them into an opulent kingdom is the wrong way to consult the interest of it i shall end my remarks on the grumbling hive with assuring the champions of national frugality that it would be impossible for the persians and other eastern people to purchase the vast quantities of fine english cloth they consume should we load our women with less cargos of asiatick silks         an essay on charity and charityschools    an essay on charity and charityschools charity is that virtue by which part of that sincere love we have for our selves is transferrd pure and unmixd to others not tied to us by the bonds of friendship or consanguinity and even meer strangers whom we have no obligation to nor hope or expect any thing from if we lessen any ways the rigour of this definition part of the virtue must be lost what we do for our friends and kindred we do partly for our selves    when a man acts in behalf of nephews or neices and says they are my brothers children i do it out of charity he deceives you for if he is capable it is expected from him and he does it partly for his own sake if he values the esteem of the world and is nice as to honour and     reputation he is obliged to have a greater regard to them than for strangers or else he must suffer in his character the exercise of this virtue relates either to opinion or to action and is manifested in what we think of others or what we do for them to be charitable then in the first place we ought to put the best construction on all that others do or say that the things are capable of if a man builds a fine house tho he has not one symptom of humility furnishes it richly and lays out a good estate in plate and pictures we ought not to think that he does it out of vanity but to encourage artists employ hands and set the poor to work for the good of his country and if a man sleeps at church so he does not snore we ought to think he shuts his eyes to increase his attention the reason is because in our turn we desire that our utmost avarice should pass for frugality and that for religion which we know to be hypocrisy secondly that virtue is conspicuous in us when we bestow our time and labour for nothing or employ our credit with others in behalf of those who stand in need    of it and yet could not expect such an assistance from our friendship or nearness of blood the last branch of charity consists in giving away while we are alive what we value our selves to such as i have already named being contented rather to have and enjoy less than not relieve those who want and shall be the objects of our choice this virtue is often counterfeited by a passion of ours calld pity or compassion which consists in a fellowfeeling and condolence for the misfortunes and calamities of others all mankind are more or less affected with it but the weakest minds generally the most it is raised in us when the sufferings and misery of other creatures make so forcible an impression upon us as to make us uneasy it comes in either at the eye or ear or both and the nearer and more     violently the object of compassion strikes those senses the greater disturbance it causes in us often to such a degree as to occasion great pain and anxiety should any of us be lockd up in a groundroom where in a yard joining to it there was a thriving goodhumourd child at play of two or three years old so near us that through the grates of the window we could almost touch it with our hand and if while we took delight in the harmless diversion and imperfect prittleprattle of the innocent babe a nasty overgrown sow  should come in upon    the child set it a screaming and frighten it out of its wits it is natural to think that this would make us uneasy and that with crying out and making all the menacing noise we could we should endeavour to drive the sow away but if this should happen to be an halfstarvd creature that mad with hunger went roaming about in quest of food and we should behold the ravenous brute in spite of our cries and all the threatning gestures we could think of actually lay hold of the helpless infant destroy and devour it to see her widely open her destructive jaws and the poor lamb beat down with greedy haste to look on the defenceless posture of tender limbs first trampled on then tore asunder to see the filthy snout digging in the yet living entrails suck up the smoking blood and now and then to hear the crackling of the bones and the cruel animal with savage pleasure grunt overa the horrid banquet to hear and see all this what tortures would it give the soul beyond expression let me see the most shining virtue the moralists have to boast of so manifest either to the person possessd of it or those who behold his actions let me see courage or the love of ones country so apparent without any mixture cleard and distinct the first     from pride and anger the other from the love of glory and every shadow of selfinterest as this pity would be cleard and distinct from all other passions there would be no    need of virtue or selfdenial to be moved at such a scene and not only a man of humanity of good morals and commiseration but likewise an highwayman an housebreaker or a murderer could feel anxieties on such an occasion how calamitous soever a mans circumstances might be he would forget his misfortunes for the time and the most troublesome passion would give way to pity and not one of the species has a heart so obdurate or engaged that it would not ake at such a sight as no language has an epithet to fit it many will wonder at what i have said of pity that it comes in at the eye or ear but the truth of this will be known when we consider that the nearer the object is the more we suffer and the more remote it is the less we are troubled with it to see people executed for crimes if it is a great way off moves us but little in comparison to what it does when we are near enough to see the motion of the soul in their eyes observe their fears and agonies and are able to read the pangs in every feature of the face when the object is quite removd from our senses the relation of the calamities or the reading of them can never raise in us the passion calld pity we may be concernd at bad news the loss and misfortunes of friends and those whose cause we espouse but this is not pity but grief or sorrow the same as we feel for the death of those we love or the destruction of what we value   0when we hear that three or four thousand men all strangers to us are killd with the sword or forcd into some river where they area drownd we say and perhaps believe that we pity them it is humanity bids us have compassion with the sufferings of others and reason tells us that whether a thing be far off     or done in our sight our sentiments concerning it ought to be the same and we should be ashamd to own that we felt no commiseration in us when any thing requires it he is a cruel man he has no bowels of compassion all these things are the effects of reason and humanity but nature makes no compliments when the object does not strike the body does not feel it and when men talk of pitying people out of sight they are to be believed in the same manner as when they say that they are our humble servants in paying the usual civilities at first meeting those who do not see one another every day are often very glad and very sorry alternately for five or six times together in less than two minutes and yet at parting carry away not a jot more of grief or joy than they met with the same it is with pity and it is a thing of choice no more than fear or anger those who have a strong and lively imagination and can make representations of things in their minds as they would be if they were actually before them may work themselves up into something that resembles compassion but this is done by art and often    the help of a little enthusiasm and is only an imitation of pity the heart feels little of it and it is as faint as what we suffer at the acting of a tragedy where our judgment leaves part of the mind uninformd and to indulge a lazy wantonness suffers it to be led into an error which is necessary to have a passion raisd the slight strokes of which are not unpleasant to us when the soul is in an idle unactive humour as pity is often by our selves and in our own cases mistaken for charity so it assumes the shape and borrows the very name of it a beggar asks you to exert that virtue for jesus christs sake but all the while his great design is to raise your pity he represents to your view the worst side of his ailments and bodily infirmities in chosen words he gives you an epitome of his calamities real or fictitious and     while he seems to pray god that he will open your heart he is actually at work upon your ears the greatest profligate of them flies to religion for aid and assists his cant with a doleful tone and a studyd dismality of gestures but he trusts not to one passion only he flatters your pride with titles and names of honour and distinction your avarice he sooths with often repeating to you the smallness of the gift he sues for and conditional promises of future returns with an interest extravagant beyond the statute of usury tho out of the reach of it people not used to great cities being thus attackd on all sides are commonly    forcd to yield and cant help giving something tho they can hardly spare it themselves how oddly are we managd by selflove it is ever watching in our defence and yet to sooth a predominant passion obliges us to act against our interest for when pity seizes us if we can but imagine that we contribute to the relief of him we have compassion with and are instrumental to the lessening of his sorrows it eases us and therefore pitiful people often give an alms when they really feel that they would rather not when sores are very bare or seem otherwise afflicting in an extraordinary manner and the beggar can bear to have them exposd to the cold air it is very shocking to some people tis a shame they cry such sights should be sufferd the main reason is it touches their pity feelingly and at the same time they are resolvd either because they are covetous or count it an idle expence to give nothing which makes them more uneasy they turn their eyes and where the cries are dismal some would willingly stop their ears if they were not ashamed what they can do is to mend their pace and be very angry in their hearts that beggars should be about the streets but it is with pity as it is with fear the more we are conversant with objects that excite either passion the less we are disturbd by them and those to whom all     these scenes and tones are by custom made familiar they make little impression upon    the only thing the industrious beggar has left to conquer those fortified hearts if he can walk either with or without crutches is to follow close and with uninterrupted noise teaze and importune them to try if he can make them buy their peace thus thousands give money to beggars from the same motive as they pay their corncutter to walk easy  and many a halfpenny is given to impudent and designedly persecuting rascals whom if it could be done handsomely a man would cane with much greater satisfaction yet all this by the courtesy of the country is calld charity the reverse of pity is malice i have spoke of it where i treat of envy those who know what it is to examine themselves will soon own that it is very   0 difficult to trace the root and origin of this passion it is one of those we are most ashamed of and therefore the hurtful part of it is easily subdued and corrected by a judicious education when any body near us stumbles it is natural even before reflexion to stretch out our hands to hinder or at least break the fall which shews that while we are calm we are rather bent to pity but tho malice by it self is little to be feard yet assisted with pride it is often mischievous and becomes most terrible when eggd on and heightend by anger there is nothing that more readily or more effectually extinguishes pity than this mixture which is calld cruelty from whence we may learn that to perform a    meritorious action it is not sufficient barely to conquer a passion unless it likewise be done from a laudable principle and consequently how necessary that clause was in the definition of virtue that our endeavours were to proceed from a rational ambition of being good  pity as i have said somewhere else is the most amiable of all our passions and there are not many occasions on which we ought to conquer or curb it a surgeon may be as compassionate as he pleases so it does not make him omit or forbear to perform what he ought to do judges likewise and juries may be influenced with pity if they take care that plain laws and justice it self are not infringed and do not suffer by it no pity does more mischief in the world than what is excited by the tenderness of parents and hinders them from managing their children as their rational love to them would require and themselves could wish it the sway likewise which this passion bears in the affections of women is more considerable than is commonly imagined and they daily commit faults that are altogether ascribed to lust and yet are in a great measure owing to pity what i named last is not the only passion that mocks     and resembles charity pride and vanity have built more hospitals than all the virtues together men are so tenacious of their possessions and selfishness is so riveted in our nature that whoever can but any ways con   quer it shall have the applause of the publick and all the encouragement imaginable to conceal his frailty and sooth any other appetite he shall have a mind to indulge the man that supplies with his private fortune what the whole must otherwise have provided for obliges every member of the society and therefore all the world are ready to pay him their acknowledgement and think themselves in duty bound to pronounce all such actions virtuous without examining or so much as looking into the motives from which they were performd nothing is more destructive to virtue or religion it self than to make men believe that giving money to the poor tho they should not part with it till after death will make a full atonement in the next world for the sins they have committed in this a villain who has been guilty of a barbarous murder may by the help of false witnesses escape the punishment he deservd he prospers well say heaps up great wealth and by the advice of his father confessor leaves all his estate to a monastery and his children beggars what fine amends has this good christian made for his crime and what an honest man was the priest who directed his conscience he who parts with all he has in his lifetime whatever principle he acts from only gives away what was his own but the rich miser who refuses to assist his nearest relations while he is alive tho they never designedly disobligd    him and disposes of his money for what we call charitable uses after his death may imagine of his goodness what he pleases but he robbs his posterity  i am now thinking     of a late instance of charity a prodigious gift that has made a great noise in the world  i have a mind to set it in the light i think it deserves and beg leave for once to please pedants to treat it somewhat rhetorically that a man with small skill in physick and hardly any learning  should by vile arts get into practice and lay up great wealth is no mighty wonder but that he should so deeply work himself into the good opinion of the world as to gain the general esteem of a nation and establish a reputation beyond all his contemporaries with no other qualities but a perfect knowledge of mankind and a capacity of making the most of it is something extraordinary if a man arrived to such a height of glory should be almost distracted with pride sometimea give his     attendance on a servant or any mean person for nothing and at the same time neglect a nobleman that gives exorbitant fees at other times refuse to leave his bottle for his business without any regard to the quality of the persons that sent for him or the danger they are in if he should be surly and morose affect to be an humourist treat his patients like dogs tho people of distinction and value no man but what would deify him and never call in question the certainty of his oracles if he    should insult all the world affront the first nobility and extend his insolence even to the royal family  if to maintain as well as to increase the fame of his sufficiency he should scorn to consult with his betters on what emergency soever look down with contempt on the most deserving of his profession and never confer with any other physician but what will pay homage to his superior genius creep to his humour and never approach him but with all the slavish obsequiousness a courtflatterer can treat a prince with if a man in his lifetime should discover on the one hand such manifest symptoms of superlative pride and an insatiable greediness after wealth at the same time and on the other no regard to religion or affection to his kindred no compassion to the poor and hardly any humanity to his fellowcreatures if he gave no proofs that he lovd his country had a publick spirit or was a lover of arts of books or of literature what must we judge of his motive the principle he acted from when after his death we find that he has left a trifle among his relations who stood in need of it and an immense treasure to an university that did not want ita     let a man be as charitable as it is possible for him to be without forfeitinga his reason or good sense can he think otherwise but that this famous physician did in the making of his will as in every thing else indulge his darling passion entertaining his vanity with the hap   piness of the contrivance when he thought on the monuments and inscriptions with all the sacrifices of praise that would be made to him and above all the yearly tribute of thanks of reverence and veneration that would be paid to his memory with so much pomp and solemnity when he considerd how in all these performances wit and invention would be rackd art and eloquence ransackd to find out encomiums suitable to the publick spirit the munificence and the dignity of the benefactor and the artful gratitude of the receivers when he thought on i say and considerd these things it must have thrown his ambitious soul into vast ecstasies of pleasure especially when he ruminated on the duration of his glory and the perpetuity he would by this means procure to his name charitable opinions are often stupidly false when men are dead and gone we ought to judge of their actions as we do of books and neither wrong their understanding nor our own the british æsculapius  was undeniably a man of sense and if he had been influencd by charity a publick spirit or the love of learning and had aimd at the good of mankind in general or that of his own profession in particular and acted from any of these principles he could never have made such a will because so much wealth might have been better managed and a man of much less capacity would have found out several better    ways of laying out the money but if we consider that he was as undeniably a man of vast pride as he was a man of     sense and give ourselves leave only to surmise that this extraordinary gift might have proceeded from such a motive we shall presently discover the excellency of his parts and his consummate knowledge of the world for if a man would render himself immortal be ever praisd and deifyd after his death and have all the acknowledgement the honours and compliments paid to his memory that vainglory herself could wish for i dont think it in human skill to invent a more effectual method had he followd arms behaved himself in five and twenty sieges and as many battles with the bravery of an alexander and exposed his life and limbs to all the fatigues and dangers of war for fifty campaigns together or devoting himself to the muses sacrificd his pleasure his rest and his health to literature and spent all his days in a laborious study and the toils of learning or else abandoning all worldly interest excelld in probity temperance and austerity of life and ever trod in the strictest path of virtue he would not so effectually have provided for the eternity of his name as after a voluptuous life and the luxurious gratification of his passions he has now done without any trouble or selfdenial only by the choice in the disposal of his money when he was forcd to leave it  00a rich miser who is thoroughly selfish and would receive the interest of his money even after his death has nothing else to do than to defraud his relations and leave his estate to some famous university they are the best markets to buy immortality at with little merit in them knowledge wit and penetration are the growth i had almost said the manufacture of the place there men are profoundly skilld in human nature and know what it is their benefactors want and there extraordinary bounties shall always meet with an extraordinary recompense and the measure of the gift is ever the standard of their praises whether the donor be a physician or a tinker     when once the living witnesses that might laugh at them are extinct i can never think on the anniversary of the thanksgivingday decreed to a great man but it puts me in mind of the miraculous cures and other surprizing things that will be said of him aa hundred years hence and i dare prognosticate that before the end of the present century he will have stories forgd in his favour for rhetoricians are never upon oath that shall be as fabulous at least as any legends of the saints of all this our subtle benefactor was not ignorant he understood universities their genius and their politicks and from thence foresaw and knew that the incense to be offerd to him would not cease with the present or a fewb succeeding generations and that it would  0 not only lastc for the trifling space of three or four hundred years but that it would continue to be paid to him through all changes and revolutions of government and religion as long as the nation subsists and the island it self remains it is deplorable that the proud should have such temptations to wrong their lawful heirs for when a man in ease and affluence brimfull of vainglory and humourd in his pride by the greatest of a polite nation has such an infallible security in petto for an everlasting homage and adoration to his manes to be paid in such an extraordinary manner he is like a hero in battle who in feasting ond his own imagination tastes all the felicity of enthusiasm it buoys him up in sickness relieves him in pain and either guards him against or keeps from his view all the terrors of death and the most dismal apprehensions of futurity should it be said that to be thus censorious and look into matters and mense consciences with that nicety will discourage people from laying out their     money this way and that let the money and the motive of the donor be what they will he that receives the benefit is the gainer i would not disown the charge but am of opinion that this a is no injury to the publick should one prevent men from crowding too much treasure into the dead stock of the kingdom there ought to be a vast disproportion between the active and unactive part  0 of the society to make it happy and where this is not regarded the multitude of gifts and endowments may soon be excessive and detrimental to a nation charity where it is too extensive seldom fails of promoting sloth and idleness and is good for little in the commonwealth but to breed drones and destroy industry the more colleges and almshouses you build the more you may the first founders and benefactors may have just and good intentions and would perhaps for their own reputations seem to labour for the most laudable purposes but the executors of those wills the governors that come after them have quite other views and we seldom see charities long applied as it was first intended they should be i have no design that is cruel nor the least aim that savours of inhumanity to have sufficient hospitals for sick and wounded i look upon as an indispensible duty both in peace and war young children without parents old age without support and all that are disabled from working ought to be taken care of with tenderness and alacrity but as on the one hand i would have none neglected that are helpless and really necessitous without being wanting to themselves so on the other i would not encourage beggary or laziness in the poor all should be set to work that are any ways able and scrutinies should be made even among the infirm employments might be found out for most of our lame and many that are unfit  0 for hard labour as well as the blind as long     as their health and strength would allow of it  what i have now under consideration leads me naturally to that kind of distraction the nation has labourd under for some time the enthusiastick passion for charityschools the generality are so bewitched with the usefulness and excellency of them that whoever dares openly oppose them is in danger of being stoned by the rabble children that are taught the principles of religion and can read the word of god have a greater opportunity to improve in virtue and good morality and must certainly be more civilizd than others that are sufferd to run at random and have no body to look after them how perverse must be the judgment of those who would not rather see children decently dressd with clean linen at least once a week that in an orderly manner follow their master to church than in every open place meet with a company of blackguards without shirts or any thing whole about them that insensible of their misery are continually increasing it with oaths and imprecations can any one doubt but these are the great nursery of thieves and pickpockets what numbers of felons and other criminals have we tried and convicted every sessions this will be prevented by charityschools and when the children of the poor receive a better education the society will in a few years reap the benefit of it and the nation be 0  clearda of so many miscreants as now this great city and all the country about it are filld with this is the general cry and he that speaks the least     word against it an uncharitable hardhearted and inhuman if not a wicked profane and atheistical wretch as to the comeliness of the sight no body disputes it but i would not have a nation pay too dear for so transient a pleasure and if we might set aside the finery of the shew every thing that is material in this popular oration   might soon be answerd as to religion the most knowing and polite part of a nation have every where the least of it craft has a greater hand in making rogues than stupidity and vice in general is no where more predominant than where arts and sciences flourish ignorance is to a proverb counted to be the mother of devotion and it is certain that we shall find innocence and honesty no where more general than among the most illiterate the poor silly country people the next to be considerd are the manners and civility that by charityschools are to be grafted into the poor of the nation i confess that in my opinion to be in any degree possessd of what i named is a frivolous if   0 not a hurtful quality at least nothing is less requisite in the laborious poor it is not compliments we want of them but their work and assiduity but i give up this article with all my heart  0 good manners well say are necessary to all people but which way will they be furnished with them in a charityschool boys there may be taught to pull off their caps promiscuously to all they meet unless it be a beggar but that they should acquire in it any civility beyond that i cant conceive the master is not greatly qualifyd as may be guessed by his salary  and if he could teach them manners he has not time for it while they are at school they are either learning or saying their lesson to him or employed in writing or arithmetick and as soon as school is done they are as much at liberty as other poor peoples children it is precept and the example of parents and those they eat drink and converse with that have an influence upon the minds of children reprobate parents that take ill courses and are regardless ofa their children wont have a mannerly civilizd offspring tho they went to a charityschool till they were married the honest painstaking people be they never so poor if they have any notion of goodness and decency themselves will keep their children in awe and never suffer them to rake about the streets and lie out anights those who will work themselves and have any command over their children will make them do something or other that turns to profit as soon as they are able be it never so little and such asb are so ungovernable that neither words norc blows can work upon them  0 no charity school will mend nay experience teaches us that among the charityboys there are abundance of bad ones that swear and curse about and bar the     clothes are as much blackguard as ever towerhill or st jamess producd i am now come to the enormous crimes and vast multitude of malefactors that are all laid upon the want of this notable education that abundance of thefts and robberies are daily committed in and about the city and great numbers yearly suffer death for those crimes is undeniable but because this is ever hooked in when the usefulness of charityschools is called in question as if there was no dispute but they would in a great measure remedy and in time prevent those disorders i intend to examine into the real causes of thosea mischiefs so justly complained of and doubt not but to make it appear that charityschools and every thing else that promotes idleness and keeps the poor from working are more accessary to the growth of villany than the want of reading and writing or even the grossest ignorance and stupidity here i must interrupt my self to obviate the clamours of some impatient people who upon reading of what i said last will cry out that far from encouraging idleness they bring up their charitychildren to handicrafts as well as trades and all manner of honest labour i promise them that i shall take notice of  0 that hereafter and answer it without stifling the least thing that can be said in their behalf in a populous city it is not difficult for a young rascal that has pushed himself into a crowd with a small hand and nimble fingers to whip away a handkerchief or snuffboxb from a man who is thinking on business and regardless of his pocket success in small crimes seldom fails of ushering in greater and he that picks pockets with impunity at twelve is likely to be a housebreaker at sixteen and a thoroughpaced villain long before he is twenty those who are cautious as well as bold and no drunkards may do a world of mischief before they     are discovered and this is one of the greatest inconveniences of such vast overgrown cities as london or paris that they harbour rogues and villains as granaries do vermin they afford a perpetual shelter to the worst of people and are places of safety to thousands of criminals who daily commit thefts and burglaries and yet by often changing their places of abode may conceal themselves for many years and will perhaps for ever escape the hands of justice unless by chance they are apprehended in a fact and when they are taken the evidences perhaps want clearness or are otherwise insufficient the depositions are not strong enough juries and often judges are touched with compassion prosecutors tho vigorous at first often relent before the time of trial comes on few men prefer the publick  0 safety to their own ease a man of goodnature is not easily reconcild with takinga away of another mans life tho he has deserved the gallows to be the cause of any ones death tho justice requires it is what most people are startled at especially men of conscience and probity when they want judgment or resolution as this is the reason that thousands escape that deserve to be capitally punished so it is likewise the cause that there are so many offenders who boldly venture in hopes that if they are taken they shall have the same good fortune of getting off but if men did imagine and were fully persuaded that as surely as they committed a fact that deserved hanging so surely they would be hanged executions would be very rare and the most desperate felon would almost as soon hang himself as he would break open a house to be stupid and ignorant is seldom the character of a thief robberies on the highway and other bold crimes are generally perpetrated by rogues of spirit and a genius and villains of any fame are commonly subtle cunning fellows that are     well versd in the method of trials and acquainted with every quirk in the law that can be of use to them that overlook not the smallest flaw in an indictment and know how to make an advantage of the least slip of an evidence and every thing else that can serve their turn to bring thema off  0 it is a mighty saying that it is better that five hundred guilty people should escape than that one innocent person should suffer this maxim is only true as to futurity and in relation to another world but it is very false in regard to the temporal welfare of the society it is a terrible thing a man should be put to death for a crime he is not guilty of yet so oddly circumstances may meet in the infinite variety of accidents that it is possible it should come to pass all the wisdom that judges and conscienciousness that juries may be possessd of notwithstanding but where men endeavour to avoid this with all the care and precaution human prudence is able to take should such a misfortune happen perhaps once or twice in half a score years on condition that all that time justice should be administred with all the strictness and severity and not one guilty person suffered to escape with impunity it would be a vast advantage to a nation not only as to the securing of every one s property and the peace of the society in general but it would likewise save the lives of hundreds if not thousands of necessitous wretches that are daily hanged for trifles and who would never have attempted any thing against the law or at least notb have ventured on capital crimes if the hopes of getting off should they be taken had not been one of the motives that animated their resolution therefore where the laws are plain and severe all the remissness   0in the execution of them lenity of juries and frequency of pardons are in the main a much greater cruelty to a populous state or kingdom      than the use of racks and the most exquisite torments another great cause of those evils is to be lookd for in the want of precaution in those that are robbed and the many temptations that are given abundance of families are very remiss in looking after the safety of their houses some are robbed by the carelessness of servants others for having grudgd the price of bars and shutters brass and pewter are ready money they are every where about the house plate perhaps and money are better secured but an ordinary lock is soon opened when once a rogue is got in it is manifest then that many different causes concur and several scarce avoidable evils contribute to the misfortune of being pesterd with pilferers thieves and robbers which all countries ever were and ever will be more or less in and near considerable towns more especially vast and overgrown cities tis opportunity makes the thief carelessness and neglect in fastning doors and windows the excessive tenderness of juries and prosecutors the small difficulty of getting a reprieve and frequency of pardons but above all the many examples of those who are known to be guilty are destitute both of friends and money and yet by imposing on the jury baffling the    witnesses or other tricks and stratagems find out means to escape the gallows these are all strong temptations that conspire to draw in the necessitous who want principle and education to these you may add as auxiliaries to mischief an habit of sloth and idleness and strong aversion to labour and assiduity which all young people will contract that are not brought up to downright working or at least kept employd most days in the week and the greatest part of the day all children that are idle even the best of either sex are bad company to one another whenever they meet     it is not then the want a of reading and writing but the concurrence and a complication of more substantial evils that are the perpetual nursery of abandond profligates in great and opulent nations and whoever would accuse ignorance stupidity and dastardness as the first and what physicians call the procatartic cause  let him examine into the lives and narrowly inspect the conversations and actions of ordinary rogues and our common felons and he will find the reverse to be true and that the blame ought rather to be laid on the excessive cunning and subtlety and too much knowledge in general which the worst of miscreants and the scum of the nation are possessed of human nature is every where the same genius wit and natural parts are always sharpened by application and may be as much    improvd in the practice of the meanest villany as they can in the exercise of industry or the most heroic virtue there is no station of life where pride emulation and the love of glory may not be displayed a young pickpocket that makes a jest of his angry prosecutor and dexterously wheedles the old justice into an opinion of his innocence is envied by his equals and admired byb all the fraternity rogues have the same passions to gratify as other men and value themselves on their honour and faithfulness to one another their courage intrepidity and other manly virtues as well as people of better professions and in daring enterprizes the resolution of a robber may be as much supported by his pride as that of an honest soldier who fights for his country the evils then we complain of are owing to quite other causes than what we assign for them men must be very wavering in their sentiments if not     inconsistent with themselves that at one time will uphold knowledge and learning to be the most proper means to promote religion and defend at another that ignorance is the mother of devotion but if the reasons alledged for this general education are not the true ones whence comes it that the whole kingdom both great and small are so unanimously fond of it there is no miraculous conversion to be perceivd among us no universal bent to goodness and morality    that has on a sudden overspread the island there is as much wickedness as ever charity is as cold and real virtue as scarce the year seventeen hundred and twenty has been as prolifick in deep villany and remarkable for selfish crimes and premeditated mischief as can be pickd out of any century whatever not committed by poor ignorant rogues that could neither read nor write but the better sort of people as to wealth and education that most of them were great masters in arithmetick and livd in reputation and splendor  to say that when a thing is once in vogue the multitude follows the common cry that charity schools are in fashion in the same manner as hoopd petticoats by caprice and that no more reason can be given for the one than the other i am afraid will not be satisfactory to the curious and at the same time i doubt much whether it will be thought of great weight by many of my readers what i can advance besides the real source of this present folly is certainly very abstruse and remote from sight but he that affords the least light in matters of great obscurity does a kind office to the enquirers i am willing to     allow that in the beginning the first design of those schools was good and charitable but to know what increases them so extravagantly and who are the chief promoters of them now we must make our search another way and address ourselves to the rigid    partymen that are zealous for their cause either episcopacy or presbytery but as the latter are but the poor mimicks of the first tho equally pernicious we shall confine ourselves to the national church and take a turn thro a parish that is not blessd yet with a charity school—but here i think myself obliged in conscience to ask pardon of my reader for the tiresome dance i am going to lead him if he intends to follow me and therefore i desire that he would either throw away the book and leave me or else arm himself with the patience of job to endure all the impertinences of low life the cant and tittletattle he is like to meet with before he can go half a streets length first we must look out among the young shopkeepers that have not half the business they could wish for and consequently time to spare if such a newbeginner has but a little pride more than ordinary and loves to be medling he is soon mortifyd in the vestry where men of substance and long standing or else your pert litigious or opinionated bawlers that have obtained the title of notable men commonly bear the sway his stock and perhaps credit are but inconsiderable and yet he finds within himself a strong inclination to govern a man thus qualified thinks it a thousand pities there is no charity school in the parish he communicates his thoughts to two or three of his acquaintance first they do the same to others and in a months time there is nothing else talkd of in    the parish every body invents discourses and arguments to the purpose according to his abilities—it is an errant shame says one to see so many poor that are not able to educate their children and no provision made for     them where we have so many rich people what dye talk of rich answers another they are the worst they must have so many servants coaches and horses they can lay out hundreds and some of them thousands of pounds for jewels and furniture but not spare a shilling to a poor creature that wants it when modes and fashions are discoursd of they can hearken with great attention but are wilfully deaf to the cries of the poor indeed neighbour replies the first you are very right i dont believe there is a worse parish in england for charity than ours tis such as you and i that would do good if it was in our power but of those that are able theres very few that are willing others more violent fall upon particular persons and fasten slander on every man of substance they dislike and a thousand idle stories in behalf of charity are raisd and handed about to defame their betters while this is doing throughout the neighbourhood he that first broachd the pious thought rejoices to hear so many come in to it and places no small merit in being the first cause of so much talk and bustle but neither himself nor his intimates being considerable enough to set such a thing on foot some body    must be found out who has greater interest he is to be addressd to and shewd the necessity the goodness the usefulness and christianity of such a design next he is to be flatterd—indeed sir if you would espouse it no body has a greater influence over the best of the parish than yourself one word of you i am sure would engage such a one if you once woulda take it to heart sir i would look upon the thing as done sir—if by this kind of rhetorick they can draw in some old fool or conceited busybody that is rich or at least reputed to be such the thing begins to be feasible and is discoursd of among the better sort the parson or his curate and the lecturer are every where extolling the pious project     the first promoters mean while are indefatigable if they were guilty of any open vice they either sacrifice it to the love of reputation or at least grow more cautious and learn to play the hypocrite well knowing that to be flagitious or noted for enormities is inconsistent with the zeal which they pretend to for works of supererogation and excessive piety the number of these diminutive patriots increasing they form themselves into a society and appoint stated meetings where every one concealing his vices has liberty to display his talents religion is the theme or else the misery of the times occasiond by atheism and profaneness men of worth who live in splendor and thriving people that have a great    deal of business of their own are seldom seen among them men of sense and education likewise if they have nothing to do generally look out for better diversion all those who have a higher aim shall have their attendance easily excusd but contribute they must or else lead a weary life in the parish two sorts of people come in voluntarily stanch churchmen who have good reasons for it in petto and your sly sinners that look upon it as meritorious and hope that it will expiate their guilt and satan be nonsuited by it at a small expence some come into it to save their credit others to retrieve it according as they have either lost or are afraid of losing it others again do it prudentially to increase their trade and get acquaintance and many would own to you if they dared to be sincere and speak the truth that they would never have been concernd in it but to be better known in the parish men of sense that see the folly of it and have no body to fear are persuaded into it not to be thought singular or to run counter to all the world even those who are resolute at first in denying ita it is ten to one but at last they are teazd and importund into a compliance the charge   0 being calculated for most of the inhabitants the insignificancy of it is another argument that prevails much and many are drawn in to be contributors who without that would have stood out and strenuously opposed the whole scheme    the governors are made of the middling people and many inferiour to that class are made use of if the forwardness of their zeal can but overbalance the meanness of their condition if you should ask these worthy rulers why they take upon them so much trouble to the detriment of their own affairs and loss of time either singly or the whole body of them they would all unanimously answer that it is the regard they have for religion and the church and the pleasure they take in contributing to the good and eternal welfare of so many poor innocents that in all probability would run into perdition in these wicked times of scoffers and freethinkers they have no thought of interest even those who deal in and provide these children with what they want have not the least design of getting by what they sell for their use and tho in every thing else their avarice and greediness after lucre be glaringly conspicuous in this affair they are wholly divested from selfishness and have no worldly ends one motive above all which is none of the least with thea most of them is to be carefully conceald i mean the satisfaction there is in ordering and directing there is a melodious sound in the word governor that is charming to mean people every body admires sway and superiority even imperium in belluas  has its delights there is a pleasure in ruling over any thing and it is this chiefly    that supports human nature in the tedious slavery of schoolmasters but if there be the least satisfaction in governing the children it must be ravishing to govern the schoolmaster himself      what fine things are said and perhaps wrote to a governor when a schoolmaster is to be chosen how the praises tickle and how pleasant it is not to find out the fulsomness of the flattery the stiffness of the expressions or the pedantry of the style those who can examine nature will always find that what these people most pretend to is the least and what they utterly deny their greatest motive no habit or quality is more easily acquird than hypocrisy nor any thing sooner learnd than to deny the sentiments of our hearts and the principle we act from but the seeds of every passion are innate to us and no body comes into the world without them if we will mind the pastimes and recreations of young children we shall observe nothing more general in them than that all who are sufferd to do it take delight in playing with kittens and little puppy dogs what makes them always lugging and pulling the poor creatures about the house proceeds from nothing else but that they can do with them what they please and put them into what posture and shape they list and the pleasure they receive from this is originally owing to the love of dominion and that usurping temper all mankind are born with   0when this great work is brought to bear and actually accomplishd joy and serenity seema to overspread the face of every inhabitant which likewise to account for i must make a short digression there are every where slovenly sorry fellows that are used to be seen always ragged and dirty these people we look upon as miserable creatures in general and unless they are very remarkable we take little notice of them and yet among these there are handsome and wellshaped men as well as among their betters but if one of these turns soldier what a vast alteration is there observd in him for the better as soon as he is put in his red coat and we see him look     smart with his grenadiers cap and a great ammunition sword  all who knew him before are struck with other ideas of his qualities and the judgment which both men and women form of him in their minds is very different from what it was there is something analogous to this in the sight of charity children there is a natural beauty in uniformity which most people delight in it is diverting to the eye to see children well matchd either boys or girls march two and two in good order and to have them all whole and tight in the same clothes and trimming must add to the comeliness of the sight and what makes it still more generally entertaining is the imaginary share which even servants and the meanest in the parish have in it to whom it costs nothing our parish church our charity    children in all this there is a shadow of property that tickles every body that has a right to make use of the words but more especially those who actually contribute and had a great hand in advancing the pious work it is hardly conceiveable that men should so little know their own hearts and be so ignorant of their inward condition as to mistake frailty passion and enthusiasm for goodness virtue and charity yet nothing is more true than that the satisfaction the joy and transports they feel on the accounts i named pass with these miserable judges for principles of piety and religion whoever will consider what i have said for two or three pages and suffer his imagination to rove a little further on what he has heard and seen concerning this subject will be furnished with sufficient reasons abstract from the love of god and true christianity why charityschools are in such uncommon vogue and so unanimously approvd of and admired among all sorts and conditions of people it is a theme which every     body can talk of and understands thoroughly there is not a more inexhaustible fund for tittletattle and a variety of low conversation in hoyboats and stagecoaches if a governor that in behalf of the school or the sermon exerted himself more than ordinary happens to be in company how he is commended by the women and his zeal and charitable disposition extolld to the skies upon my word sir says an old lady    we are all very much obliged to you i dont think any of the other governors could have made interest enough to procure us a bishop twas on your account i am told that his lordship came tho he was not very well to which the other replies very gravely that it is his duty but that he values no trouble nor fatigue so he can be but serviceable to the children poor lambs indeed says he i was resolvd to get a pair of lawn sleeves tho i rid all night for it and i am very glad i was not disappointed sometimes the school it self is discoursd of and of whom in all the parish it is most expected he should build one the old room where it is now kept is ready to drop down such a one had a vast estate left him by his uncle and a great deal of money besides a thousand pounds would be nothing in his pocket at others the great crouds are talkd of that are seen at some churches and the considerable sums that are gatherd from whence by an easy transition they go over to the abilities the different talents and orthodoxy of clergymen dr —— —— —— is a man of great parts and learning and i believe he is very hearty for the church but i dont like him for a charitysermon there is no better man in the world than —— —— —— he forces the money out of their pockets when he preachd last for our children i am sure there was abundance of people that gave more than they intended when they came to church         i could see it in their faces and rejoicd at it heartily another charm that renders charityschools so bewitching to the multitude is the general opinion establishd among them that they are not only actually beneficial to society as to temporal happiness but likewise that christianity enjoynsa and requires of us we should erect them for our future welfare they are earnestly and fervently recommended by the whole body of the clergy and have more labour and eloquence laid out upon them than any other christian duty not by young parsonsb or poor scholars of little credit but the most learned of our prelates and the most eminent for orthodoxy even those who do not often fatigue themselves on any other occasion as to religion there is no doubt but they know what is chiefly required of us and consequently the most necessary to salvation and as to the world who should understand the interest of the kingdom better than the wisdom of the nation of which the lords spiritual are so considerable a branch the consequence of this sanction is first that those who with their purses or power are instrumental to the increase or maintenance of these schools are tempted to place a greater merit in what they do than otherwise they could suppose it deservd secondly that all the rest who either cannot or will not any ways contribute towards them have still a very good reason    why they should speak well of them for tho it be difficult in things that interfere with our passions to act well it is always in our power to wish well because it is performd with little cost there is hardly a person so wicked among the superstitious vulgar but in the liking he has for charityschools he imagines to see a glimmering hope that it will make an atonement for his sins from the same principle as the most vicious comfort themselves     with the love and veneration they bear to the church and the greatest profligates find an opportunity in it to shew the rectitude of theira inclinations at no expence but if all these were not inducements sufficient to make men stand up in defence of the idol i speak of there is another that will infallibly bribe most people to be advocates for it we all naturally love triumph and whoever engages in this causeb is sure of conquest at least in nine companies out of ten let him dispute with whom he will considering the speciousness of the pretence and the majority he has on his side it is a castle an impregnable fortress he can never be beat out of and was the most sober virtuous man alive to produce all the arguments to prove the detriment charityschools at least the multiplicity of them do to society which i shall give hereafter and such as are yet stronger against the greatest scoundrel in the world who should only make use of the common cant of charity and religion the    vogue would be against the first and himself lose his cause in the opinion of the vulgar the rise then and original of all the bustle and clamour that is made throughout the kingdom in behalf of charityschools is chiefly built on frailty and human passion at least it is more than possible that a nation should have the same fondness and feel the same zeal for them as are shewn in ours and yet not be prompted to it by any principle of virtue or religion encouraged by this consideration i shall with the greater liberty attack this vulgar error and endeavour to make it evident that far from being beneficial this forcd education is pernicious to the publick the welfare whereof as it demands of us a regard superior to all other laws and considerations so it shall be the only apology i intend to make for differing from the present sentiments of the     learned and reverend body of our divines and venturing plainly to deny what i have just now ownd to be openly asserted by most of our bishops as well as inferior clergy as our church pretends to no infallibility even in spirituals her proper province so it cannot be an affront to her to imagine that she may err in temporals which are not so much under her immediate care—— —— —— but to my task the whole earth being cursd and no bread to be had but what we eat in the sweat of our brows vast toil must be undergone before man can provide himself with necessaries for his    sustenance and the bare support of his corrupt and defective nature as he is a single creature but infinitely more to make life comfortable in a civil society where men are become taught animals and great numbers of them have by mutual compact framed themselves into a body politick and the more mans knowledge increases in this state the greater will be the variety of labour required to make him easy it is impossible that a society can long subsist and suffer many of its members to live in idleness and enjoy all the ease and pleasure they can invent without having at the same time great multitudes of people that to make good this defect will condescend to be quite the reverse and by use and patience inure their bodies to work for others and themselves besides the plenty and cheapness of provisions depends in a great measure on the price and value that is set upon this labour and consequently the welfare of all societies even before they are tainted with foreign luxury requires that it should be performd by such of their members as in the first place are sturdy and robust and never used to ease or idleness and in the second soon contented as to the necessaries of life such as are glad to take up with the coursest manufacture in every thing they wear and in their diet have no other aim than to feed their bodies when their     stomachs prompt them to eat and with little regard to taste or relish refuse no wholesome nourishment that can be swallowd    when men are hungry or ask any thing for their thirst but to quench it as the greatest part of the drudgery is to be done by daylight so it is by this only that they actually measure the time of their labour without any thought of the hours they are employd or the weariness they feel and the hireling in the country must get up in the morning not because he has rested enough but because the sun is going to rise this last article alone would be an intolerable hardship to grown people under thirty who during nonage had been used to lie abed as long as they could sleep but all three together make upa such a condition of life as a man more mildly educated would hardly choose tho it should deliver him from a goal or a shrew if such people there must be as no great nation can be happy without vast numbers of them would not a wise legislature cultivate the breed of them with all imaginable care and provide against their scarcity as he would prevent the scarcity of provision it self no man would be poor and fatigue himself for a livelihood if he could help it the absolute necessity all stand in for victuals and drink and in cold climates for clothes and lodging makes them submit to any thing that can be bore with if no body did want no body would work but the greatest hardships are lookd upon as solid pleasures when they keep a man from starving    from what has been said it is manifest that in a free nation where slaves are not allowd of the surest wealth consists in a multitude of laborious poor for besides that they are the neverfailing nursery of fleets and armies without them there could be no enjoyment and no product of any country could be valuable to make the society     happy and people easy under the meanest circumstances it is requisite that great numbers of them should be ignorant as well as poor knowledge both enlarges and multiplies our desires and the fewer things a man wishes for the more easily his necessities may be supplyd the welfare and felicity therefore of every state and kingdom require that the knowledge of the working poor should be confind within the verge of their occupations and never extended as to things visible beyond what relates to their calling the more a shepherd a plowman or any other peasant knows of the world and the things that are foreign to his labour or employment the less fit hell be to go through the fatigues and hardships of it with chearfulness and content reading writing and arithmetick are very necessary to those whose business require such qualifications but where peoples livelihood has no dependence on thesea arts they are very pernicious to the poor who are forcd to get their daily bread by their daily labour few children make any progress at school but at the    same time they are capable of being employd in some business or other so that every hour thoseb of poor people spend at their book is so much time lost to the society going to school in comparison to working is idleness and the longer boys continue in this easy sort of life the more unfit theyll be when grown up for downright labour both as to strength and inclination men who are to remain and end their days in a laborious tiresome and painful station of life the sooner they are put upon it at first the more patiently theyll submit to it for ever after hard labour and the coarsest diet arec a proper punishment to several kinds of malefactors but to impose either on those that have not been used and brought up to both is the greatest     cruelty when there is no crime you can charge them with reading and writing are not attaind to without some labour of the brain and assiduity and before people are tolerably versd in either they esteem themselves infinitely above those who are wholly ignorant of them often with so little justice and moderation as if they were of another species as all mortals have naturally an aversion to trouble and painstaking so we are all fond of and apt to overvalue those qualifications we have purchased at the expence of our ease and quiet for years together those who spent a great part of their youth in learning to read write and cypher expect and not unjustly to be em  0ployd where those qualifications may be of use to them the generality of them will look upon downright labour with the utmost contempt i mean labour performd in the service of others in the lowest station of life and for the meanest consideration a man who has had some education may follow husbandry by choice and be diligent at the dirtiest and most laborious work but then the concern must be his own and avarice the care of a family or some other pressing motive must put him upon it but he wont make a good hireling and serve a farmer for a pitiful reward at least he is not so fit for it as a daylabourer that has always been employd about the plough and dung cart and remembers not that ever he has lived otherwise when obsequiousness and mean services are required we shall always observe that they are never so chearfully nor so heartily performd as from inferiors to superiors i mean inferiors not only in riches and quality but likewise in knowledge and understanding a servant a can have no unfeignd respect for his master as soon as he has sense enough to find out that he serves a fool when we are to learn or to   0 obey we shall experience in our selves that the greater opinion we have of the wisdom and capacity of those that are either to teach or command us the greater deference we pay to their laws and instructions no creatures submit contentedly to their equals    and should a horse know as much as a man i should not desire to be his rider here i am obliged again to make a digression tho i declare ia never had a less mind to it than i have at this minute but i see a thousand rods in piss  and the whole posse of diminutive pedants against me for assaulting the christcrossrow  and opposing the very elements of literature this is no panick fear and the reader will not imagine my apprehensions ill grounded if he considers what an army of petty tyrants i have to cope with that all either actually persecute with birch or else are solliciting for such a preferment for if i had no other adversaries than the starving wretches of both sexes throughout the kingdom of great britain that from a natural antipathy to working have a great dislike to their present employment and perceiving within a much stronger inclination to command than ever they felt to obey others think themselves qualifyd and wish from their hearts to be masters and mistresses of charityschools the number of my enemies would by the most modest computation amount to one hundred thousand at least methinksb i hear them cry out that a more dangerous doctrine never was broachd and poperys a fool to it and ask what brute of a saracen it is that draws his ugly weapon for the destruction of learning it is ten to one but theyll indict me for endeavouring by in   stigation of the prince of darkness to introduce into these realms greater ignorance and barbarity     than ever nation was plunged into by goths and vandals since the light of the gospel first appeared in the world whoever labours under the publick odium has always crimes laid to his charge he never was guilty of and it will be suspected that i have had a hand in obliterating the holy scriptures and perhaps affirmd that it was at my request that the small bibles publishd by patent in the year      and chiefly made use of in charityschools were through badness of print and paper renderd illegible which yet i protest i am as innocent of as the child unborn but i am in a thousand fears the more i consider my case the worse i like it and the greatest comfort i have is in my sincere belief that hardly any body will mind a word of what i say or else if ever the people suspected that what i write would be of any weight to any considerable part of the society i should not have the courage barely to think on all the trades i should disoblige and i cannot but smile when i reflect on the variety of uncouth sufferings that would be prepard for me if the punishment they would differently inflict upon me was emblematically to point at my crime for if i was not suddenly stuck full of useless penknifes up to the hilts the company of stationers would certainly take me in hand and either have me buried alive in their hall under a great heap of primers and spel   lingbooks they would not be able to sell or else send me up against tide to be bruised to death in a paper mill that would be obliged to stand still a week upon my account the inkmakers at the same time would for the publick good offer to choke me with astringents or drown me in the black liquor that would be left upon their hands which if they joind stock might easily be performd in less than a month and if i should escape the cruelty of these united bodies the resentment of a private monopolist would be as fatal to me and i should soon find my self pelted and     knockd o th head with little squat bibles claspd in brass and ready armd for mischief that charitable learning ceasing would be fit for nothing but unopend to fight with and exercises truly polemick  the digression i spoke of just now is not the foolish trifle that ended with the last paragraph and which the grave critick to whom all mirth is unseasonable will think very impertinent but a serious apologetical one i am going to make out of hand to clear my self from having any design against arts and sciences as some heads of colleges and other careful preservers of human learning might have apprehended upon seeing ignorance recommended as a necessary ingredient in the mixture of civil society    in the first place i would have near double the number of professors in every university of what there is now theology with us is generally well provided but the two other faculties have very little to boast of especially physick  every branch of that art ought to have two or three professors that would take pains to communicate their skill and knowledge to others in publick lectures a vain man has great     opportunities to set off his parts but private instructions are more useful to students pharmacy and the knowledge of the simples are as necessary as anatomy or the history of diseases it is a shame that when men have taken their degree and are by authority intrusted with the lives of the subject they should be forcd to come to london to be acquainted with the materia medica and the composition of medicines and receive instructions from others that never had university education themselves it is certain that in the city i named there is ten times more opportunity for a man to improve himself in anatomy botany pharmacy and the practice of physick than at botha universities together what has an oilshop to do with silks or who would look for hams and pickles at a mercers where things are well managed hospitals are made as subservient to the advancement of students in the art of physick as they are to the recovery of health in the poor    good sense ought to govern men in learning as well as in trade no man ever bound his son prentice to a goldsmith to make him a linendraper then why should he have a divine for his tutor to become a lawyer or a physician it is true that the languages logick and philosophy should be the first studies in all the learned professions but there is so little help for physick in our universities that are so rich and where so many idle people are well paid for eating and drinking and being magnificently as well as commodiously lodgd that bar books and what is common to all the three faculties a man may as well qualify himself at oxford or cambridge to be a turkeymerchant as he can to be a physician which is in my humble opinion a great sign that some part of the great wealth they are possessed of is not so well applied as it might be professors should besides their stipends allowed emb     by the publick have gratifications from every student they teach that selfinterest as well as emulation and the love of glory might spur them on to labour and assiduity when a man excels in any one study or part of learning and is qualifyd to teach others he ought to be procurd if money will purchase him without regarding what party or indeed what country or nation he is of whether black or white universities should be publick marts for all manner of literature as your annual fairs that are kept at leipsick francfort and    other places in germany are for different wares and merchandizes where no difference is made between natives and foreigners and which men resort to from all parts of the world with equal freedom and equal privilege from paying the gratifications i spoke of i would excuse all students designd for the ministry of the gospel there is no faculty so immediately necessary to the government of a nation as that of theology and as we ought to have great numbers of divines for the service of this island i would not have the meaner people discouraged from bringing up their children to that function for tho wealthy men if they have many sons sometimes make one of them a clergyman as we see even persons of quality take up holy orders and there are likewise people of good sense especially divines that from a principle of prudence bring up their children to that profession when they are morally assured that they have friends or interest enough and shall be able either by a good fellowship at the university advowsons or other means to procure em a livelihood but these produce not the large number of divines that are yearly ordaind and for the bulk of the clergy we are indebted to another original among the midling people of all trades there are bigots who have a superstitious awe for a gown and cassock of these there are multitudes that feel an     ardent desire of having a son    promoted to the ministry of the gospel without considering what is to become of them afterwards and many a kind mother in this kingdom without consulting her own circumstances or her childs capacity transported with this laudable wish is daily feasting on this pleasing thought and often before her son is twelve years old mixing maternal love with devotion throws herself into ecstasies and tears of satisfaction by reflecting on the future enjoyment she is to receive from seeing him stand in a pulpit and with her own ears hearing him preach the word of god it is to this religious zeal or at least the human frailties that pass for and represent it that we owe the great plenty of poor scholars the nation enjoys for considering the inequality of livings and the smallness of benefices up and down the kingdom without this happy disposition in parents of small fortune we could not possibly be furnished from any other quarter with proper persons for the ministry to attend all the cures of souls so pitifully provided for that no mortal could live upon them that had been educated in any tolerable plenty unless he was possessed of real virtue which it is foolish and indeed injurious we should more expect from the clergy than we generally find it in the laity  the great care i would take to promote that part of learning which is more immediately useful to society should not make me neglect    the more curious and polite but all the liberal arts and every branch of literature should be encouraged throughout the kingdom more than they are if my wishing could do it in every county there should be one or more large schools erected at the publick charge for latin and greek that should be divided into six or more classes with particular masters in each of them the whole should be under the care and inspection     of some men of letters in authority who would not only be titular governors but actually take pains at least twice a year in hearing every class thoroughly examind by the master of it and not content themselves with judging of the progress the scholars had made from themes and other exercises that had been made out of their sight at the same time i would discouragea and hinder the multiplicity of those petty schools that never would have had any existence had the masters of them not been extremely indigent it is a vulgar error that no body can spell or write english well without a little smatch of latin this is upheld by pedants for their own interest and by none more strenuously maintained than such of emb as are poor scholars in more than one sense in the mean time it is an abominable falshood i have known and am still acquainted with several and some of the fair sex that never learnd any latin and yet keep to strict orthography and write admirable good sense  whereasc on the other hand every    body may meet with the scriblings of pretended scholars at leastd such as went to a grammar school for several years that have grammar faults and are illspelt the understanding of latin thoroughly is highly necessary to all that are designed for any of the learned professions and i would have no gentleman without literature even those who are to be brought up attorneys surgeons and apothecaries should be much better versd in that language than generally they are but to youth who afterwards     are to get a livelihood in trades and callings in which latin is not daily wanted it is of no use and the learning of it an evident loss of just so much time and money as are bestowed upon it  when men come into business what was taught them of it in those petty schools is either soon forgot or only fit to make them impertinent and often very troublesome in company few men can forbear valuing themselves on any knowledge they had once acquired even after they have lost it and unless they are very modest and discreet the undigested scraps which such people commonly remember of latin seldom fail of rendring them at one time or other ridiculous to those who understand it reading and writing i would treat as we do musick and dancing i would not hinder them nor force them upon the society as long as there was any thing to be got by them there would be masters enough to teach them but   0nothing should be taught for nothing but at church and here i would exclude even those who might be designed for the ministry of the gospel for if parents are so miserably poor that they cant afford their children these first elements of learning it is impudence in them to aspire any further it woud encourage likewise the lower sort of people to give their children this part of education if they could see them preferred to those of idle sots or sorry rakehells that never knew what it was to provide a rag for their brats but by begging but now when a boy or a girl are wanted for any small     service we reckon it a duty to employ our charity children before any other the education of them looks like a reward for being vicious and unactive a benefit commonly bestowd on parents who deserve to be punished for shamefully neglecting their families in one place you may hear a rascal halfdrunk damning himself call for the othera pot and as a good reason for it add that his boy is provided for in clothes and has his schooling for nothing in another you shall see a poor woman in great necessity whose child is to be taken care of because herself is a lazy slut and never did any thing to remedy her wants in good earnest but bewailing them at a jinshop if every bodys children are well taught who by their own industry can educate them at our universities there will be men of learn   ing enough to supply this nation and such another and reading writing or arithmetick would never be wanting in the business that requires them tho none were to learn them but such whose parents could be at the charge of it it is not with letters as it is with the gifts of the holy ghost that they may not be purchased with money and bought wit if we believe the proverb is none of the worst i thought it necessary to say thus much of learning to obviate the clamours of the enemies to truth and fair dealing who had i not so amply explained my self on this head woud have represented me as a mortal foe to all literature and useful knowledge and a wicked advocate for universal ignorance and stupidity i shall now make good my promise of answering what i knowb the wellwishers to charityschools would object against me by saying that they brought up thec children under their care to warrantable and laborious trades and not to idleness as i did insinuate     i have sufficiently shewd already why going to school was idleness if compard to working and exploded this sort of education in the children of the poor because it incapacitates them ever after for downright labour which is their proper province and in every civil society a portion they ought not to repine or grumble at if exacted from them with discretion and humanity what remains is that i should speak as to their putting them out to trades    which i shall endeavour to demonstrate to be destructive to the harmony of a nation and an impertinent intermeddling with what few of these governors know any thing of in order to this let us examine into the nature of societies and what the compound ought to consist of if we would raise it to as high a degree of strength beauty and perfection as the ground we are to do it upon will let us the variety of services that are required to supply the luxurious and wanton desires as well as real necessities of man with all their subordinate callings is in such a nation as ours prodigious yet it is certain that tho the number of those several occupations be excessively great it is far from being infinite if you add one more than is required it must be superfluous if a man had a good stock and the best shop in cheapside to sell turbants in he woud be ruind and if demetrius or any other silversmith made nothing but dianas shrines  he would not get his bread now the worship of that goddess is out of fashion as it is folly to set up trades that are not wanted so what is next to it is to increase in any one trade the numbers beyond what are required as things are managed with us it would be preposterous to have as many brewers as there are bakers or as many woollendrapers as there are shoemakers this proportion as to numbers  00 in every trade finds it self and is never better kept than when no body meddles or interferes with it     people that have children to educate that must get their livelihood are always consulting and deliberating what trade or calling they are to bring them up to till they are fixd and thousands think on this that hardly think at all on any thing else first they confine themselves to their circumstances and he that can give but ten pounds with his son must not look out for a trade where they ask an hundred with an apprentice but the next they think on is always which will be the most advantageous if there be a calling where at that time people are more generally employd than they are in any other in the same reach there are presently half a score fathers ready to supply it with their sons therefore the greatest care most companies have is about the regulation of the number of prentices now when all trades complain and perhaps justly that they are overstocked you manifestly injure that trade to which you add one member more than woud flow from the nature of society besides that the governors of charityschools dont deliberate so much what trade is the best but what tradesmen they can get that will take the boys with such a sum and few men of substance and experience will have any thing to do with these children they are afraid of aa hundred inconveniences from the necessitous parents of them so that they are bound at least most commonly either to sots and neglectfulb masters or else such as are very needy and dont    care what becomes of their prentices after they have received the money by which it seems as if we studyd nothing more than to have a perpetual nursery for charityschools when all trades and handicrafts are overstockd it  0  is a certain sign there is a fault in the management of the whole for it is impossible there should be too many people if the country is able to feed them are provisions dear whose fault is that as long as you have ground untilld and hands unemployd but i shall be answerd that to increase plenty must at long run undo the farmer or lessen the rents all over england to which i reply that what the husbandman complains of most is what i would redress the greatest grievance of farmers gardeners and others where hard labour is required and dirty work to be done is that they cant get servants for the same wages they used to have them at the daylabourer grumbles at sixteen pence to do no other drudgery than what thirty years ago his grandfather did chearfully for half the money  as to the rents it is impossible they should fall while you increase your numbers but the price of provisions and all labour in general must fall with them if not before and a man of a hundred and fifty pounds a year has no reason to complain that his income is reduced to one hundred if he can buy as much for that one hundred as before he could have done for two    there is no intrinsick worth in money but what is alterable with the times  and whether a guinea goes for twenty pounds or for a shilling it is as i have already hinted before the labour of the poor and not the high and low value that is set on gold or silver which all the comforts of life must arise from it is in our power to have a much greater plenty than we enjoy if agriculture and fishery were taken care of as they might be but we are so little capable of increasing our labour that we have hardly  0  poor enough to do what is necessary to make us subsist the proportion of the society is spoild and the bulk of the nation which should every where consist of labouring poor that are unacquainted with every thing but their work is too little for the other parts in all business where downright labour is shund or overpaid there is plenty of people to one merchant you have ten bookkeepers or at least pretenders and every where in the country the farmer wants hands ask for a footman that for some time has been in gentlemens families and youll get a dozen that are all butlers you may have chambermaids by the score but you cant get a cook under extravagant wages no body will do the dirty slavish work that can help it i dont discommend them but all these things shew that the people of the meanest rack know too much to be serviceable to us servants require more than masters    and mistresses can afford and what madness is it to encourage them in this by industriously increasing at our cost that knowledge which they will be sure to make us pay for over again and it is not only that those who are educated at our own expence incroach upon us but the raw ignorant country wenches and boobily fellows that can do and are good for nothing impose upon us likewise the scarcity of servants occasiond by the education of the first gives a handle to the latter of advancing their price and demanding what ought only to be given to servants that understand their business and have most of the good qualities that can be required in them there is no place in the world where there are more clever fellows to look at or to do an errand than some of our footmen but what are they good for in the main the greatest part of them are rogues and not to be trusted and if they are honest half of them are sots and will get drunk three or four  0  times a weak the surly ones are generally quarrelsome and valuing their manhood beyond all other considerations care not what clothes they spoil or what disappointments they may occasion when their prowess is in question those who are goodnaturd are generally sad whoremasters that are ever running after the wenches and spoil all the maidservants they come near many of them are guilty of all these vices whoring drinking quarreling and yet shall    have all their faults overlookd and bore with because they are men of good mien and humble address that know how to wait on gentlemen which is an unpardonable folly in masters and generally ends in the ruin of servants some few there are that are not addicteda to any of these failings and understand their duty besides but as these are rarities so there is not one in fifty but what overrates himself his wages must be extravagant and you can never have done giving him every thing in the house is his perquisite and he wont stay with you unless his vails are sufficient to maintain a midling family and tho you had taken him from the dunghil out of an hospital or a prison you shall never keep him longer than he can make of his place what in his high estimation of himself he shall think he deserves nay the best and most civilizd that never were saucy andb impertinent will leave the most indulgent master and to get handsomely away frame fifty excuses and tell downright lies as soon as they can mend themselves a man who keeps an halfcrown or twelvepenny ordinary  looks not more for money from his customers than a footman does from every guest that dines or sups with his master and i question whether the one does not often think a shilling or half a crown according to the quality of the person his due as much as the other  0     a housekeeper who cannot afford to make many entertainments and does not often invite people to his table can have no creditable manservant and is forcd to take up with some country booby or other aukward fellow who will likewise give him the slip as soon as he imagines himself fit for any other service and is made wiser by his rascally companions all noted eatinghouses and places that many gentlemen resort to for diversion or business more especially the precincts of westminsterhall are the great schools for servants where the dullest fellows may have their understandings improved and get rid at once of their stupidity and their innocence they are the academies for footmen where publick lectures are daily read on all sciences of low debauchery by the experiencd professors of them and students are instructed in above seven hundred illiberal arts how to cheat impose upon and find out the blind side of their masters with so much application that in few years they become graduates in iniquity young gentlemen and others that are not thoroughly versd in the world when they get such knowing sharpers in their service are commonly indulging above measure and for fear of discovering their want of experience hardly dare to contradict or deny them any thing which is often the reason that by allowing them unreasonable privileges they expose their ignorance when they are most endeavouring to conceal it    some perhaps will lay the things i complain of to the charge of luxury of which i said that it could do no hurt to a rich nation if the imports never did exceed the exports  but i dont think this imputation just and nothing ought to be scored on the account of luxury that is downright the effect of folly a man may be very extravagant in indulging his ease and his pleasure and render the enjoyment  0  of the world as operose and expensive as they can be made if he can afford it and at the same time shew his good sense in every thing about him this he cannot be said to do if he industriously renders his people incapable of doing him that service he expects from them tis too much money excessive wages and unreasonable vails that spoil servants in england a man may have five and twenty horses in his stables without being guilty of folly if it suits with the rest of his circumstances but if he keeps but one and overfeeds it to shew his wealth he is a fool for his pains is it not madness to suffer that servants should take three and others five per cent of what they pay to tradesmen for their masters as is so well known to watchmakers and others that sell toys superfluous nicknacks and other curiosities if they deal with people of quality and fashionable gentlemen that are above telling their own money if they should accept of a present when offerd it might be connivd at but it is an unpardonable impudence that they should   0claim it as their due and contend for it if refused those who have all the necessaries of life provided for can have no occasion for money but what does them hurt as servants unless they were to hoard it up for age or sickness which among our skipkennels  is not very common and even then it makes them saucy and insupportable i am credibly informd that a parcel of footmen are arrivd to that height of insolence as to have enterd into a society together and made laws by which they oblige themselves not to serve for less than such a sum nor carry burdens or any bundle or parcel above a certain weight not exceeding two or three pounds with other regulations directly opposite to the interest of those they serve and altogether  0  destructive to the use they were designd for if any of them be turnd away for strictly adhering to the orders of this honourable corporation he is taken care of till another service is provided for him and there is no money wanting at any time to commence and maintain a lawsuit against any master that shall pretend to strike or offer any other injury to his gentleman footman contrary to the statutes of their society if this be true as i have reason to believe it is and they are sufferd to go on in consulting and providing for their own ease and conveniency any further we may expect quickly to see the french comedy le maitre le valet  acted in good earnest in most families which    if not redressd in a little time and those footmen increase their company to the number it is possible they may as well as assemble when they please with impunity it will be in their power to make a tragedy of it whenever they have a mind tota but suppose those apprehensions frivolous and groundless it is undeniable that servants in general are daily incroaching upon masters and mistresses and endeavouring to be more upon the level with them they not only seem sollicitous to abolish the low dignity of their condition but have already considerably raisd it in the common estimation from the original meanness which the publick welfare requires it should always remain in i dont say that these things are altogether owing to charityschools there are other evils they may be partly ascribd to london is too big for the country and in several respects we are wanting to our selves but if a thousand faults  0  were to concur before the inconveniences could be produced we labour under can any man doubt who will consider what i have said that charityschools are accessary or at least that they are more likely to create and increase than to lessen or redress those complaints the only thing of weight then that can be said in their behalf is that so many thousand children are educated by them in the christian faith and the principles of the church of england to demonstrate that this is not a suffici   ent plea for them i must desire the reader as i hate repetitions to look back on what i have said before to which i shall add that whatever is necessary to salvation and requisite for poor labouring people to know concerning religion that children learn at school may fully as well either by preaching or catechizing be taught at church from which or some other place of worship i would not have the meanest of a parish that is able to walk to it be absent on sundays it is the sabbath the most useful day in seven that is set apart for divine service and religious exercise as well as resting from bodily labour and it is a duty incumbent on all magistrates to take particular care of that day the poor more especially and their children should be made to go to church on it both in the fore and afternoon because they have no time on any other by precept and example they ought to be encouraged and used to it from their very infancy the wilful neglect of it ought to be counted scandalous and if downright compulsion to what i urge might seem too harsh and perhaps impracticable all diversions at least ought strictly to be prohibited and the poor hindred from every amusement abroad that might allure or draw them from it where this care is taken by the magistrates as far as it lies in their power ministers of the gospel may instil into the smallest capacities more piety and  0  devotion and better principles    of virtue and religion than charityschools ever did or ever will produce and those who complain when they have such opportunities that they cannot imbue their parishioners with sufficient knowledge of what they stand in need of as christians without the assistance of reading and writing are either very lazy or very ignorant and undeserving themselves that the most knowing are not the most religious will be evident if we make a trial between people of different abilities even in this juncture where going to church is not made such an obligation on the poor and illiterate as it might be let us pitch upon a hundred poor men the first we can light on that are above forty and were brought up to hard labour from their infancy such as never went to school at all and always lived remote from knowledge and great towns let us compare to these an equal number of very good scholars that shall all have had university education and be if you will half of them divines well versed in philology and polemick learning then let us impartially examine into the lives and conversations of both and i dare engage that among the first who can neither read nor write we shall meet with more union and neighbourly love less wickedness and attachment to the world more content of mind more innocence sincerity and other good qualities that conduce to the publick peace and real felicity than we shall find among the latter where on the contrary    we may be assured of the height of pride and insolence eternal quarrels and dissensions irreconcilable hatreds strife envy calumny and other vices destructive to mutual concord which the illiterate labouring poor are hardly ever tainted with to any considerable degree i am very well persuaded that what i have said in the last paragraph will be no news to most of my  0  readers but if it be truth why should it be stifled and why must our concern for religion be eternally made a cloke to hide our real drifts and worldly intentions would both parties agree to pull off the masque we should soon discover that whatever they pretend to they aim at nothing so much in charityschools as to strengthen their party and that the great sticklers for the church by educating children in the principles of religion mean inspiring them with a superlative veneration for the clergy of the church of england and a strong aversion and immortal animosity against all that dissent from it to be assured of this we are but to mind on the one hand what divines are most admired for their charity sermons and most fond to preach them  and on the other whether of late years we have had any riots or party scuffles among the mob in which the youth of a famous hospital in this city were not always the most forward ringleaders the grand asserters of liberty who are ever guarding themselves and skirmishing against    arbitrary power often when they are in no danger of it are generally speaking not very superstitious nor seem to lay great stress on any modern apostleship yet some of these likewise speak up loudly for charityschools but what they expect from ema has no relation to religion or morality they only look upon them as the proper means to destroy and disappoint the power of the priests over the laity reading and writing increase knowledge and the more men   0 know the better they can judge for themselves and they imagine that if knowledge could be rendered universal people could not be priestrid which is the thing they fear the most the first i confess it is very probable will get their aim but sure wise men that are not redhot for a party or bigots to the priests will not think it worth while to suffer so many inconveniences as charityschools may be the occasion of only to promote the ambition and power of the clergy to the other i would answer that if all those who are educated at the charge of their parents or relations will but think for themselves and refuse to have their reason imposed upon by the priests we need not be concerned for what the clergy will work upon the ignorant that have no education at all let them make the most of them considering the schools we have for those who can and do pay for learning it is ridiculous to imagine that the abolishing of charityschools would be a step towards    any ignorance that could be prejudicial to the nation i would not be thought cruel and am well assured if i know any thing of myself that i abhor inhumanity but to be compassionate to excess where reason forbids it and the general interest of the society requires steadiness of thought and resolution is an unpardonable weakness i know it will be ever urged against me that it is barbarous the children of the poor should have no opportunity of exerting themselves as long as god has not debarrd them from natural parts and genius more than the rich but i cannot think this is harder than it is that they should not have money as long as they have the same inclinations to spend as others that great and useful men have sprung from hospitals i dont deny but it is likewise very probable that when they were first employd many as capable as themselves not brought up in hospitals were neglected that with the same good     fortune would have done as well as they if they had been made use of instead of thema there are many examples of women that have excelled in learning and even in war but this is no reason we should bring emb all up to latin and greek or else military discipline instead of needlework and housewifery but there is no scarcity of sprightliness or natural parts among us and no soil or climate has human creatures to boast of better formed    either inside or outside than this island generally produces but it is not wit genius or docility we want but diligence application and assiduity abundance of hard and dirty labour is to be done and coarse living is to be complied with where shall we find a better nursery for these necessities than the children of the poor none certainly are nearer to it or fitter for it besides that the things i calledc hardships neither seem nor are such to those whod have been brought up to eme and know no better there is not a more contented people among us than those who work the hardest and are the least acquainted with the pomp and delicacies of the world these are truths that are undeniable yet i know few people will be pleased to have them divulged what makes them odious is an unreasonable vein of petty reverence for the poor that runs through most multitudes and more particularly in this nation and arises from a mixture of pity folly and superstition it is from a lively sense of this compound that men cannot endure to hear or see any thing said or acted against the poor without considering how just the one or insolent the other so a beggar must not be beat tho he strikes you first journeymen tailors go to law with their masters and are obstinate in a wrong     cause  yet they must be pitied and murmuring weavers must be relieved and have fifty silly things    done to humour them tho in the midst of their poverty they insult their betters and on all occasions appear to be more prone to make holydays and riots than they are to working or sobriety this puts me in mind of our wool which considering the posture of our affairs and the behaviour of the poor i sincerely believe ought not upon any account to be carried abroad but if we look into the reason why suffering it to be fetched away is so pernicious our heavy complaint and lamentations that it is exported can be no great credit to us considering the mighty and manifold hazards that must be run before it can be got off the coast and safely landed beyond sea it is manifest that the foreigners before they can work our wool must pay more for it very considerably than what we can have it for at home yet notwithstanding this great difference in the prime cost they can afford to sell the manufactures made of it cheaper at foreign markets than ourselves  this is the disaster we grone under the     intolerable mischief without which the exportation of that commodity could be no greater prejudice to us than that of tin or lead as long as our hands were fully employed and we had still wool to spare there is no people yet come to higher perfection in the woollen manufacture either as to dispatch or goodness of work at least in the most considerable branches than ourselves    and therefore what we complain of can only depend on the difference in the management of the poor between other nations and ours if the labouring people in one country will work twelve hours in a day and six days in a week and in another they are employd but eight hours in a day and not above four days in a week the one is obliged to have nine hands for what the other does with four but if moreover the living the food and raiment and what is consumed by the workmen of the industrious costs but half the money of what is expended among an equal number of the other the consequence must be that the first will have the work of eighteen men for the same price as the other gives for the work of four i would not insinuate neither do i think that the difference either in diligence or necessaries of life between us and any neighbouring nation is near so great as what i speak of yet i would have it considered that half of that difference and much less is sufficient to overbalance the disadvantage they labour under as to the price of wool nothing to me is more evident than that no nation in any manufacturea whatever can undersell their neighbours with whom they are at best but equals     as to skill and dispatch and the conveniency for working more especially when the prime cost of the thing to be manufactured is not in their favour unless they have provisions and whatever is relating   0to their sustenance cheaper or else workmen that are either more assiduous and will remain longer at their work or be content with a meaner and coarser way of living than those of their neighbours this is certain that where numbers are equal the more laborious people are and the fewer hands the same quantity of work is performd by the greater plenty there is in a country of the necessaries for life the more considerable and the cheaper that country may render its exports it being granted then that abundance of work is to be done the next thing which i think to be likewise undeniable is that the more chearfully it is done the better as well for those that perform it as for the rest of the society to be happy is to be pleasd and the less notion a man has of a better way of living the more content hell be with his own and on the other hand the greater a mans knowledge and experience is in the world the more exquisite the delicacy of his taste and the more consummate judge he is of things in general certainly the more difficult it will be to please him i would not advance any thing that is barbarous or inhuman but when a man enjoys himself laughs and sings and in his gesture and behaviour shews me all the tokens of content and satisfaction i pronounce him happy and have nothing to do with his wit or capacity i never enter into the reasonableness of his mirth at    least i ought not to judge of it by my own standard and argue from the effect which the thing that makes him merry would have upon me at that rate a man that hates cheese must call me fool for loving blue mold  de gustibus non est disputandum  is as true     in a metaphorical as it is in the literal sense and the greater the distance is between people as to their condition their circumstances and manner of living the less capable they are of judging of one anothers troubles or pleasures  had the meanest and most uncivilizd peasant leave incognito to observe the greatest king for a fortnight tho he might pick out several things he would like for himself yet he would find a great many more which if the monarch and he were to change conditions he would wish for his part to have immediately alterd or redressd and which with amazement he sees the king submit to and again if the sovereign was to examine the peasant in the same manner his labour would be insufferable the dirt and squalor his diet and amours his pastimes and recreations would be all abominable but then what charms would he find in the others peace of mind the calmness     and tranquillity of his soul no necessity for dissimulation with any of his family or feignd affection to his mortal enemies no wife in a foreign interest no danger to apprehend from his children no plots to unravel no poison to fear no popular statesman at home or cunning    courts abroad to manage no seeming patriots to bribe no unsatiable favourite to gratify no selfish ministry to obey no divided nation to please or fickle mob to humour that would direct and interfere with his pleasures was impartial reason to be judge between real good and real evil and a catalogue made accordingly of the several delights and vexations differently to be met with in both stations i question whether the condition of kings would be at all preferable to that of peasants even as ignorant and laborious as i seem to require the latter to be  the reason why the generality of people would rather be kings than peasants is first owing to pride and ambition that is deepy riveted in human nature and which to gratify we daily see men undergo and despise the greatest hazards and difficulties secondly to the difference there is in the force with which our affection is wrought upon as the objects are either material or spiritual things that immediately strike our outward senses act more violently upon our passions than what is the result of thought and the dictates of the most demonstrative reason and there is a much stronger bias to gain our liking or aversion in the first than there is in the latter having thus demonstrated that what i urge could be no injury or the least diminution of happiness to the poor i leave it to the judicious reader whether     it is not more probable we should increase our exports by the methods    i hint at than by sitting still and damning and sinking our neighbours for beating us at our own weapons some of them outselling us in manufactures made of our own product which they dearly purchasd others growing rich in spite of distance and trouble by the same fish which we neglect tho it is ready to jump into our mouths as by discouraging idleness with art and steadiness you may compel the poor to labour without force so by bringing them up in ignorance you may inure them to real hardships without being ever sensible themselves that they are such by bringing them up in ignorance i mean no more as i have hinted long ago than that as to worldlya affairs their knowledge should be confind within the verge of their own occupations at least that we should not take pains to extend it beyond those limits when by these two engines we shall have made provisions and consequently labour cheap we must infallibly outsell our neighbours and at the same time increase our numbers this is the noble and manly way of encountring the rivals of our trade and by dint of merit outdoing them at foreign markets to allure the poor we make use of policy in some cases with success why should we be neglectful of it in the most important point when they make their boast that they will not live as the poor of other nations if we cannot alter their resolution why should we applaud the justness    of their sentiments against the common interest i have often wondred formerly how an englishman that pretended to have the honour and glory as well as the welfare of his country at heart could take delight in the evening to hear an idle tenant that owed him above a years rent ridicule the french for wearing wooden shoes when in the morning he had had the mortification of     hearing the great king william that ambitious monarch as well as able statesman openly own to the world and with grief and anger in his looks complain of the exorbitant power of france yet i dont recommend wooden shoes nor do the maxims i would introduce require arbitrary power in one person liberty and property i hope may remain secured and yet the poor be better employd than they are tho their children should wear out their clothes by useful labour and blacken them with country dirt for something instead of tearing them off their backs at play and dawbing thema with ink for nothing there is above three or four hundred years work for a hundred thousand poor more than we have in this island to make every part of it useful and the whole thoroughly inhabited many rivers are to be made navigable canals to be cut in hundreds of places some lands are to be draind and secured from inundations for the future abundance of barren soil is to be made fertile and thousands of acres rendred more beneficial by being made more accessible    dii laboribus omnia vendunt  there is no difficulty of this nature that labour and patience cannot surmount the highest mountains may be thrown into their valleys that stand ready to receive them and bridges might be laid where now we would not dare to think of it let us look back on the stupendious works of the romans more especially their highways and aqueducts let us consider in one view the vast extent of several of their roads how substantial they made them and what duration they have been of and in another a poor traveller that at every ten miles end is stopd by a turnpike     and dunnd for a penny for mending the roads in the summer with what every body knows will be dirt before the winter that succeeds it is expired the conveniency of the publick ought ever to be the publick care and no private interest of a town or a whole county should ever hinder the execution of a project or contrivance that would manifestly tend to the improvement of the whole and every member of the legislature who knows his duty and would choose rather to act like a wise man than curry favour with his neighbours will prefer the least benefit accruing to the whole kingdom to the most visible advantage of the place he serves for we have materials of our own and want neither stone nor timber to do any thing and was the money that people give uncompelld to    beggars who dont deserve it and what every housekeeper is obligd to pay to the poor of his parish that is otherwise employd or illapplied to be put together every year it would make a sufficient fund to keep a great many thousands at work i dont say this because i think it practicable but only to shew that we have money enough to spare to employ vast multitudes of labourers neither should we want so much for it as we perhaps might imagine when it is taken for granted that a soldier whose strength and vigour is to be kept up at least as much as any bodys can live upon sixpence a day i cant conceive the necessity of giving the greatest part of the year sixteen and eighteen pence to a daylabourer the fearful and cautious people that are ever jealous of their liberty i know will cry out that where the multitudes i speak of should be kept in constant pay property and privileges would be precarious but they might be answerd that sure means might be found out and such regulations made as to the hands in which to trust the management and direction of these labourers that it would be   0 impossible for the prince or any body else to make an ill use of their numbers what i have said in the four or five last paragraphs i foresee will with abundance of scorn be laughd at by many of my readers and at best be calld building castles in the air but whether that is my fault or theirs is a question    when the publick spirit has left a nation they not only lose their patience with it and all thoughts of perseverence but become likewise so narrowsould that it is a pain for them even to think ofa things that are of uncommon extent or require great length of time and whatever is noble or sublime in such conjunctures is counted chimerical where deep ignorance is entirely routed and expelld and low learning promiscuously scatterd on all the people selflove turns knowledge into cunning and the more this last qualification prevails in any country the more the people will fix all their cares concern and application on the time present without regard of what is to come after them or hardly ever thinking beyond the next generation but as cunning according to my lord verulam is but lefthanded wisdom  so a prudent legislature ought to provide against this disorder of the society as soon as the symptoms of it appear among which the following are the most obvious imaginary rewards are generally despised every body is for turning the penny and short bargains he that is diffident of every thing and believes nothing but what he sees with his own eyes is counted the most prudent and in all their dealings men seem to act from no other principle than that of the devil take the hindmost instead of planting oaks that will require a hundred and fifty years before they are fit to be     cut down    they build houses with a design that they shall not stand above twelve or fourteen years all heads run upon the uncertainty of things and the vicissitudes of human affairs the mathematicks become the only valuable study and are made use of in every thing even where it is ridiculous and men seem to repose no greater trust in providence than they would in a broken merchant it is the business of the publick to supply the defects of the society and take that in hand first which is most neglected by private persons contraries are best cured by contraries and therefore as example is of greater efficacy than precept in the amendment of national failings the legislature ought to resolve upon some great undertakings that must be the work of ages as well as vast labour and convince the world that they did nothing without an anxious regard to their latest posterity this will fix or at least help to settle the volatile genius and fickle spirit of the kingdom put us in mind that we are not born for our selves only and be a means of rendring men less distrustful and inspiring them with a true love for their country and a tender affection for the ground it self than which nothing is more necessary to aggrandize a nation forms of government may alter religions and even languages may change but great britain or at least if that likewise might lose its name the island it self will remain and in all human probability last as long    as any part of the globe all ages have ever paid their kind acknowledgments to their ancestors for the benefits derived from them and a christian who enjoys the multitude of fountains and vast plenty of water to be met with in the city of st peter is an ungrateful wretch if he never casts a thankful remembrance on old pagan rome that took such prodigious pains to procure it when this island shall be cultivated and every inch     of it made habitable and useful and the whole the most convenient and agreeable spot upon earth all the cost and labour laid out upon it will be gloriously repaid by the incense of them that shall come after us and those who burn with the noble zeal and desire after immortality and took such care to improve their country may rest satisfyd that a thousand and two thousand years hence they shall live in the memory and everlasting praises of the future ages that shall then enjoy it here i should have concluded this rhapsody of thoughts but something comes in my head concerning the main scope and design of this essay which is to prove the necessity there is for a certain portion of ignorance in a wellorderd society that i must not omit because by mentioning it i shall make an argument on my side of what if i had not spoke of it might easily have appeard as a strong objection against me it is the opinion of most people and mine among the rest that the most com  0mendable quality of the present czar of muscovy  is his unwearied application in raising his subjects from their native stupidity and civilizing his nation but then we must consider it is what they stood in need of and that not long ago the greatest part of them were next to brute beasts in proportion to the extent of his dominions and the multitudes he commands he had not that number or variety of tradesmen and artificers which the true improvement of the country required and therefore was in the right in leaving no stone unturnd to procure them but what is that to us who labour under a contrary disease sound politicks are to the social body what the art of medicine is to the natural and no physician would treat a man in a lethargy as if he was sick for want of rest or prescribe in a dropsy what should be administred in a diabetes in short russia has too few knowing men and great britain too many     a search into the nature of society    a search into the nature of societya the generality of moralists and philosophers have hitherto agreed that there could be no virtue without selfdenial but a late author who is now much read by men of sense is of a contrary opinion and imagines that men without any trouble or violence upon themselves may be naturally virtuous  he seems to require and expectb goodness in his species as we do a sweet taste in grapes and china oranges of which if any of them are sour we boldly pronounce that they are not come to that perfection their nature is capable of this noble writer for it is the lord shaftesbury i mean in his characteristicks fancies that as man is    made for society so he ought to be born with a kind affection to the whole of which he     is a part and a propensity to seek the welfare of it ina pursuance of this supposition he calls every action performd with regard to the publick good virtuous and all selfishness wholly excluding such a regard vice in respect to our species he looks upon virtue and vice as permanent realties that must ever be the same in all countries and all ages  and imagines that a man of sound understanding by following the rules of good sense may not only find out that pulchrum  honestum  both in morality and the works of art and nature but likewise govern himself by his reason with as much ease and readiness as a good rider manages a welltaught horse by the bridle the attentive reader who perused the foregoing part of this book will soon perceive that two systems cannot be more opposite than his lordships and mine his notions i confess are generous and refind they are a high compliment to humankind and capable by the help of a little enthusiasm of inspiring us with the most noble sentiments concerning the dignity of our exalted nature what pity it is that they are not true i would not advance thus much if i had not already demonstrated in almost every page of this treatise that the solidity of them is inconsistent with our daily experience but to leave not the least shadow of an objection that might     be made unanswerd    i design to expatiate on some things which hitherto i have but slightly touchd upon in order to convince the reader not only that the good and amiable qualities of mana are not those that make him beyond other animals a sociable creature but moreover that it would be utterly impossible either to raise any multitudes into a populous rich and flourishing nation or when so raisd to keep and maintain them in that condition without the assistance of what we call evil both natural and moral the better to perform what i have undertaken i shall previously examine into the reality of the pulchrum  honestum the τὸ κάλον  that the ancients have talkd of so much the meaning of this is to discuss whether there be a real worth and excellency in things a preeminence of one above another which every body will always agree to that well understands them or that there are few things if any that have the same esteem paid them and which the same judgment is passd upon in all countries and all ages when we first set out in quest of this intrinsick worth and find one thing better than another and a third better than that and so on we begin to entertain great hopes of success but when we meet with several things that are all very good or all very bad we are puzzled and agree not always with ourselves      much less with others there are different faults as well as beauties that as modes and fashions alter and men vary    in their tastes and humours will be differently admired or disapproved of judges of painting will never disagree in opinion when a fine picture is compared to the dawbing of a novice but how strangely have they differd as to the works of eminent masters there are parties among connoisseurs and few of them agree in their esteem as to ages and countries and the best pictures bear not always the best prices  a noted original will be ever worth more than any copy that can be made of it by an unknown hand tho it should be better the value that is set on paintings depends not only on the name of the master and the time of his age he drew them in but likewise in a great measure on the scarcity of his works anda what is still more unreasonable the quality of the persons in whose possession they are as well as the length of time they have been in great families and if the cartons now at hamptoncourt were done by a less famous hand than that of raphael and had a private person for their owner who would be forcd to sell them they would never yield the tenth part of the money which with all their gross faults they are now esteemed to be worth notwithstanding all this i will readily own that the judgment to be made of painting might become of universal certainty or at least less alterable and precarious than almost any thing else the reason is plain there is a standard    to go by that always remains the same painting is an imitation of nature a copying of things which men have every where before them my good humourd reader i hope will forgive me if thinking on this glorious invention i make a reflexion a little out of season tho very much conducive to my main design which is that valuable as the art is i speak of we are beholden to     an imperfection in the chief of our senses for all the pleasures and ravishing delight we receive from this happy deceit i shall explain my self air and space are no objects of sight but as soon as we can see with the least attention we observe that the bulk of the things we see is lessend by degrees as they are further remote from us and nothing but experience gaind from these observations can teach us to make any tolerable guesses at the distance of things if one born blind should remain so till twenty and then be suddenly blessd with sight he would be strangely puzzled as to the difference of distances and hardly able immediately by his eyes alone to determine which was nearest to him a post almost within the reach of his stick or a steeple that should be half a mile off let us look as narrowly as we can upon a hole in a wall that has nothing but the open air behind it and we shall not be able to see otherwise but that the sky fills up the vacuity and is as near us as the back part of the stones that circumscribe the space where they are wanting    this circumstance not to call it a defect in our sense of seeing makes us liable to be imposed upon and every thing buta motion may by art be represented to us on a flat in the same manner as we see them in life and nature if a man had never seen this art put into practice a lookingglass might soon convince him that such a thing was possible and i cant help thinking but that the reflexions from very smooth and wellpolishd bodies made upon our eyes must have given the first handle to the inventions of drawings and painting in the works of nature worth and excellency are as uncertain and even in humane creatures what is beautiful in one country is not so in another how whimsical is the florist in his choice sometimes the tulip sometimes the auricula and at other times the carnationb shall engross his esteem and every year a new flower in his judgment beats all the old ones     tho it is much inferior to them both in colour and shape  three hundred years ago men were shaved as closely as they are now since that they have wore beards and cut them in vasta variety of forms that were all as becoming when fashionable as now they would be ridiculous how mean and comically a man looks that is otherwise well dressd in a narrowbrimd hat when every body wears broad ones and again how monstrous is a very great hat when the other extreme has been in fashion for a considerable time experience has taught us    that these modes seldom last above ten or twelve years and a man of threescore must have observed five or six revolutions of emb at least yet the beginnings of these changes tho we have seen several seem always uncouth and are offensive afresh whenever they return  what mortal can decide which is the handsomest abstract from the mode in being to wear great buttons or small ones the many ways of laying out a garden judiciously are almost innumerable and what is called beautiful in them varies according to the different tastes of nations and ages in grass plats knots  and parterres  a great diversity of forms is generally agreeable but a round may be     as pleasing to the eye as a square an oval cannot be more suitable to one place than it is possible for a triangle to be to another and the preeminence an octogon has over an hexagon is no greater in figures than at hazard eight has above six among the chances churches ever since christians have been able to build them resemble the form of a cross with the upper end pointing toward the east and an architect where there is room and it can be conveniently done who should neglect it would be thought to have committed an unpardonable fault but it would be foolish to expect this of a turkish mosque or a pagan temple among the many beneficial laws that have been made these hundred years ita is not easy to name one of greater    utility and at the same time more exempt from all inconveniencies than that which has regulated the dresses of the dead  those who were old enough to take notice of things when that act was made and are yet alive must remember the general clamour that was made against it at first nothing could be more shocking to thousands of people than that they were to be buried in woollen and the only thing that made that law supportable was that there was room left for people of some fashion to indulge their weakness without extravagancy considering the other expences of funerals where mourning is given to several and rings to a great many the benefit that accrues to the nation from it is so visible that nothing ever could be said in reason to condemn it which in few years made the horror conceived against it lessen every day i observed then that young people who had seen but few in their coffins did the soonest strike in with the innovation but that those who when the act was made had buried many friends and relations remained   0 averse to it the longest and i remember many that never could be reconciled to it to their dying day by this time burying in linen being almost forgot it is the general opinion that nothing could be more decent than woollen and the present manner of dressing a corps which shews that our liking or disliking of things chiefly depends on mode and custom and the precept and example of our bet   ters and such whom one way or other we think to be superior to us in morals there is no greater certainty plurality of wives is odious among christians and all the wit and learning of a great genius in defence of it  has been rejected with contempt but polygamy is not shocking to a mahometan what men have learned from their infancy enslaves them and the force of custom warps nature and at the same time imitates her in such a manner that it is often difficult to know which of the two we are influenced by in the east formerly sisters married brothers and it was meritorious for a man to marry his mother such alliances are abominable but it is certain that whatever horror we conceive at the thoughts of them there is nothing in nature repugnant against them but     what is built upon mode and custom a religious mahometan that has never tasted any spirituous liquor and has often seen people drunk may receive as great an aversion against wine as another with us of the least morality and education may have against lying with his sister and both imagine that their antipathy proceeds from nature which is the best religion is a question that has caused more mischief than all other questions together ask it at peking at constantinople and at rome and youll receive three distinct answers extremely different from one another yet all of them equally positive and peremptory christians are   0well assured of the falsity of the pagan and mahometan superstitions as to this point there is a perfect union and concord among them but enquire of the several sects they are divided into which is the true church of christ and all of them will tell you it is theirs and to convince you go together by the ears  it is manifest then that the hunting after this pulchrum  honestum is not much better than a wildgoosechace that is but little to be depended upon but this is not the greatest fault i find with it the imaginary notions that men may be virtuous without selfdenial are a vast inlet to hypocrisy which being once made habitual we must not only deceive others but likewise become altogether unknown to our selves and in an instance i am going to give it will appear how for want of duly examining himself this might happen to a person of quality of parts and erudition one every way resembling the author of the characteristicks himself a man that has been brought up in ease and affluence if he is of a quiet indolent nature learns     to shun every thing that is troublesome and chooses to curb his passions more because of the inconveniencies that arise from the eager pursuit after pleasure and the yielding to all the demands of our inclinations than any dislike he has to sensual enjoyments and it is possible that a person educated under a great philosopher  who was a mild and goodnatured as well as able tutor may in such happy cir   cumstances have a better opinion of his inward state than it really deserves and believe himself virtuous because his passions lie dormant he may form fine notions of the social virtues and the contempt of death write well of them in his closet and talk eloquently of them in company but you shall never catch him fighting for his country or labouring to retrieve any national losses a man that deals in metaphysicks may easily throw himself into an enthusiasm and really believe that he does not fear death while it remains out of sight but should he be askd why having this intrepidity either from nature or acquired by philosophy he did not follow arms when his country was involved in war or when he saw the nation daily robbd by those at the helm and the affairs of the exchequer perplexd why he did not go to court and make use of all his friends and interest to be a lord treasurer that by his integrity and wise management he might restore the publick credit it is probable he would answer that he lovd retirement had no other ambition than to be a good man and never aspired to have any share in the government or that he hated all flattery and slavish attendance the insincerity of courts and bustle of the world i am willing to believe him but may not a man of an indolent temper and unactive spirit say and be sincere in all this and at the same time indulge his appetites without being able to subdue them tho his         duty summons him to it virtue consists in action and whoever is possest of this social love and kind affection to his species and by his birth or quality can claim any post in the publick management ought not to sit still when he can be serviceable but exert himself to the utmost for the good of his fellow subjects had this noble person been of a warlike genius or a boisterous temper he would have chose another part in the drama of life and preachd a quite contrary doctrine for we are ever pushing our reason which way soever we feel passion to draw it and selflove pleads to all human creatures for their different views still furnishing every individual with arguments to justify their inclinations that boasted middle way and the calm virtues recommended in the characteristicks are good for nothing but to breed drones and might qualify a man for the stupid enjoyments of a monastick life or at best a country justice of peace but they would never fit him for labour and assiduity or stir him up to great atchievements and perilous undertakings mans natural love of ease and idleness and proneness to indulge his sensual pleasures are not to be cured by precept his strong habits and inclinations can only be subdued by passions of greater violence  preach and demonstrate to a coward the unreasonableness of his fears and youll not make him valiant more than you can make him taller by bidding him to be    ten foot high whereas the     secret to raise courage as i have made it publick in remark r is almost infallible the fear of death is the strongest when we are in our greatest vigour and our appetite is keen when we are sharpsighted quick of hearing and every part performs its office the reason is plain because then life is most delicious and our selves most capable of enjoying it how comes it then that a man of honour should so easily accept of a challenge tho at thirty and in perfect health it is his pride that conquers his fear for when his pride is not concernd this fear will appear most glaringly if he is not used to the sea let him but be in a storm or if he never was ill before have but a sore throat or a slight fever and hell shew a thousand anxieties and in them the inestimable value he sets on life had man been naturally humble and proof against flattery the politician could never have had his ends or known what to have made of him without vices the excellency of the species would have ever remaind undiscoverd and every worthy that has made himself famous in the world is a strong evidence against this amiable system if the courage of the great macedonian came up to distraction when he fought alone against a whole garrison his madness was not less when he fancyd himself to be a god or at least doubted whether he was or not and as soon    as we make this reflexion we discover both the passion and the extravagancy of it that buoyd up his spirits in the most imminent dangers and carried him through all the difficulties and fatigues he underwenta there never was in the world a brighter example of an able and compleat magistrate than cicero when i think on his care and vigilance the real hazards he slighted and the pains he took for the safety of rome his wisdom and sagacity in detecting     and disappointing the stratagems of the boldest and most subtle conspirators and at the same time on his love to literature arts and sciences his capacity in metaphysicks the justness of his reasonings the force of his eloquence the politeness of his style and the genteel spirit that runs through his writings when i think i say on all these things together i am struck with amazement and the least i can say of him is that he was a prodigious man but when i have set the many good qualities he had in the best light it is as evident to me on the other side that had his vanity been inferior to his greatest excellency the good sense and knowledge of the world he was so eminently possessd of could never have let him be such a fulsome as well as noisy trumpetera as he was of his own praises or sufferd him rather than not proclaim his own merit to make a verse that a schoolboy would have been laughd at for o fortunatam c     how strict and severe was the morality of rigid cato how steady and unaffected the virtue of that grand asserter of roman liberty but tho the equivalent this stoick enjoyd for all the selfdenial and austerity he practised remained long concealed and his peculiar modesty hid from the world and perhaps himself a vast while the frailty of his heart that forced him into heroism yet it was brought to light in the last scene of his life and by his suicide it plainly appeared that he was governed by a tyrannical power superior to the love of his country and that the implacable hatred and superlative envy he bore to the glory the real greatness and personal merit of cæsar had for a long time swayd all his actions under the most noble pretences had not     this violent motive overruld his consummate prudence he might not only have saved himself but likewise most of his friends that were ruined by the loss of him and would in all probability if he could have stooped to it been the second man in rome but he knew the boundless mind and unlimited generosity of the victor it was his clemency he feared and therefore chose death because it was less terrible to his pride than the thought of giving his mortal foe so tempting an opportunity of shewing the magnanimity of his soul as cæsar would have found in forgiving such an inveterate enemy as cato and offering him his friendship and which it is thought by the judicious that    penetrating as well as ambitious conqueror would not have slipt if the other had dared to live another argument to prove the kind disposition and real affection we naturally have for our species is our love of company and the aversion men that are in their senses generally have to solitude beyond other creatures this bears a fine glossa in the characteristicks  and isb set off in very good language     to the best advantage the next day after i read it first i heard abundance of people cry fresh herrings which with the reflexion on the vast shoals of that and other fish that are caught together made me very merry tho i was alone but as i was entertaining my self with this contemplation came an impertinent idle fellow whom i had the misfortune to be known by and asked me liow i did tho i was and dare say looked as healthy and as well as ever i was or did in my life what i answered him i forgot but remember that i could not get rid of him in a good while and felt all the uneasiness my friend horace complains of from a persecution of the like nature  i would have no sagacious critick pronounce me a manhater from this short story whoever does is very much mistaken i am a great lover of company and if the reader is not quite tired with mine before i shew the weakness and ridicule of that piece of flattery    made to our species and which i was just now speaking of i will give him a description of the man i would choose for conversation with a promise that before he has finished what at first he might only take for a digression foreign to my purpose he shall find the use of it by early and artful instruction he should be thoroughly imbued with the notions of honour and shame and have contracted an habitual aversion to every thing that has the least tendency to impudence rudeness or inhumanity he should be well versd in the latin tongue and not ignorant of the greek and moreover understand one or two of the modern languages besides his own he should be acquainted     with the fashions and customs of the ancients but thoroughly skilled in the history of his own country and the manners of the age he lives in he should besides literature have studyd some useful science or other seen some foreign courts and universities and made the true use of travelling he should at times take delight in dancing fencing riding the great horse and knowinga something of hunting and other country sports without being attachd to any and he should treat them all as either exercises for health or diversions that should never interfere with business or the attaining to more valuable qualifications he should have a smatch of geometry and astronomy as well as anatomy and the oeconomy of human bodiesb    to understand musick so as to perform is an accomplisbment but there is abundance to be said against it and instead of it i would have him know so much of drawing as is required to take a landskip or explain ones meaning of any form or model we wouldc describe but never to touch a pencil he should be very early used to the company of modest women and never be a fortnight without conversing with the ladies gross vices as irreligion whoring gaming drinking and quarrelling i wont mention even the meanest education guards us against them i would always recommend to him the practice of virtue but i am for no voluntary ignorance in a gentleman of any thing that is done in court or city it is impossible a man should be perfect and therefore there are faults i would connive at if i could not prevent them and if between the years of nineteen and three and twenty youthful heat should sometimes get the better of his chastity so it was done with caution should he on some extraordinary occasion overcome by the pressing solicitations of jovial friends drink more than was consistent with strict sobriety so he     did it very seldom and found it not to interfere with his health or temper or if by the height of his mettle and great provocation in a just cause he had been drawn into a quarrel which true wisdom and a less strict adherence to the rules of honour might have declined or prevented so    it never befel him above once if i say he should have happened to be guilty of these things and he would never speak much less brag of them himself they might be pardoned or at least overlooked at the age i named if he left off then and continued discreet for ever after the very disasters of youth have sometimes frightend gentlemen into a more steady prudence than in all probability they would ever have been masters of without them to keep him from turpitude and things that are openly scandalous there is nothing better than to procure him free access in one or two noble families where his frequent attendance is counted a duty and while by that means you preserve his pride he is kept in a continual dread of shame a man of a tolerable fortune pretty near accomplishd as i have required him to be that still improves himself and sees the world till he is thirty cannot be disagreeable to converse with at least while he continues in health and prosperity and has nothing to spoil his temper when such a one either by chance or appointment meets with three or four of his equals and all agree to pass away a few hours together the whole is what i call good company there is nothing said in it that is not either instructive or diverting to a man of sense it is possible they may not always be of the same opinion but there can be no contest between any but who shall yield first to the other he differs from   0one only speaks at a time and no louder than to be plainly understood by him who sits the farthest off the greatest pleasure aimed at by every one of them is to have the satisfaction of   0 pleasing others which they all practically know may as effectually be done by hearkning with attention and an approving countenance as if we said very good things our selves most people of any taste would like such a conversation and justly prefer it to being alone when they knew not how to spend their time but if they could employ themselves in something from which they expected either a more solid or a more lasting satisfaction they would deny themselves this pleasure and follow what was of greater consequence to ema but would not a man though he had seen no mortal in a fortnight remain alone as much longer rather than get into company of noisy fellows that take delight in contradiction and place a glory in picking a quarrel would not one that has books read for ever or set himself to write upon some subject or other rather than be every night with partymen who count the island to be good for nothing while their adversaries are suffered to live upon it would not a man be by himself a month and go to bed before seven oclockb rather than mix with foxhunters who having all day long tried in vain to break their necks join at night in a second attempt upon their lives by drinking and to express their mirth are louder in sense   less sounds within doors than their barking and less troublesome companions are only without i have no great value for a man who would not rather tire himself with walking or if he was shut up scatter pins about the room in order to pick them up again than keep company for six hours with half a score common sailors the day their ship was paid off i will grant nevertheless that the greatest part of mankind rather than be alone any considerable time would submit to the things i named but i cannot see why this love of company this strong desire     after society should be construed so much in our favour and alledged as a mark of some intrinsick worth in man not to be found in other animals for to prove from it the goodness of our nature and a generous love in man extended beyond himself on the rest of his species by virtue of which he was a sociable creature this eagerness after company and aversion of being alone ought to have been most conspicuous and most violent in the best of their kind the men of the greatest genius parts and accomplishments and those who are the least subject to vice the contrary of which is true the weakest minds who can the least govern their passions guilty consciences that abhor reflexion and the worthless who are incapable of producing any thing of their own thats useful are the greatest enemies to solitude and will take up with any    company rather than be without whereas the men of sense and of knowledge that can think and contemplate on things and such as are but little disturbd by their passions can bear to be by themselves the longest without reluctancy and to avoid noise folly and impertinence will run away from twenty companies and rather than meet with any thing disagreeable to their good taste will prefer their closet or a garden nay a common or a desart to the society of some men but let us suppose the love of company so inseparable from our species that no man could endure to be alone one moment what conclusions could be drawn from this does not man love company as he does every thing else for his own sake no friendships or civilities are lasting that are not reciprocal in all your weekly and daily meetings for diversion as well as annual feasts and the most solemn carousals every member that assists at them has his own ends and some frequent a club which they would never go to unless they were the top of it i have known a man     who was the oracle of the company be very constant and as uneasy at any thing that hindred him from coming at the hour leave his society altogether as soon as another was added that could match and disputed superiority with him there are people who are incapable of holding an argument and yet malicious enough to take delight in hearing others wrangle and tho    they never concern themselves in the controversy would think a company insipid where they could not have that diversion a good house rich furniture a fine garden horses dogs ancestors relations beauty strength excellency in any thing whatever vices as well as virtuesa may all be accessary to make men long for society in hopes that what they value themselves upon will at one time or other become the theme of the discourse and give an inward satisfaction to them even the most polite people in the world and such as i spoke of at first give no pleasure to others that is not repaid to their selflove and does not at last center in themselves let them wind it and turn it as they will but the plainest demonstration that in all clubs and societies of conversable people every body has the greatest consideration for himself is that the disinterested who rather overpays than wrangles the goodhumourd that is never waspish nor soon offended the easy and indolent that hates disputes and never talks for triumph is every where the darling of the company whereas the man of sense and knowledge that will not be imposed upon or talkd out of his reason the man of genius and spirit that can say sharp and witty things tho he never lashes but what deserves it the man of honour who neither gives nor takes an affront may be esteemd but is seldom so well beloved as a weaker man less accomplishd    as in these instances the friendly qualities arise     from our contriving perpetually our own satisfaction so on other occasions they proceed from the natural timidity of man and the sollicitous care he takes of himself two londoners whose business oblige them not to have any commerce together may know see and pass by one another every day upon the exchange with not much greater civility than bulls would let them meet at bristol theyll pull off their hats and on the least opportunity enter into conversation and be glad of one anothers company when french english and dutch meet in china or any other pagan country being all europeans they look upon one another as countrymen and if no passion interferes will feel a natural propensity to love one another nay two men that are at enmity if they are forcd to travel together will often lay by their animosities be affable and converse in a friendly manner especially if the road be unsafe and they are both strangers in the place they are to go to these things by superficial judges are attributed to mans sociableness his natural propensity to friendship and love of company but whoever will duly examine things and look into man more narrowly will find that on all these occasions we only endeavour to strengthen our interest and are moved by the causes already alledgd what i have endeavourd hitherto has been to prove that the pulchrum  honestum excel   lency and real worth of things are most commonly precarious and alterable as modes and customs vary that consequently the inferences drawn from their certainty are insignificant and that the generous notions concerning the natural goodness of man are hurtful as they tend to mislead and are meerly chimerical the truth of this latter i have illustrated by the most obvious examples in history i have spoke of our love of company and aversion to solitude examind thoroughly the various motives of them     and made it appear that they all center in selflove i intend now to investigate into the nature of society and diving into the very rise of it make it evident that not the good and amiable but the bad and hateful qualities of man his imperfections and the want of excellencies which other creatures are endued with are the first causes that made man sociable beyond other animals the moment after he lost paradise and that if he had remaind in his primitive innocence and continued to enjoy the blessings that attended it there is no shadow of probability that he ever would have become that sociable creature he is now how necessary our appetites and passions are for the welfare of all trades and handicrafts has been sufficiently provd throughout the book and that they are our bad qualities or at least produce them no body denies it remains then that i should set forth the variety of obstacles that hinder and perplex man in the labour    he is constantly employd in the procuring of what he wants and which in other words is calld the business of selfpreservation while at the same time i demonstrate that the sociableness of man arises only from these two things viz the multiplicity of his desires and the continual opposition he meets with in his endeavours to gratify them the obstacles i speak of relate either to our own frame or the globe we inhabit i mean the condition of it since it has been cursd i have often endeavourd to contemplate separately on the two things i named last but coud never keep them asunder they always interfere and mix with one another and at last make up together a frightful chaos of evil all the elements are our enemies water drowns and fire consumes those who unskilfully approach them the earth in a thousand places produces plants and other vegetables that are hurtful to man while she feeds and cherishes a variety of creatures that are noxious     to him and suffers a legion of poisons to dwell within her but the most unkind of all the elements is that which we cannot live one moment without it is impossible to repeat all the injuries we receive from the wind and weather and tho the greatest part of mankind have ever been employed in defending their species from the inclemency of the air yet no art or labour have hitherto been able to find a security against the wild rage of some meteors    hurricanes it is true happen but seldom and few men are swallowd up by earthquakes or devourd by lyons but while we escape those gigantick mischiefs we are persecuted by trifles what a vast variety of insects are tormenting to us what multitudes of them insult and make game of us with impunity the most despicable scruple not to trample and graze upon us as cattle do upon a field which yet is often bore with if moderately they use their fortune but here again our clemency becomes a vice and so encroaching are their cruelty and contempt of us on our pity that they make laystalls of our headsa and devour our young ones if we are not daily vigilant in pursuing and destroying them there is nothing good in all the universe to the bestdesigning man if either through mistake or ignorance he commits the least failing in the use of it there is no innocence or integrity that can protect a man from a thousand mischiefs that surround him on the contrary every thing is evil which art and experience have not taught us to turn into a blessing therefore how diligent in harvest time is the husbandman in getting in his crop and sheltering it from rain without which he could never have enjoyd it as seasons differ with the climates experience has taught us differently to make use of them and in one part of the globe we may see the     farmer sow while he is reaping in the other from all which we may learn how vastly    this earth must have been alterd since the fall of our first parents for should we trace man from his beautiful his divine original not proud of wisdom acquired by haughty precept or tedious experience but endued with consummate knowledge the moment he was formd i mean the state of innocence in which no animal nora vegetable upon earth nor mineral under ground was noxious to him and himself secure from the injuries of the air as well as all other harms was contented with the necessaries of life which the globe he inhabited furnishd him with without his assistance when yet not conscious of guilt he found himself in every place to be the well obeyed unrivald lord of all and unaffected with his greatness was wholly rapt up in sublime meditations on the infinity of his creator who daily did vouchsafe intelligibly to speak to him and visit without mischief in such a golden age no reason or probability can be alledged why mankind ever should have raisd themselves into such large societies as there have been in the world as long as we can give any tolerable account of it where a man has every thing he desires and nothing to vex or disturb him there is nothing can be added to his happiness and it is impossible to name a trade art science dignity or employment that would not be superfluous in such a blessed state if we pursue this thought we shall easily perceive that no societies could have    sprung from the amiable virtues and loving qualities of man but on the contrary that all of them must have had their origin from his wants his imperfections and the variety of his appetites we shall find likewise that the more their pride and vanity are displayd and all their desires enlargd the more capable they     must be of being raisd into large and vastly numerous societies was the air always as inoffensive to our naked bodies and as pleasant as to our thinking it is to the generality of birds in fair weather and man had not been affected with pride luxury and hypocrisy as well as lust i cannot see what could have put us upon the invention of clothes and houses i shall say nothing of jewels of plate painting sculpture fine furniture and all that rigid moralists have calld unnecessary and superfluous but if we were not soon tired with walking afoot and were as nimble as some other animals if men were naturally laborious and none unreasonable in seeking and indulging their ease and likewise free from other vices and the ground was every where even solida and clean who would have thought of coaches or ventured on a horses back what occasion has the dolphin for a ship or what carriage would an eagle ask to travel in i hope the reader knows that by society i understand a body politick in which manb either subdued by superior force or by persuasion drawn from his savage state is become  00a disciplind creature that can find his own ends in labouring for others and where under one head or other form of government each member is renderd subservient to the whole and all of them by cunning management are made to act as one for if by society we only mean a number of people that without rule or government should keep together out of a natural affection to their species or love of company as a herd of cows or a flock of sheep then there is not in the world a more unfit creature for society than man an hundred of them that should be all equals under no subjection or fear of any superior upon earth could never live together awake two hours without     quarrelling and the more knowledge strength wit courage and resolution there was among them the worse it would be it is probable that in the wild state of nature parents would keep a superiority over their children at least while they were in strength and that even afterwards the remembrance of what the others had experiencd might produce in them something between love and fear which we call reverence it is probable likewise that the second generation following the example of the first a man with a little cunning would always be able as long as he lived and had his senses to maintain a superior sway over all his own offspring and descendants how numerous soever they might grow but  0 the old stock once dead the sons would quarrel and there could be no peace long before there had been war eldership in brothers is of no great force and the preeminence that is given to it only invented as a shift to live in peace man as he is a fearful animal naturally not rapacious loves peace and quiet and he would never fight if no body offended him and he could have what he fights for without it to this fearful disposition and the aversion he has to his being disturbd are owing all the various projects and forms of government monarchy without doubt was the first aristocracy and democracy were two different methods of mending the inconveniencies of the first and a mixture of these three an improvement on all thea rest but be we savages or politicians it is impossible that man mere fallen man should act with any other view but to please himself while he has the use of his organs and the greatest extravagancy either of love or despair can have no other centre there is no difference between will and pleasure in one sense and every motion made in spite of them must be     unnatural and convulsive since then action is so confind and we are always forcd to do what we please and at the same time our thoughts are free and uncontrould it is impossible we could be sociable creatures without hypocrisy the proof of this is plain since we cannot prevent the ideas that are continu 0 ally arising within us all civil commerce would be lost if by art and prudent dissimulation we had not learnd to hide and stifle them and if all we think wasa to be laid open to others in the same manner as it is to our selves it is impossible that endued with speech we could be sufferable to one another i am persuaded that every reader feels the truth of what i say and i tell my antagonist that his conscience flies in his face while his tongue is preparing to refute me in all civil societies men are taught insensibly to be hypocrites from their cradle no body dares to own that he gets by publick calamities or even by the loss of private persons the sexton would be stoned should he wish openly for the death of the parishioners tho every body knew that he had nothing else to live upon to me it is a great pleasure when i look on the affairs of human life to behold into what various and often strangely opposite forms the hope of gain and thoughts of lucre shape men according to the different employments they are of and stations they are in how gay and merry does every face appear at a wellordered ball and what a solemn sadness is observd at the masquerade of a funeral but the undertaker is as much pleasd with his gains as the dancingmaster both are equally tired in their occupations and the mirth of the one is as much forced as the gravity of the other is affected those who have never minded the conver 0 sation of a spruce mercer and a young lady his customer that comes to his shop have neglected a scene of life   0 that is very entertaining i beg of my serious reader that he would for a while abate a little of his gravity and suffer me to examine these people separately as to their inside and the different motives they act from his business is to sell as much silk as he can at a price by which he shall get what he proposes to be reasonable according to the customary profits of the trade as to the lady what she would be at is to please her fancy and buy cheaper by a groat or sixpence per yard than the things she wants are commonly sold at from the impression the gallantry of our sex has made upon her she imagines if she be not very deformd that she has a fine mien and easy behaviour and a peculiar sweetness of voice that she is handsome and if not beautiful at least more agreeable than most young women she knows as she has no pretensions to purchase the same things with less money than other people but what are built on her good qualities so she sets her self off to the best advantage her wit and discretion will let her the thoughts of love are here out of the case so on the one hand she has no room for playing the tyrant and giving herself angry and peevish airs and on the other more liberty of speaking kindly and being affable than she can have almost on any other occasion she knows that abundance of wellbred people come to  0 his shop and endeavours to render her self as amiable as virtue and the rules of decency allow of coming with such a resolution of behaviour she cannota meet with any thing to ruffle her temper before her coach is yet quite stoppd she is approachd by a gentlemanlike man that has every thing clean and fashionable about him who in low obeisance pays her homage and as soon as her pleasure is known that she has a mind to come in hands her into the shop where immediately he slips from her and through a byway that remains visible only for     half a moment with great address entrenches himself behind the counter here facing her with a profound reverence and modish phrase he begs the favour of knowing her commands let her say and dislike what she pleases she can never be directly contradicted she deals with a man in whom consummate patience is one of the mysteries of his trade and whatever trouble she creates she is sure to hear nothing but the most obliging language and has always before her a chearful countenance where joy and respect seem to be blended with goodhumour and altogether make up an artificial serenity more engaging than untaught nature is able to produce when two persons are so well met the conversation must be very agreeable as well as extremely mannerly tho they talk about trifles while she remains irresolute what to take he  0 seems to be the same in advising her and is very cautious how to direct her choice but when once she has made it and is fixd he immediately becomes positive that it is the best of the sort extols her fancy and the more he looks upon it the more he wonders he should not before have discovered the preeminence of it over any thing he has in his shop by precept example and great application he has learnd unobservd to slide into the inmost recesses of the soul sound the capacity of his customers and find out their blind side unknown to them by all which he is instructed in fifty other stratagems to make her overvalue her own judgment as well as the commodity she would purchase the greatest advantage he has over her lies in the most material part of the commerce between them the debate about the price which he knows to a farthing and she is wholly ignorant of therefore he no where more egregiously imposes on her understanding and tho here he has the liberty of telling what lies he pleases as to the prime cost and the money he has refusd yet he trusts not to     them only but attacking her vanity makes her believe the most incredible things in the world concerning his own weakness and her superior abilities he had taken a resolution he says never to part with that piece under such a price but she has the power of talking him out of his goods beyond any body he ever sold to he protests that he loses by his  0 silk but seeing that she has a fancy for it and is resolvd to give no more rather than disoblige a lady he has such an uncommon value for hell let her have it and only begs that another time she will not stand so hard with him in the mean time the buyer who knows that she is no fool and has a voluble tongue is easily persuaded that she has a very winning way of talking and thinking it sufficient for the sake of goodbreeding to disown her merit and in some witty repartee retort the compliment he makes her swallow very contentedly the substance of every thing he tells her the upshot is that with the satisfaction of having saved ninepence per yard she has bought her silk exactly at the same price as any body else might have done and often gives sixpence more than rather than not have sold it he would have taken it is possible that this lady for want of being sufficiently flatterd for a fault she is pleased to find in his behaviour or perhaps the tying of his neckcloth or some other dislike as substantial may be lost and her custom bestowd on some other of the fraternity but where many of them live in a cluster it is not always easily determind which shop to go to and the reasons some of the fair sex have for their choice are often very whimsical and kept as a great secret we never follow our inclinations with more freedom than where they cannot be traced and it is unreasonable for others to suspect them  0 a virtuous woman has preferrd one house to all the rest because she had seen a handsome fellow in it and     another of no bad character for having receivd greater civility before it than had been paid her any where else when she had no thoughts of buying and was going to pauls church for among the fashionable mercers the fair dealer must keep before his own door and to draw in random customers make use of no other freedom or importunities than an obsequious air with a submissive posture and perhaps a bow to every welldressd female that offers to look towards his shop what i have said last makes me think on another way of inviting customers the most distant in the world from what i have been speaking of i mean that which is practisd by the watermen especially on those whom by their mien and garb they know to be peasants it is not unpleasant to see half a dozen people surround a man they never saw in their lives before and two of them that can get the nearest clapping each an arm over his neck hug him in as loving and familiar a manner as if he was their brother newly come home from an eastindia voyage a third lays hold of his hand another of his sleeve his coat the buttons of it or any thing he can come at while a fifth or a sixth who has scampered twice round him already without being able to get at him plants himself directly before the man in hold and within three inches of his nose contra 0 dicting his rivals with an openmouthed cry shews him a dreadful set of large teeth and a small remainder of chewd bread and cheese which the countrymans arrival had hindred from being swallowd at all this no offence is taken and the peasant justly thinks they are making much of him therefore far from opposing them he patiently suffers himself to be pushd or pulld which way the strength that surrounds him shall direct he has not the delicacy to find fault with a mans breath who has just blown out his pipe or a greasy head of hair that is rubbing against his chops dirt and sweat he has been used     to from his cradle and it is no disturbance to him to hear half a score people some of them at his ear and the furthest not five foot from him bawl out as if he was a hundred yards off he is conscious that he makes no less noise when he is merry himself and is secretly pleasd with their boisterous usages the hawling and pulling him about he construesa the way it is intended it is a courtship he can feel and understand he cant help wishing them well for the esteem they seem to have for him he loves to be taken notice of and admires the londoners for being so pressing in the offers of their service to him for the value of threepence or less whereas in the country at the shop he uses he can have nothing but he must first tell them what he wants and tho he lays out three or four shillings  0 at a time has hardly a word spoke to him unless it be in answer to a question himself is forcd to ask first this alacrity in his behalf moves his gratitude and unwilling to disoblige any from his heart he knows not whom to choose i have seen a man think all this or something like it as plainly as i could see the nose in his face and at the same time move along very contentedly under a load of watermen and with a smiling countenance carry seven or eight stone more than his own weight to the waterside if the little mirth i have shewn in the drawing of these two images from low life misbecomes me i am sorry for it but i promise not to be guilty of that fault any more and will now without loss of time proceed with my argument in artless dull simplicity and demonstrate the gross error of those who imagine that the social virtues and the amiable qualities that are praiseworthy in us are equally beneficial to the publick as they are to the individual persons that are possessd of them and that the means of thriving and whatever conduces to the welfare     and real happiness of private families must have the same effect upon the whole society this i confess i have labourd for all along  and i flatter myself not unsuccessfully but i hope no body will like a problem the worse for seeing the truth of it provd more ways than one   0it is certain that the fewer desires a man has and the less he covets the more easy he is to himself the more active he is to supply his own wants and the less he requires to be waited upon the more he will be beloved and the less trouble he is in a family the more he loves peace and concord the more charity he has for his neighbour and the more he shines in real virtue there is no doubt but that in proportion he is acceptable to god and man but let us be just what benefit can these things be of or what earthly good can they do to promote the wealth the glory and worldly greatness of nations it is the sensual courtier that sets no limits to his luxury the fickle strumpet that invents new fashions every week the haughty dutchess that in equipage entertainments and all her behaviour would imitate a princess the profuse rake and lavish heir that scatter about their money without wit or judgment buya every thing they see and either destroy or give it away the next day the covetous and perjurd villain that squeezd an immense treasure from the tears of widows and orphans and left the prodigals the money to spend it is these that are the prey and proper food of a full grown leviathan  or in other words such is the calamitous condition of human affairs that we stand in need of the plagues and monsters i named to have all the variety of labour performd which the skill of men is capable of inventing    in order to procure an honest livelihood to the vast multitudes of working poor that are     required to make a large society and it is folly to imagine that great and wealthy nations can subsist and be at once powerful and polite without i protest against popery as much as ever luther anda calvin did or queen elizabeth herself but i believe from my heart that the reformation has scarce been more instrumental in rendring the kingdoms and states that have embraced it flourishing beyond other nations than the silly and capricious invention of hoopd and quilted petticoats but if this should be denied me by the enemies of priestly power at least i am sure that bar the greatb men who have fought for and against that laymans blessing it has from its first beginning to this day not employd so many hands honest industrious labouring hands as the abominable improvement on female luxury i named has done in few years religion is one thing and trade is another he that gives most trouble to thousands of his neighbours and invents the most operose manufactures is right or wrong the greatest friend to the society what a bustle is there to be made in several parts of the world before a fine scarlet or crimson cloth can be produced what multiplicity of trades and artificers must be employd not only such as are obvious as woolcombers spinners the weaver the cloth   worker the scourer the dyer the setter the drawer and the packer but others that are more remote and might seem foreign to it as the millwright the pewterer and the chymist which yet are all necessary as well as a great number of other handicrafts to have the tools utensils and other implements belonging to the trades already named but all these things are done at home and may be performd without extraordinary fatigue or danger the most frightful prospect is left behind when we reflect on the toil and hazard that are to be undergone     abroad the vast seas we are to go over the different climates we are to endure and the several nations we must be obliged to for their assistance spain alone it is true might furnish us with wool to make the finest cloth but what skill and pains what experience and ingenuity are required to dye it of those beautiful colours how widely are the drugs and other ingredients dispersd thro the universe that are to meet in one kettle allum indeed we have of our own argol we might have from the rhine and vitriol from hungary all this is in europe but then for saltpetre in quantity we are forcd to go as far as the eastindies cochenille unknown to the ancients is not much nearer to us tho in a quite different part of the earth we buy it tis true from the spaniards but not being their product they are forcd to fetch it for us from the remotest corner of the new world in the westindiesa while    so many sailors are broiling in the sun and sweltered with heat in the east and west of us another set of them are freezing in the north to fetch potashes from russia  when we are thoroughly acquainted with all the variety of toil and labour the hardships and calamities that must be undergone to compass the end i speak of and we consider the vast risques and perils that are run in those voyages and that few of them are ever made but at the expence not only of the health and welfare but even the lives of many when we are acquainted with i say and duly consider the things i named it is scarce possible to conceive a tyrant so inhuman and void of shame that beholding things in the same view he should exact such terrible services from his innocent slaves and at the same time dare to own that he did it for no other     reason than the satisfaction a man receives from having a garment made of scarlet or crimson cloth but to what height of luxury must a nation be arrived where not only the kings officers but likewise his guards even the private soldiers should have such impudent desires but if we turn the prospect and look on all those labours as so many voluntary actions belonging to different callings and occupations that men are brought up to for a livelihood and in which every one works for himself how much soever he may seem to labour for others if we consider that even the sailors    who undergo the greatest hardships as soon as one voyage is ended even after shipwracka are looking out and solliciting for employment in another if we consider i say and look on these things in another view we shall find that the labour of the poor is so far from being a burthen and an imposition upon them that to have employment is a blessing which in their addresses to heaven they pray for and to procure it for the generality of them is the greatest care of every legislature as children and even infants are the apes of others so all youth have an ardent desire of being men and women and become often ridiculous by their impatient endeavours to appear what every body sees they are not all large societies are not a little indebted to this folly for the perpetuity or at least long continuance of trades once established what pains will young people take and what violence will they not commit upon themselves to attain to insignificant and often blameable qualifications which for want of judgment and experience they admire in others that are superior to them in age this fondness of imitation makes them accustom themselves by degrees to the use of things that were irksome if not intolerable to them at first till they know not how to leave     them and are often very sorry for having inconsiderately increasd the necessaries of life without any necessity what estates have been got by tea and coffee    what a vast traffick is drove what a variety of labour is performed in the world to the maintenance of thousands of families that altogether depend on two silly if not odious customs the taking of snuff and smoking of tobacco both which it is certain do infinitely more hurt than good to those that are addicted to them i shall go further and demonstrate the usefulness of private losses and misfortunes to the publick and the folly of our wishes when we pretend to be most wise and serious the fire of london was a great calamity but if the carpenters bricklayers smiths and all not only that are employed in building but likewise those that made and dealt in the same manufactures and other merchandizes that were burnt and other trades again that got by them when they were in full employ were to vote against those who lost by the fire the rejoicings would equal if not exceed the complaints  in recruiting what is lost and destroyd by fire storms seafights sieges battles a considerable part of trade consists the truth of which and whatever i have said of the nature of society will plainly appear from what follows it would be a difficult task to enumerate all the advantages and different benefits that accrue to a nation on account of shipping and navigation but if we only take into consideration the ships themselves and every vessel great and small that is made use of for watercarriage from the least wherry to a first    rate man of war the timber and hands that are employed in the building of them and   0 consider the pitch tar rosin grease the masts yards sails and riggings the variety of smiths work the cables oars and every thing else belonging to them we shall find that to furnish only such a nation as ours with all these necessaries makes a up a considerable part of the traffick of europe without speaking of the stores and ammunition of all sorts that are consumed in them or the mariners watermen and others with their families that are maintained by them but should we on the other hand take a view of the manifold mischiefs and variety of evils moral as well as natural that befal nations on the score of seafaring and their commerce with strangers the prospect would be very frightful and could we suppose a large populous island that should be wholly unacquainted with ships and sea affairs but otherwise a wise and wellgovernd people and that some angel or their genius should lay before them a scheme or draught where they might see on the one side all the riches and real advantages that would be acquired by navigation in a thousand years and on the other the wealth and lives that would be lost and all the other calamities that would be unavoidably sustained on account of it during the same time i am confident they would look upon ships with horrour and detestation and    that their prudent rulers would severely forbid the making and inventing all buildings or machines to go to sea with of what shape or denomination soever and prohibit all such abominable contrivances on great penalties if not the pain of death but to let alone the necessary consequence of foreign trade the corruption of manners as well as plagues poxes and other diseases that are brought to us by shipping should we only cast our eyes on what is either to be imputed to the wind and weather the treachery of the seas the ice of the north the     vermin of the south the darkness of nights and unwholsomeness of climates or else occasioned by the want of good provisions and the faults of mariners the unskilfulness of some and the neglect and drunkenness of others and should we consider the losses of men and treasure swallowd up in the deep the tears and necessities of widows and orphans made by the sea the ruin of merchants and the consequences the continual anxieties that parents and wives are in for the safety of their children and husbands and not forget the many pangs and heartakes that are felt throughout a trading nation by owners and insurers at every blast of wind should we cast our eyes i say on these things consider with due attention and give them the weight they deserve would it not be amazing how a nation of thinking people should talk of their ships and navigation    as a peculiar blessing to them and placing an uncommon felicity in having an infinity of vessels dispersd through the wide world and always some going to and others coming from every part of the universe but let us once in our consideration on these things confine our selves to what the ships suffer only the vessels themselves with their rigging and appurtenances without thinking on the freight they carry or the hands that work them and we shall find that the damage sustaind that way only is very considerable and must one year with another amount to vast sums the ships that are founderd at sea split against rocks and swallowd up by sands some by the fierceness of tempests altogether others by that and the want of pilots experiencea and knowledge of the coasts the masts that are blown down or forcd to be cut and thrown overboard the yards sails and cordage of different sizes that are destroyd by storms and the anchors that are lost add to these the necessary repairs of leaks sprung and other     hurts receivd from the rage of winds and the violence of the waves many ships are set on fire by carelesness and the effects of strong liquors which none are more addicted to than sailors sometimes unhealthy climates at others the badness of provision breed fatal distempers that sweep away the greatest part of the crew and not a few ships are lost for want of hands    these are all calamities inseparable from navigation and seem to be great impediments that clog the wheels of foreign commerce how happy would a merchant think himself if his ships should always have fine weather and the wind he wishd for and every mariner he employd from the highest to the lowest be a knowing experiencd sailor and a careful sober good man was such a felicity to be had for prayers what owner of ships is there or dealer in europe nay the whole world who would not be all day long teazing heaven to obtain such a blessing for himself without regard what detriment it would do to others such a petition would certainly be a very unconscionable one yet where is the man who imagines not that he has a right to make it and therefore as every one pretends to an equal claim to those favours let us without reflecting on the impossibility of its being true suppose all their prayers effectual and their wishes answerd and afterwards examine into the result of such a happiness ships would last as long as timberhouses to the full because they are as strongly built and the latter are liable to suffer by high winds and other storms which the first by our supposition are not to be so that before there would be any real occasion for new ships the master builders now in being and every body under them that is set to work about them would all die a natural death if they   0were not starvd or come to some untimely end for in the first place all ships having prosperous gales and     never waiting for the wind they would make very quick voyages both out and home secondly no merchandizes would be damagd by the sea or by stress of weather thrown overboard but the entire lading would always come safe ashore and hence it would follow that three parts in four of the merchantmen already made would be superfluous for the present and the stock of ships that are now in the world serve a vast many years masts and yards would last as long as the vessels themselves and we should not need to trouble norway on that score a great while yet the sails and rigging indeed of the few ships made use of would wear out but not a quarter part so fast as now they do for they often suffer more in one hours storm than in ten days fair weather anchors and cables there would be seldom any occasion for and one of each would last a ship time out of mind this article alone would yield many a tedious holiday to the anchorsmiths and the ropeyards this general want of consumption would have such an influence on the timbermerchants and all that import iron sailcloth hemp pitch tar c that four parts in five of what in the beginning of this reflexion on seaaffairs i said made a considerable branch of the traffick of europe would be entirely lost    i have only touchd hitherto on the consequences of this blessing in relation to shipping but it would be detrimental to all other branches of trade besides and destructive to the poor of every country that exports any thing of their own growth or manufacture the goods and merchandizes that every year go to the deep that are spoild at sea by salt water by heat by vermine destroyd by fire or lost to the merchant by other accidents all owing to storms or tedious voyages or else the neglect or rapacity of sailors such goods i say and merchandizes are a considerable part of what every year     is sent abroad throughout the world and must have employd great multitudes of poor before they could come on board a hundred bales of cloth that are burnt or sunk in the mediterranean are as beneficial to the poor in england as if they had safely arrivd at smyrna or aleppo and every yard of them had been retaild in the grand signiors dominions the merchant may break and by him the clothier the dyer the packer and other tradesmen the middling people may suffer but the poor that were set to work about them can never lose daylabourers commonly receive their earnings once a week and all the working people that were employd either in any of the various branches of the manufacture it self or the several land and water carriages it requires to be brought to perfection from    the sheeps back to the vessel it was enterd in were paid at least much the greatest part of them before the parcel came on board should any of my readers draw conclusions in infinitum from my assertions that goods sunk or burnt are as beneficial to the poor as if they had been well sold and put to their proper uses i would count him a caviller and not worth answering should it always rain and the sun never shine the fruits of the earth would soon be rotten and destroyd and yet it is no paradox to affirm that to have grass or corn rain is as necessary as the sunshine in what manner this blessing of fair winds and fine weather would affect the mariners themselves and the breed of sailors may be easily conjectured from what has been said already as there would hardly one ship in four be made use of so the vessels themselves being always exempt from storms fewer hands would be required to work them and consequently five in six of the seamen we have might be spared which in this nation most employments of the poor being overstockd would be but an untoward     article as soon as those superfluous seamen shoulda be extinct it would be impossible to man such large fleets as we could at present but i do not look upon this as a detriment or the least inconveniency for the reduction of mariners as to numbers being general throughout the world all the consequence would be that in case of war the    maritime powers would be obliged to fight with fewer ships which would be an happiness instead of an evil and would you carry this felicity to the highest pitch of perfection it is but to add one desirable blessing more and no nation shall ever fight at all the blessing i hint at is what all good christians are bound to pray for viz that all princes and states would be true to their oaths and promises and just to one another as well as their own subjects that they might have a greater regard for the dictates of conscience and religion than those of state politicks and worldly wisdom and prefer the spiritual welfare of others to their own carnal desires and the honesty the safety the peace and tranquillity of the nations they govern to their own love of glory spirit of revenge avarice and ambition the last paragraph will to many seem a digression that makes little for my purpose but what i mean by it is to demonstrate that goodness integrity and a peaceful disposition in rulers and governors of nations are not the proper qualifications to aggrandize them and increase their numbers any more than the uninterrupted series of success that every private person would be blest with if he could and which i have shewn would be injurious and destructive to a large society that should place a felicity in worldly greatness and being envied by their neighbours    and value themselves upon their honour and their strength no man needs to guard himself against blessings     but calamities require hands to avert them the amiable qualities of man put none of the species upon stirring his honesty his love of company his goodness content and frugality are so many comforts to an indolent society and the more real and unaffected they are the more they keep every thing at rest and peace and the more they will every where prevent trouble and motion it self the same almost may be said of the gifts and munificence of heaven and all the bounties and benefits of nature this is certain that the more extensive they are and the greater plenty we have of them the more we save our labour but the necessities the vices and imperfections of man together with the various inclemencies of the air and other elements contain in them the seeds of all arts industry and labour it is the extremities of heat and cold the inconstancy and badness of seasons the vidence and uncertainty of winds the vast power and treachery of water the rage and untractableness of fire and the stubbornness and sterility of the earth that rack our invention how we shall either avoid the mischiefs they may produce or correct the malignity of them and turn their several forces to our owna advantage a thousand different ways while we are employd in supplying the infinite variety    of our wants which will ever be multiplyd as our knowledge is enlarged and our desires increase hunger thirst and nakedness are the first tyrants that force us to stir afterwards our pride sloth sensuality and fickleness are the great patrons that promote all arts and sciences trades handicrafts and callings while the great taskmasters necessity avarice envy and ambition each in the class that belongs to him keep the members of the society to their labour and make them all submit most of them chearfully to the drudgery of their station kings and princes not excepted     the greater the variety of tradesa and manufactures the more operose they are and the more they are divided in many branches the greater numbers may be contained in a society without being in one anothers way and the more easily they may be renderd a rich potent and flourishing people few virtues employ any hands and therefore they may render a small nation good but they can never make a great one to be strong and laborious patient in difficulties and assiduous in all business are commendable qualities but as they do their own work so they are their own reward and neither art norb industry have ever paid their compliments to them whereas the excellency of human thought and contrivance has been and is yet no where more conspicuous than in thec variety of tools and instruments of workmen and artificers and the    multiplicity of engines that were all invented either to assist the weakness of man to correct his many imperfections to gratify his laziness or obviate his impatience it is in morality as it is in nature there is nothing so perfectly good in creatures that it cannot be hurtful to any one of the society nor any thing so entirely evil but it may prove beneficial to some part or other of the creation so that things are only good and evil in reference to something else and according to the light and position they are placed in what pleases us is good in that regard and by this rule every man wishes well for himself to the best of his capacity with little respect to his neighbour there never was any rain yet tho in a very dry season when publick prayers had been made for it but somebody or other who wanted to go abroad wished it might be fair weather only for that day when the corn stands thick in the spring and the generality of the country rejoice at the pleasing     object the rich farmer who kept his last years crop for a better market pines at the sight and inwardly grieves at the prospect of a plentiful harvest nay we shall often hear your idle people openly wish for the possessions of others and not to be injurious forsooth add this wise proviso that it should be without detriment to the owners but im afraid they often do it without any such restriction in their hearts    it is a happiness that the prayers as well as wishes of most people are insignificant and good for nothing or else the only thing that could keep mankind fit for society and the world from falling into confusion would be the impossibility that all the petitions made to heaven should be granted a dutiful pretty young gentleman newly come from his travels lies at the briel  waiting with impatience for an easterly wind to waft him over to england where a dying father who wants to embrace and give him his blessing before he yields his breath lies hoaning  after him melted with grief and tenderness in the mean while a british minister who is to take care of the protestant interest in germany is riding post to harwich and in violent haste to be at ratisbone before the diet breaks up at the same time a rich fleet lies ready for the mediterranean and a fine squadron is bound for the baltick all these things may probably happen at once at least there is no difficulty in supposinga they should if these people are not atheists or very great reprobates they will all have some good thoughts before they go to sleep and consequently about bedtime they must all differently pray for a fair wind and a prosperous voyage i dont say but it is their duty and it is possible they may be all heard but i am sure they cant be all served at the same time        after this i flatter my self to have demonstrated that neither the friendly qualities and kind affections that are natural to man nor the real virtues he is capable of acquiring by reason and selfdenial are the foundation of society but that what we call evil in this world moral as well as natural is the grand principle that makes us sociable creatures the solid basis the life and support of all trades and employments without exception that there we must look for the true origin of all arts and sciences and that the moment evil ceases the society must be spoiled if not totally dissolved i could add a thousand things to enforce and further illustrate this truth with abundance of pleasure but for fear of being troublesome i shall make an end tho i confess that i have not been half so sollicitous to gain the approbation of others as i have studyd to please my self in this amusement yet if ever i hear that by following this diversion i have given any to the intelligent reader it will always add to the satisfaction i have received in the performance in the hope my vanity forms of this i leave him with regret and concludea with repeating the seeming paradox the substance of which is advanced in the title page that private vices by the dextrous management

the cause between my adversaries and myself it is requisite that before he sees my defence he should know the whole charge and have before him all the accusations against me at large the presentment of the grand jury  is worded thus we the grand jury for the county of middlesex have with the greatest sorrow and concern observd the many books and pamphlets that are almost every week published against the sacred articles of our holy    religion and all discipline and order in the church and the manner in which this     is carryd on seems to us to have a direct tendency to propagate infidelity and consequently corruption of all morals we are justly sensible of the goodness of the almighty that has preserved us from the plague  which has visited our neighbouring nation and for which great mercy his majesty was graciously pleased to command by his proclamation that thanks should be returned to heaven but how provoking must it be to the almighty that his mercies and deliverances extended to this nation and our thanksgiving that was publickly commanded for it should be attended with such flagrant impieties we know of nothing that can be of greater service to his majesty and the protestant succession which is happily established among us for the defence of the christian religion than the suppression of blasphemy and profaneness which has a direct tendency to subvert the very foundation on which his majestys government is fixed so restless have these zealots for infidelity been in their diabolical attempts against religion that they have first openly blasphemed and denied the doctrine of the ever blessed trinity  endeavouring by specious pretences to revive the arian heresy which was never introduced    into any nation but the vengeance of heaven pursued it secondly they affirm an absolute fate and deny the providence and government of the almighty in the world thirdly they have endeavoured to subvert all order and discipline ina the church and by vile and unjust reflexions on the clergy they strive to     bring contempt on all religion that by the libertinism of their opinions they may encourage and draw others into the immoralities of their practice fourthly that a general libertinism may the more effectually be established the universities are decried and all instructions of youth in the principles of the christian religion are exploded with the greatest malice and falsity fifthly the more effectually to carry on these works of darkness studied artifices and invented colours have been made use of to run down religion and virtue as prejudicial to society and detrimental to the state and to recommend luxury avarice pride and all kind of vices as being necessary to publick welfare and not tending to the destruction of the constitution nay the very stews themselves have had strained apologies and forced encomiums made in their favour and produced in print with design we conceive to debauch the nation these principles having a direct tendency to the subversion of all religion and civil go   vernment our duty to the almighty our love to our country and regard to our oaths obliege us to present  as the     publisher of a book intituled the fable of the bees or private vices publick benefits  d edit      and also as the publisher of a weekly paper calld the british journal numb          and     the letter i complain of is this my lord  tis welcome news to all the kings loyal subjects and true friends to the establishd government and succession in the illustrious house of     hanover that your lordship is said to be contriving some effectual means of securing us from the dangers wherewith his majestys happy government seems to be threatned by catiline under the name of cato  by the writer of a book intituled the fable of the bees c and by others of their fraternity who are undoubtedly useful friends to the pretender  and diligent for his sake in labouring to subvert and ruin our constitution under a specious pretence of defending it your lordships wise resolution totally to suppress such impious writings and the direction already gi   ven for having them presented immediately      by some of the grand juries will effectually convince the nation that no attempts against christianity will be sufferd or endured here and this conviction will at once rid mens minds of the uneasiness which this flagitious race of writers has endeavoured to raise in them will therefore be a firm bulwark to the protestant religion will effectually defeat the projects and hopes of the pretender and best secure us against any change in the ministry and no faithful briton could be unconcernd if the people should imagine any the least neglect in any single person bearing a part in the ministry or begin to grow jealous that any thing could be done which is not done in defending their religion from every the least appearance of danger approaching towards it and my lord this jealousy might have been apt to rise if no measures had been taken to discourage and crush the open advocates of irreligion tis no easy matter to get jealousy out of ones brains when tis once got into them jealousy my lord tis as furious a fiend as any of them all i have seen a little thin weak woman so invigorated by a fit of jealousy that five grenadiers could not hold her my lord go on with your just methods of keeping the people clear of this cursed jealousy for amongst the various kinds and occasions of it that which concerns their religion is the most violent flagrant frantick    sort of all and accordingly has in former reigns produced those various mischiefs which your lordship has faithfully determined to prevent dutifully regarding the royal authority and conforming to the example of his majesty who has graciously given directions which are well known to your lordship for the preserving of unity in the church and the purity of the christian faith tis in vain to think that the people of england will ever give up their religion or be very fond of any ministry that will not support it as the wisdom of     this ministry has done against such audacious attacks as are made upon it by the scriblers for scribler your lordship knows is the just appellation of every author who under whatever plausible appearance of good sense attempts to undermine the religion and therefore the content and quiet the peace and happiness of his fellowsubjects by subtle and artful and fallacious arguments and insinuations may heaven avert those insufferable miseries which the church of rome would bring upon us tyranny is the bane of human society and there is no tyranny heavier than that of the triple crown and therefore this free and happy people has justly conceived an utter abhorrence and dread of popery and of every thing that looks like encouragementa or tendency to it but they do also abhor and dread the violence offerd to christianity it self by    our british catilines who shelter their treacherous designs against it under the false colours of regard and goodwill to our blessed protestant religion while they demonstrate too plainly demonstrate that the title of protestants does not belong to them unless it can belong to those who are in effect protesters against all religion and really the people cannot be much blamed for being a little unwilling to part with their religion for they tell ye that there is a god and that god governs the world and that he is wont to bless or blast a kingdom in proportion to the degrees of religion or irreligion prevailing in it your lordship has a fine collection of books and which is a finer thing still you do certainly understand them and can turn to an account of any important affair in a trice i would therefore fain know whether your lordship can show from any writer let him be as profane as the scriblers would have him that any one empire kingdom country or province great or small did   0 not dwindle and sink and was confounded when it once faild of providing studiously for the support of religion the scriblers talk much of the roman government and liberty and the spirit of the old romans but tis undeniable that their most plausible talk of these things is all pretence and grimace and an artifice to serve the purposes of irreligion and by consequence to render the people uneasy and ruin   0the kingdom for if they did in reality esteem and would faithfully recommend to their countrymen the sentiments and principles the main purposes and practices of the wise and prosperous romans they would in the first place put us in mind that old rome was as remarkable for observing and promoting natural religion  as new rome has been for corrupting that which is reveald and as the old romans did signally recommend themselves to the favour of heaven by their faithful care of religion so were they abundantly convinced and did accordingly acknowledge with universal consent that their care of religion was the great means of gods preserving the empire and crowning it with conquest and success prosperity and glory hence it was that when their orators were bent upon exerting their utmost in moving and persuading the people upon any occasion they ever put them in mind of their religion if that could be any way affected by the point in debate not doubting that the people would determine in their favour     if they could but demonstrate that the safety of religion depended upon the success of their cause and indeed neither the romans nor any other nation upon earth did ever suffer their establishd religion to be openly ridiculed exploded or opposed and im sure your lord   ship would not for all the world that this thing shoulda be done with impunity amongst us which was never endured in the world before did ever any man since the blessed revelation of the gospel run riot upon christianity as some men nay and some few women too have lately done must the devil grow rampant at this rate and not to be calld coram nobis why should not he content himselfb to carry off people in the common way the way of cursing and swearing sabbathbreaking and cheating bribery and hypocrisy drunkenness and whoring and such kind of things as he usd to do never let him domineer in mens mouths and writings as he does now with loud tremendous infidelity blasphemy and profaneness enough to frighten the kings subjects out of their wits we are now come to a short question god or the devil thats the word and time will shew who and who goes together thus much may be said at present that those have abundantly shewn their spirit of opposition to sacred things who have not only inveighed against the national profession and exercise of religion and endeavourd with bitterness and dexterity to render it odious and contemptible but are sollicitous to hinder multitudes of the natives of this island from having the very seeds of religion sown among them with advantage arguments are urged with the utmost vehemence against the education of poor chil   dren in the charityschools tho there hath not one just reason been offerd against the provision made for that     education the things that have been objected against it are not in fact true and nothing ought to be regarded by serious and wise men as a weighty or just argument if it is not a true one how hath catiline the confidence left to look any man in the face after he hath spent more confidence than most mens whole stock amounts to in saying that this pretended charity has in effect destroyd all other charities which were before given to the aged sick and impotent  it seems pretty clear that if those who do not contribute to any charityschool are become more uncharitable to any other object than formerly they were their want of charity to the one is not owing to their contribution to the other and as to those who do contribute to these schools they are so far from being more sparing in their relief of other objects than they were before that the pooh widows the aged and the impotent do plainly receive more relief from them in proportion to their numbers and abilities than from any the same numbers of men under the same circumstances of fortune who do not concern themselves with charityschools in any respect but in condemning and decrying them i will meet catiline at the grecian coffeehouse  any day in the week and by    an enumeration of particular persons in as great a number as he pleaseth demonstrate the truth of what i say but i do not     much depend upon his giving me the meeting because tis his business not to encourage demonstrations of the truth but to throw disguises upon it otherwise he never could have allowed himself after representing the charityschools as intended to breed up children to reading and writing and a sober behaviour that they may be qualified to be servants immediately to add these words a sort of idle and rioting vermin by which the kingdom is already almost devoured and are become every where a publick nusance  c what is it owing to the charityschools that servants are become so idle such rioting vermin such a publick nusance that womenservants turn whores and the menservants robbers housebreakers and sharpers as he says they commonly do is this owing to the charityschools or if it is not how comes he to allow himself the liberty of representing these schools as a means of increasing this load of mischief which is indeed too plainly fallen upon the publick the imbibing principles of virtue hath not usually been thought the chief occasion of running into vice if the early knowledge of truth and of our obligationsa to it were the surest means of departing from it no body would doubt that the knowledge of truth was instilld into catiline very early and with the utmost care tis a good pretty thing in him to spread a report and to lay so much stress upon it as he does that there is more collected at the church doors in a day to make these poor boys and girls appear in caps and liverycoats than for all the poor in a year  o rare catiline this point you ll carry most swimmingly for you have no witnesses against you nor any living soul to contradict you except the collectors and overseers of     the poor and all other principal inhabitants of most of the parishes where any charityschools are in england the jest of it is my lord that these scriblers would still be thought good moral men but when men make it their business to mislead and deceive their neighbours and that in matters of moment by distorting and disguising the truth by misrepresentations and false insinuations if such men are not guilty of usurpation while they take upon them the character of good moral men then tis not immoral in any man to be false and deceitful in cases where the law cannot touch him for being so and morality bears no relation to truth and fair dealing however i shall not be very willing to meet one of these moral men upon hounslowheath if i should happen to ride that way without pistols for i have a notion that they who have no conscience in one point dont much abound with it in another your lordship who judges ac   curately of men as well as books will easily imagine if you had no other knowledge of the charityschools that there must be something very excellent in them because such kind of men as these are so warm in opposing them they tell you that these schools are hindrances to husbandry and to manufacture as to husbandry the children are not kept in the schools longer than till they are of age and strength to perform the principal parts of it or to bear constant labour in it and even while they are under this course of education your lordship may depend upon it that they shall never be hindred from working in the fields or being employd in such labour as they are capable of in any parts of the year when they can get such employment for the support of their parents and themselves in this case the parents in the several countriesa are proper judges of their several     situations and circumstances and at the same time not so very fond of their childrens getting a little knowledge rather than a little money but that they will find other employment for them than going to school whenever they can get a penny by so doing and the case is the same as to the manufactures the trustees of the charityschools and the parents of the children bred in them would be thankful to those gentlemen who make the objection if they would assist in removing    it by subscribing to a fund for joining the employment of manufacture to the business of learning to read and write in the charityschools this would be a noble work tis already effected by the supporters of some charityschools and is aimed at and earnestly desired by all the rest but rome was not built in a day till this great thing can be brought about let the masters and managers of the manufactures in the several places of the kingdom be so charitable as to employ the poor children for a certain number of hours in every day in theira respective manufactures while the trustees are taking care to fill up their other hours of the day in the usual duties of the charityschools tis an easy matter for partymen for designing and perverted minds to invent colourable fallacious arguments and to offer railing under the appearance of reasoning against the best things in the world but undoubtedly no impartial man who is affected with a serious sense of goodness and a real love of his country can think this proper and just view of the charityschools liable to any just weighty objection or refuse to contribute his endeavours to improve and raise them to that perfection which is proposd in them in the mean time let no man be so weak or so wicked as to deny that when poor children cannot meet with employment in any other honest way rather than suffer their tender age     to be    spent in idleness or in learning the arts of lying and swearing and stealing tis true charity to them and good service done to our country to employ them in learning the principles of religion and virtue till their age and strength will enable them to become servants in families or to be engagd in husbandry or manufacture or any kind of mechanick trade or laborious employment for to these laborious employments are the charity children generally if not always turnd as soon as they become capable of them and therefore catiline may be pleasd to retract his objection concerning shopkeepers or retailers of commodities wherein he has affirmed that their employments which he says ought to fall to the share of children of their own degree are mostly anticipateda and engrossd by the managers of the charityschools  he must excuse my acquainting your lordship that this affirmation is in fact directly false which is an inconvenience very apt to fall upon his affirmations as it has particularly done upon one of em more which i would mention for he is not ashamd roundly to assert that the principles of our common people are debauchd in our charityschools who are taught as soon as they can speak to blabber out highchurch and ormond  and so are bred up to be traitors before they know what treason signifies  your lordship and other persons of integrity whose words are the faithful repre   sentatives of their meaning would now think if i had not given you a key to catilines talk that he has been fully convinced     that the children in the charityschools are bred up to be traitors my lord if any one master be sufferd by the trustees to continue in any charityschool against whom proof can be brought that he is disaffected to the government or that he does not as faithfully teach the children obedience and loyalty to the king as any other duty in the catechism then i will gratify catiline with a license to pull down the schools and hang up the masters according to his hearts desire these and such things as these are urgd with the like bitterness and as little truth in the book mentiond above viz the fable of the bees or private vices publick benefits c catiline explodes the fundamental articles of faith impiously comparing the doctrine of the blessed trinity to feefafum  this profligate author of the fable is not only an auxiliary to catiline in opposition to faith but has taken upon him to tear up the very foundations of moral virtue and establish vice in its room the best physician in the world did never labour more to purge the natural body of bad qualities than this bumblebee has done to purge the body politick of good ones he himself bears testimony to the truth of this charge against him for    when he comes to the conclusion of his book he makes this observation upon himself and his performance after this i flatter my self to have demonstrated that neither the friendly qualities and kind affections that are natural to man nor the real virtues he is capable of acquiring by reason and selfdenial are the foundation of society but that what we call evil in this world moral as well as natural is the grand principle that makes us sociable creatures the solid basis the life and support of all trades and employments without exception that there we must look for the true origin of all arts and     sciences and that the moment evil ceases the society must be spoild if not totally dissolvd  now my lord you see the grand design the main drift of catiline and his confederates now the scene opens and the secret springs appear now the fraternity adventure to speak out and surely no band of men ever dared to speak at this rate before now you see the true cause of all their enmity to the poor charityschools tis levelld against religion religion my lord which the schools are instituted to promote and which this confederacy is resolved to destroy for the schools are certainly one of the greatest instruments of religion and virtue one of the firmest bulwarks against popery one of the best recommendations of this people to the divine favour   0and therefore one of the greatest blessings to our country of any thing that has been set on foot since our happy reformation and deliverance from the idolatry and tyranny of rome if any trivial inconvenience did arise from so excellent a work as some little inconvenience attends all human institutions and affairs the excellency of the work would still be matter of joy and find encouragement with all the wise and the good who despise such insignificant objections against it as other men are not ashamd to raise and defend now your lordship also sees the true cause of the satyr which is continually formd against the clergy by catiline and his confederates why should mr halls conviction and execution be any more an objection against the clergy  than mr layers      against the gentlemen of the long robe why because the profession of the law does not immediately relate to religion and therefore catiline will allow that if any persons of that profession should be traitors or otherwise vicious all the rest may notwithstanding the iniquity of a brother be as loyal and virtuous as any other subjects in the kings dominions but because matters of religion are the professd concern and the employment of the clergy therefore catilines logick makes it out as clear as the day that if any of them be disaffected to the government all the rest are so too or if any of them be chargeable with vice this consequence from    it is plain that all or most of the rest are as vicious as the devil can make them i shall not trouble your lordship with a particular vindication of the clergy nor is there any reason that i should for they are already secure of your lordships good affection to them and they are able to vindicate themselves wheresoever such a vindication is wanted being as faithful and virtuous and learned a body of men as any in europe and yet they suspend the publication of arguments in a solemn defence of themselves because they neither expect nor desire approbation and esteem from impious and abandond men and at the same time they cannot doubt that all persons not only of great penetration but of common sense do now clearly see that the arrows shot against the clergy are intended to wound and destroy the divine institution of the ministerial offices and to extirpate the religion which the sacred offices were appointed to preserve and promote this  00 was always supposed and suspected by every honest and impartial man but tis now demonstrated by those who before had given occasion to such suspicions for they have now openly declared that faith in the principal articles of it is not only needless but ridiculous that the welfare of human society must sink and perish under the encouragement of virtue and that immoralitya is the only firm foundation whereon the happiness of mankind can be built and    subsist the publication of such tenets as these an open avowd proposal to extirpate the christian faith and all virtue and to fix moral evil for the basis of the government is so stunning so shocking so frightful so flagrant an enormity that if it should be imputed to us as a national guilt the divine vengeance must inevitably fall upon us and how far this enormity would become a national guilt if it should pass disregarded and unpunished a casuist less skilful and discerning than your lordship may easily guess and no doubt your lordships good judgment in so plain and important a case has made you like a wise and faithful patriot resolve to use your utmost endeavours in your high station to defend religion from the bold attacks made upon it as soon as i have seen a copy of the bill for the better security of his majesty and his happy government by the better security of religion in greatbritain  your lordships just scheme of politicks your  0  love of your country and your great services done to it shall again be acknowledgd by my lord your most faithful humble servant theophilus philobritannus     these violent accusations and the great clamour every where raised against the book by governors masters and other champions of charityschools together with the advice of friends and the reflexion on what i owed to myself drew from me the following answer the candid reader in the perusal of it will not be offended at the repetition of some passages one of which he may have met with twice already when he shall consider that to make my defence by it self to the publick i was obliged to repeat what hada been quoted in the letter since the paper would unavoidably fall into the hands of many who had never seen either the fable of the bees or the defamatory letter wrote against it the answer was published in the londonjournal of august  0      in these words whereas in the eveningpost of thursday july    a presentment was inserted of the grand jury of middlesex against the publisher of a book entituled the fable of the bees or private vices publick benefits and since that a passionate and abusive letter has been published against the same book and the author of it in the london journal  0  of saturday july    i think myself indispensably obliged to vindicate the abovesaid book against the black aspersions that undeservedly have been cast upon it being conscious that i have not had the least ill design in    composing it the accusations against it having been made openly in the publick papers it is not equitable the defence of it should appear in a more private manner what i have to say in my behalf i shall address to all men of sense and sincerity asking no other favour of them than their patience and attention setting aside what in that letter relates to others and every thing that is foreign and immaterial i shall begin with the passage that is quoted from the book viz after this i flatter my self to have demonstrated that neither the friendly qualities and kind affections that are natural to man nor the real virtues he is capable of acquiring by reason and selfdenial are the foundation of society but that what we call evil in this world moral as well as natural is the grand principle that makes us sociable creatures the solid basis the life and support of all trades and employments without exception that there we must look for the true origin of all arts and sciences and that the moment evil ceases the society must be spoiled if not totally dissolved  these words i own are in the book and being both innocent and true like to remain there in all future impressions but i will likewise own very freely that if i had wrote with a design to be understood by the meanest capacities i would not have chose the subject there treated of or if i had i would have amplifyd and explained every period talked and distin   guished magisterially and never appeared without the fescue in my hand as for example to make the passage pointed at intelligible i would have bestowed a page or two on the meaning of the word evil after that i would have taught them that every defect every  0  want was an evil that on the multiplicity of those wants depended all thosea mutual services which the individual members of a society pay to each other and that consequently the greater variety there was of wants the larger number of individuals might find their private interest in labouring for the good of others and united together compose one body is there a trade or handicraft but what supplies us with something we wanted this want certainly before it was supplyd was an evil which that trade or handicraft was to remedy and without which it could never have been thought of is there an art or science that was not invented to mend some defect had this latter not existed there could have been no occasion for the former to remove it i say p     the excellency of human thought and contrivance has been and is yet no where more conspicuous than in the variety of tools and instruments of workmen and artificers and the multiplicity of engines that were all invented either to assist the weakness of man to correct his many imperfections to gratify his laziness or obviate his impatience    several foregoing pages run in the same strain but what relation has all this to religion or infidelity more than it has to navigation or the peace in the north  the many hands that are employd to supply our natural wants that are really such as hunger thirst and nakedness are inconsiderable to the vast numbers that are all innocently gratifying the depravity of our corrupt nature i mean the industrious who get a livelihood by their honest labour to which the vain and voluptuous must be beholden for all their tools and implements of ease and luxury the  0  shortsighted vulgar in the chain of causes seldom can see farther than one link but those who can enlarge their view and will give themselves leisure of gazing on the prospect of concatenated events may in a hundred places see good spring up and pullulate from evil as naturally as chickens do from eggs thea words are to be found p    in the remark made on the seeming paradox that in the grumbling hive   the worst of all the multitude   did something for the common good  where in many instances may be amply discovered how unsearchable providence daily orders the comforts of the laborious and even    the deliverancesb of the oppressed secretly to come forth not only from the vices of the luxurious but likewise the crimes of the flagitious and most abandoned men of candour and capacity perceive at first sight that in the passage censured there is no meaning hid or expressed that is not altogether contained in the following words man is a necessitous creature on innumerable accounts and yet from those very necessities and nothing else arise all trades and employments  but it is ridiculous for men to meddle with books above their sphere the fable of the bees was designed for the entertainment of people of knowledge and education when they have an idle hour which they know not how to spend better it is a book of severe and exalted  0  morality that contains a strict test of virtue an infallible touchstone to distinguish the real from the counterfeited and shews many actions to be faulty that are palmed upon the world for good ones it describes the nature and symptoms of human passions detects their force and disguises and traces selflove in its darkest recesses i might safely add beyond any other system of ethicks the whole is a rhapsody void of order or method but no part of it has any thing in it that is sour or pedantick the style i confess is very unequal sometimes very high and rhetorical and sometimes very low    and even very trivial such as it is i am satisfied that it has diverted persons of great probity and virtue and unquestionable good sense and i am in no fear that it will ever cease to do so while it is read by such whoever has seen the violent charge against this book will pardon me for saying more in commendation of it than a man not labouring under the same necessity would do of his own work on any other occasion the encomiums upon stews complained of in the presentment are no where in the book what might give a handle to this charge must be a political dissertation concerning the best method to guard and preserve women of honour and virtue from the insults of dissolute men whose passions are often ungovernable  as in this there is a dilemma between two evils which it is impracticable to shun both so i have treated it with the utmost caution and begin thus i am far from encouraging vice and should think it an unspeakable felicity for a state if the sin of uncleanness could be utterly banished from it but i am afraid it is impossible  i give my reasons why i think it so and speaking occasionally of the musickhouses at amsterdam i give a short account of them than which nothing can be more harmless and i appeal to all impartial judges whether what i have  0  said of them is not ten times more proper to give men even the voluptuous of any    taste a disgust and aversion against them than it is to raise any criminal desire i am sorry the grandjury should conceive that i published this with a design to debauch the nation without considering that in the first place there is not a sentence nor a syllable that can either offend the chastest ear or sully the imagination of the most vicious or in the second that the matter complained of is manifestly addressed to magistrates and politicians or at least the more serious and thinking part of mankind whereas a general corruption of manners as to lewdness to be produced by reading can only be apprehended from obscenities easily purchased and every way adapted to the tastes and capacities of the heedless multitude and unexperienced youth of both sexes but that the performance so outrageously exclaimed against was never calculated for either of these classes of people is selfevident from every circumstance the beginning of the prose is altogether philosophical and hardly intelligible to any that have not been used to matters of speculation and the running title of it is so far from being specious or inviting that without having read the book it self no body knows what to make of it while at the same time the price is five shillings  from all which it is plain that if the book contains any dangerous tenets i have not been very sollicitous to scatter them among the   0people i have not said a word to please or engage them and the greatest compliment i have made them has been apage vulgus but as nothing i say p     would  0  more clearly demonstrate the falsity of my notions than that the generality of the people should fall in with them so i dont expect the approbation of the multitude i write not to many nor seek for any wellwishers but among the few that can think abstractly and have their minds elevated above the vulgar of this i have made no ill use and ever preserved such a tender regard to the publick that when i have advanced any uncommon sentiments i have used all the precautions imaginable that they might not be hurtful to weak minds that might casually dip into the book when pa     i owned that it was my sentiment that no society could be raised into a rich and mighty kingdom or so raised subsist in their wealth and power for any considerable time without the vices of man i had premised what was true that i had never said or imagined that man could not be virtuous as well in a rich and mighty kingdom as in the most pitiful commonwealth which caution a man less scrupulous than my self might have thought superfluous when he had already explained himself on that head in the very same paragraph which begins thus i lay down as a first principle that in all societies great or small it is    the duty of every member of it to be good that virtue ought to be encouraged vice discountenanced the laws obeyd and the transgressors punished there is not a line in the book that contradicts this doctrine and i defy my enemies to disprove what i have advanced p     that if i have shewn the way to worldly greatness i have always without hesitation preferrd the road that leads to virtue no man ever took more pains not to be misconstrued than my self mind p     when i say that societies cannot be raised to wealth and power and the top of earthly glory without vices i dont think that by so saying i bid men be vicious any more than i bid them be quarrelsome or covetous when i affirm that the profession of the law  0  could not be maintained in such numbers and splendor if there was not abundance of too selfish and litigious people a caution of the same nature i had already given towards the end of the preface on account of a palpable evil inseparable from the felicity of london to search into the real causes of things imports no ill design nor has any tendency to do harm a man may write on poisons and be an excellent physician page     i say no man needs to guard himself against blessings but calamities require hands to avert them and lowera it is the extremities of heat and cold the inconstancy and badness of seasons the vio   lence and uncertainty of winds the vast power and treachery of water the rage and untractableness of fire and the stubbornness and sterility of the earth that rack our invention how we shall either avoid the mischiefs they produce or correct the malignity of them and turn their several forces to our own advantage a thousand dtfferent ways while a man is enquiring into the occupationb of vast multitudes i cannot see why he may not say all this and much more without being accused of depreciating and speaking slightly of the gifts and munificence of heaven when at the same time he demonstrates that without rain and sunshine this globe would not be habitable to creatures like ourselves it is an outoftheway subject and i would never quarrel with the man who should tell me that it might as well have been let alone yet i always thought it would please men of any tolerable taste and not be easily lost my vanity i could never conquer so well as i could wish and i am too proud to commit crimes and as to the main scope the intent of the book i mean the view it was wrote with i protest that it has been with the utmost sincerity what i have declared of it in the preface where at the bottom of the sixth  0  page you will find these words if you ask me why i have done all this cui    bono and what good these notions will produce truly besides the readers diversion i believe none at all but if i was askd what naturally ought to be expected from them i would answer that in the first place the people who continually find fault with others by reading them would be taught to look at home and examining their own consciences be made ashamd of always railing at what they are more or less guilty of themselves and that in the next those who are so fond of the ease and comforts of a great and flourishing nation would learn more patiently to submit to those inconveniences which no government upon earth can remedy when they should see the impossibility of enjoying any great share of the first without partaking likewise of the latter  the first impression of the fable of the bees which came out in      was never carpt at or publickly taken notice of and all the reason i can think on why this second edition should be so unmercifully treated tho it has many precautions which the former wanted is an essay ona charity and charityschools which is added to what was printed before i confess that it is my sentiment that all hard and dirty work ought in a wellgovernd nation to be the lot and portion of the poor and that to divert their children from useful labour till they are fourteen or fifteen years    old is a wrong method to qualify them for it when they are grown up i have given several reasons for my opinion in that essay to which i refer all impartial men of understanding assuring them that they will not meet with such monstrous impiety in it as is reported what an advocate i have been for libertinism and immorality and what an enemy to all instructions of youth in the christian faith may be collected from the pains i have taken on education   0 for above seven pages together and afterwards again page     where speaking of the instructions the children of the poor might receive at church from which i say or some other place of worship i would not have the meanest of a parish that is able to walk to it be absent on sundays i have these words it is the sabbath the most useful day in seven that is set apart for divine service and religious exercise as well as resting from bodily labour and it is a duty incumbent on all magistrates to take a particular care of that day the poor more especially and their children should be made to go to church on it both in the fore and the afternoon because they have no time on any other by precept and example they ought to be encouraged to it from their very infancy the wilful neglect of it ought to be counted scandalous and if downright compulsion to what i urge might seem too harsh and perhaps    impracticable all diversions at least ought strictly to be prohibited and the poor hindred from every amusement abroad that might allure or draw them from it if the arguments i have made use of are not convincing i desire they may be refuted and i will acknowledge it as a favour in any one that shall convince me of my error without ill language by shewing me wherein i have been mistaken but calumny it seems is the shortest way of confuting an adversary when men are touchd in a sensible part vast sums are gatherd for these charityschools and i understand human nature too well to imagine that the sharers of the money should hear them spoke against with any patience i foresaw therefore the usage i was to receive and having repeated the common cant that is made for charityschools i told my readers pagea  0  this is the general cry and he that speaks the least word against it is an uncharitable hardhearted and inhuman if not a wicked profane and atheistical wretch for this     reason it cannot be thought that it was a great surprize to me when in that extraordinary letter to lord c i saw my self calld profligate author the publication of my tenets an open and avowed proposal to extirpate the christian faith and all virtue and what i had done so stunning so shocking so frightful so flagrant an enormity that it cryd for the vengeance of hea   ven this is no more than what i have always expected from the enemies to truth and fair dealing and i shall retort nothing on the angry author of that letter who endeavours to expose me to the publick fury i pity him and have charity enough to believe that he has been imposed upon himself by trusting to fame and the hearsay of others for no man in his wits can imagine that he should have read one quarter part of my book and write as he does  i am sorry if the words private vices publick benefits have ever given any offence to a wellmeaning man the mystery of them is soon unfolded when once they are rightly understood but no man of sincerity will question the innocence of them that has read the last paragraph where i take my leave of the reader and conclude with repeating the seeming paradox the substance of which is advanced in the title page that private vices by the dextrous management     of a skilful politician may be turnd into publick benefits  these are the last words of the book printed in the same large character with the rest but i set aside all what i have said in my vindication and if in the whole book calld the fable of the bees and presented by the grandjury of middlesex to the judges of the kings bench there is to be found the least tittle of blasphemy or pro   faneness or any thing tending to immorality or the corruption of manners i desire it may be publishd and if this be done without invectivea personal reflexions or setting the mob upon me things i never design to answer i will not only recant but likewise beg pardon of the offended publick in the most solemn manner and if the hangman might be thought too good for the office

for instance ed    0 pp    –   concluding that wine is a cordial and restorative only to those that are unacquainted with or at least make no constant practise of using it upon us that either out of luxury pride or a foolish custom have brought our selves to drink it daily and made it a part of our diet its medicinal virtue … is lost p     he speaks also of hot vinous liquors by the constant sipping of which it is incredible how many have been destroyd p     to be sure he admits the healthfulness of its use in moderation and even indulges in a literary rhapsody in imitation of the classics as to its effects pp   0–  but his final professional verdict is that it is useful except as a restorative only because otherwise people who dislike water would not drink enough with their meals to saturate their solid nourishment pp    –  and he counterbalances his rhapsody by the assertion that the innumerable mischiefs which wine as it is managed creates to mankind far exceed whatever horace or any body else can say in commendation of it p     his attitude towards winedrinking indeed is extraordinarily unfavourable for a century in which respectable men used regularly to drink themselves into an afterdinner stupor in fact mandevilles advice p     to forbear wine for a fortnight or longer every now and then was so contrary to the custom of his day that he feels forced to add that most people in plentiful circumstances would laugh at this admonition p     in the fable of the bees also he takes an attitude contrary to that with which hawkins credits him he directs his irony specifically against distillers see i    and preaches against drinking see remark g—although maintaining of course in accord with the paradoxical theme of his book that even this evil has

in applebees original weekly journal for    jan        p        that mandeville and not the compositor was responsible for some of the variations between the editions of      and      is indicated first by the fact that the variations between these editions are much more numerous than the alterations occurring after      which is what would be likely to happen if the changes were due to the authors intention and not to inaccuracies of the printer secondly by the nature of certain of the changes—those noted below i    n a     n a     n a     n c     n b and     n a the variant in i    n a is especially significant for in the previous edition mandeville had made similar contractions see below i     n e and     n a the variant in i     n a shows a correction of an error in the earlier editions—a correction of a kind not likely to be made by a compositor setting a verbatim reprint and the change in i     n c is a stylistic improvement   there is not a single alteration in the      edition which might not easily be due to the compositors inaccuracy that the changes in the      edition were not mandevilles is shown by the fact that the next edition      was set from the

parts of the letter to dion and of the origin of honour part ii of the fable is stylistically not so good its more polite and artificial manner sacrifices some of the raciness and movement of part i and the effect of the dialogue form of remark and answer has caused some loss of the rhythmic sweep of phrase so satisfying in vol i the student of style would do well to note mandevilles skill in rhythm and balance to take an example almost at random note how in the paragraph on i    – —especially in the last two sentences—the sentences are divided into balancing parts each part being in turn composed of antiphonal elements such parallel structure in the rhythmic texture of his prose is an outstanding trait of mandevilles style and is so skilfully employed as never to be monotonous—one might note too the exuberant generosity with which mandeville throws in illustrative matter as if from sheer joy in a visualizing faculty which can supply so many apposite and vivid details about

use the term utilitarian in a looser sense than that in which specialists in philosophy ordinarily employ it i intend by it always an opposition to the insistence of rigoristic ethics that not results but motivation by right principle determines virtuousness to have used the technical vocabulary of the philosophical specialist would have needlessly hampered the reader trained in other fields and besides my nontechnical use of the term parallels the condition of ethical thought in mandevilles day when utilitarian theory had not yet taken to itself the more specific connotation it now has but corresponded simply to an ethics whose moral touchstone was results and not abstract principle for like reasons i have used loosely though i hope not irrelevantly certain other terms such as

psychology the fundamental position of the fable—that socalled good arises from a conversion of socalled evil—is really a form of one of the chief tenets of psychoanalysis—that virtues arise through the individuals attempt to compensate for original weaknesses and vices mandeville also forestalled another freudian position when he argued fable ii     sqq that the naturalness of a desire could be inferred from the fact of a general prohibition aimed at it and the strength of the desire from the stringency of the prohibition and the psychoanalytic theory of the ambivalence of emotions was anticipated by mandeville in his origin of honour pp   –   see below i    n     mandevilles more scientific formulation of his position in part ii and the origin of honour seems due partly to the attacks on him cf below ii     n   and     n   and possibly the full implications of his position were not quite clear to him when he first enunciated it in      cf below i lxxii mandeville pointed

the most ingenious way of becoming foolish is by a system shaftesbury characteristics ed robertson   00 i       cf characteristics i    –    to prevent confusion here and elsewhere it should be noted that mandeville did not consider man an unsocial animal he believed emphatically that man was happiest in society and well adapted to it but he held that it was his egoism which made him social beyond other animals   the special sense in which shaftesbury employed the term nature and the fact that to follow it implied not selfindulgence but selfdiscipline is clear for instance in the last clause of the following passage thus in the several orders of terrestrial forms a resignation is required a sacrifice and mutual yielding of natures one to another    and if in natures so little exalted or preeminent above each other the sacrifice of interests can appear so just how much more reasonably may all inferior natures be subjected to the superior nature of the world … characteristics ed robertson ii    in like manner shaftesbury speaks of the need of disciplining our disposition till it become natural i     note that become the essentially repressive nature of shaftesburys ethics is evident also in such a passage as if by temper any one is passionate angry fearful amorous yet resists these passions and notwithstanding the force of their impression adheres to virtue we say commonly in this case that the virtue is the greater and we say well i     cf esther tiffany shaftesbury as stoic in pub mod lang ass for      xxxviii    –     mandeville in his letter to dion      p    offered a sort of summary of their disagreement i differ from my lord shaftsbury entirely as to the certainty of the pulchrum  honestum abstract from mode and custom i do the same about the origin of society and in many other things especially the reasons why man is a sociable creature beyond other animals leslie stephen makes an interesting comparison between mandeville and shaftesbury in his

there was of course a psychological element in the antirationalism of the pyrrhonists for much of their scepticism as to the possibility of achieving truth rested on the ground that the divergence of our organisms and hence of our impressions and experience prevents the discovery of the common premisses necessary for the realization of truth but the sceptics were interested in criticizing conclusions rather than mental processes and when giving a psychological criticism they attributed error usually to faults of sense or inference and not as with mandeville to the will to error still they showed on some occasions an antirationalism of the mandevillian type thus montaigne added to the more customary type of scepticism of his apologie de raimond sebond some consideratlon of the rule of passion over reason from the particular antirationalistic point of view with which we are here concerned see below i lxxx n   as did joseph glanvill essays on several important subjects in philosophy and religion ed      pp   –  in the first essay there naturally would be some relation between the sceptics and antirationalists of the class to which mandeville belonged for in their attempt to show the elusiveness of truth the sceptics as might be expected considered the ability of man to deceive himself this recognition of mans openness to selfimposture needed only to be stressed and universalized to issue as antirationalism of the kind here considered thus the sceptics were among the intellectual grandparents of mandeville   see next note—this is not to deny that spinoza was also a rationalist see below i    n  —i take this opportunity to note that in painting mandevilles background i am not attempting to show his predecessors fulllength considering that if they stated a concept clearly it may often fairly be taken as a possible source of influence whether or not the concept in question was thoroughly representative of its utterer   i mass here some

sb   in the ox£ord english dictionary   fable i       a more subtly related ancestor of antirationalism and possibly therefore to some extent of mandevilles is perhaps to be found in the medieval doctrine called voluntarism voluntarism declared that it was the will and not the reason which was the efficient cause of belief nemo credit nisi volens of course this doctrine is very different from the antirationalism of a mandeville for to the voluntarist in contrast to mandeville see fable ii     n   for mandevilles determinism the will was free and therefore capable of completely rational choice and control so that the priority of the will committed no voluntarist to antirationalism add now however to voluntarism the servum arbitrium of the lutherans and calvinists this leaves the will no longer free to make rational choice but since the nature of gods creation is rational the action of the will still remains rational despite its loss of power to choose now however take a not unnatural step instead of having the will determined by the nature of gods creation have it determined by its own nature we then have a deterministic psychology which may easily issue as an antirationalism like mandevilles for to the belief that the reason does not control the will is now added the belief that the will is not free to control itself by the light of reason but must mechanically follow the dictates of its own constitution which need not be conceived of as rational however abstruse such a progression of concepts may sound at first it was not i think in practice

in the fable i  0 n   where mandeville similarly qualifies it might be noted that it was common—perhaps to escape prosecution—to limit many theses about human nature to man in the state of nature seventeenthcentury antirationalism was often thus qualified that a writer however admitted exceptions to his rule of human conduct—even when honest in the admission—did not prevent him serving as a focus for an influence which neglected his provisos—a simple procedure since these qualifications often appeared widely separated in the text from otherwise forcible statements   cf nicoles treatise

emerged   thus mandevilles reasoning fable i  0 –   that if a country ceases to import it renders it impossible for other countries to buy its exports was adumbrated by davenant in his essay on the eastindia trade but if we provide ourselves at home with linen sufficient for our own consumption and do not want that which is brought from silesia saxony bohemia and poland this trade must cease for these northern countries have neither money nor other commodities and if we deal with them we must be contented in a manner to barter our clothes for their linen and it is obvious enough to any considering man that by such a traffic we are not losers in the balance works ed      i     similar reasoning may be found in sir dudley norths discourses upon trade      pp   –   see also child new

england interest in the fable was largely concerning its moral and psychological aspects in france this was also true the french too showed a specific interest in mandevilles defence of luxury which although it awoke attention also in england did so there to a greater extent because of its moral implications french concern with the defence of luxury is partly explained by the fact that this was bound up with the evaluation of primitive society which had attracted french speculation from the sixteenth century to rousseau how was it that a work so celebrated and influential as the fable and possessed of such extraordinary literary merit should have passed into the eclipse which it has suffered in the first place because mandevilles opinions in many cases became familiar and the public studied them in the form in which they prevailed—in adam smith in helvétius in bentham in the second place mandevilles fame had been a succès de scandale generations had been trained to think of him as a sort of philosophical antichrist and scandal was the normal association with the fable after a while the scandal became stale when that happened mandevilles renown passed for at that date in the public mind nothing impelling to interest besides the now dead scandal was sufficiently associated with mandeville to preserve him a succès de scandale is never permanent sooner or later if the author is to live his fame must be built afresh on other grounds   according to the elwin and courthope edition the following passages were derived from mandeville moral essays iii   –   and   –  essay on

those from the moral essays seem to derive definitely from the fable i believe that further study would show additlonal indebtedness of pope to mandeville   see works ed elwin and courthope ii     n     boswell life ed hill iii       see below i cxxxviii n     johnson develops in a manner much like mandevilles the theme that the qualities requisite to conversation are very exactly represented by a bowl of punch the ingredients of which taken separately are either unpleasant or insipid but together are agreeable boswell life ed hill i     suggests that johnson derived the passage from thomas blacklocks on punch an epigram blacklock poems on several occasions ed      p       life is a bumper filld by fate …   where strong insipid sharp and sweet   each other duly tempring meet …   what harm in drinking can there be   since punch and life so well agree but it seems more likely that johnson was thinking of the fable which he knew thoroughly see below i cxxxviii n   and which bears a closer resemblance to the passage in the idler than does blacklocks epigram—it is of course possible that blacklock also was indebted to mandeville   derivations from mandeville in these three works

his conscious lovers iii i steele satirized this attitude as if it were of general currency to love is a passion tis a desire and we must have no desires   although the general thought of the day identified virtue with conduct in accord with reason reasons was usually an illdefined and contradictorily employed term the ethical rationalism of the period implied first that the organization of the universe was a geometrically rational one and that therefore moral laws were the immutable and eternal affairs whose disconnexion with the facts of human nature fielding was later to ridicule in tom jones to such a conception the tastes and emotions in which men differed from one another were either irritating or negligible and its stress was naturally laid upon the abstract rational relationships which were true alike of all men to this conception therefore reason tended to imply an antithesis to taste and individual impulse secondly contemporary ethical rationalism insisted that acts were virtuous only if their motivation was from reason it is at this point—the phase of rationalistic ethics of chief importance in relation to mandeville—that current philosophy was most inchoate no real attempt was usually made to define motivation by reason reason sometimes implied any practical action sometimes a proper blend of deliberation and impulse and very often indeed it was used as mandeville used it in connexion with acts the decision to perform which was not determined by emotion or personal bias which might however provided they did not determine the will to act legitimately accompany the action again and again it is manifest upon analysis that action according to reason is thought of even by thinkers who sometimes take a different position as action done despite the insistence of natural impulse and selfregarding bias in spite of ones animal nature sometimes the writer makes this antithesis comparatively obvious as when culverwel reasons yet grant that the several multitudes all the species of these irrational creatures animals were all without spot or blemish in … their sensitive conversation can any therefore fancy that they dress themselves by the glass of a moral law is it not rather a faithfulness to their own natural inclinations … a law is founded in intellectuals in the reason not in the sensitive principle of the light of nature ed brown      p    the antithesis between reason and natural impulse is very sharp and explicit in richard price who summed up the principles of the intellectualist school of which he was a belated member in the statement that instinctive benevolence is no principle of virtue nor are any actions flowing merely from it virtuous as far as this influences so far something else than reason and goodness influence and so much i think is to be subtracted from the moral worth of any action or character review of the principal questions … in morals ed      p     there were certain characteristics of the ethical rationalism of the day which explain and illustrate the tendency to dissociate reason and feeling in the first place rationalism was from one aspect transcendental with its stress on immutable and eternal laws of right and wrong and its love of the formulable it was largely an attempt to transcend the merely relative and hence personal and individual emotions like the theological asceticism of its day see above p cxxi it was a method of transcending concrete human nature secondly it could hardly help being affected by this current theological asceticism and its condemnation of natural impulse especially since so many rationalists were also theologians the tendency to identify the theological and the rationalistic attitudes is evidenced in the prayer with which thomas burnet closed the second book of his theory of the earth may we in the mean time by a true love of god above all things and a contempt of this vain world which passeth away by a careful use of the gifts of god and nature the light of reason and revelation prepare our selves … for the great coming of our saviour note the paralleling of a contempt of this vain world with the light of reason in the third place because of the problem of the soul a sharp distinction was drawn between man and the animals the belief that animals have no soul rational principle combined with the conviction that the soul is the ultimately important thing tended naturally to cause contempt for the animal functions and a belief that they could form no ingredient in virtue berkeley illustrated this tendency when in his reply to mandeville alciphron he said … considered in that light as he is an animal he man hath no sense of duty no notion of virtue works ed fraser   0  ii    there was too a famous pauline passage—rom vii   – —which could be construed as implying an antithesis between reason and emotion an interpretation made for instance by toland christianity not mysterious  nd ed      pp   –  finally to cause too sharp an antithesis between the conceptions of reason and feeling there was the allimportant fact of mental and literary inexactness of failure to make and maintain proper distinctions since mandevilles day philosophical speculation to some extent perhaps on his account see below i cxxviii n   has become more precise as regards the distinction between reason and feeling but in his time it was a commonplace for a writer to fall into assertions or implications of a necessary antithesis between reason and impulse even in the face of speculations in the same work maintaining an opposite position from the above it may be seen that even though the position taken by mandeville that no conduct can be virtuous unless the will to perform it was undetermined by natural impulse and selfishness may have been somewhat more extreme than the average yet it is evident that his position was none the less in accord with a great body of contemporary theory and indeed this close relation to his age is demonstrated by the violence of the popular reaction to his book   i say rational advisedly many of mandevilles attackers simply misunderstood him they took his terms quite literally interpreting vice as something contrary to the welfare of the individual practising it from this they proved by rule demonstrative that vice must therefore be injurious to society the sum of individuals but of course mandeville meant by vice not something harrnful to its devotees but something contrary to the dictates of a rigorously ascetic morality john dennis is a good example of the literalminded whose attack on the fable was largely an excited attempt to prove that if a thing has a bad effect it has an effect which is bad and then besides the logomachy arising from a too literal reading of the fable much of the controversy was mere vituperation as in hendleys defence of the charityschools wherein the many false scandalous and malicious objections of those advocates for ignorance and irreligion the author of the fable of the bees … are … answerd        notably hutcheson inquiry into … beauty and virtue but hutchesons attempt to prove the fundamental benevolence of humanity is not entirely an attack on mandevilles psychological analysis it is largely a giving of different names to the same emotions hutcheson like mandeville denied the possibility of entirely dispassionate action and mandeville like hutcheson admitted the reality of the compassionate impulses mandeville however insisted on terming all natural emotions selfish whereas hutcheson defined some of them as altruistic as to the effects of distinguishing between selfish and unselfish natural impulse see below i cxxviii n     that is if he did not indulge merely in vituperation or in the misunderstanding considered above i cxxvii n     see his serious call to a devout and holy life published      passim   concerning my necessarily somewhat loose use of this term see above i xlviii n     remarks upon … the fable of the bees      p      examples of rigoristic critics thus forced to qualify their position include law dennis fiddes general treatise of morality      bluet enquiry whether … virtue tends to … benefit … of a people—digests of whose replies to mandeville will be found below ii  0 –  —and warburton works ed      i     in divine legation bk   §   pt     of course there were ways for the rigorists to evade mandevilles attack their very inconsistencies were a means of defence and mandeville too really had taken a rigoristic position more accentuated and bald than the average but the devices by which the rigorists sought to defend themselves without shifting ground were a very incomplete defence thus they argued that there was such a thing as morally neutral activity and that therefore selfregarding action and natural impulse while not sufficient by themselves for virtue were not necessarily vicious this destroyed mandevilles demonstration that the rigoristic position implied everything to be necessarily vicious but it left him able still to claim that nothing could be virtuous moral neutrality being then the utter limit of moral achievement this of course was hardly satisfactory to the rigorists similarly the ascetics could and did argue that they did not deny the moral value of natural impulse nor quite condemn selfishness—indeed that properly understood mans real nature and greatest happiness are found only in obeying the a priori dictates of heaven and that therefore enlightened selfishness demands adherence to the rigoristic code not to notice the important shift of sense in the word nature it is enough to point out that the partial utilitarianism here adopted is definitely an approach to more empirical utilitarianism and therefore that here again mandevilles pressure towards utilitarianism is only partially evaded again the rigorists might deny like nonrigorists such as adam smith that all natural feeling was selfish maintaining that some compassionate emotions were genuinely altruistic but since they could not say this of all compassionate feeling some of this being obviously a selfindulgence they had to find a criterion to distinguish between selfish and nonselfish compassionate emotion and the strictly rigoristic test being here not possible a utilitarian criterion naturally forced itself upon them—and waiving the efficacy of their replies to mandeville the very fact that they had to frame replies on profoundly significant ethical questions was itself a service to the progress of speculation one may look long in premandevillian literature for such careful distinctions between reason and emotion and their respective virtuousness as law for example is forced to make in his effort to show that mandeville misunderstood the rigoristic position whether he misunderstood it or not he helped to force its adherents to attempt a liberation of their creed from the contradictions and indefiniteness which by themselves had given enough ground for his satire and apart from the sheerly logical side of the matter there was a psychological reason why the attempt to cope with mandeville so weakened the power of the rigorists rigorism affirms its transcendence it professes absoluteness when therefore imperfection in a rigoristic creed is sufficiently felt to induce a desire for modification the impulsion to rigorism—a craving for the absoluteness and perfection which the creed promised—is weakened at its source for the creed is now seen to be somewhat a thing of uncertainty   cf hume philosophical works ed green and grose     –  iv     hume is not here referring specifically to the fable but speaking generally   see below ii     n   and       this is conjectural but somewhat substantiated by the fact that hume specifically mentioned the paradox of the fable and answered it like hutcheson and brown by appeal to a utilitarian criterion philosophical works ed green and grose     –  iii  0    for instance in law remarks §   berkeley works ed fraser   0  iil    and   –  brown essays second essay §   adam smith theory of moral sentiments ed      p     and fiddes general treatise of morality preface   in ways less demonstrable than those just mentioned mandeville might also have been a factor in the spread of utilitarianism one of the practical difficulties in securing general acceptance of the utilitarian philosophy that men act for happiness and that this fact is its own justification arises from the fear that belief in such an ethics will lead to a breakdown of ethical sanctions such that men will feel justified in acting from completely selfish motives and society be ruined before the utilitarian point of view can gain popular adherence therefore some argument must be found to show that it will not lead to this unsocial action such an argument was given us by aristotle when he contended that a mans personal good and the good of the state are identical nic ethics   ii   and by eighteenthcentury utilitarians like hutcheson and hume when they invoked mans benevolence and sympathy to show that he can only be happy if he acts socially now in mandevilles philosophy there was latent an effective answer to the fear that utilitarianism would foster selfish and unsocial action this answer was mandevilles famous philosophy of individualism—his argument that selfservice by the nature of things means public service through this philosophy the utilitarians could reassure themselves and the public since mandevilles position was both so celebrated and as the history of economics proves so in harmony with the times it may well have furnished important preparation for the acceptance of utilitarianism mandeville might also to some extent have exerted a more direct influence than i have noticed for he himself several times took the utilitarian position and it underlies his thought see above i lviii–lxi   see fable i    –

treating the question of indebtedness therefore it would be well to consider whether melon would probably have been familiar with the fable we may i think assume that he was from      leading french periodicals had been discussing the fable—especially as regards the problem of luxury it is highly improbable that melon engaged in looking up data for his book should not have read either some of the reviews in the magazines or the celebrated fable itself melon discusses the problem of luxury in the chapter du luxe of his essai politique sur le commerce      it may be said that he offers no basal arguments that are not in the fable and omits no essential ones that are in the fable his moral and psychological groundwork is like mandevilles man he says is not governed by religion but … ce sont les passions qui conduisent  le législateur ne doit chercher quà les mettre à profit pour la société essai politique ed      p  0  for thus setting the passions to work luxury melon continues is a great stimulus this is good mandeville of course melon even shows the mandevillian paradox that vice is virtue—that there are two valid conflicting codes of conduct … les hommes se conduisent rarement par la religion cest à elle à tâcher de détruire le luxe  cest à letat à le tourner à son profit … essai p     mandevilles insistence on the relativity of luxury and on the question being largely one

se regarde comme grossier par rapport à lhabitant de la capitale plus grossier encore devant le courtisan essai p  0  and cf p     again … le pain blanc  les draps fins établis par m colbert seroient

does not enervate a people and his reasons are mandevilles he urges that luxury cannot enervate because it is necessarily limited to a small proportion of the population essai p   0 and fable i    – 0 his argument that luxury tends to diminish drunkenness essai p     is adumbrated in fable i     but most significant of all is his closeness to mandeville in the following contention dans quel sens peuton dire que le luxe amollit une nation cela ne peut pas regarder le militaire les soldats  les officiers subalternes en sont bien éloignés  ce nest pas par la magnificence des officiers généraux quune armée a été battue essai pp  0 –  with this compare fable i    –   the hardships and fatigues of war that are personally sufferd fall upon them that bear the brunt of every thing the meanest indigent part of the nation … and those … will … make good soldiers who where good orders are kept have seldom so much plenty and superfluity come to their share as to do them any … the other inferior officers … can spare but little money for debauches … and strong sinews and supple joints are trifling advantages not regarded in generals … so their heads be but active and well furnished tis no great matter what the rest of their bodies are i   0 finally coming to more purely economic arguments melon like mandeville argues that the ruin of the individual by luxury is no harm to the state essai p     and fable i  0 –  and    – 0 and that foolish extravagance has the merit of making money circulate essai p     and fable passim some of the reasoning which melon shares with mandeville he shares also with other predecessors see above i xciv n   melons friend montesquieu especially in the lettres persanes letter  0  parallels both mandevilles and melons defence of luxury by urging its inevitability in great states its not enervating a people and its necessity to prosperous trade and the circulation of money but melon is throughout much closer to mandeville than to montesquieu particularly in illustrative detail and in certain arguments—for example the suspiciously close parallel to mandeville concerning luxury and armies—melon seems to have been anticipated by mandeville alone now it is possible that melon made up this duplicate of mandevilles opinions from his own invention and the scattered hints of other predecessors but it is a more plausible hypothesis that he drew his views largely from the fable   both the lettres persanes letter  0  and the esprit des lois bk   show strong resemblances to mandevilles arguments and in addition montesquieu twice cited mandeville on luxury to express agreement with him see below ii   0 and     whether montesquieu received from mandeville any basal influence or merely drew from him some supplementary insight into the problem of luxury we cannot however determine since among other things we do not know whether montesquieus knowledge of the fable antedated the formation of his own opinions on luxury it is probable however that montesquieu did not read the fable until his opinions were pretty well formed for the fable was not well known till     —two years after the publication of the lettres persanes   dr johnsons opinions about luxury were apparently drawn largely from the fable mandevillian passages abound see works      xi     boswell life ed hill      ii    – 0    –   cf fable i     sqq iii   –

admitted his debt life iii     he as usual defended luxury you cannot spend money in luxury without doing good to the poor … miss seward asked if this was not mandevilles doctrine of private vices publick benefits and johnson responded with a brilliant criticism of the fable the statement that he read the book forty or fifty years ago and the acknowledgement that it opened my views into real life very much   for the colleges approval see pluquet traité philosophique et politique sur le luxe      ii  0  pluquets statement concerning mandevilles priority traité i    is not quite accurate saintévremond for instance had preceded mandeville in defending luxury see above i xciv–xcviii however the very error shows how closely mandeville had become identified popularly with the defence of luxury   tyler the contrast     ii   see above i ci–ciii   cf wealth of nations ed cannan i xxxvi–xli smith strongly praised hutcheson see theory of moral sentiments pt   §   ch     see below ii     n     in his theory of moral sentiments although he strongly praised hutcheson ed      pp     and  0  smith differed from him both in his calculation of the proportion benevolence holds in human nature and in his estimate of the effect of benevolence in actual life cf pt   §   ch   selfishness is much more prominent in our motives than altruism said smith every man … is much more deeply interested in whatever immediately concerns himself than in what concerns any other man and to hear perhaps of the death of another person with whom we have no particular connexion will give us less concern … than a very insignificant disaster which has befallen ourselves p     so much is society based upon selfishness that it may subsist among different men as among different merchants from a sense of its utility without any mutual love or affection … p     in the wealth of nations smiths difference from hutcheson is more apparent in this book smith frankly assumed the selfishness of mankind and made this assumption a basis of his speculation elaborating as it were the sentence from his theory of moral sentiments quoted at the close of the preceding paragraph from the above it will be seen that what references hutcheson might have made to the fable would have been received by the pupil in an attitude somewhat more favourable to mandeville than the lecturer wished and indeed a study of smiths ethical system will show an outlook more in harmony with the conceptions of the fable than at first appears it is true that smith labelled mandevilles opinions as in almost every respect erroneous p     but this we shall see was largely a gesture of respectability the formality of which is indicated by the fact that immediately afterwards smith scaled down his disagreement with mandeville mostly to a matter of terminology in smiths system the central and motivating ethical force is the affection of sympathy analysing this sympathy into its elements smith wrote as we have no immediate experience of what other men feel we can form no idea of the manner in which they are affected but by conceiving what we ourselves should feel in the like situation though our brother is upon the rack as long as we are at our ease our senses will never inform us of what he suffers they never did and never can carry us beyond our own persons and it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations neither can that faculty help us to this any other way than by representing to us what would be our own if we were in his case p   this is not very far from fable i    for further illustration of the manner in which smith reduced sympathy to egoistic components see pt   §   ch    and cf pp  0–     –  and     it must however be admitted that smith argued in spite of his own analysis that sympathy need not be selfish see pp    and    –  but these arguments do not bulk large in his work and to me at least have a flavour of disingenuousness of playing safe in this analysis i have not of course meant to imply that smith owed his doctrine of sympathy in any way to mandeville nor has it been my primary purpose to establish a very close resemblance between this doctrine and mandevilles opinions my purpose has been merely to show that whatever hutcheson might have retailed of mandevllle to attack him would have found in smith a mind far from prepared to reject the fable   condillacs essai sur lorigine des connoissances humaines appeared in      while the fable was at the height of its french vogue and a few years after it had achieved a french translation what makes me suspect indebtedness by condillac for that part of the essai pt   §   ch   where the origin of language is treated is that he agrees so closely with mandevilles very unusual discussion most of the analysis in the essai barring its systematic exposition and its appeal to what psychologists call association being in the fable—the ability of primitive men to communicate without language by means of cries and gestures aided by sympathy essai in œuvres ed      i    –  and fable ii    –  their inability at first to use language because of their stupidity and the stiffness of their tongues œuvres i     and     and fable ii    –  the slowness and the accidental nature of the development of language œuvres i    –  and fable ii     the use forcefulness and persistence of gesture œuvres i    – 0 and fable ii    – 0 even for such a detail as condillacs remark œuvres i     that gesture because of its very usefulness as a means of intercourse was a hindrance to the growth of language there is a hint in the fable ii    –  but the most significant resemblance between the essai and the fable is in a point which both books make central—that children because of the superior flexibility of their tongues were largely the creators of new words œuvres i    –  and fable ii     herders celebrated abhandlung über den ursprung der sprache which in    0 won the prize offered by the königliche akademie der wissenschaften of berlin does not show the specific parallels to the fable which condillacs inquiry offers it agrees with the fable merely in its general attitude taking the still unorthodox naturalistic view of the origin of language for this attitude herder need of course have owed mandeville nothing if herders inspiration was derivative he might have drawn it for instance from condillac whom he cited and criticized yet it is worth some notice that herder specifically referred to the fable in      sämmtliche werke ed suphan i   –  and reviewed it at length in adrastea in   0  see below ii       the indebtedness of helvétius to mandeville has been assumed by a number of historians and the sorbonnes famous condemnation of helvétiuss de lesprit in      the year after its publication detailed passages from the fable as among the sources of helvétiuss doctrines see below ii     it is true that helvétius is often very close to mandeville—in his belief for instance that the passions are the mainspring of our actions de lesprit amsterdam and leipsic arkstee  merkus      i    –      sqq ii   – 0 and passim de lhomme london      i   –  in his discussion of luxury de lesprit i       –      and passim de lhomme §   ch  –  in his psychologizing of courage de lesprit discours   ch    in his stress on the egoism of man and corollary analyses of compassion and of pride de lesprit i   – 0 and     de lhomme ii   –      and     and in his attack on shaftesbury de lhomme ii  0–   on the other hand in so far as these opinions were derivative they need not have come from mandeville they had been expressed by other writers such as bayle hobbes spinoza la rochefoucauld and melon see above i lxxviii–xcviii and cxxxvi n   the chances to be sure are decidedly that the freethinker helvétius had like his friends read the famous freethinking fable but on the other hand he nowhere in de lesprit and de lhomme cited mandeville this last point however may in turn be somewhat discounted for helvétius was not conscientious about confessing his sources thus in de lhomme in the very short ch    of §   he has without indication paraphrased hobbes at the opening human nature dedication and borrowed from hume on miracles in his first footnote i note three passages where helvétius is rather close to mandeville in illustrative detail the least close of these is in de lesprit i    –  where helvétius illustrates the force of avarice and pride by showing them sending merchants over seas and mountains and stimulating effort in various lands cf fable i    –  for a really close parallel compare fable ii    and de lesprit ii     le courage est donc rarement fondé sur un vrai mépris de la mort aussi lhomme intrépide lépée à la main sera souvent poltron au combat du pistolet transportez sur un vaisseau le soldat qui brave la mort dans le combat il ne la verra quavec horreur dans la tempête parce quil ne la voit réellement que là helvétius however might equally well have drawn this passage from la rochefoucauld or aristotle see below ii    n   finally helvétius wrote as follows while treating of compassion on écrase sans pitié une mouche une araignée un insecte  lon ne voit pas sans peine égorger un bœuf pourquoi cest que dans un grand animal leffusion du sang les convulsions de la souffrance rappellent à la mémoire un sentiment de douleur que ny rappelle point lécrasement dun insecte de lhomme §   notes n   this is certainly close to fable i    –  and   0–  from the evidence just given i think we may conclude no more than that helvétius had probably read the fable that if he had read it he probably owed it at least a little and that he might have owed it much   as the grain of salt with which my conclusions in this chapter are to be taken it will be well to recall certain limitations to which the influence of books is subject they are but one means of affecting thought and when influential are rather the immediate than the effective causes of change if furthermore in a genuine historical synthesis books as a whole are but one source of influence and that often a minor one single writings of course are of still less import the most celebrated and dynamic composition must enter into streams of consciousness—and of unconsciousness—coloured and determined not only by natural bias by social status and by the great historical and economic facts but by hundreds and thousands of other books the power of a book is hardly more than that of one vote in a great parliament a power which can bulk large in full synthesis only through an alinement of forces—an alinement not determined by it—which enables it to be a deciding vote when therefore we estimate the influence of a book we should always join the qualification—in so far as books have influence such a relative estimate of mandevilles influence is all i have pretended to give and measured against the dimensions to which such influence through books may attain my conclusions as to the importance of the fable are i think justified a above eight about fifteen     this was wrote in     b b footnote add      see above i

and  0  œuvres ed gilbert and gourdault it is very important however to note that mandeville did not really believe that virtue was invented on particular occasions he was at pains several times to qualify the false impression created by his enquiry into the origin of moral virtue thus in the origin of honour      he wrote hor but how are you sure that this was the work of moralists and politicians as you seem to insinuate cleo mandevilles spokesman i give those names promiscuously to all that having studied human nature have endeavourd to civilize men and render them more and more

to fable ii         you of politeness that they are the joint labour of many human wisdom is the child of time it was not the contrivance of one man nor could it have been the business of a few years to establish a notion by which a rational creature is kept in awe for fear of it self and an idol is set up that shall be its own worshiper pp  0–  mandevilles repeated insistence on the fact that civilization is the result not of sudden invention but of a very slow evolution based on mans actual nature is discussed above i lxiv–lxvi a stood … way were so obnoxious to them         in support of his contention that virtue must always mean selfdenial mandeville in the preface to his origin of honour      furnished an analysis of the origin of ethics concluding upon due consideration of what has been said it will be easy to imagine how and why soon after fortitude conquest of our fear of death the greatest selfconquest had been honoured with the name of virtue all the other branches of conquest over our selves were dignifyd with the same title we may see in it likewise the reason of what i have always so strenuously insisted upon viz that no practice no action or good quality how useful or beneficial soever they may be in themselves can ever deserve the name of virtue strictly speaking where there is not a palpable selfdenial to be seen pp v–vi later in the origin of honour p     he argued it is certain that christianity being once stript of the severity of its discipline and its most essential precepts the design of it may be so skilfully perverted from its real and original scope as to be made subservient to any worldly end or purpose a politician can have occasion for for the paradoxical relation of the ascetic element of mandevilles conception of virtue to his ethical philosophy as a whole see the discussion above i xlvii–lvi cf also below n     rationalism of one aspect or another in seventeenth and eighteenthcentury ethics was it is almost unnecessary to note very marked whether in a writer such as culverwel who states of the light of nature ed brown      p    that the law of nature is built upon reason or in a more systematic thinker like the intellectualist samuel clarke who argues works ed      ii  0–  from this first original and literal signification of the words flesh and spirit the same terms have by a very easy and natural figure of speech been extended to signify all vice and all virtue in general as having their root and foundation one in the prevailing of different passions and desires over the dictates of reason and the other in the dominion of reason and religion over all the irregularities of desires and passions every vice and every instance of wickedness of whatever kind it be has its foundation in some unreasonable appetite or ungoverned passion warring against the law of the mind and again—all religion or virtue consists in the love of truth and in the free choice and practice of right and in being influenced regularly by rational and moral motives sermons ed      i     even so empirical a thinker as locke holds in contradiction to his main philosophy that a complete morality can be derived by the exercise of pure ratiocination from general a priori principles without reference to concrete circumstances and spinoza also who placed so great a stress on the dependence of thought upon feeling nevertheless attempts to demonstrate his ethics ordine geometrico   several things of importance should be noted in regard to this definition a definition on which mandevilles whole speculation turns in the first place his insistence that virtue always implies contradiction of our nature and his demand that virtue be rational come to the same thing a rational act meant to mandeville one not at all dictated by the emotions consequently rational conduct was ex hypothesi action contrary to the impulse of nature in the second place not only was the general rationalistic aspect of his definition a reflection of contemporary thought see above n i but the extreme ascetic rigorism of his definition and his identification of reason with dispassionateness were also largely an emphasized presentment of fundamental and popular conceptions of his day i have considered these facts at some length above i cxxi n   and cxxii n   a nor      cf pliny naturalis historia ed mayhoff xix     0  mandeville alludes again to

recognizing it as a commodity they considered it the most valuable commodity naturally therefore they attempted to control trade so as to concentrate the maximum amount of money in their own country though they might approve of exportations they frowned upon importations for they thought payment for such importations took money out of the country thus impoverishing it their ideal consequently was a balance of trade such that exports should always exceed imports meanwhile however as englands importing business grew apologists naturally arose to defend it they did this though in terms of current opinion thus sir thomas mun pleaded that although money is really a countrys best wealth this fact is no argument against importing commodities for such trade in spite of first appearances will not draw money out of the country but attract it mun englands treasure by forraign trade passim and the very able considerations on the eastindia trade   0  stated freetrade the way to increase our money see select collection of early english tracts on commerce ed political economy club      p     marginal note and when contemporary economists urged that certain importations be encouraged they were not usually abandoning the balance of trade conception but believed merely that in the case involved there were special reasons why receiving goods from the country in question would in the long run lead to a favourable balance of trade see below i     n   from this it may be seen that when mandeville stated that imports should never exceed exports below i     and when he approved of turkey being made a favoured nation and warned against trade with nations who insist on being paid only in money he was following orthodox example but he had a more than customary appreciation of the interdependence of national interests and he wished to control the balance of trade not by limiting imports but by a stimulation of both exports and imports—for further consideration of mandevilles

balance of trade would result from making turkey a favoured nation cf above i  0  n i neither does the record of contemporary thought show these laws as signifying any real acceptance of the principle
