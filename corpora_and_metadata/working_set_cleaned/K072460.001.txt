murray fleet street j sewell cornhill and w creech edinburgh  mdcclxxxviii  advertisement this work upon its first appearance in the english language having met with the most favorable reception and been universally approved as one of the properest books that could be put into the hands of children the publisher has been induced to bring forward a second edition of it but in a state considerably improved for besides the insertion of many original pieces not to be found in the former edition the present has been corrected throughout with the most scrupulous regard to expression and uniformity and may therefore be looked upon as almost entirely a new translation  preface of the translator though the task of writing to improve the minds of children may be less productive of literary fame than many other studies yet in its real importance and utility it yields to none even of the sublimest speculations to impress the infant mind with a love of decency and virtue to fortify it against the influence of prejudice and corruption and at once to gratify the curiosity and improve the reason is an undertaking which would not disgrace the most enlightened understanding if the eye of the philosopher can be gratified in merely tracing the progress of organized bodies from their earliest periods of existence to perfect maturity how much greater must be the pleasure of considering the successive development of the noblest work of providence the human mind a common eye indeed may view with indifference the sports and agitations of children their joys their griefs their passions and their hopes may appear too trivial to engage its attention not so the man whose feeling renders him alive to all the interests of the species whose penetration enables him to foresee the mighty revolutions which may be produced by the virtues or vices of an individual it was thus the philosophic eye remarked in the youthful alexander that vast ambition which was to ravage the globe and change the fate of nations it was thus that popedius silo discovered in the infant cato that stubborn and inflexible virtue which so long opposed the tide of caesars fortune and supported the dying liberties of rome  but if the simple consideration of future greatness or distinguished virtue be thus agreeable to a cultivated mind how much more interesting must be the spectacle when we consider ourselves as constituting no trifling part of the future drama in this light may every man justly consider himself who devotes his talents and his assiduity to the service of the rising generation how truly noble are those exertions which are thus directed to the service of human nature in the discharge of the most important though last attractive duties and which neglecting fame can offer up ambition itself a voluntary sacrifice to the interest of posterity  the author of the present work may deservedly rank among the foremost of this deserving class his merit as a writer is so well established upon the continent and even in our own country that it is almost superfluous to say any thing upon the subject his easy and elegant pen seems to be particularly adapted to describe nature in its most beautiful forms the lively passions the volatile tastes the glowing colors and the sportive graces of blooming infancy are all at his command but here for once the copy may be allowed to exceed the original his elegant pencil seems to have given a consistency and permanency which nature had denied under such a master nothing is cold or inanimate the very caprices and levities of infancy become interesting scenes which gradually warm the heart and captivate the attention the lighter and more sportive parts of his work exhibit all the opening graces of the young thalia while melpomene herself blushes with astonishment to find the variable passions and shortlived distresses of an infant theater so nearly resemble her own  we flatter ourselves therefore that we shall offer to unacceptable present to the public in giving a complete translation of all the works of the admired m berquin as to the accuracy of the translation it becomes us to be silent nor do we pretend to any higher merit than that of being faithful imitators of a great original it will be a sufficient reward for all our labors if they tend to naturalize so excellent a work in our own country and if we can flatter ourselves with having thus contributed to form the hearts and improve the understandings of the rising generation  dec        the authors preface the following work has a double object in view to amuse children and at the same time to incline them naturally to virtue by always presenting it to them under the most amiable form instead of those extravagant fictions those romantic and mavelous tales which have so long contributed to lead the imaginations of children astray we here exhibit to them only such adventures as they may be witnesses to in private life every day the sentiments with which the author endeavors to inspire them are not above their capacities and he represents them accompanied only by their equals their parents their playfellows the servants who are always about them and the animals familiar to their view they express themselves in their own native simplicity of language and in proportion as they are affected by the incidents described they indulge the free movement of their little passions their punishments are made the consequences of their own proper faults and their rewards consist in the pleasure which they derive from their good actions every thing here disposes them to love virtue for the sake of their own happiness and to deter them from vice as from a source of sorrows and mortification  it is perhaps needless to remark that this work is equally calculated for children of either sex the difference of their tastes and characters is not yet at their age sufficiently strong to require to be differently delineated besides care has been taken to bring children of both sexes together as often as possible in order to produce that union and intimacy which we are so pleased to see subsist between brothers and sisters  the author has endeavored to introduce a variety in the different pieces which compose each volume there is not one of them the effect of which has not previously been tried on children more or less advanced in age and understanding and every thing has been retrenched that did not seem sufficiently to interest their feelings each volume of this work will contain little dramas in which children are the principal characters in order that they may early learn to acquire a free unembarrassed countenance a gracefulness of attitude and deportment and an easy manner of delivering themselves before company besides the performance of these dramas will be a domestic recreation and amusement the parents having always some part to perform in them will taste the pleasing delight of partaking in the diversions of their young family and from the gratitude of the latter and the satisfaction of the parent both will be mutually attached to each other by a bond of additional tenderness  independent of the moral utility of this work with respect to children it is obvious that there cannot be a more proper one to instruct them early in delivering their native language with ease and propriety the greater part of those books which are first put into their hands are either above their comprehension or totally remote from their ideas and sentiments all the objects on the contrary here held up to their view being of a nature sufficiently interesting to excite their curiosity they will of course take pleasure in the easy study of a work which may render them familiar to the innocent turn of thought and expression adapted to their age and applied to describe their amusements their pursuits and their necessities  contents of the first volume the little brother page

from i as well as from the works of messrs camp and salemann will be introduced in the following performance  the little brother fanny arose one morning very early intending to go and gather some flowers in the garden and to make a nosegay of them to carry to her mama who was then in bed as she was just preparing to go down stairs mr glassford her father entered her chamber smiling and took her up in his arms saying good morning my dear fanny come along with me directly i am going to show you something which you will certainly be very glad to see fanny eagerly asked what is it papa god has given you a little brother last night answered he a little brother ah where is he let me see him pray carry me to him directly her father opened the door of the chamber in which her mother lay there was beside the bed a strange woman whom fanny had never before seen in the house and who was wrapping up the newborn infant in its swathes fanny asked a thousand questions to which her father answered as well as he was able and thought he had satisfied her curiosity in every thing when she said to him papa who is that old woman how she binds my little brother up are not you afraid that she will hurt him  mr g oh no never fear it is an honest woman that i have sent for to take care of him   fanny but he belongs to mama has she seen him yet   mrs g drawing back the curtain of her bed yes fanny i have seen him tell me are not you glad to see him   fanny oh indeed i am mama you have given me a very pretty young companion what a cunning little face he has and all red as if he had just been running papa will you let him play with me   mr g that is not possible my dear he cannot stand upon his little legs you see how weak they are   fanny oh dear the little legs i see it will be a long time before we shall run about together   mr g all in good time he must first learn to walk and then you will soon be able to play and jump together in the garden   fanny shall we o my poor little fellow i must give you something to make you fond of me hold i have a little picture in my pocket there take that what is the matter papa the little monkey will not have it he holds his little fists shut   mr g he does not know how to use them yet we must wait a few months   fanny is that the case aha my little man i will give you all my playthings well are you glad of that answer me he seems to smile call me fanny what wont you speak   mr g he will not be able to speak these two years but fanny take care that you do not disturb your mama with too much talk   fanny ah papa look there his face is quite changed see he cries certainly it is because he is hungry be quiet then my little man and i will go get you something nice   mr g do not trouble yourself my dear about his victuals he has no teeth yet how should he be able to eat   fanny cannot he eat what will he live upon then must he die   mrs g no my child god has given me milk in my breast for the nourishment of thy little brother he is very weak as yet but after some time you shall see how he will tumble about on the floor like a little lamb   fanny how i long to see that but only look what a pretty tiny head i dare not touch it   mr g you may touch it but very gently   fanny oh quite gently oh dear how soft it is like a ball of cotton   mr g every little child has such a head as your brother   fanny if he was to fall he would break it all to pieces   mrs g certainly but we will take good care to hold him so that he shall not fall   mr g do you know fanny that five years ago you were as little as he   fanny as little as he oh papa you are joking   mr g no my dear nothing is more true   fanny yet i do not remember it   mr g that i believe do you remember when i had this carpet put on the floor   fanny why it has always been as it is now   mr g not at all i had this carpet laid down at the very time when you were as little as your brother   fanny indeed then i never took notice of it   mr g little babies never take notice of what passes where the are when your brother shall be as old as you ask him if he remembers that you tried this day to make him learn to pronounce your name you will then see if he recollects it   fanny what and did i suck at mamas breast too   mr g certainly if you knew all the pains that she has taken for you in the first place you were so weak that you could scarce take any nourishment we were afraid every moment that you would die before our faces your mother used to say my poor infant if she should fall into a fit and believe me she took infinite pains to get you to suck a few drops of milk   fanny ah dear mama it was you then that taught me to feed myself   mr g yes my child then after your mother had succeeded in making you take to the breast of yourself you grew fat and goodhumoured such were her cares for near two years every day and every hour of the day sometimes when your mother was fallen asleep merely through fatigue you would disturb her rest by your cries then would she be obliged to rise and run to your cradle my dear fanny would she say while she endeavored to quiet you surely thou must be thirsty and then she would take you to her breast   fanny and was my head at that time as soft as my brothers   mr g just the same my dear   fanny what mine that is so hard now oh dear i must have broken it a thousand times   mr g ah child we took so much care of you your mother for a time renounced every pleasure and kept from all company on purpose not to lose you a moment from her sight as often as business that was absolutely indispensable obliged her to go out she was in continual apprehension for you my dear grace she would say to your nurse i give fanny into your care to look to her as if it were your own child and she was continually making the good woman presents to induce her to take more particular care of you   fanny ah my dear good mama  but was there ever a time papa when i could not run i that can run so well now see in three or four steps i am across the room who was it that taught me this   mr g thy mother and i we put a bandage of velvet well stuffed about your head that if you happened to fall you might not hurt yourself we then held you by leadingstrings to assist your first attempts in walking and every day we went into the garden upon the grassplat where placing ourselves opposite to each other at a little distance we set you down betwixt us standing all alone and held out our arms to invite you to come sometimes to one sometimes to the other your slightest stumble would make our blood run cold it was by often repeating these trials that we taught you to walk   fanny i could never have thought that i gave you so much trouble was it you too that taught me to speak   mr g yes for that again you are indebted to us i used to take you upon my knees and repeat to you the words papa and mama until you were able to lisp them to me again every word that you can speak this day we taught you in the same manner i dare say you can recollect that it was we also who showed you how to read   fanny oh i remember that perfectly you had me placed every day at dinner between you and at the dessert a plate of raisins was set upon the table and some small squares marked with the letters whenever i was so lucky as to name them perfectly you always gave me some raisins oh it was a very pretty play   mr g if we had not taken all these pains with you if we had left you to yourself what would have become of you   fanny i should have been dead a long time ago ah the dear good papa and mama   mr g and yet you sometimes vex your papa you are sometimes disobedient to mama   fanny i will never be so any more as long as i live i did not know how much you had done for me   mr g take notice of the attention that we shall pay to your little brother and then say to yourself i too have given my parents the same trouble  this conversation made a lively impression upon fanny and when she saw all the tenderness which her mother testified for her little brother all the anxiety that she felt for his health the patience which she exerted in endeavoring to make him take to his nourishment how much she was afflicted whenever she heard him cry with what tender solicitude her father relieved her of some part of her fatigue and how both one and the other took infinite pains in teaching the infant to walk and speak she would say in her own mind my dear parents have taken the same trouble with me this reflection inspired her with so much affection and gratitude toward them that she ever after faithfully observed the promise which she had made never voluntarily to cause them the slightest uneasiness   the four seasons ah if it would always continue to be winter said young florio who was just returned from sliding and was amusing himself in the garden with making men of snow mr gardener his father hearing these words said to him my dear thou will do me a pleasure to write down that wish on my tablets florio complied and wrote while his hand trembled with cold the winter passed away and spring succeeded florio was walking along with his father beside a border in the garden where the hyacinth auricula and narcissus were in perfect bloom he felt the most lively pleasure in breathing their perfume and admiring their fresh and vivid colors these are the productions of spring said mr gardener to him they are beautiful but of very short duration oh replied florio that it were always spring be so good as to write that wish in my tablets florio obeyed while his heart beat with joy the spring very soon made room for summer florio one fine day went out to take a walk with his parents and some of his young acquaintance to a neighboring village their walk afforded them a prospect sometimes of green corn fields waving smoothly like a calm sea lightly agitated by the breeze and sometimes of meadows enamelled with a thousand flowers on every side they beheld young lambs at play and the high spirited colts and fillies sporting round their dams they eat cherries strawberries and other fruits of the season and passed the whole day in amusing themselves in the fields do not you think florio said mr gardener as they were returning to town that the summer too has its pleasures oh replied he i wish it would last all the year and at the request of his father he wrote down this wish too on his tablets at length the autumn arrived all the family went to spend a day in the country at harvest time the weather was not quite so hot as in summer the air was mild and the sky clear the gardens and orchards were loaded with fruits the round plump melons from their rich beds diffused a delicious odor and the branches of the peartrees bent under the weight of the finest pears this was a day of feasting for florio who loved nothing so much as grapes melons and peaches and he had the additional pleasure of gathering them himself this fine season said his father to him will soon pass away winter is advancing toward us very fast to deprive us of the autumn ah answered florio i wish it would stop short in its approach and autumn never leave us  mr guard should you be glad of that florio   florio oh very glad papa i promise you  but replied his father taking out his tablets cast your eye a little on what is written here read it out   florio reads ah if it would always continue to be winter   mr guard now let us look a few leaves farther   florio reads oh that it were always spring   mr guard and on the next leaf what do we find   florio reads i wish that the summer would last all the year   mr guard do you recollect whose hand this is   florio it is mine   mr guard and what was your wish but just now   florio that the winter would stop short in its approach and autumn never leave us   mr guard this is something particular in the winter you desired that it might be always winter in the spring that it might always be spring in summer that that season would always continue and now in autumn you wish that it may always be autumn do you reflect what conclusion may be drawn from all this   florio that all the seasons of the year are good   mr guard yes my son they are all blessed with plenteous increase and variety of pleasures and god knows much better how to govern the system of nature than we limited beings as we are if it had depended only on thee last winter we should never have had any more spring nor summer nor autumn thou would have covered the earth with eternal snows and never felt any other pleasure than that of sliding or making men of snow of how many other enjoyments would thou not have been deprived by such a disposition of things we are happy that it is not in our power to regulate the course of nature every thing would be lost which was intended for our happiness if our own rash vows were heard   the snow after many deceitful promises of its return spring at length arrived a gentle breeze warmed the air the snow was seen to melt the fields to resume their verdure and the flowers to bud forth the singing of birds was heard on every side little louisa was already gone out to the country with her father she had heard the first songs of the blackbird and the linnet and she had gathered some of the earliest violets but the weather changed once more there arose suddenly a violent northwind that whistled through the groves and covered the roads with snow little louisa went to bed that night shivering with cold and blessed god for having given her so comfortable a shelter from the inclemency of the air ah what a sight when she arose the next morning every thing was perfectly white there had fallen during the night so great a quantity of snow that it was kneedeep in the roads this made louisa quite dull the little birds appeared still more so the ground being every where covered to a great depth they were not able to find the least grain or worm to appease their hunger all the feathered inhabitants of the grove took refuge in the towns and villages to seek the relief of man numerous flights of sparrows linnets chaffinches and larks alighted in the streets and courtyards of houses and scraped with their claws and bills into every heap of rubbish to find if possible some nourishment there came near fifty of these guests into the yard of the house where louisa was she saw them and returned quite afflicted into her fathers chamber what is the matter my dear said he ah papa answered she there they are all in the yard the poor little birds that sung so cheerfully only two days ago they seem to be quite starved with cold and to ask for something to eat will you let me give them a little corn with the greatest pleasure said her father the barn was on the other side of the way thither she ran accompanied by her governess to get a few handfuls of corn and hemp seed and came immediately back to scatter it in the yard the little birds approached fluttering about her in great numbers and picking up every grain louisa amused herself in looking at them and was quite delighted with the sight she went to ask her papa and mama to come and view them also and to partake of her satisfaction but these handfuls of grain were soon picked up the birds then flew up to the housetop and seemed to eye louisa wistfully as if they would have said have thou nothing more to give us louisa understood their language she flies like lightning to seek more grain in crossing the way she met a little boy who had not a heart quite so compassionate as hers he was carrying in his hand a cage full of birds and was shaking it so carelessly that the poor little creatures were thrown every moment with their heads against the wires this sight gave louisa pain what are you going to do with those birds said she to the little boy i do not know yet answered he i am trying to sell them and if nobody will buy them i shall feast my cat upon them at home your cat replied louisa your cat oh what an illnatured boy as to that they would not be the first that she has munched alive so dangling his cage as before he was setting off at a great pace when louisa called him back and asked how much he would have for his birds i will sell them said he three for a penny and there are eighteen of them well then said louisa they are mine so bidding the little boy to follow her she ran to her papa and asked his permission to purchase those birds her father granted it with pleasure and even gave his daughter an empty room for the reception of her little guests jack that was the name of the illnatured boy went away very well satisfied with his bargain and told all his companions that he knew a little miss who would buy birds in a few hours there came so many little country boys to louisas door that one would have thought it the entrance to a market they all crowded round her climbing upon each other and holding up their cages with both hands each hoping to obtain the preference for his birds louisa purchased all that were brought before her and had them carried into the chamber where the first were night came it was a long time since louisa had gone to bed so well pleased in her mind am not i very happy said she to herself in being able to save the lives of so many innocent creatures and to give them food when summer comes i will go into the fields and groves and all my little guests will sing their sweetest songs to thank me for the care that i have taken of them with this reflection she went to sleep and dreamed that she was in a grove of trees of the finest verdure which were all covered with birds chirping as they fluttered from bough to bough or engaged in seeding their young ones the happy louisa smiled in her sleep she rose very early to go and feed her little friends in the aviary and in the yard but she was not now so happy as she had been the day before she knew how much money she had put into her purse and that there could not remain much of it by this time if this snowy weather should last some few days longer said she what will become of the other birds the wicked little boys will give them alive as they are to their cats and for want of a small sum of money i shall not be able to save them full of these sorrowful ideas she draws her purse out slowly in order to count her little treasure once more but how great is her astonishment to feel her purse heavy she opens it and finds it full of pieces of coin of every sort indiscriminately up to the very strings she runs immediately to her father and relates the incident to him with transports of pleasure and surprise her father took her to his bosom kissed her and shed tears of joy upon the cheeks of louisa my dear child said he thou have never made me so happy as in this moment continue to relieve the little creatures that thou shall see in distress and in proportion as thy purse is diminished thou shall find it filled again what joyful news for louisa she ran immediately to her aviary with her apronfull of hemp seed and corn all the birds came fluttering round her and looked with eager eyes for their breakfast after feeding them she next went down into the yard and bestowed a plentiful meal upon the famished birds that were there she saw herself now engaged in the support of almost an hundred dependents this afforded her such a pleasure her dolls and playthings never had given her half so much in the afternoon as she put her hand into the bag of hemp seed she found a note with these words the inhabitants of the air fly toward thee o lord and thou give them their food thou openest thy hand and fillest all things living with plenteousness her father had followed her she turned to him and said i am now therefore like god the inhabitants of the air fly toward me and when i open my hand i fill them with plenteousness yes my dear said her father every time that thou do good to any creature thou art like god when grown up thou shall assist thy fellow creatures as thou now do the birds and thou shall then resemble god much more ah what happiness for a mortal to be able to act like god during a week louisa continued to extend her bounty and feed every thing that was hungry about her at length the snow melted the fields resumed their verdure and the birds which before had not dared to quit the neighborhood of the houses now turned their flight toward the grove but those that had been put into the aviary remained there confined they saw the sun flew up against the window pecked at the glass but in vain their prison was too strong for them louisa could not as yet imagine what made them so uneasy one day as she was taking them their food her father entered a few moments after her she was very happy to see that he was desirous of being witness to her pleasure my dear louisa said he why do these birds seem so uneasy i should imagine that they want something may not they perhaps have left in the fields companions whom they would now be glad to see again you are right papa they seem to be dull ever since the return of the fine weather i will go and open the window and let them fly away i think thou would not do amiss replied her father thou will diffuse joy through all the country these little prisoners will go to find their friends once more and will fly to meet them as thou do to meet me when i have been absent some time from home before he had finished speaking the windows were all thrown up the birds perceived it and in two minutes there did not remain a single one of them in the room some were seen to skim along the ground others to soar up into the air some to perch upon the neighboring trees and others to fly backwards and forwards before the windows with chirpings of joy louisa went every day to walk in the fields she saw and heard numbers of birds on every side at one time a lark would rise up before her feet and sing its sprightly strain while it mounted to the clouds at another time a linnet perched upon the highest branches of a tree chirped forth its song and whenever she observed any one to distinguish itself by the sweetness of its music louisa would say there is one of my little guests one may know by its voice that it has been well fed last winter  arthur a poor labourer of the name of bernard had six young children and found himself much at a loss to maintain them as an addition to his misfortune the season happened to be unfavorable and consequently bread much dearer than the year before bernard worked day and night yet in spite of his labors could not possibly earn money enough to provide food even of the most indifferent sort for six hungry children he was reduced to extremity calling therefore one day his little family together with tears in his eyes he said to them my dear children bread is risen so dear that with all my labor i am not able to earn sufficient for your subsistence you see how i am circumstanced this piece of bread in my hand must be paid for with the wages of my whole days labor and therefore you must be content to share with me the little that i have been able to earn there certainly will not be sufficient to satisfy you all but at least there will be enough to prevent your perishing with hunger the poor man could say no more he lifted up his eyes to heaven and wept his children wept also and each one said within himself o lord come to our assistance unfortunate infants that we are help our dear father and suffer us not to perish for want bernard divided the bread into seven equal shares he kept one for himself and distributed the rest amongst his children but one of them named arthur refused to take his portion and said i cannot eat any thing father i find myself sick do you take my part or divide it amongst the rest my poor child what is the matter with thee said bernard taking him up in his arms i am sick answered arthur very sick i would go to bed bernard carried him to bed and the next morning overwhelmed with sorrow he went to a physician and besought him for charity to come and see his sick child and to assist him the physician who was a man of great humanity went to bernards house though he was very sure of not being paid for his visits he approached arthurs bed felt his pulse but could not thereby discover any symptom of illness he found him however very weak and in order to raise his spirits was going to prescribe a cordial draught but arthur said do not order any thing for me sir i could take nothing that you should prescribe for me  physician could not take it why not pray   arthur do not ask me sir it is not in my power to tell you   phys what hinders thee child thou seem to me to be an obstinate little boy   arth i assure you doctor it is not from obstinacy   phys it may be so however i shall not press you but i will go and ask the reason from your father who will perhaps not be so mysterious   arth ah i beseech you do not let my father know any thing of it   phys thou art a very unaccountable child but i must certainly acquaint your father with this since you will not confess the truth   arth o dear by no means sir i will rather explain every thing to you myself but first i beg that my brothers and sisters may quit the room  the physician ordered the children to withdraw and then arthur continued alas sir in this hard season my father can scarcely earn us every day a loaf of coarse bread he divides it amongst us each of us can have but a small part and he will hardly take any for himself it makes me unhappy to see my little brothers and sisters suffer hunger i am the eldest and have more strength than they i like better therefore not to eat any that they may divide my share amongst them this is the reason why i pretended that i was sick and could not eat but i entreat you not to let my father know this  the physician wiped his eyes and said but my dear little friend art thou not hungry   arth yes sir i am hungry sure enough but that does not give me so much pain as to see my family suffer   phys but you will soon die if you take no nourishment   arth i am sensible of that but i shall die contented my father will have one mouth less to feed and when i shall be with god i will pray him to give bread to my little brothers and sisters  the humane physician was melted with pity and admiration on hearing the generous child speak thus taking him up in his arms he clasped him to his heart and said no my dear little friend thou shall not die god who is the father of us all will take care of thee and of thy family return him thanks that he has led me hither i shall come back very soon he hastened therefore to his own house and ordering one of his servants to take a quantity of provisions of all sorts returned with him immediately to arthur and his famished little brothers he made them all sit down at table and eat heartily until they were satisfied it was a delightful sight for the good physician to behold the joy of those innocent creatures on his departure he bid arthur not to be under any concern for that he would provide for their necessities which promise he faithfully observed and furnished them every day with a plentiful subsistence other charitable persons also to whom he related the circumstance imitated his generosity some sent them provisions some money and others clothes and linen insomuch that very few days passed before this little family had more of every thing than was sufficient for their wants  as soon as bernards landlord was informed of what the generous little arthur had suffered for his father and his brothers filled with admiration at such nobleness of soul he sent for bernard and addressed him thus you have an admirable son permit me to be his father also i will allow you an annuity out of my own pocket and arthur with all your other children shall be maintained at my expense in whatever professions they shall choose if they make use of this establishment to their own advantage i will charge myself with the care of their fortunes  bernard returned to his house transported with joy and throwing himself on his knees blessed god for having given him so worthy a child   caroline mrs p  a young married lady as much distinguished for the elegant charms of her wit as for the delicacy of her sentiments and the respectability of her character was one day reproving pamela her eldest daughter for a slight fault very pardonable at her age pamela touched with the tender manner in which her mother delivered the reproof shed tears of sorrow and affection caroline who was then but three years old seeing her sister weep climbs up the steps of her chair in order to reach her with one hand she takes her handkerchief and wipes her sisters eyes and with the other slips into her mouth a piece of sweetmeat from her own i think an able painter might make a charming picture on this subject  the little

finished it when i have not begun it   godfrey you have not had time then to do it from twelve oclock till four   charles you shall see now whether that was possible at eleven oclock i could not help taking a turn or two in the garden in order to get an appetite for my dinner we were at table an hour then to sit down and study immediately after ones meals you know how dangerous papas doctor says that is so as i had made a hearty dinner i had occasion for a good deal of exercise to digest it you know   godfrey well now at least you have had exercise enough and before dark there is more time than you want to finish your task   charles you do not consider that just now i must go to my writing   godfrey but since your writingmaster is not come    charles i shall wait for him it would be spoiling every thing to confound my hours of business   godfrey well then after your writing you have still some of the afternoon and the whole evening   charles i shall not have a minute my sister expects the two miss richmonds to come to see her   godfrey it is not on your account that they come   charles no but then i must help my sister to entertain them   godfrey what will hinder you when

go and tell her any thing of this you understand me   scene ii sophia and godfrey sophia well cousin what have you and my brother been conversing about he has certainly been playing you one of his old tricks   godfrey no but he has been making me one of his old requests he wants me as usual to perform his task for him against tomorrow   sophia and is my papa never to be informed of his idleness   godfrey i shall not undertake that office you know that ever since your mamas death my uncles health has been so precarious that the least emotion makes him ill for some days besides his generosity supports me and he might think that i wished to hurt your brother in his esteem   sophia well then i shall talk to my brother the first opportunity  but do you know what i had to say to you the miss richmonds are coming to see me today and you must assist us in our amusements   godfrey oh i shall certainly do my best cousin   sophia ah here they are   scene iii godfrey sophia amelia and charlotte richmond sophia ah how do you do my dear friends  they salute each other and curtsy to godfrey who bows to them   charlotte it seems an age since i saw you last   amelia indeed it is a long time   sophia i believe it is more than three weeks  godfrey draws out the table and gives them chairs   charlotte do not give yourself so much trouble master godfrey   godfrey miss i only do my duty   sophia oh i am very sure godfrey does it with pleasure  gives him her hand i wish my brother had a little of his complaisance   scene iv godfrey sophia amelia charlotte charles charles  without taking notice of the miss richmonds this is very pretty of you godfrey to let me wait so long while you are playing the fine gentleman here   godfrey i thought i should be the last person in the company to whom you would direct your compliments   charles oh do not be angry ladies i shall be at your service presently   amelia oh pray do not hurry yourself mr charles  charles takes godfrey aside and while the young ladies converse together draws a paper from his pocket which he gives him   charles there it is you understand me   godfrey six lines a great task indeed are not you ashamed   charles hist hold your tongue   godfrey ladies if you give me leave i will just step out for a few minutes   charlotte we shall expect your return with impatience   sophia since you are going out cousin pray bid jenny bring us in tea   scene v charles sophia amelia charlotte charles  throwing himself into an armchair soh i shall take possession of this   sophia i think it would have been civil to ask leave   charles your leave perhaps   sophia i am not the only person here   charlotte i see your brother counts us as nothing   amelia he thinks certainly that he does us a great deal of honor in keeping us company   charles oh i know that you could do without my company but i could not so easily deprive myself of yours   sophia there at least is the appearance of a compliment though i believe to say the truth the tea should come in for the greatest part of it   charles you are very right my dear sister in not thinking that i stay at least on your account   sophia oh as to that i have too humble an opinion of my own merit all that i should take pride in is that i am sister to so polite a young gentleman  jenny brings the tea and sets it before sophia   charles let me pour it out pray do   sophia no no that is my business you are a little too awkward if you want to do something hand these ladies their cups   amelia not so much sugar for me   sophia help yourself my dear to your liking  hands her a cup and the sugar basin charles takes a cup for himself and gets hold of the sugar charles you have got three great lumps already   charles why that is not too much i like it pretty sweet  takes several bits one after another till his sister gets the sugar basin out of his hands   sophia are not you ashamed brother you see there will be none left for us   charles well do not you know the way to the sugar canister   sophia my brother would think he had done wrong if he saved his sister any trouble   charles no but if you went for it i should have the pleasure of being alone with these ladies   amelia do you hear that sophia now will you say that your brother is not perfectly polite   sophia  having collected all the cups before her and filled them again charles hand amelia this cup  charles takes the cup and in handing it to amelia spills the tea upon her slip  they all rise hastily   sophia there is an instance of his politeness  aside to charles i dare swear thou illnatured creature that was done on purpose   amelia o dear what will my mama say and what shall we do   charlotte this is only the second time that she has had on this slip make haste a glass of clean water   sophia no i have heard that it is better to rub it with a dry linen cloth here is a handkerchief quite clean  they go to assist amelia charlotte holds her slip and sophia rubs it meantime charles remains at table quite unconcerned drinking his tea   charlotte there it begins to disappear you must let it dry   amelia by good luck it is in a fold where one will not think of looking   charles  aside that is not my fault   sophia there look now charlotte i do not think it will be observed   charlotte if i had not seen the spot before    amelia very true however mr charles another time i shall beg you to spare yourself the trouble of waiting on me   sophia come ladies let us take our places again  going to pour out the tea she finds the teapot empty looks angrily at charles well this is a piece of ill manners that i could not have imagined would ye believe it ladies while we were so much concerned he has taken all the tea however stop a moment i will go and order more   charlotte no there has been quite enough i could not drink another drop   amelia the misfortune of my slip has taken away my thirst   charles but i beg you will make no ceremony they can soon bring us more   amelia really i think you should have known beforehand that your brother was to be one of the company   sophia those who are not invited should at least wait until it were their turn   charlotte let us not say any more about it it does not give me the least concern   sophia well what shall we do now ah here is our friend godfrey he will help us to six on some amusement   charles  mimicks her our friend godfrey  but ladies i must speak to him before you  goes to meet godfrey while the young ladies are conversing together   scene vi amelia charlotte sophia godfrey charles charles  to godfrey well have you done it   godfrey there take it and blush for your idleness  well ladies have you fixed upon any amusement   amelia no we waited for you to determine us   godfrey i have a little musician below stairs at your service if you give me leave i will call him up to sing you a song or to play if you choose to dance   sophia a little musician where is he where is he   charlotte we must own master godfrey knows how to amuse his company   godfrey at the same time that we amuse ourselves we shall do an act of charity for the poor little fellow has no livelihood but his violin   charles and who will pay him master godfrey he talks and acts as if the king were his cousin and he has not a farthing all the while   sophia are not you ashamed brother   godfrey let him go on cousin he does not offend me it is no crime to be poor i am the liker my little musician who is for all that a very good boy i will give him sixpence that i have remaining in my purse and he has promised to play for that all the evening   charlotte we will make a collection to pay him   amelia yes yes we shall club   godfrey shall i go for him he waits below at the door   sophia by all means my dear cousin and make haste  godfrey goes out meantime jenny brings in a cake upon a plate   scene vii amelia charlotte sophia charles charles i was only going to cut it up  charles goes to take the plate from jenny sophia prevents him   sophia i shall save you the trouble you would cut it up so well i suppose that we should have no more of the cake than we had of the tea  she divides it and hands it round   charles  after taking his share who is to have the piece that is left   sophia what is my cousin to have none   amelia i would rather give him my part   charlotte and i mine   charles  with a sneer he is exceedingly happy   sophia can you see nothing but his cake to envy him   scene viii amelia charlotte sophia charles godfrey leading in jonas by the hand who has his violin under his arm godfrey give me leave to present you my young performer   charlotte and amelia he is a smart little fellow   sophia where do you come from my man   jonas i come from the worlds of yorkshire maam   amelia la what has made you come thus far   jonas because my poor father is blind and cannot work so we travel the country and i support him with my fiddle   sophia well will you give us a specimen of your performance   jonas that i will with all my heart but my skill is not very great   godfrey play your best at any rate it will be well enough for me and these ladies will be so good as to pardon you if you should play a little out of tune  jonas tunes his violin amelia in the mean time taking the plate presents the remainder of the cake to godfrey he bows takes the plate and holds it in his hand without touching the cake while he liftens to jonas the latter begins by playing the air of the following song then sings   i pity the early hardships of a boy whose tender hands maintain an helpless fire alas no other means can he employ but that compassion which their wants inspire ii pity their lot who would not importune chill penury implores the scanty boon long years of toil have dimmed the fathers eyes the others weakness that resource denies iii oh let their hardships touch the bounteous breast relieve the aged sire and helpless boy a little bread were wealth to the distressed alas it is all their pressing wants enjoy godfrey  giving him his hand poor child then you are both in great distress   jonas alas we are so but with my fiddle i hope that we shall never be destitute if we should be sick god almighty will take care of us and if we die we shall want nothing but a little spot of earth which may be had any where   godfrey but my poor little boy perhaps thou art hungry hold here take my cake   jonas oh no my pretty master eat it yourself a bit of bread serves me   godfrey no you shall have this i can eat bread as well as you   jonas well sir i thank you but i will not eat it now i will share it with my poor father he is not used to taste such good things   sophia your poor father say you here you shall give him my part   charlotte and take mine too   amelia and mine   jonas oh no no keep your cakes my sweet young ladies one piece is enough for me we are not used to fill our bellies with sweet things   charles  ironically he is right that would spoil his fine voice   sophia nobody has asked you for yours   charles oh i have dispatched that long ago   godfrey come my man will you taste your cake first   jonas oh no master since you are so good as to give it me allow me to wrap it up in my handkerchief and take it home   sophia stop a moment i will give you a piece of linen cleaner than that and meantime you may lay your cake in the window   jonas i will my good young lady i come here to play upon the fiddle not to eat   amelia i should wish to dance a minuet with master godfrey can you play any   jonas whatever you please a minuet a jig or a country dance   amelia let us have the minuet first  godfrey takes amelia by the hand to dance   charlotte why cannot we both dance  advancing toward charles mr charles   charles excuse me miss i cannot dance   sophia yet he has learned full two years   charles i am not in a capering humor today   charlotte  curtsying to him so then i am refused   sophia come cousin lend me your hat  to charlotte i shall have the honor maam to be your beau   amelia then if we were to dance a double minuet    godfrey miss i am at your service  they dance a double minuet after which charlotte goes to take out godfrey   charlotte mr godfrey now i will dance with you   godfrey i shall be happy miss to have that honor   amelia and now sophia i will be your beau   sophia as this goes i find i must lose my cousin however these ladies have the first title to your complaisance  they dance another minuet during which charles goes to the window takes jonass cake and slips out of the room   sophia  to godfrey who wipes his face ah you give it up you must own that we have stronger feet than you gentlemen   godfrey it is because you are much nimbler   amelia  to godfrey if your cousin had been as complaisant as you we should soon have overmatched you for then one of us could take breath while the other two danced  they all look round for charles   charlotte ah he is gone so much the better   jonas shall i play another tune or two   godfrey no that is enough unless ladies you would choose more the poor little fellow will be glad to go and earn something elsewhere i have already told you how little i have in my purse and charles has gone off without paying   charlotte we will all contribute as well as you   amelia certainly we mean it  takes out her purse there master godfrey is my purse   charlotte and here is mine   sophia hold cousin here is a shilling keep your money and this will do for us both   godfrey no no sophia i have a right to pay first  they gather the money and give it to jonas   jonas i will never take all that this young gentleman promised me only sixpence   godfrey take the whole my man we are very happy to be able to do you a service   jonas god almighty reward you  to sophia now miss if you would please to give me a piece of old linen to wrap up the cake that you have made me take   sophia i had quite forgot it  runs to a drawer and takes out a handkerchief there it is a little worn but it will do very well for your purpose   jonas may heaven repay you for your generosity  goes to the window for the cake   jonas  sorrowfully it is not here   sophia what a sad boy is that he certainly has taken this poor childs cake   jonas do not be concerned my sweet young lady i am only sorry to lose it on account of my poor father   godfrey if charles were not your brother his greediness should cost him dear but jonass father must not be a loser however my dear sophia lend me that sixpence that you were going to pay for me just now   sophia no cousin i will have the merit of it all to myself  to jonas there my lad is sixpence buy another cake for your father  charlotte and amelia feel in their purses   charlotte hold here are some more halfpence   amelia take this too   jonas oh dear no this is too much   godfrey  taking him by the hand affectionately how unhappy i am not to have any thing more to give thee but i am an orphan and subsist like thee upon the generosity of others   jonas  to godfrey i wish that you had not brought me here or that you would take back your money   godfrey do not be uneasy as to me farewell go and try to earn something elsewhere   jonas  to sophia as he is going but take your handkerchief my good young lady   sophia no keep it if you have occasion for it   jonas may heaven preserve you all in good health and make you still more amiable than you are  goes out   scene ix sophia charlotte amelia and godfrey sophia can you imagine any thing more shameful than the behavior of charles   amelia he should not play these pranks if i were his sister   charlotte i am sorry he has destroyed all the pleasure that we had in doing a service to this poor little boy   amelia however he is not ill off at present the cake has been pretty well made up to him   godfrey very true thanks to your generosity but that does not justify the behavior of charles besides poor jonas might have had the one without losing the other   sophia it is you cousin that have suffered most upon the whole you have deprived yourself of your share that my goodfornothing brother might eat it  a knocking is beard at the door   amelia charlotte sophia godfrey jonas godfrey here is our little fiddler again what is the matter my man   jonas  crying oh dear oh dear help i am ruined  the children gather round him   sophia what has happened to you then   jonas the whole of my poor subsistence  all that i had to maintain myself and my father  see see here  my little violin  it is broken all to pieces and your handkerchief and your money  all is gone  he has taken it all from me   godfrey who has broken your violin who has taken your money   jonas twas he  twas he that took my cake   sophia what my brother is it possible   godfrey charles   charlotte it cannot be   amelia o the wretch   jonas yes it was he it was he as i was going out of the streetdoor he came up to me and asked if i had been paid for my playing as otherwise he meant to pay me oh yes that i have said i and even overpaid how came they by so much money says he let me see what they have given you so i silly fool that i was  i should have remembered the cake but i thought no more of that i was so overjoyed to carry home so much money to my father besides i had not counted it and was desirous to know the sum so i laid my fiddle down on the ground beside me and took out the handkerchief see here said i to him what i got more than was promised me at first one of the young misses gave it me i had tied up all my money in the handkerchief and was going to undo the knot when the snatched at it i guessed his roguery so he pulled one way and i another when all at once seeing where my fiddle lay on the ground he stamped on it with both his feet i loosed my hold and let go the handkerchief and so he got it from me and ran away both my fiddle and the bow are broke and now i have neither handkerchief nor money o my father my poor father what will become of us   sophia why really i do not know  i have nothing more in the world o cousin   charlotte here are some few halfpence it is all that i have about me   jonas my sweet miss i thank you but that will not buy me a fiddle o my poor father he had it more than fifteen years   amelia take this too it is the very last farthing i have   sophia  runs to her drawer here is my thimble it is gold run and sell it my poor little man i have an ivory one that will serve me   godfrey no keep your thimble cousin stop my boy i can assist you  takes out his buckles and gives them to him i have another pair of pinchbeck you will certainly get twelve shillings for these i can give them away for they are my own my godfather made me a present of them for my birthday   sophia offers him her thimble and godfrey his buckles jonas hesitates   jonas no i will have none of them my father would think that i had stolen them   sophia take my thimble at least   godfrey wont you take my buckles you will make me angry take them i say   jonas oh dear would you have me deprive you of your ornaments   godfrey do  be uneasy about that god will repay me perhaps more than i give you your father wants bread i have no father to maintain   sophia go go and take care of yourself   jonas at least take back your thimble   sophia no it is not mine now   charlotte if you ever pass our way i will do something for you   amelia it is in  square any body will show you mr richmonds   jonas oh great folks seldom ask me into their houses i am sometimes perhaps taken down into the kitchen   sophia well enough of this your father probably is uneasy on your account and ours may return very soon   jonas how miss your papa do you expect him soon   sophia yes go your ways else the rogue who took your handkerchief and money may take this from you too   jonas but i hope you are very sure not to be scolded   godfrey no no never fear good bye   jonas  as he goes out the goodnatured little souls   scene xi sophia charlotte amelia godfrey charlotte i am very sorry that you have deprived yourself of your buckles muster godfrey   amelia you have set us a good example   godfrey i only followed that of sophia i should be happy in the opportunity of doing a good action if it had not been furnished by the mean behavior of charles with what pleasure shall i now look at my pinchbeck buckles   scene xii mr melfort sophia amelia charlotte godfrey jonas the children get close together sophia and godfrey cast a side look at jonas and whisper each other mr melf  to the miss richmonds your servant ladies i thank you for the honor that you have done my daughter but give me leave to hear in your presence what this boy has to say he was waiting for me upon the stairs and cannot leave me he says until he has spoken to me before you   to jonas come what have you to say   jonas  to sophia and godfrey my good young master and miss i beg you for heavens sake not to be angry with me but i cannot help speaking and it would be ill done of me to keep what you have made me take without the consent of your papa i know very well that children have nothing of their own to give away   mr melf what is all this   jonas i am going to tell you sir this young master called me from his window to come in and play upon my violin for these ladies there was another little gentleman too along with them very handsome but a very illnatured rogue   mr melf what my son   jonas i beg pardon that word escaped me well i played my best what tunes i knew and this good little company were so kind as to bestow me a piece of cake with a handkerchief to wrap it up and almost a handful of money besides i do not know how much   mr melf well   jonas well that illnatured little gentleman took away the cake which i was intending to carry to my poor father who is blind that i should not have minded but he slips out of the room and when i was going away quite overjoyed with my little bundle he watches me in the passage takes the handkerchief with all the money from me by force and breaks my violin in pieces look ye there it is crying all my riches that supported me and my father   mr melf is it possible such a malicious illnatured action  what my son    charlotte his behavior in every thing else makes this very probable ask sophia herself   mr melf go my man do not be afflicted i will indemnify you but is that all   jonas no sir only hear me being in such trouble i returned to tell these good little gentlefolks the whole affair they had not money enough to pay for the damage so this pretty miss gives me her gold thimble and this young gentleman his silver buckles i could not possibly keep them my father would have thought that i had stolen them i knew you were coming home so i waited to return them to you and here they are  but i have no fiddle now o my fiddle o my poor father   mr melf what an account thou have given me is it thou or you my generous children whom i should most admire excellent boy in extreme indigence to lose all and yet from the fear of doing wrong to run the risque of letting a father whom you love perish with hunger   jonas is it so great a matter not to be a rogue no no one never thrives on illgotten bread it is what my father and mother have often told me if you would only please to buy me another fiddle that will make amends for all whatever more the thimble and buckles would have brought god almighty will repay me   mr melf your father and you must be endowed with extraordinary uprightness of heart not even to suspect the depravity of others god will make use of me as an instrument to impart his blessings to you you shall stay here and for the first you shall wait upon godfrey afterward we will see what we can do better for you   jonas what wait upon this little angel of a gentleman oh i should be delighted  bows to godfrey but no  sorrowfully i cannot leave my father all alone without me how would he do to live what should i be in abundance and he die for want oh no   mr melf excellent child and who is thy father   jonas an old blind labourer whom i supported by playing on the fiddle it is true he seldom eats nor i neither any thing else but a piece of bread with some milk but god always gives us enough for the day and we take no care for the morrow he provides for that also   mr melf well i will take care of thy father and if he chooses i will get him into an almshouse where old and infirm people are well maintained you may go and see him there whenever you please   jonas after an exclamation of joy runs about the room quite transported   jonas o goodness what my dear father no that will make him die with joy i cannot stop any longer but must go for him and bring him here   runs out sophia and godfrey take mr melforts hands they wipe their eyes   scene xiii mr melfort sophia amelia charlotte and godfrey mr melf o my dear children how happy would this day have been for me if while i admire the generosity of your sentiments the idea of my sons unworthiness did not intervene to poison my happiness but no it should not affect it god has given me another son in thee my dear godfrey if you are not so by birth yet you are by the ties of blood and by congenial worthiness of heart yes you shall be my son  but where is charles go seek him and bring him hither to me immediately   godfrey goes out   sophia it is almost an hour since we saw him while the little boy was playing a minuet to us he disappeared with his piece of cake   godfrey  returning he was seen going into a confectioners not far off i have told john to go for him   mr melf children step into my study i wish to know what answer he will have the assurance to make me when i want your testimony i shall call you   charlotte and amelia then we shall take our leave   mr melf no my dears i will send word to your papa and mama that you will spend the rest of the evening with us probably the generous little jonas and his old father will be our guests also i have occasion for something to assuage the cruel wound that charles has given my heart and i know of nothing more salutary than the conversation of such amiable children as you   sophia  listening i think i hear charles coming   mr melfort opens his studydoor the children withdraw   scene xiv mr melfort i have long dreaded a discovery of this disagreeable nature but could never have suspected him of any thing so horrid it is perhaps still not too late to correct his vices alas why am i obliged to try a desperate remedy   scene xv mr melfort charles charles what are your commands papa   mr melfort where have you been were you not in your chamber   charles our tutor is gone out godfrey was below stairs so after having studied all the afternoon i grew tired of being alone   mr melf why did not you go as well as godfrey and join the little company that i found with your sister   charles and so i did but those misses treated me so ill    mr melf how you astonish me   charles at first they drank tea but without asking me to have a drop on the contrary they showed me all the spite in the world then godfrey picked up a little beggar brat in the street and brought him to play the siddle to them he gave him some of the cake that was brought up to them and me not a bit they danced but not one of the ldies would dance with me though there were three of them and no gentleman but godfrey what could i do here i went down to the door to look at the people passing by   mr melf only to the door what was it then that passed at the corner of the street between a little fiddler and you i have been told that you beat him and broke his violin and that he went away crying   charles yes that is true papa and if i had not been very goodnatured i should have got a constable to put him in bridewell you shall hear sir when i saw him go out i said to myself i must give this poor creature something too for his trouble for i know that godfrey has nothing of his own and a beggar is but ill paid with only a morsel of cake so i took some money out of my purse which i gave him and he drew out a handkerchief to put it in i perceived that it was one of my sisters handkerchiefs you may see the mark i begged him very civilly to return it which he would not so i took him by the collar and we struggled together and by accident i put my foot upon his fiddle   mr melf  with indignation hold your tongue base liar i cannot bear to hear you   charles  drawing near to him and going to take him by the hand why my dear papa what makes you angry   mr melf be gone wicked creature out of my sight you shock me  he calls the children from the study   scene xvi mr melfort sophia amelia charlotte charles godfrey mr melf come hither my children i will see none but those who merit my affection as for you quit my presence for ever but no stop you shall receive your sentence first  to sophia and godfrey you have heard his charges against you   sophia yes papa and if it were not necessary for our own justification i would say not a word against him for fear of increasing your anger   charles do not believe any thing that she will tell you   mr melf be silent i have already had a proof of thy detestable falsehood lying is the high road to thest and murder thou have already committed the first crime and perhaps wanted only strength to attempt the other go on sophia   sophia in the first place he has done no business at all this afternoon it was godfrey that wrote his translation for him   mr melf is this true   godfrey i cannot deny it   sophia then he spilt a dish of ten upon amelias slip and while we were busy in wipin it he  at table and emptied the teapot there was not a drop left for us these young ladies are witnesses  pointing to the miss richmonds as to the cake    mr melf that is enough all your baseness is discovered go up into your chamber for this day tomorrow morning i will put you out of the house i will give you time enough to amend before you return and if that experiment does not succeed there are not wanting methods to dispose of incorrigible reprobates who disturb society by their misdeeds godfrey tell john to see that he keeps his room you will give orders in the mean time that your tutor be sent to me as soon as he returns   sophia and godfrey  interceding for him dear papa  dear uncle   mr melf i will not hear a word in his favor he who is capable of taking from the poor by force the earnings of his industry of breaking the instrument of his livelihood and of seeking to justify such actions by falsehood and calumny should be turned out of the society of men i thank god that he has left me still two such excellent children as you you shall be my consolation henceforward and with you i will endeavor to make myself as happy this evening as the father of so unprincipled a son can be   the canarybird canarybirds to sell who will buy my canarybirds fine canarybirds thus cried a man passing by the house of little jessy jessy heard him she ran to the window and looking into the street saw that it was a birdseller who carried upon his head a large cage full of canarybirds they jumped so nimbly from perch to perch and chirped so sweetly that jessy in the eagerness of her curiosity was near falling out of the window while she endeavored to have a nearer view of them will you buy a canarybird miss said the birdman to her perhaps i may answered jessy but that does not depend on me entirely stop a little i will go and ask my papas leave the man promised to stop and seeing a buk on the other side of the street laid down his cage these and stood by the side of it jessy in the mean time ran to her fathers chamber and entered it quite out of breath crying come here papa quick make haste  mr gower and what is the hurry   jessy there is a man in the street that sells canarybirds i dare say he has more than a hundred he carries a great cage quite full of them on his head   mr gower and why does that make you so glad   jessy ah papa because  that is if you give me leave  i should like to buy one   mr gower and have you money enough   jessy o yes in my purse   mr gower but who will feed the poor bird   jessy i will papa myself you will see it will be glad to be my bird   mr gower ah i am afraid    jessy of what papa   mr gower that you will let him die of hunger or thirst   jessy i let him die of hunger or thirst oh no certainly i shall not nay i will never touch my own breakfast before my bird has had his   mr gower jessy jessy you know you are very giddy and then you have only to neglect him one day  jessy promised her father so fairly she coaxed him so much and pulled his coatskirt so often that mr gower consented at last to his daughters request he crossed the street leading her by the hand and when they came up to the cage they chose the prettiest canarybird in it a male of the most lively yellow with a little black tuft upon his head who was ever so happy as jessy then she held her purse to her father that he might pay for the bird mr gower then took money out of his own to buy a handsome cage with drawers and a watercup of crystal jessy had no sooner given the canarybird possession of its little palace than she ran to every part of the house calling her mama her sisters and all the servants and showing them the bird which her father had been so good as to buy her when any of her little friends came to see her the first words were do you know i have the prettiest canary bird in the world he is as yellow as gold and has a little black crest like the plumes of mamas hat come i will show him to you his name is cherry cherry was quite happy under jessys care the first thing that she thought of in the morning was to give him fresh grain and the clearest water whenever there was any cake at table cherry had his part of it first she had always some bits of sugar in store for him and his cage was garnished with fresh greens of one sort or another cherry was not ungrateful to all these attentions he soon learned to distinguish jessy and the moment he heard her step in the room what fluttering of his wings what incessant chirpings jessy almost devoured him with kisses at the end of a week he began to sing and produced the most delightful music sometimes he swelled his little notes to such a length that one would have thought he must expire from fatigue then after pausing a moment he would begin again sweeter than ever with a tone so clear and brilliant that he could be heard all over the house jessy passed whole hours in listening to him as she sat by his cage she sometimes would let her work fall out of her hands to gaze at him and after he had entertained her with a sweet song she regaled him in her turn with a tune upon the birdorgan which he would endeavor to imitate these pleasures however became familiar to jessy her father one day made her a present of a book of prints she was so agreeably taken up with it that cherry was something the less minded he would chirp the moment that he saw jessy though ever so far off but jessy heard him not almost a week had passed since he had either had fresh greens or biscuit he repeated the sweetest airs that jessy had taught him and composed new for her but in vain the truth was jessys thoughts were otherwise engaged her birthday came on when her godfather gave her a great jointed doll this doll which she called columbine completely banished all thoughts of cherry from morning till night she was busied with nothing but dressing and undressing miss columbine a hundred times talking to her and carrying her up and down the room the poor bird was very happy to get some food toward evening sometimes it happened that he was obliged to wait for it till the next day at length one day when mr gower was at table and cast his eye accidentally upon the cage he saw the canarybird lying upon its breast and panting for breath its feathers were ruffled and it seemed contracted all of a lump mr gower went close up to it but no more fond chirpings the poor little creature had scarce strength enough left to breathe jessy cried mr gower what is the matter with your canarybird jessy blushed why papa i  somehow i forgot  and all in a tremble she ran to fetch the box of seed mr gower took down the cage and examined the drawer and the watercup alas cherry had not a single grain nor a drop of water ah poor bird cried mr gower thou art fallen into cruel hands if i had foreseen this i should never have bought thee all the company rose from table holding up their hands and crying the poor bird mr gower put some seed into the drawer and filled the cup with fresh water but had much difficulty in bringing cherry back to life jessy left the table and went up into her chamber crying and made her handkerchief quite wet with her tears the next day mr gower ordered the bird to be carried out of the house and given as a present to the son of mr mercer his neighbor who was counted a very careful boy and would pay more attention to him than jessy had done but to hear the little girls complaints and expressions of sorrow ah my dear bird my poor cherry indeed i promise you faithfully papa that i will never forget him a single moment as long as i live only leave him with me this once mr gower suffered himself at length to be touched with jessys entreaties and gave her back the canarybird but not without a severe reprimand for her negligence and the strictest injunction as to the future this poor little creature says he is shut up and therefore not able to provide for its own wants whenever you want any thing you can ask for it but cherry cannot make people understand his language if ever you let him suffer hunger or thirst again  at these words jessy shed a flood of tears she took her papas hand and kissed it but her grief was so full that she could not utter a word now jessy was once more mistress of cherry and cherry was sincerely reconciled with jessy about a month after mr gower was obliged to go into the country for a few days with his lady jessy jessy said he in parting with his daughter i earnestly recommend poor cherry to your care her parents were scarcely got into the carriage when jessy ran to the cage and carefully provided the bird with every thing necessary in a few hours after her time began to hang heavy she sent for some of her little acquaintance and soon recovered her cheerfulness they went out to walk together and at their return spent part of the evening in playing at blindmans buff and four corners after that they danced in fine the little company broke up very late and jessy went to bed quite fatigued the next morning she awoke by break of day and began thinking on the amusements of the evening before if her governess had let her she would have run as soon as she got up to see the miss marshalls but was obliged to wait till after dinner however she had scarcely finished it before she desired to be conducted to their house and cherry  he was obliged to stay at home alone and to fast the following day was also spent in amusements and cherry  he was forgotten again it was the same the third day and cherry  who could think of him in the midst of such diversions the fourth day mr and mrs gower returned from the country jessy had thought very little about their return her father had scarce kissed her and enquired after her health before he asked how is cherry very well cried jessy a little confused and she ran toward the cage to carry him some water alas the poor little creature was no more he was laid upon his back with his wings spread and his bill open jessy screamed out and wrung her hands every one in the house ran up and was eyewitness of the disaster ah poor bird cried mr gower how painful has thy death been if i had wrung thy head off the day that i went to the country thou would have had but the pain of a moment whereas now thou have endured for several days the pangs of hunger and thirst and have died in a long and cruel agony however thou art still happy in being delivered from the hands of so pitiless a guardian jessy would have hid herself in the bowels of the earth she would have given all her playthings and all her pocketmoney to purchase the life of cherry but it was then too late mr gower took the bird and had its skin stuffed and hung up from the ceiling jessy did not dare to look at it her eyes were filled with tears whenever she chanced to perceive it and every day she entreated her father to remove it from her sight mr gower did not consent till after many supplications on her part and whenever jessy showed any mark of inattention or giddiness the bird was hung up again in its place and every body would say in her hearing poor cherry what a cruel death you suffered   the children who would be their own masters camillus ah papa how i should wish to be big to be as big as you   mr orpin and why should you wish so my dear   came because then i should not be under any bodys command and might do whatever came into my head   mr orpin i suppose then you would do wonders   came that i should i promise you   mr orpin and do you wish also julia to be free to do whatever you please   julia yes indeed papa   came oh if julia and i were our own masters   mr orpin well children i can give you that satisfaction after tomorrow morning you shall have the liberty of conducting yourselves entirely according to your own fancy   came ah you are jesting papa   mr orpin no i speak quite seriously tomorrow neither your mother nor i nor in short any body in the house shall oppose your inclinations   came what pleasure shall we feel to have our necks out of the yoke   mr orpin that is not all i do not intend to give you this privilege for tomorrow only it shall continue until you come of yourselves and request me to assume my authority again   came at that rate we shall be our own masters a long while   mr orpin well i shall be glad to see you able to conduct yourselves so prepare to become great folks tomorrow  the next day came the two children instead of rising at seven oclock as usual lay in bed till near nine too much sleep makes us heavy and listless this was the case with camillus and julia they awoke at length uncalled and got up in an illhumour however they pleased themselves a little with the agreeable idea of acting in whatever manner they liked the whole day come what shall we do first said camillus to his sister after they had dressed themselves and breakfasted   julia why well go and play   came at what   julia let us build houses with cards   came oh that is very dull amusement i am not for that   julia will you play at blindmans buff   came what only two of us   julia well at crafts or at fox and geese   came you know i cannot bear those games that oblige one to sit still   julia well then mention some to your own liking   came then well play at riding on a stick   julia ay that is pretty play for a little girl   came well play then if you like at horses you shall be the horse and i will be coachman   julia on yes to lash me with your whip as you did the other day i have not forgot that   came i never do it willingly but the thing is you will not gallop   julia ay but that hurts me so i will not play at any such game   came you will not will not you well let us play at hounds and hare i will be the huntsman and you shall be the hare come make ready i shall set off   julia pshaw i will have none of your hunting you do nothing but tread upon my neels and punch me in the sides   came well since you do not choose any of my games i will never pay with you again do you hear that   julia nor i with you do you hear that too  at these words they quitted the middle of the room where they were standing and retired each into a corner and there remained a considerable time without looking at or speaking to each other they were still in a pout when the clock struck ten the forenoon would soon pass  therefore camillus at length approaching his  said i must do every thing that you like well then i will play at drafts with you for twelve chestnuts a game   julia i have no chestnuts and besides you know you owe me a dozen already you should pay me those first   came yes i owed them to you yesterday but i do not owe any thing today   julia and pray how did you come to be quit   came nobody has a right to ask any thing of those who are their own masters   julia very well i shall tell my papa of your cheating   came but papa has no power over me now   julia if that be the case i will not play   came then you may do as you like  they go away pouting again to the farther ends of the room from each other camillus began to whistle julia to sing camillus tied knots on his whip and cracked it julia dressed her doll and began a conversation with it camillus grumbled and julia sighed the clock struck again they had another hour less to play in camillus in a pet threw his whip out of the window julia tossed her doll into a corner they look at each other not knowing what to say at length julia breaks silence come camillus i will be your horse   came there now that is right i have a long string for the bridle see here put it into your mouth   julia no not into my mouth tie it round my waist or fasten it to my arm   came how you talk did you ever see horses have the bit any where but between their teeth   julia but i am not a real horse   came well but you should do just the same as if you were   julia i do not see any occasion for that   came i suppose you think that you know more about it than i do who am all the day in the stable come take it the right way   julia you have been trailing it about in the dirt all the week no i will never put it into my mouth   came then i will not have it any where else i would rather not play at all   julia just as you like  a third fit of pouting more sullen and peevish than before camillus goes for his whip julia takes up her doll but the whip refuses to crack the dolls dressing goes all wrong camillus sighs julia weeps this interval brought on dinnerhour and mr orpin came to ask them if they chose to have it served up but what is the matter with you said he seeing them both quite dull nothing papa answered the children and wiping their eyes followed their father into the diningroom the dinner this day consisted of a number of dishes and a bottle of wine was opened for each of the children my dear children said mr orpin if i had still my former authority over you i would forbid you to taste all these dishes and particularly to drink wine at least i would desire you to be very sparing of them because i know how dangerous wine and highfeasoned food are to children but ye are now your own masters and may eat and drink whatever ye fancy the children did not wait to be told this twice the one swallowed great bits of meat without bread the other took sauce in whole spoonfuls and they drank full bumpers of wine without remembering to mix water with it my dear whispered mrs orpin to her husband they will make themselves sick i fear they will my dear answered mr orpin but i would rather that they should learn for once at their own expense how much one may suffer from ignorance than by a premature attention deprive them of the fruits of so important a lesson mrs orpin saw her husbands intention and therefore suffered our thoughtless little couple to indulge their greediness the cloth was now removed the children had stuffed as long as they were able and their little heads began to be heated come with me julia cried camillus and took his sister with him into the garden mr orpin thought proper to follow them unobserved there was a little pond in the garden and at the edge of the pond a small boat camillus had a mind to go into it julia stopped him you know said she that we must not go there must not answered camillus do you forget that we are our own masters oh that is true said julia so giving her hand to her brother they both went into the boat mr orphin drew nearer to them but did not choose to discover himself yet he knew that the pond was not deep even if they fall in said he to himself i shall not have much trouble in getting them out the two children wished to disengage the boat from the bank and push it out toward the middle of the pond but they were not able to untie the knots of the rope which held it fast since we cannot fail said the giddy camillus we may at least balance ourselves so striding across the boat he began to press it down first on one side then on the other their heads being a little dizzy it was not long before their legs failed them they laid hold of each other to support themselves and fell both plump upon the side of the boat and from thence into the water mr orpin flew like lightning from the place where he had been hid he threw himself into the water seized his rash children one in each hand and brought them back into the house half dead with terror they felt themselves violently sick while they were undressing and rubbing with cloths at length they were put each in a warm bed they fell alternately into a stupor and convulsions they complained of a dreadful headache and pains in the bowels were seized with frequent fainting fits and in the intervals with shudderings sickness of the stomach and difficulty of breathing in this deplorable condition they passed the rest of the day they sobbed and wept till at length they fell fast asleep through weariness early the next morning their father entered their chamber and asked how they had passed the night very ill answered both in a feeble voice we could not lie easy in bed and feel a sickness yet in the head and stomach poor children how i pity you but added he a moment after what will ye do with your liberty today ye remember that ye enjoy it still oh no no answered both eagerly and why my little friends ye said the other day that it was so disagreeable to be subject to the direction of others we have been well punished for our folly replied camillus and shall take warning for a long time added julia   mr orpin ye will not be your own masters then any longer   camillus no no papa we would rather be told by you what to do   julia it will be much better for us both   mr orpin think well of what ye say for if i resume my authority i inform you beforehand that my very first orders will be disagreeable to you   came no matter papa we are ready to do whatever you shall think proper   mr orpin well i have here a yellow powder called rhubarb it has an unpleasing taste but is excellent for those who have hurt their stomachs by excess since ye consent to follow my orders i command you instantly to take this powder let me see you obey   came oh yes yes papa   julia i would take it though it were as bitter as soot  mr orpin gave them the medicine and the children without making as formerly any grimaces endeavored each to excel the other in taking it with a cheerful countenance this remedy happily had its effect and they both recovered very soon after that whenever their parents would terrify them with threats of punishment they would say we shall let you be your own masters and the children selt more terror from this threat than many others to whom one should say i will put you in prison   the bushes one fine evening in the month of may mr ogilby was sitting with algernon his son upon the side of a small hill from whence he pointed out to him the beauties of nature as they lay before him the setting sun in taking his last adieu seemed to have clothed every thing in a robe of purple they were roused from this pleasing meditation by the cheerful song of a shepherd who was driving back his bleating flock from a neighboring field on each side of his road there grew up thornbushes which no sheep approached without leaving upon them some part of her fleece little algernon grew quite angry at those robbers do you see papa cried he those bushes how they rob the sheep of their wool why did god make those illnatured brambles or why do not all men join with one accord to destroy them if the poor sheep come back this same way again they will leave the rest of their clothing upon them but no i will rise tomorrow at break of day and come with my billhook and snipsnap cut all those briars down to the ground you shall come with me papa and bring a little axe and the whole shall be finished before breakfast  we will think of your project answered mr ogilby but in the mean time do not be unjustly angry with those bushes remember what we do about lammas  alger what do we do then papa   mr ogilby have not you seen the shepherds arm themselves with great shears and rob the trembling sheep not of a few locks of wool only but of their whole fleece   alger that is very true papa because they want it to make themselves clothes but those bushes rob them out of mere spite and without having the least occasion for it   mr ogilby you dont know what purpose these bits of wool may serve to them but supposing that they served none has a person any right to appropriate a thing to himself merely because he wants it   alger but i have heard you say papa that sheep naturally lose their fleeces about that time of the year then it is much better to take it for our use than to suffer it to fall off quite useless   mr ogilby your remark is just nature has given all beasts a clothing and we are obliged from them to borrow ours unless we choose to go quite naked and remain exposed to the inclemency of the winter   alger but a bush has no occasion for clothing so you see papa we must not give up our design i shall certainly cut all these thorns down tomorrow you will come along with me will not you   mr ogilby with all my heart come then now for tomorrow morning by break of day  algernon who thought himself already an hero merely from the thought of destroying with his little arm this legion of robbers could hardly sleep taken up as he was with his victories of the next day scarce had the cheerful singing of the birds that perched on the trees near his windows announced the return of the dawn before he hasted to awake his father mr ogilby on the other hand though indifferent as to the fate of the thornbushes yet pleased with the opportunity of showing to his son the beauties of the opening day was no less eager to quit his bed they dressed themselves hastily took their instruments and set forward on the expedition algernon went before with an air of triumph and mr ogilby had some difficulty to keep up with him as they approached the bushes they saw a number of little birds flying backwards and forwards amongst them and fluttering about the branches softly said mr ogilby to his son let us suspend our vengeance for a moment for fear of disturbing those innocent creatures let us go up again to that part of the hill where we sat yesterday evening and examine what it is that those birds seem to seek so busily they went up the hill seated themselves and looked on they saw that the birds were employed in carrying away those bits of wool in their beaks which the bushes had torn from the sheep the evening before there came multitudes of yellowhammers chaffinches linnets and nightingales who loaded themselves with this plunder what is the meaning of that cried algernon quite astonished it means replied his father that providence takes care of the smallest creatures and furnishes them with every expedient for their happiness and preservation you see the poor birds find here a lining for the habitation which they prepare for their young they make ready you see a very comfortable bed for themselves and their little family thus the honest thornbush against which you were so easily provoked yesterday unites the inhabitants of the air with those of the earth he takes from the rich his superfluities to satisfy the wants of the poor will you come now and cut him down heaven forbid cried algernon thou art right my son replied mr ogilby let him flourish in peace since he makes so generous a use of his conquests   joseph there lived once in bristol a crazy person whose name was joseph he never went out without having five or six wigs on his head at once and as many muffs upon each of his arms though his senses were disordered he was not mischievous and must be teazed a long time to be put in a passion whenever he walked the streets a number of troublesome little boys would come out of the houses and follow him crying joseph joseph how do you sell your wigs and your muffs some of them were even so illnatured as to throw stones at him though joseph commonly bore all these insults very quietly yet he was sometimes so tormented that he would fall into a fury and take up stones or handfuls of dirt to throw at the rabble of boys such a combat as this happened one day before the house of mr denham the noise drew him to the window and he beheld with grief his own son henry engaged in the fray as soon as he perceived this he shut down the sash and went into another chamber at dinner mr denham said to his son who was that man that you was running and hallooing after  henry you know him very well papa it is the crazy man called joseph   mr denham poor man what can have occasioned this misfortune to him   henry they say that it was a lawsuit for a great estate he was so grieved at losing it that he has lost his senses too   mr denham if you had known this man at the very time when he was stripped of his estate and if he had said to you my dear henry i am unfortunate i have just lost an inheritance which i long enjoyed peaceably all my property is gone to support the expense of a lawsuit i have now neither townhouse nor country house in short nothing upon earth left would you have laughed at him then   henry god forbid who could be so wicked as to laugh at a man in his misfortunes i should much rather have endeavored to comfort him   mr denham what then is he happier now when he has lost his reason besides   henry on the contrary he is much more to be pitied   mr denham and yet this day you insult and throw stones at an unfortunate man whom you would have endeavored to comfort when he was less an object of pity   henry my dear papa i have done wrong forgive me   mr denham i pardon you willingly if you are sorry for your fault but my pardon is not sufficient there is another whose forgiveness you have still to ask   henry you mean joseph   mr denham and why joseph   henry because i offended him   mr denham if joseph had retained his senses it would certainly be his pardon that you should demand but as he is not able to understand what is meant by pardon it were useless to address yourself to him yet you think that every one should ask pardon of those whom he has offended   henry so you have taught me papa   mr denham and do you know who it is that has commanded us to have compassion upon the unfortunate   henry god   mr denham and yet you have not shown compassion to poor joseph on the contrary you have aggravated his misery by your insults do you think that such conduct does not offend god   henry yes i acknowledge it and will ask forgiveness of him tonight in my prayers   henry kept his word he repented of his fault and at night asked pardon of god from the bottom of his heart and he not only ceased to trouble joseph for several weeks himself but he hindered also others of his comrades from insulting him in spite of his fair resolutions however he happened one day to mix in the rabble of boys who were following him it is true it was purely out of curiosity and only to see the tricks that they played upon this poor man now and then he could not refrain from hallooing like the rest joseph joseph and by degrees came to be the foremost in the mob at length josephs patience being tired by the shouts that pursued him he turned short about and taking up a large stone threw it at him with such violence that it grazed his cheek and almost cut off part of his ear henry returned home all over blood and roaring heartily it is a just punishment on you from god said mr denham but replied henry why have i alone been hurt while my companions who used him much worse than i did have not been punished the reason is answered his father that you knew better than the others what a fault you were committing and consequently your offense was more criminal it is very just that a child who knows the commands of god and of his father should be doubly punished whenever he has such a disregard of his duty as to violate them  the little gleaner a drama in one act characters lord bevil marcellus his son harriet his daughter mrs jennings emily

not a bad beginning what joy will this be for my poor mother  she lays her basket on the ground and looks at it with an air of satisfaction that old reaper how goodnatured he was to fill my basket i might have run about here and there all the day and never have picked up so much as half of this god reward him for it but here are still some ears upon the ground if i could only glean a handful or two   she presses down the corn ears in her basket with both hands i can make it hold them by pressing down a little and besides i have my apron  she rises takes the two corners of her apron in one hand and prepares to put into it with the other the ears of corn that she gathers when a noise is heard o dear yonder is a man coming toward me who seems to be angry yet i do not think that i have done any harm   scene ii emily hardy hardy  seizing her by the arm ah little thief have i caught you at it   emily what do you say sir i am not a thief i am an honest little girl i can tell you that   hardy an honest little girl you an honest little girl  snatches the bosket out of her hands what have you got in this then my honest little girl   emily ears of corn as you see   hardy and did these ears of corn grow in your basket   emily ah if they grew there i should not have occasion to take so much trouble in gathering them up and down the fields   hardy then they are stolen   emily pray sir do not treat me so ill i would rather die of hunger and my mother too than do what you say   hardy blood why they did not throw themselves into your basket of their own accord did they   emily oh dear you terrify me with your swearing but only hear me i went to glean down in yonder field and there was a goodnatured old man who saw me at work poor child said he how she labors i will assist her there were some sheaves lying in the field and he pulled out of them whole handfuls of ears which he threw into my basket what is given to the poor said he god repays and    hardy aha i understand you the old man in that field below filled your basket with ears that you have been pulling here out of our sheaves heh   emily nay then you may go and ask himself he can tell you   hardy i go and ask him yes you may wait for that i have caught you here that is enough   emily but when i tell you that i have not touched a single sheaf the few ears that i have in my apron i picked up from the ground because i thought that was allowed however if you do not choose that i should i am ready to return them there these are yours   hardy no no these shall remain with the other and you shall remain with the basket wherever it goes come follow me to the house of correction   emily  frightened how you dont say so my dear sir   hardy oh yes your dear sir but i should be much dearer if i let you escape should i not to the house of correction i say come come along   emily ah pray for gods sake  i have picked up nothing here but the handfuls of ears that i returned to you what would my poor mother say if i should not go home the whole day and if she heard that i had been put in prison it would be enough to kill her   hardy a great loss the parish would be well rid of her   emily  begins to cry ah if you knew what a good mother she is and how poor we are you would pity us   hardy i am not here to pity people i am here to take them up when they trespass upon my lords grounds and to clap them in prison   emily but when one has done nothing when one is innocent as i am    hardy oh yes tell me of your innocence what come here and steal a whole basket full of corn and then tell me a thousand lies come come walk along   emily ah my dear sir have compassion on me take my basket if you will alas my little store will hardly make you much richer but let me go i entreat you if not on my own account at least for the sake of my poor mother i am all the comfort and help that she has   hardy if i let you go it is not on account of your mother at least that i can tell you i could wish her a hundred miles off it is only on your own because your whimpering has moved me a little but do not expect to have your basket too the law seizes on it as forfeit then at sessions their worships will lay on a swinging fine and if that is not paid off to prison and turn out of the village  takes the basket upon his shoulder emily weeps bitterly and kneels to him go do not teaze me or you will see what is to be got by that  goes off muttering only see if one were not always to be on the watch after them little as they are they would run away i do believe with the fields themselves   scene iii

little birds are they at least are permitted to come and take some grains for their food and i  but who knows whether some illnatured man like this be not watching them now to kill them with his gun i will frighten them all away and then i will go myself for perhaps they would punish me for having rested my head on this sheaf  but what two children are those coming this way   scene iv marcellus

attentively and taking her brother aside she seems to be a very good little girl marcellus see how she cries do not reproach her any more that will afflict her worse and it i not worth while for a few ers of corn that she has picked up   goes to her my poor child what makes you cry   emily why they accuse me unjustly and perhaps you think me in fault   marc then you are not in fault   emily no indeed you may believe me i went into that field down there to glean an old reaper took pity on my fatigue and filled my basket with ears of corn i then came here to pick up a few others that i saw scattered about your illnatured bailiff found me near this sheaf and accused me of stealing he took away my basket and would have carried me to prison if my entreaties and tears for my mother had not at length prevailed on him to let me go   harriet ah i should be glad to see him dare to molest you we have a good papa who does not suffer any ill to be done to the poor and who would soon have released you   marc ay and who will very soon make him give you back your basket i promise you that   emily  joyfully o dear do you think so my sweet little master   harriet marcellus and i will go and will so beg of him  do not be uneasy he is never so well pleased with us as when we speak to him in favor of poor people and besides we could get you your basket again without speaking to him   emily ah how happy you are my pretty little miss not to want help from any body and even to be able to help others   marc are you very poor then my little girl   emily one must needs be poor that comes here gleaning with so much trouble what is to make a little bread   harriet what is it for bread that you come gathering the ears of corn i thought that you intended to toast the grains on a hot sireshovel and so to eat them as my brother and i do sometimes when no body sees us   emily o dear no my mother and i intended to beat the corn out of those ears and to give it to the miller that we might have flour to make bread   harriet but my poor child you could not have much out of that and it would not last you very long   emily why suppose we had only enough for a day or two my mother and i should have a day or two the more to live   marc well that you may have another day certain i will give you this shilling which i have kept the last of all my money because it is quite new   emily ah my good little master so much money no no i dare not take it   harriet  smiling so much money take it never fear if i had my purse about me i would give you much more but i keep it for you and you shall not be a loser   marcellus  still holding out the money come take it  emily  receives the money and curtsies to him without speaking   marc this is doing only half i will run as fast as i can after our bailiff and make him give me back the basket or else    emily oh sir do not give yourself that trouble you have promised to assist me that is enough for me   harriet tell me where do you live   emily just by in the village   marc we never saw you before and yet we come here along with papa every year about harvesttime   emily we have been here only a week and live with a  old woman called margaret who has showed much friendship to my mother oh a great deal of friendship indeed   harriet what old margaret   marc why we know her she is the widow of a poor weaver who was out of work my papa makes her come sometimes to weed in the garden   harriet will you take me to your mothers   emily it would be too great an honor for her a young lady of quality like you    harriet no no our papa will not let us think ourselves to be any better than other people and if you have no other reason    emily none at all so far from it you may help me to comsort her for the loss of my basket and my corn and then that naughty man that threatened us    marc fear none of his threats while my sister is going with you to your mothers i will run after him and i think  you will come back here again   emily if you choose it my good young master   marc your basket shall be here before you return   emily perhaps i shall bring my mother with me to thank you   harriet come along let us hasten to find her  takes emily by the hand and goes out with her   scene v marcellus alone how happy are my sister and i not to be obliged like this poor child to go about picking up ears of corn for our food really this little girl speaks as if she were born to something better she has not that dirty vulgar appearance of other cottage girls oh certainly papa will oblige me so far  but here he comes along with hardy that is clever here comes the basket too   scene vi marcellus lord bevil and hardy marc  running up to his father ah dear papa how glad i am to meet you   to hardy give me this basket   hardy softly softly sir you will pull my arm off   lord bevil what do you want with that basket marcellus   marc it belongs to a poor little girl from whom this wicked hardy took it as well as the ears of corn that had been given her you shall hear the whole papa   hardy so so one is wicked then for doing ones duty and for not assisting rogues in their dishonesty why does my lord give me wages   lord bevil i have often told you hardy it is for hindering vagrants from haunting my grounds and incommoding my laborers but not for seizing poor people and dragging them to prison far less if they be honest persons reduced by necessity to seek a mite of nourishment from my superfluity and who meddle with nothing but a few ears of corn that lie scattered after a rich harvest   hardy in the first place i do not hinder them to glean as much as they will after the corn is in but while there is one sheaf on the ground    marc  ironically why do not you say too after the fields are fallow or covered with snow there is a great deal to pick up indeed after the harvest is got home   hardy you do not understand these affairs master  in the next place who can answer to us that these are not thieves   marc thieves bless me thieves the little girl told me that she had not taken a single ear of corn here and that it was an old reaper in the next field who filled her basket for her   hardy that is good she told you as if there was a word of truth in what those gentry say i caught her here close by a sheaf   lord bevil pulling out the ears of corn   hardy i will not say so much as that but how do i know what she had been doing before i came up and then is not all that story false of an old reaper who filled her basket for her oh it is very like the country people here those folks are so charitable   marc now i will maintain that those ears of corn were given her for she told me so and so good a little girl i am sure would not tell a story   hardy and pray master have you never told a story yet we all look upon you to be an excellent young gentleman   marc do you hear papa how this fellow hardy treats me  to hardy angrily no if i told stories i should be a wicked boy but i do not nor this good little girl neither and it is you that are a    lord bevil softly marcellus i am thus far satisfied with your defense we should believe all men honest until we are convinced of the contrary but we should never be in a passion with those who are of a different opinion we should rather endeavor to bring them by gentleness to a more satisfactory and just way of thinking   hardy no no my lord it is much better to believe all men wicked until we see beyond a possibility of doubting that they are honest that is much the wifest maxim whenever i meet an ox in my road i always suppose him to be mischievous and get out of his way it may happen that he is not dangerous but i run no risque in being cautious the surest way is always the best   lord bevil if all men had your manner of thinking with whom could we live and what dealings could ever have subsisted between you and me if instead of putting you into an honest service upon my estate in order to atord a livelihood to a disbanded old soldier i had given you up to the magistrate as a vagrant having neither discharge nor certificate   hardy yes that is very true but it is also true that i am an honest man   lord bevil i do not keep you in my service but because i am persuaded of that but i had no foundation for believing it at first except your word and your countenance   marc my dear papa if you depend upon ones word and countenance you will much sooner believe our little girl than hardy   hardy ay master look at my face your papa will certainly be well satisfied with the countenance of your little girl if it conveys so favorable an impression as mine does   marc oh yes it becomes you very well with that bears face to    lord bevil fie marcellus  hardy do you know this little girl   hardy yes my lord i know her and i do not know her i know that she has been here about ten days with her mother but how or why they came here the overseers can best inform you and to speak my mind freely it is ill done of them to receive such folks into the parish to increase the expense of the poors rate   marc well then i will take that expense upon me yes i   hardy why have you any thing of your own sir   marc if i have nothing my papa has enough   hardy in the mean time all the parish murmurs but when once you grease the fist of people in office  iitates the action of counting money for i am pretty sure the overseers    marc look ye there if he is not speaking ill of the overseers it would be well done to tell them   lord bevil softly child i see hardy it is impossible to cure your suspicious temper so that i am inclined to suspect too in my turn you judge that this little girl has filled her basket here because you found her in my field near a sheat you judge that the overseers would receive a bribe because they have admitted a poor family into the village well then i judge that you only kept this childs basket because she had no money or tobacco to give you and that in such case you would have freely released her   hardy how my lord can you imagine    lord bevil why may not i think of you as you allow yourself to think of others   hardy well my lord i had better hold my tongue and were i to see those beggars carry away your fields your groves and your meadows  shall i take this basket to the steward   marc oh no no dear papa i beg it as a favor   lord bevil hardy you will carry it to the poor womans house and make an apology to the little girl   hardy an apology my lord an apology can you think of such a thing i go and make her an apology for what   marc for what  for having given her so much uneasiness without cause and for having affronted her by accusing her of a base action   hardy if they have not an apology nor basket until i    lord bevil hardy if i had been guilty of injustice to you i should never hesitate to make amends and to convince you of it i will go myself i will carry back the basket and make an apology in your name   hardy or rather do you master marcellus take that charge upon you   marc oh with all my heart papa the little girl is to come back presently with harriet who is gone to comsort her mother i must wait for her   hardy in that case i have no business here  he goes off muttering i see we shall have so many beggars in this village that we must soon go begging ourselves   scene vii lord bevil marcellus marc papa do you hear what he says   lord bevil yes my dear i am willing to excuse his  ours   marc but how can you keep so illnatured a man   lord bevil he is not illnatured my dear but his overmuch zeal to serve us leads him astray he is most faithfully attached to me and fulfils his duty punctually   marc but then if he is unjust   lord bevil you heard him say that he did not think he was his only fault is that he follows his orders too literally and that he has not discernment enough to make the proper distinctions between persons and circumstances   marc pray papa explain that to me   lord bevil with pleasure my dear when i fixed him in his employment i gave him in charge to rid my grounds of vagrants and to carry all such when found upon them before a justice this order could only regard those wretches who live by thefts and robberies or should come to defraud or molest my tenants   marc ah i understand whereas he looks upon all those as rogues who subsist upon the charity of others and never informs himself whether old age sickness or inevitable misfortunes have reduced them to that condition   lord bevil very right my dear boy for circumstances alter things exceedingly for instance you did not show sufficient reflection in your dispute with him can you tell whether the mother of this little girl is not a dishonest person whether the little girl herself has not told you an untruth and actually stolen those ears of corn out of my sheaves   marc no my dear papa that is impossible   lord bevil why impossible are you clearly informed of every thing do you know who she is who her mother is and with what view they have come here   marc ah if you had only seen her if you had only heard her speak her language her countenance her tears then she is so poor as to have occasion for a handful of cornears to make her bread need one know more than this should i let a poor person perish with hunger because i do not know as yet whether he merits my assistance   lord bevil let me kiss thee my dear boy preserve always these generous dispositions toward the poor and god will bless thee as he has blessed me for the same sentiments by giving birth to them in thy young heart mercy is always preferable to severity a want of feeling can only lead to injustice and if he who solicits our compassion does not merit it the fault is his not ours   marc but my dear papa it is not prudent to commit to such men a hardy an office which puts it in ones power to be unjust   lord bevil you would be right my son if i had left to him alone the power of condemning or acquitting he can at most commit but a slight injury which it is easy to remedy and this inconvenience is unavoidable to judge of things according to the principles of equity i have in my steward a man of good understanding upright and noble in his sentiments he gave me a favorable account of the little girl and her mother as soon as they were first received into the village and informed me that they live with old margaret who is a very honest woman   marc but what if hardy had beat the little girl as he threatened her   lord bevil nothing could have carried him so far i have forbidden him on pain of losing his place to strike any person whatsoever even those whom he should surprise in doing any thing amiss and he rigorously pursues the orders that i give him   marc ah papa here is my sister returning with the little girl   scene viii lord bevil marcellus harriet emily marc  running with the basket to emily here my little girl here is your basket there has not been a single ear of it touched   emily o my dear basket how much am i obliged to you my good little master  perceiving lord bevil who is that gentleman   harriet  running toward her father and jumping up to embrace him this is our good papa   marc oh he is a good papa indeed that i can assure you so that you have nothing to fear come i will introduce you to him  coming forward he has scolded old hardy well for treating you as he did   emily  advances fearfully toward lord bevil and curtsies to him i beg pardon my lord for the liberty  but your lordships children are so good   lord bevil  aside marcellus was right whoever looks on her cannot doubt her innocence that graceful air her manner of speaking are proofs of no vulgar education   emily  in a low voice to marcellus and harriet have i made your papa angry he is talking to himself   lord bevil  overhearing her no my dear if my children have behaved well to you they have done no more than you appear to merit   harriet nor than she does really merit papa ah if you had seen her mother   lord bevil who is your mother my dear by what means did you come to these parts and how do you live   emily we live  indeed i can scarce tell how we live upon little or nothing we spend the day and sometimes the night in spinning and working at the needle to get us bread old madge affords my mother lodging and they sent me today into the fields to glean but indeed my first attempt has not turned out well   marc  in a whisper to emily better than you think my sister will get papas leave that you shall have ears of corn without gleaning   lord bevil but where did you live before   emily at richmond which is a few miles off living was too dear there so old margaret persuaded my mother to come to her and offered her houseroom for nothing   lord bevil  aside if people who are so poor exercise humanity to each other what duties have not we to fulfill  to emily is your father living what is his profession   marc i will lay a wager he is no working man   harriet and so will i especially since i have seen her mother   emily  confused my father  i have none indeed i never saw him he died before i was born ah if he was living now    lord bevil and do not you know who he was what was his name   emily my mother will inform you better than i   lord bevil could i speak with her   harriet oh yes papa she is coming herself she only begged a moments time to put herself in order   lord bevil and who brought you up   emily my mother entirely my lord she taught me to read and write she instructs me in my religion and gives me some lessons in drawing   lord bevil in drawing i have not a doubt remaining this is a branch of some good family reduced by misfortunes to necessity   harriet ah here she comes   marc is this she   lord bevil  aside i am impatient to clear up this mystery this child recalls to my mind features that are well known to me but whose i cannot recollect   scene ix lord bevil mrs jennings marcellus harriet emily emily  running to meet her mother who appears confused on seeing lord bevil come mama do not be afraid this is the papa of those two amiable children that showed us so much goodnature and he is very kind too as kind as his children  mrs jennings advances modestly harriet eagerly takes her hand and draws her on toward her father   harriet oh my papa knows all   mrs jenn may i flatter myself that your lordship has not suspected my little emily    lord bevil the sight alone madam of you and your daughter is sufficient to convey the most favorable opinion of you both   marc is her name emily oh papa it is easy to see that she was not born to be a gleaner   mrs jenn the laws of necessity are sometimes severe and as long as we do nothing dishonorable    lord bevil nobody should blush for poverty it may be found united to every virtue but may i take the liberty madam to ask your name   harriet her name is mrs lambert   mrs jenn i should not disguise my real name from your lordship i find myself indeed under the necessity of disclosing it to you in order to justify myself in your lordships opinion for the state to which you see me reduced yet i should wish  looking at the children to make this avowal to you without witnesses not that i blush for my humble situation but if my name was known i should fear to meet among the lower class some ungenerous souls who would perhaps take a pleasure in mortifying me because they sometimes see those who are in prosperity behave with the same want of generosity to themselves   marc well i shall not listen   harriet and i will never mention a word of it i assure you whoever you are emily shall always be my friend   lord b be assured madam i should not enquire these particulars without being strongly interested in them and unless i were resolved to make amends for the injustice of fortune   mrs jenn i was born of a good family though little favored by fortune i passed my youth in london as companion to a lady of the first rank eight years ago i became acquainted with mr jennings a lieutenantcolonel in the army who had come to spend some months in town   lord b  eagerly jennings jennings   mrs jenn he conceived an affection for me and his good qualities prejudiced me in his favor i gave him my hand and a few days after our marriage we retired to a small estate which he had in dorsetshire   lord b it is the same it is the same i can trace his features in the face of this child   mrs jenn how my lord   lord b go on madam i conjure you   mrs jenn i will be as brief as possble we were beginning to enjoy in a peaceful retirement the happiness of a most tender union but alas the fatigues of the service had impaired my husbands health and a severe illness seizing him put an end to his life in a few days  weeps   harriet  to emily poor child you became an orphan very soon   emily ah me before i was even born   mrs jenn he left me pregnant of this child whom you see she was born in sorrow as soon as my husbands brothers who were hardhearted worldly men saw that there was no male heir they took possession of his property and as we had delayed from day to day the formal attetions requisite to put our marriage articles in force i was obliged to be satisfied with whatever they thought proper to allow for the subsistence of me and my daughter   lord b their ungenerous avarice gives room to suppose that the sum was small and could not last you long   mrs jenn it sufficed to maintain me for a few years in dorsetshire during which time i continued to flatter myself with the expectation of obtaining a small jointure but at length seeing all my hopes frustrated i took the resolution of returning to london to my former benefactress on my arrival i learned that she had died a short time before having then no other resource than to fell what remained of my clothes and jewels and to work with my own hands for a subsistence i retired to richmond to live private and unknown and there i met some time ago a woman whom i had formerly known and who lives in this village   harriet that is old margaret papa   mrs jenn she had been servant to the lady whom i mentioned my attention to her during a severe illness attached her strongly to me i explained my situation to her and she proposed to me to come and live here where i might enjoy a still more obscure retreat i am indebted much to her hospitality and as she has no relation to perform the last offices for her she has given me to understand that i shall succeed to the possession of her little cottage you see my lord    lord b it is enough madam this generous woman shall not surpass me in gratitude it gives me inexpressible joyt be able to repay a debt which i have contracted to your worthy husband   mrs jenn how my lord have you known my husband   marc the father of this good little emily   harriet  my dear emily i see we shall keep you with us but what is the matter do you cry   emily it is only for joy   lord b to your husband i owe my life how happy am i then in being able to repay that kindness to his wife and his child i served under him last war in a dangerous engagement one of the enemys horsemen had his sword lifted over me at a time when i was quite spent with fatigue so that i must have perished if my brave lieutenant colonel had not saved my life by rushing upon him at the very moment   mrs jenn i know him well by this description he was as brave as he was generous   lord b some days after i was sent with a detachment upon a very dangerous expedition we were surrounded and forced to yield after a long resistance my baggage had been plundered so that i was stripped of both clothes and money colonel jennings being informed of my situation procured me a recommendation to the enemys general through his exertions i obtained every assistance requisite whilst under cure for a deep wound that i received i was more than two years in recovering and when we were ordered home had barely time to pay him a visit of acknowledgment before i was obliged to go on board immediately for the west indies i married there to my advantage and in consequence of that circumstance returned to england about six years ago i was preparing to fly to him when i heard that he was no more i little thought that his wife and daughter experienced that reverse of fortune in which i am grieved to find you at present   mrs jenn good god by what wonderful ways have thou conducted me hither   marc what your father saved papas life   harriet how dearly we ought to love you   lord b come hither emily thou shall find in me the father whom thou have lost my children too have occasion for a second mother to replace her whom death has taken from them the education that you have given your amiable child  emily goes close up to him and takes his hand shows me madam how worthy you are to fill so delicate an employ i shall take every necessary precaution that you may not have to dread a second time the unforeseen strokes of adversity  to emily who still holds his hand yes my little dear i will make no difference between you and my own children you are the living image of your generous father and are as worthy of my affection as he was of my gratitude   mrs jenn  with emotion how shall i answer my lord to so much kindness i have only tears to express what i feel   harriet  embracing her my dear new mama will you always be with us then as well as emily you shall see how glad we will be to obey you   marc yes and emily shall be my other sister she will certainly not go any more to glean ah illnatured hardy how i shall laugh at you now   mrs jenn my dear little lambs with what joy you fill my heart instead of one child then i have now three and no mother shall equal me in attention and tenderness to them  to lord bevil will your lordship permit me to go and impart these happy tidings to my good friend margaret i almost fear that she will die with joy   lord b nothing is more just madam meantime i will go and order an apartment to be prepared for you at my house   harriet papa will you give me leave to go with emily and my new mama   marc and me too papa i should wish to accompany them   lord b with pleasure my dear children afterward you will bring mrs jennings and her daughter to our house without forgetting good old margaret whom i invite also to come and dine with us   marc  to emily who is going to take the basket no emily this is not fit for you to carry now let the basket remain here   emily oh sir i would not give this basket for any thing in the world to it i owe my own happiness and my mothers the happiness of knowing you and in short my life and wellbeing no my dear little basket i shall never blush to carry you  she lifts it up with difficulty   harriet at least take the ears of corn out it will be lighter   emily no no they are mine for the good old reaper gave them to me whatever hardy might say i will make a present of them to old margaret   lord b she shall not be forgot next harvest and from this day forward shall be assured of bread for her whole life   mrs jenn may heaven reward you in your children for these acts of generosity   cecilia and marian before the sun had risen above the horizon to enliven with his splendour one of the finest mornings of the spring young cecilia went down into her fathers garden to taste with more appetite as she roved through its walks the sweetness of a little cake of which she intended to make her breakfast  every thing that could add to the beauties of the rising day united to charm her the pure breath of zephyr while it diffused a calm around refreshed every sense her palate was feasted with sweets her eye with the lively freshness of the springing verdure her smell with the balmy perfume of a thousand flowers and that her ear alone might not be without its share of delight two nightingales perching near her on the top of a green arbor charmed her with their morning song cecilia was so transported with all these delicious sensations that her fine eyes were bedewed with a moisture which however rested on her eyelids without dropping in tears her heart felt a soft emotion and was impressed with feelings of tenderness and benevolence all at once this agreeable calm was interrupted by the sound of steps and a little girl came forward toward the same walk eating with great appetite a piece of coarse brown bread as she too came into the garden for amusement her eyes wandered from one object to another without being fixed on any so that she came close up to cecilia before she perceived her on seeing who it was she stopped short a moment and looked down then like a young deer that is frightened and almost as swift as one she ran back again with all her speed stop stop cried cecilia wait for me why do you run away but these words made the little wild creature fly still faster cecilia pursued but as she was less used to running could not possibly come up with her luckily the little stranger had turned up another walk and that in which cecilia was led directly to the garden gate cecilia as sensible as she was pretty slipped softly along by a close hedge that bordered the walk and reached the end of it just as the little girl was going to pass by she caught hold of her unawares crying ah now you are my prisoner oh i have you fa you cannot escape now the little girl struggled to get out of her hands do not be illnatured said cecilia to her if you knew how well i mean to use you i am sure you would not be so shy come my good child come along with me for a moment these friendly words and still more the gentle tone of voice with which they were pronounced encouraged the little stranger and she followed cecilia into a summer house that was near  is your father alive said cecilia making her sit down beside her  marian yes miss   cec and what does he follow   marian any trade at all to earn his bread he came to day to work in your garden and has brought me with him   cec oh i see him down there upon the lettuce bed it is fat thomas but what are you eating for your breakfast let me see i want to taste your bread oh dear how it scrapes my throat why does not your father give you better than this   marian because he has not so much money as your papa   cec but then he earns some by his work and he could afford you household bread or else something along with this to make it palatable   marian yes if i was his only child but there are five of us and we all eat heartily and then one wants a frock and another a jacket and that makes my father quite at a less what to do sometimes he says it is all in vain for me to work i shall never earn enough to feed and clothe this young fry   cec then you never eat any plum cake   marian plum cake what is that   cec see here is some in my hand   marian la i never saw any before in my life   cec taste a little of it dont be afraid you see i eat it   marian  joyfully oh dear mis how good it is   cec i believe so my good girl what is your name   marian  rising and making her a low curtsey marian miss at your service   cec well my good marian stop here for me a moment i am going to ask something from my governess for you and will return immediately but dont you go away   marian oh no i am not afraid of you now  cecilia ran to her governess and begged her to give her some current jelly for a little girl who had nothing but dry bread for breakfast the governess was pleased with the goodnature of her amiable pupil she gave her some in a cup and a small roll at the same time and cecilia ran with all her speed to carry marian this breakfast well said she as she came up have i made you wait long here my good child take this lay down your brown bread you will eat enough of that another time   marian  tasting the jelly and licking her lips it is like sugar i never tasted any thing so sweet   cecilia i am glad that you like it i was pretty sure it would please you   marian what do you eat such as this every day ah we poor people do not know what it is to taste it   cec i am sorry for that hark ye come to see me now and then i will always give you some but bless me how healthy you look are you never sick   marian sick what i no never   cec do you never catch cold or feel your head stuffed   marian what sickness is that   cec when one is always coughing and blowing ones nose   marian oh yes that happens to me sometimes but it is not a sickness   cec and do they make you keep your bed then   marian ha ha my mother i dare say would make a fine noise if i were to take it in my head to be lazy   cec why what work can you do you are so little   marian must not i go in the winter to get straw for our cow and dry sticks to make the pot boil and in summer must i not go to weed the corn and in harvest time to glean and pull hops ah miss we are never at a loss for work   cec and are your sisters too as healthy as you   marian oh we are all hearty and as full of play as little mice   cec well now i am glad of that i was at first afraid that god took no care of so many poor children but since you have your health i see that he has not forgotten you i am very well too in health though certainly not so strong as you but child you go barefoot why do not you wear shoes and stockings   marian because it would cost my father too much money if he was to give them to us all so he gives none of us any   cec and are not you afraid of hurting yourself   marian i never once mind it god almighty made the soles of my feet hard like shoes   cec i should not like to lend you mine but how comes it that you have left off eating   marian the time has past away in talk i must now go and gather some greens for our cow it will soon be eight oclock and she waits for her breakfast   cec well take the rest of your roll with you stop a moment i will take out the crumb and you shall put the jelly into the hollow of the crust   marian i will carry it to my youngest sister oh she will not be nice about it she will not leave the least crumb when once she tastes it   cec now i love you better than ever for thinking of your little sister   marian i never get any thing good but i give her part good bye miss   cec good bye marian but remember to come here tomorrow at the same hour   marian if my mother does not send me somewhere else i will warrant i shall not fail  cecilia had now tasted the happiness of doing good she walked a little longer in the garden thinking how happy she had made marian how grateful marian had showed herself and how pleased her little sister would be to taste current jelly what will it be said she when i give her some ribbands and a necklace mama gave me some the other day that were pretty enough but i am tired of them now then i will look in my drawers for some old things to give her we are just of a size and my slips would fit her charmingly oh how i long to see her well dressed  next morning marian slipped into the garden again cecilia gave her some gingerbread that she had bought for her marian did not fail to come every day and cecilia thought of nothing but new dainties to give her when her pocketmoney was out she begged her mama to order her something out of the pantry and her mother consented with pleasure it happened however one day that cecilia received an answer which grieved her she was entreating her mother to advance her a little of her weekly allowance to buy shoes and stockings for marian that she might not go barefoot no my dear cecilia answered her mother and why mama i will tell you at dinner my reasons for wishing that you would be a little more sparing toward your favorite cecilia was surprised at this refusal she never longed so much for dinnertime as that day at length they sat down to table dinner was half over before her mother spoke a word concerning marian at length however a dish of shrimps that was served up furnished mrs allen with an opportunity of beginning the conversation thus   mrs a ah here is my cecilias favorite dish is it not i am glad they have brought some up today   cec yes mama i like shrimps very well and at this season they are good   mrs a i dare say that marian would like them still better than you do   cec ah my poor marian i suppose she has never seen any if she was only to look at these long whiskers she would be frightened oh so frightened i think i see her running away with all her speed mama if you will give me leave i should be curious to see how she would look there i will take only two for her two of the smallest   mrs a i am almost unwilling to consent to your request   cec why so mama you that do good to every body i asked you this morning too for a little money to buy shoes and stockings for marian and you refused me marian surely must have vexed you has she done any mschief in the garden oh i shall be sure to scold her   mrs a no my dear cecilia marian has not displeased me but do you wish by your kindness to her to make her happy or unhappy   cec happy mama god forbid that i should wish the contrary   mrs a i could wish too with all my heart to see her more fortunate since she has gained your esteem but is it true cecilia that she eats her bread quite dry for breakfast   cec it is very true mama i would not deceive you   mrs a how and has she been content with it till now   cec o dear yes and i never eat a tart with more pleasure than she ea her brown bread   mrs a then i should think she has a good appetite but i can hardly imagine that she goes barefoot   cec i have always seen her barefoot ask the gardener else   mrs a then she makes them all over blood when she walks on the grvel or pebbes   cec not at all she runs about in the garden like a little eer and she says langhing that god almighty has made the les of her feet hard like a pair of shoes   mrs a i know that you never tell stories but i confess that i can hardly believe what you say now i should be glad to see the wry faces that my cecilia would make in eating her bread quite dry without butter or sweetmeats   cec oh i know it would stick in my throat   mrs a nor should i be less curious to see how she would set about walking befoot   cec well then mama do not be angry but yesterday i had a mind to try being all alone in the garden i took off my shoes and stockings to walk barefoot i felt my feet sadly hurt but still i walked on at last i struck against a stone oh that did so pain me that i went back as softly as i could and put on my shoes and stockings and i promised fairly never to walk barefoot again my poor marian yet she is so all the summer   mrs a but how comes it then that you cannot eat dry bread nor walk barefoot as she does   cec the thing is perhaps that i am not used to it   mrs a why then if she uses herself like you to eat sweet things and to wear shoes and stockings and afterward if the brown bread should go against her and she should not be able to walk barefoot do you think that you would have done her any great service   cec no mama but i mean that she shall never be obliged to do so again all her lifetime   mrs a a very generous design and will your pocketmoney be sufficient for that   cec oh yes mama if you will only add ever so little to it   mrs a you know that my heart is never against helping the distressed whenever an occasion offers but is marian the only child that you know in necessity   cec nay i know many others beside there are two especially just by in the village that have neither father nor mother   mrs a and they without doubt stand much in need of assistance   cec oh they do indeed mama   mrs a but if you give marian every thing if you feed her with biscuits and sweetmeats while you let the rest die with hunger will there be much justice and humanity in that management   cec but now and then i shall be able to give them something yet after all i love marian best   mrs a if you were to die and marian had been used to enjoy every indulgence    cec i am pretty sure that she would cry for my death   mrs a yes i am convinced of that but then would she fall into indigence again and perhaps be obliged to do some disgraceful action in order to live well and dress well as before who would then have the blame of her ruin   cec  sorrowfully i should mama so then i must never give her any thing again   mrs a i do not think so however i should imagine that you will do well to give her sweet things seldomer and to make her a present rather of a good coat   cec why i was thinking of it i will give her if you please one of my frocks   mrs a i suppose your muslin slip would become her surprizingly especially without shoes or stockings   cec oh every body would point at her how shall we do then   mrs a if i were in your place i would be sparing in my amusements for some time and when i had saved a little money would lay it out in buying whatever was most necessary for her the stuff that poor children wear is not very expensive  cecilia followed her mothers advice marian came feldomer indeed to see her about breakfast time but cecilia made her other presents that were more useful at one time she would give her an apron another time a petti and she paid the schoolmaster of the village so much a month for her schooling that she might improve herself perfectly in reading marian was so sensible of these kindnesses that she grew every day more tenderly attached to cecilia she came frequently to see er and would say to her have you any commands for me is there any work that i can do for you and whenever cecilia gave her an opportunity of doing any slight service it was pleasing to see with what joy marian erted herself to oblige her one day she came to the garden gate to wait for cecilias coming down but cecilia did not come marian came back again but could not see cecilia she returned two days successively but no cecilia appeared poor marian was disconsolate not finding her benefactress ah said she can it be that she does not love me i have perhaps vexed her without meaning it i am sure if i knew in what i would ask her pardon for i could not live without loving her just then mrs allens maid came out marian stopped her where is miss cecilia asked she miss cecilia replied the woman she has perhaps not long to live i am afraid that she is in her last moments she has the smallpox o dear heart cried marian i will not let her die and running to the stairs she flies up into mrs allens chamber madam said she for gods sake tell me where is miss cecilia i must see her mrs allen would have stopped marian but the door being half open she had a sight of cecilias bed and was already by her side cecilia was in a violent fever alone and very low in spirits for all her little acquaintances had forsaken her marian drowned in tears took her hand squeezed it in hers and kissed it saying ah is it thus i find you do not die i pray you what would become of me were i to lose you i will stay with you night and day i will watch over you and serve you will you allow me cecilia squeezing her hand signified to her that she would do her a pleasure in staying constantly with her marian was now become with the consent of mrs allen cecilias nurse and performed this part to admiration she had a small bed made up for her close beside her little sick friend and never left her a moment on the slightest expression of pain from cecilia marian rose immediately to know what she wanted she gave her with her own hands the medicines ordered her by the physicians sometimes she would go and gather bulrushes to amuse her by making handsome little rush baskets while she looked on sometimes she would tumble all mrs allens library over to find pictures for her in the books she exerted her imagination in search of every thing that was capable of diverting cecilia from the sense of her illness cecilia had her eyes closed by the disorder for near a week this time appeared to her very tedious but marian told her stories of what happened in the village and as she had profited well by her lessons at school read to her whatever she thought would give her pleasure now and then too she addressed her with the most sensible consolations with a little patience she would say god almighty will have pity upon you as you have had pity on me at these words she would weep then quickly drying her eyes will you let me sing you a pretty song to divert you cecilia had only to make a sign and marian would sing her all the songs that she had learned from the young country maids round about thus the time passed over without hanging heavy on cecilia at length by degrees her health was reestablished she could open her eyes again her lowness of spirits left her the pock dried up and her appetite returned her face was still covered with red spots marian seemed to look at her with more pleasure than ever while she thought how narrowly she had missed losing her cecilia on the other hand regarded her with equal tenderness how shall i be able to pay you she would say to my satisfaction for all that you have done for me she asked her mama in what manner she might recompense her tender and faithful nurse mrs allen who was almost beside herself with joy to see her dear child restored to health after so dangerous an illness answered her leave it to me i shall take the charge of acquitting both your obligations and mine to her she gave private orders to have a complete suit of clothes made for marian and cecilia undertook to try it on her the first day that she should be allowed to go down into the garden it was a day of rejoicing through the whole house mrs allen and all her family were transported with gladness at the recovery of cecilia cecilia was delighted that she had it in her power to recompense marian and marian was out of her wits with joy to behold cecilia once more in the same spot where their acquaintance had commenced and besides to find herself new clad from head to foot   little jack mr churchill was returning home one day on horseback after taking a ride about his own estate as he passed by the wall of a buryingground belonging to a small village he heard the groans of a person on the other side this worthy gentleman had a heart too full of compassion to hesitate in flying to the relief of the unfortunate person whom he heard groan he alighted and giving his horse to the servant who followed him sprung over the enclosure of the buryingground he stood on tiptoe and looking all round at length perceived in a corner at the farthest end a grave covered with earth that was still quite fresh upon this grave lay at his full length a child about five years old who was weeping mr churchill approached him with looks of kindness and said to him what do thou do there my little friend  child i am calling my mother they laid her here yesterday and she does not get up   mr chapter that is because she is dead my poor child   child yes they say that she is dead but i cannot believe it she was so well the other day when she lest me with old susan our neighbor she told me she was to come back but she does not come my father is gone away too and my little brother and now the other little boys of the town will not have me   mr chapter will not have you why so   child i do not know but when i want to go along with them they drive me away and leave me by myself and they say naughty things too about my father and mother that is what vexes me most of all o mammy get up get up  mr churchills eyes filled with tears you say that your father is gone away and your brother too where are they gone   child i do not know where my father is and my little brother went away yesterday to another town there came a gentleman all in black just like our parson and took him away   mr chapter and where do you live now   child with our neighbor susan i am to be there until my mother comes back as she promised me i love my other mammy susan very well but  pointing to the grave i love my mammy that is here a great deal better o mother mother why do you lie so long when will you get up   mr chapter my poor child you call her in vain for you will never awake her   child well then i will lie down here and sleep by her ah i saw her when they put her into a great chest to carry her away oh how white she was and how cold i will lie down here and sleep by her  mr churchill could no longer refrain from tears he stooped down took the child up in his arms and kissing him tenderly said what is your name my poor little fellow   child they call me jackey when i am good and when i am a bad boy they call me you jack  mr churchill though in tears smiled at this answer will you take me to susan oh yes yes sir answered the child and running before mr churchill as fast as his little legs could go conducted him to susans door susan was not a little surprised on seeing a gentleman enter her cottage with little jack who pointing to her and running to hide his face in her lap said that is she that is my other mammy she knew not what to think of so extraordinary a visit mr churchill however did not leave her long in suspense he expressed to her the situation in which he had found the child and the compassion that he felt for him and at the same time requested her to favor him with every information concerning the parents of little jack susan bade him be seated and placing herself close by him began thus the father of this child is a shoemaker whose house joins mine he is an honest sober laborious man under thirty and a comely person his wife was a handsome woman but did not get her health well withal she was very careful and a good housewise they were married about seven years ago lived vastly well together and would have made the happiest couple in the world if they had been a little better in their affairs john had nothing but his trade and margaret being left an orphan brought her husband only a little money that she had sav in the service of a worthy clergyman the curate of the next parish this little sum was laid out in buying a bed and a few other articles of household furniture with a small stock of leather for his work in spite of their poverty they contrived to maintain themselves during the first years of their marriage by dint of labor and good management but children came on and then began their difficulties yet still they might have made it out by doubling their industry if misfortunes had not happened to them poor margaret who had worked in the fields every day during the hay time to bring home some money at night to her husband fell sick of fatigue and continued so all the harvest and all winter physic is very expensive and then besides the work did not go on so well because johns customers left him one by one as they were afraid of being ill served in a house where there was a sick wife at last margaret grew better but her husbands business declined he was obliged to borrow money to pay the apothecary and having lost all his customers he was now quite out of work at the same time margaret could earn nothing her strength was so much reduced that nobody would give her employment besides the rent of their house and the interest of the money that they had borrowed came heavily upon them they were obliged more than once to suffer hunger and thought themselves very happy when they had a morsel of bread to give to their children at these words little jack withdrew into a corner and began to sob with all this it happened that their hardhearted landlord seeing them not able to pay the rent of the two winter quarters threatened john to put him in ga they begged hard of him to have patience until the hay making came on because then they could earn something by working in the fields but neither their entr nor their tears could soften him though he is the richest man in the place it was with much ado that he allowed them a months delay but he swore that if at the end of that time he was not paid the whole he would sell their furniture and put john in prison their house was now acture of melancholy and patient distress capable of oftening a heart of stone you may believe me sir i have often been grieved to the soul on hearing the complaints of these good neighbors and not being able to relieve them i went once myself to their landlord and prayed him to have compassion on their extremity i offered to pawn to him all that i possessed in the world but it was to no purpose you are no better than they are answered he this it is to have such trash of tenants as you are all together ah sir  here the tears trickled down susans checks i bore this reproach patiently that i might not provoke him still more but oh how i suffered in being no more than a poor widow and in not being able to afford the least comfort to those worthy people how much good the rich might do if they had the same inclination as the poor but to return to our unfortunate neighbors i advised margaret to make known her distresses to the clergyman with whom she had lived some years as an honest and worthy servant and to beg of him to advance her some money she answered me that she would speak about it to her husband but that she could hardly think of doing so because the carate might imagine that they were reduced to want through their own bad management three days ago she brought me her two children as she used to do and begged me to take care of them till the evening she intended to go to a neighboring village and try if she could have some hemp from the weaver to spin in order to clear her debt she could never bring herself to go before the clergyman her old master but her husband was to go in her stead and he had set off the same day i took charge of the children with pleasure for i loved them very well having been at the birth of them margaret as she was going clasped them to her breast and kissed them as if it were the last time that eyer she should see them her eyes were swimming in tears and she said to the eldest jackey i am to be back very soon and then i will come and setch you she took me by the hand thanked me for being so good as to look after her children kissed them once more and departed a little time after i heard an odd sort of noise in her house that went thump as it were but imagining that she was gone out i supposed it might be only the inner door clapping to and so did not think any more about it well the evening came on it grew dark night and i saw nothing or my neighbor i thought i would go to her house and see it she was gone in to lay her hemp down before she came to fetch the children i found the door open and went in but o heavens how was i struck on beholding margaret stretched at her length stone dead at the ft of the stairs as for me i stood motionless and as cold as a stone i did not know what to do at length after trying in vain to recover her i ran to the surgeon who came and feeling her pulse shook his head and sent directly for the coroner they held an inquest the surgeon being present to examine how she came by her death and they brought it in that she must have died suddenly or that having fallen into a fit and not being able to call for help she expired in that condition i can easily imagine how it happened she had returned into her own house to go up to the lost for the bag that was to hold her hemp and as her eyes were still dimmed with tears she had missed her step in coming down and fallen from the top of the stairs with her head foremost on the ground the bag that was beside her showed it plainly yet for all that the coroner thought otherwise so the body was ordered to be buried the next morning before daylight in a corner of the churchyard and an enquiry to be made after john to know what was become of him i proposed to the parish officers to keep the two children myself for though i find it hard enough to live yet thought i the bounteous god knows that i am a helpless widow and if these two children come to my charge will surely assist me to feed them the younger brother to this did not stay long with me yesterday of all days and even not long after margaret had been buried did the worthy curate her old master come by chance to see her he knocked for some time at her door and as nobody opened he came to my window and asked me what was become of john johnson the shoemaker that lived in the next house i told him that if he would give himself the trouble to step in a moment i had many things to tell him he came in and sat down there just where you are i told him all that had happened which made him shed tears afterward i told him that john had some thoughts of applying to him in his distress he seemed surprised and assured me positively that he had not seen john the two children came up to him and he fondled them a good deal little jack asked him if he could not awake his mother who had been a long time asleep the tears came into the good curates eyes when he heard the child talk so and he said to me good woman i will send tomorrow for these two little boys and i will keep them at home with me if their father returns and should be able to bring them up i shall restore them to him whenever he requires it in the mean time i will take charge of their education all this was not very agreeable to me for i love these little innocents as if i were their mother and it would have given me some pain to see them snatched from me so soon doctor said i to him i cannot consent to part with these children i am used to them and they are used to me  well then my good woman you must give me one of them and i will leave you the other since he is likely to be so happy with you and from time to time i shall send you something toward his maintenance i could not refuse the good parson this he asked little jack if he should not like to go with him what there where my mother is said jack oh yes with all my heart  no my little man i do not mean there but to my handsome house and my handsome garden  no no let me stay here with susan i will go every day to where my mother is i would rather go there than to your handsome garden the good gentleman did not choose to trouble the child more who had gone to hide himself behind the curtains of my bed he told me that he would send his man for the youngest who would give me more trouble than the other and at his going left me some money for this child this sir is all that i have to inform you of the parents of little jack what doubles my uneasiness at present is that john does not return and that a report goes in the parish that he is gone to join a gang of smugglers and that his wife killed herself for grief these stories have gained such ground in the village that there is not one even to the children but talks of them and whenever my poor jack would go amongst the other boys they drive him away and are ready to beat him the poor child is quite dull and never stirs out now unless to go to his mothers grave  mr churchill had listened in silence to susans account and was deeply affected by it little jack was come again close up to her he looked at her with fondness and called her several times his mother at length mr charchill said to susan my worthy woman you have conducted yourself very generously toward this unfortunate family god will not fail to reward you for it   susan i have done no more than my duty we are sent into this world to assist and relieve each other i always thought that i could do nothing more pleasing in the sight of god for all the blessings that i have received from him than to comfort my poor neighbors to the utmost of my power ah if i could have done more than i did but i am possessed of nothing in the world except my cottage a little garden where i have a few greens and what i can earn by the work of my hands nevertheless for these eight years that i have been a widow god has always given me an honest support and i hope will do so while i live   mr chapter but if you keep this child the expense of maintaining him may be very inconvenient to you before he be capable of earning his bread   susan i shall always take care not to let him want we will share even to my last morsel of bread   mr chapter and how are you to furnish him with clothes   susan i leave the care of that to him who clothes the fields with grass and the trees with leaves he has given me fingers to sew and spin they shall work to clothe our poor little orphan whosoever can pray and work will never want   mr chapter then you are resolved to keep little jack with yourself   susan always sir i could not live under the thought of sending away this destitute infant from me or of setting him come upon the parish   mr chapter you are i suppose related to his family   susan no otherwise than as neighbors and fellowchristians   mr chapter then as i am also related to both of you by religion and humanity i will not suffer you alone to have all the honor of doing good to this orphan since god has provided me with the means for it more amply than you commit the education of little jack to my care and since you are so strongly attached to each other and that your benevolence merits my esteem as much as the childs affection for his mother i will take you both home with me and provide for you sell your garden and your cottage and come live at my house there you shall have a comfortable support and a home for the rest of your life   susan  looking at him affectionately do not be angry at me sir may god reward you for all your goodness but i cannot accept your offers   mr chapter and why   susan in the first place i am fond of the spot where i was born and have lived so long then again i could not suit myself to the bustle of a great house nor to the sight of so many folks in a family neither am i used to ease or nice living i should fall sick if i had nothing to do or if i eat finer food than ordinary let me bide therefore in my cottage with my little jack it will do him no harm to live a little hard nevertheless if you choose to send him now and then a small matter to pay for his schooling and to furnish him with tools for whatever trade he may take up the gracious god will not  to pay you an hundred fold at least this boy and i will  daily for you that he may i have no child he shall be instead of one to me and what little i possess shall belong to him whenever it pleases the lord to call me to himself   mr chapter well then be it so i do not wish that what i mean well should make you unhappy i will leave little jack with you since you are so well together talk to him often of me and tell him that i am in the place of a father to him while you on the other hand will take upon you the cares and the name of the mother for whom he grieves so much i shall send you every month what may be sufficient for your subsistence i will come frequently to see you and my visit shall be as much on your account as his  susan lifted up her eyes to heaven and implored its favors on mr churchill she then said to the child come hither jackey and ask this gentlemans blessing he will be your father now the little boy did so but said presently to susan how can he be my daddy he wears no apron mr churchill smiled at this innocent question of little jack and throwing his purse on the table farewell said he generous susan farewell my little friend it shall not be long before you see me again he then left them and mounting his horse took the road that led to the parish where the curate lived who had taken home the younger orphan he found the curate reading a letter on which he now and then shed tears after the first civilities mr churchill explained the subject of his visit to the worthy divine and asked him if he knew what was become of the father of those two unfortunate children sir answered the curate it is not a quarter of an hour since i received this letter written by him to his wise it was enclosed in one to me and conrains a small draft for the use of his wife he requests me to deliver it to her and to console her for his absence as she is dead i have opened the letter here it is be so kind as to read it mr churchill eagerly took the letter and read as follows  dear wife i cannot think without uneasiness on the trouble that my absence must have occasioned you but let me inform you of what has happened to me being on my way to the clergymans house i began to think in this manner of what use will it be to me to go begging thus i shall only get rid of one debt by contracting another and shall gain nothing but the uneasiness of thinking how to pay it i that am yet young and can work to go and ask so much money i shall be taken either for an idle fellow or a drinker the parson to be sure married us and loves us as his children but if he were to take a dislike and refuse me or on the other hand if he were not able to relieve us and then supposing that he advanced me the sum for a year should i be sure to have it in my power to pay him and if i did not should not i be as bad as a thief it would be defrauding him thus i reasoned my dear margaret and began afterward to think how i might extricate our affairs by acting in a juster manner i often sighed and put up my prayers to heaven at last it came into my head all at once thought i you are still a young man you are stout and able bodied what harm would there be if you went on board of a man of war for a few years you can read and write and cast accounts pretty well you may still make a fortune for your wife and children at least you may clear all your debts consider that if you have good success and happen on some prize money it will be the making of your wife for above half an hour these were my thoughts when at last i saw part of a pressgang at a distance behind me they soon came up with me and asked me whence i came where i was bound and whether i would go as a volunteer i seemed at first not to like the sea but they questioned me again and promised me a bounty of five pounds i told them that for so much i would serve during the war done said they come along with us my lad and the affair shall be settled presently they brought me before the lieutenant who asked me some questions and i answered them so much to his satisfaction that he advanced my bounty immediately and thus my dear margaret i have entered the kings service to clear my affairs i send you a draft for the five pounds i would not keep a penny of it pay the forty shillings that we owe and whatsoever else may be due with the remainder do the best you can to keep house live well that you may recover your strength clothe our children and send them soon to school i know that although you are handy and careful you will not be able to make this sum last very long but patience my wages are   s  d per month i will try if i cannot find a way to forward part of them to you at the end of a few months and whenever we arrive in harbor i shall ask leave to go on shore on purpose to see you my dear margaret do not grieve trust in god we may soon have a peace i will then return to you and we shall begin housekeeping together once more my lieutenant has promised me to write to our churchwardens that the parish may not be uneasy on my account bring up our children carefully make them stick to home and be fond of work pray with them every day and teach them their duty that they may grow up to be honest men for you are very capable of instructing them well live in the fear of the lord pray to him for me and i will pray to him in your behalf answer me soon you have only to give your letter to the doctor he knows best how to direct it remember me to the two boys tell jack that if he is a good lad i will bring him home something at my return god be praised for all things continue still to love me who remain  your ever faithful husband john johnson   mr churchills eyes were filled with tears while he read this letter when he had finished it this man cried he may truly be called a good husband a good father and an honest man sir there is a real pleasure in contributing to the happiness of such excellent people as to johns debts i will pay them and will enable him besides to take up his trade again decently let this money remain for the children who have cost their father dear and let it be divided between them as soon as they are capable of doing for themselves till then keep it in your hands and speak to them at times of it as of the strongest proof of a fathers affection i will pay you interest for it to be joined with the capital for i wish to have some part in this sacred deposit the worthy curate was too much affected to be able to answer mr churchill the latter understood the force of his silence and squeezing him by the hand took his leave  all his designs in favor of john have been executed john being safe returned enjoys an easiness of circumstances which he never experienced before and would be the happiest of men but for his grief for the loss of margaret he finds no other comfort than in talking of her constantly with susan this worthy woman looks upon herself as his sister and as a mother to his children little jack never lets a single day pass without going to his mothers grave he has made so good a use of mr churchills generosity in improving himself that this excellent gentleman has it in view to establish him in the most advantageous manner he has taken the same care of johns younger son and he never mounts his horse without recalling to mind this affecting incident whenever he meets any subject of chagrin he goes to see the persons whom he has made happy and always returns home relieved of every uneasy sensation   the masons on the ladder as mr dormer was walking one day with little archibald his son in one of the public squares they stopped before a house that was building and which was raised as high as the second story archibald remarked a number of workmen placed one above another upon the rounds of a ladder who were moving their arms up and down successively this appearance excited his curiosity papa cried he what game are those men playing let us go a little nearer to the foot of the ladder  they placed themselves in a spot where there was no danger and observed a man go and take a large stone from a heap and carry it to another man placed on the first round of the ladder and he raising his arms above his head handed the stone to a third who was placed above him who by the same operation passed it up to a fourth and thus from one hand to another the stone very soon reached the scaffold where the masons were ready to make use of it  what do you think of this sight said mr dormer to his son why are so many persons employed in building this house would it not be better that one man singly should work at it and that the rest should go and each build for himself  very true indeed papa answered archibald there would then be many more houses than there are  do you consider well said mr dormer what you now say do you know how many arts and trades are concerned in forming such a house as this one single man therefore who would undertake a building should be master of all these professions so that he would spend his whole life in acquiring those different sorts of knowledge before he could begin to build but supposing that he could in a short time perfect himself in every thing necessary to be known for the purpose see him all alone and without any assistance first digging the earth to lay his foundation then going to seek stone hewing it making mortar plaster and whitewash in short preparing every thing necessary to a mason see him fell of ardor taking his measurements raising his ladders erecting his scaffolds but in what time do you think his house would be raised to the top  archibald ah papa i am greatly afraid that he would never be able to finish it   mr dermer you are very right child and it is the same with all the labors of society were a man to withdraw himself totally and work for himself alone were he to refuse to borrow the aid of others fearing to be obliged to lend them his in return he would exhaust his strength in the undertaking and see himself quickly under the necessity of abandoning it whereas if men lend their assistance mutually they execute in a short time the most puzzling and laborious works to perform which each of them singly would require the course of a whole life it is the same also with the pleasures of life he who would taste them alone could procure to himself but few enjoyments but let all unite in contributing to their mutual happiness and each will find his share in this union  you are one day to be a member of society my dear child let the example of these workmen be always present to your memory you see how much they ease and shorten their labors by mutually aiding each other we will pass by here again some days hence and we shall find their house finished endeavor therefore to help others in their undertakings if you wish that they should in their turn exert themselves to labor for you   the sword a drama in one act characters lord onsburgh augustus his son henrietta his

aug what is it for me oh give it to me dear papa i will be so good and so diligent for the future    lord onsb ah if i thought that but do you know that a sword requires a man that he must be no longer a child who wears one but should conduct himself with circumspection and decency and in short that it is not the sword that adorns the man but the man that adorns the sword   aug oh never fear me i shall adorn mine i warrant and i will have nothing to say to those mean persons    lord onsb when do you call those mean persons   aug i mean those who cannot wear a sword and a bag those who are no of the bility as you and i are   lord onsb for my part i know no mean persons but those who have a wrong way of thinking and a worse of conducting themselves who are disobedient to their parents rude and unmannerly to others so that i see many mean persons among the nobility and many noble amongst those whom you call mean   aug yes i think in the same manner   lord onsb what were you talking then just now of a bag and sword do you think that the real advantages of nobility consist in those fopperies they serve to distinguish ranks because it is necessary that ranks should be distinguished in the world but the most levated rank does only add more disgrace to the man unworthy to fill it   aug so i believe papa but it will be no disgrace to me to have a sword and to wear it   lord onsb no i mean that you will render yourself worthy of this distinction no otherwise than by your good behavior here is your sword but remember    aug oh yes papa you shall see  he endeavors to put the sword by his side but cannot lord onsburgh helps him to bule it on   lord onsb eh why it does not sit so ill   aug does it now oh i knew that   lord onsb it becomes you surprizingly but above all things

affronting you unknowingly i wish to be informed what the respect is that you demand   aug you shall soon see my father has just sent for some of my young acquaintance if those little puppies do not

fellows give one a pull the other a pinch and play all sorts of tricks on them   henrietta those i take it are some of the duties of a gentleman that wears a sword but if those fellows should not like the sport and return it on the gentlemans ear    aug what low vulgar blood no they have neither hearts nor swords   henrietta really papa could not have given you a more useful present he saw plainly what a hero was concealed in the person of his son and that he wanted but a sword to show him in his proper light   aug hark ye sister it is my birthday we must divert ourselves however you will not say any thing of it to papa   henrietta why not he would not have given you a sword if he did not expect some exploit of this sort from a gentleman newly equipt would he have advised you otherwise   aug certainly you know that he is always preaching to me   henrietta what has he been preaching to you then   aug i dont know not i that i should adorn my sword and not my sword me   henrietta in that case you understood him properly i must say to adorn ones sword is to know how to make use of it and you are willing to show already that you have that knowledge   aug very well sister you think to joke but i would have you to know madam    henrietta oh i know extremely well all that you can tell me but do you know too that there is one principal ornament wanting to your sword   aug what is that  unbuckles the belt and looks all over the sword i do not see that there is the least thing wanting   henrietta really you are a very clever swordsman but a swordknot now ah how a blue and silver knot would dangle from that hilt   aug you are right henrietta hark ye you have a whole bandbox full of ribbands in your room so    henrietta i was thinking of it provided that you do not give me a specimen of your fencing or lay your blade about me in return   aug nonsense here is my hand that is enough you have nothing to fear but quick  a handsome knot when my little party comes they shall

uneasy my dear little friend i know all i was in the next room and heard from the beginning my sons unbecoming discourse he is the more blameable as he had just been making me the fairest promises i

blood  the children barst out a laughing   elder raynton excuse the freedom my lord that i took in teling him the truth a little bluntly   lord onsh i rather owe you my thanks for it you are an excellent young gentleman and deserve much better than he does to wear this badge of honor as a token of my esteem and acknowledgment accept this sword but i will first put a blade to it that may be

sir  to augustus do not offer to stir from this place you may celebrate your birthday here all alone you shall never have a sword until you deserve it if you were even to grow old without wearing one   priscilla and marcus mrs carey a young widow had two children prisilla and marcus both equally deserving of her affectin which nevertheless they shared very unequally  young as she was perceived her mamas part ality to her brother it afflicted her but she conceled within her own breast the sorrow which this preserence o ioned her though not disagreeably plain  features did not correspond with the charms of her ind but her brother was beautiful as the god of love is painted to us all the fndness all the caresses of mrs carey were lavished on him alone and the servants to gain the favor of their mistress were studious to flatter him in all his fancies priscilla on the contrary from her mothers coldness found herself the more slighted by the rest of the family far from anticipating her wishes they even neglected her real wants she would shed floods of tears when she found herself alone and forsaken by every body but never suffered the slightest complaint or mark of discontent to escape her in the presence of others in vain did she endeavor by a constant observance of her duty by her mildness and her attentions to make amends in her mothers opinion for the deficiency of her beauty the qualities of her mind were unnoticed by eyes accustomed only to look on outward advantages mrs carey not much affected by the marks of tenderness which priscilla showed her seemed particularly since her husbands death to view her with a kind of disgust she was continually chiding her and required perfections in her which could not even be expected from an understanding far more advanced  this unjust mother fell sick marcus appeared strongly touched at her sufferings but priscilla who in the softened looks and languid countenance of her mother thought she perceived an abatement of her accustomed severity far surpassed her brother in her care and vigilance attentive to her mothers slightest wants she exerted all her penetration to discover them that she might spare her even the trouble of expressing them while her mothers illness had the least appearance of danger she never quitted her pillow entreaties or even commands could not prevail upon her to take a moments repose at length mrs carey recovered this happy circumstance dissipated the apprehensions of priscilla but her sorrows began afresh when she saw her mama reassume her usual severity toward her  one day when mrs carey was discoursing with her children of the pains that she had suffered during her illness and was thanking them for the tender and earnest affection which their cares for her had testified my dear children added she you may both ask of me whatever will give you most pleasure i promise to grant it to you if your desires are within the extent of my fortune  what do you wish marcus said she first to her son  a watch and a cane mama replied he  you shall have them tomorrow morning  and you priscilla  me mama me answered she trembling i have nothing to wish for if you love me  that is not an answer you shall have your recompense too miss what would you wish speak  though priscilla had been accustomed to this tone of severity yet she felt it more sensibly on this occasion than ever she had done before she threw herself at her mothers feet looked up to her with eyes all drowned in tears and suddenly hiding her face with both her hands lisped out these words give me only two kisses such as you give my brother  mrs careys heart melted at these words and she felt those sentiments of affection to her daughter now revive which she had hitherto suppressed taking her up in her arms she clasped her to her breast and loaded her with kisses priscilla who for the first time received her mothers caresses gave a loose to the effusions of her joy and love she kissed her cheeks her eyes her breast her hands and marcus who could not help loving his sister mixed his embraces with here is they all enjoyed a happiness which was not confined to the present moment mrs carey repaid with interest to priscilla that affection which she had before withheld from her and priscilla returned it with new marks of tenderness nor was marcus in the least jealous on this account but rejoiced in his sisters happiness he soon reaped the reward of so generous a behavior the natural goodness of his disposition having been a little injured by the weakness and doting fondness of his mother he gave way in youth to many little indiscretions which would have lost him her heart but priscilla always found means to excuse him to her the sensible advice too which she gave him completed the reform of his manners and they all three experienced that there is no true happiness in a family without the most cerdial union between brothers and sisters and the most lively and equal affection between parents and children  the lamb little flora the daughter of a poor countryman was seated one morning by the side of the road holding on her lap a porringer of milk for her breakfast in which she sopped a few slices of coarse black bread just then a farmer was passing the road who had in his cart about a score of lambs that he was going to sell at the market these poor creatures crowded one upon the other with their feet tied together and their heads hanging down filled the air with plaintive bleatings which pierced the heart of flora but were heard by the farmer with an ear of unconcern  when he was come up opposite to the little country girl he threw down before her a lamb which he was carrying across his shoulder there my girl said he is a goodfornothing beast that has just died and made me five shillings the poorer take it if you will and make a stew of it  flora quitted her breakfast laid down her porringer and her bread and taking up the lamb began to examine it with looks of compassion but said she immediately why should i pity you today or tomorrow they would have run a great knife through your throat while now you have nothing more to fear while she was speaking thus the lamb revived by the warmth of her arms opened its eyes a little made a slight motion and cried baa faintly as if it was calling its mother it would be difficult to express the little girls joy she covers the lamb with her apron and over that with her stuff petticoat bends her breast down toward her lap to warm it still more and blows with all her force into its nostrils and mouth she felt the poor animal stir by degrees and at each of its motions she felt her own heart throb encouraged by this first success she crumbles some soft bread into her porringer and taking it up in her fingers with some difficulty forced it between its teeth which were shut fast the lamb which was dying only through hunger felt itself a little strengthened by this nourishment it began now to stretch its limbs to shake its head to wag its tail and to prick up its ears it had soon strength enough to support itself upon its legs and then went of its own accord to floras porringer who smiled to see it drink up her breakfast in short before a quarter of an hour was past it had already played a thousand little gambols  flora transported with joy took it up in her arms and running to the cottage showed it to her mother baba so she named it became from that moment the object of all her cares she shared with it the little bread which was given her for her meals and would not have exchanged it singly for the largest flock in the neighborhood baba was so gratefully sensible of her fondness that she never quitted flora a single step she would come to eat out of her hand would frisk round her and whenever she was obliged to go out without her would bleat most pitifully  this was not the only recompense with which heaven repaid floras compassionate tenderness baba brought forth young lambs and these others in their turn so that in a few years after flora had a pretty flock that nourished all her family with their milk and furnished them comfortable clothing from their wool  the vinestump mr sutton being at his country house in the spring went out with his son julius to walk in his garden the violet and primrose were in their bloom and many trees began already to show their budding verdure and to be clothed in white and crimson blossoms  they went by chance into a summer house at the foot of which rose a vinestump twisting wildly and stretching its naked branches in a rude irregular manner papa cried julius see this ugly tree how it points at me why do not you have martin to grub it up and make firewood of it at the same time he began to pull at it in order to tear it up but its roots had taken too firm hold in the earth do not molest it said mr sutton to his son i will have it stand as it is and at the proper time i shall tell you my reasons  julius but papa see close by it those lively blossoms of the lilac and the laurustinus why is not it as well adorned as they are if it is to be kept it spoils and disfigures the garden shall i go and tell martin to pluck it up   mr sutton no my dear i tell you i will have it stand as it is at least a little longer  julius persevered in condemning it his father tried to divert his attention to other objects and the unfortunate vinestump was forgotten  mr suttons affairs called him to a distant part of the country he set off the next day and did not return till the middle of autumn his first care was to visit his country house whither he brought his son once more the day being very hot they went to enjoy the shade of the summer house ah papa said julius what a charming green shade i thank you for having that ugly dry stump plucked up that i was so uneasy to see last spring and for putting in its place this handsome shrub to give me an agreeable surprise what delightful fruit see these fine grapes some purple others almost black there is not a single tree in the garden that looks so well they have all lost their fruit but this  see how it is covered see those large green leaves that hide the clusters i should like to know if the fruit be as good as it appears handsome  mr sutton gave him a grape to taste this renewed his joy and how much was it enlivened when his father informed him that from those berries was produced that delicious liquor which he sometimes tasted after dinner you seem to be astonished my dear said mr sutton i should surprise you much more were i to tell you that this is the same crooked misshapen stump that pointed at you in the spring i will go if you choose and order martin to pluck it up and make firewood of it   julius oh by no means papa let him take all the others in the garden before this i do like the grapes so well   mr sutton you see then julius that i did well in not following your advice what has happened to you happens frequently in the world we see a child ill clothed and of an unpleasing outside appearance we despise him and grow proud on comparing ourselves with him we even carry our cruelty so far as to address him with insulting discourses beware my child of such hasty judgments in this person so little favored by nature dwells perhaps an exalted soul which will one day astonish the world by its great virtues or enlighten it by its knowledge it is a rugged stem but may produce the noblest fruits   caroline little caroline of whom we have spoken page    was one day playing beside her mother who was then busy writing letters the hairdresser being come mrs p  told him to step into an adjoining dressing room with caroline and to take a little of her hair off instead of a little the hairdresser took off so much that the little girls head was entirely naked her mother entered just as this unlucky operation was finished ah my poor caroline exclaimed she you have lost all your fine hair  do not be uneasy mama answered caroline with the greatest simplicity it is not lost it is put up in that drawer  last summer vacation while she was in the country a chicken was served up at dinner and mrs p  who had no company but her children having helped her eldest daughter to some of it offered a bit to caroline  no mama answered she with a sigh i shall not eat any of it   and why my dear   because mama that chicken and i saw one another every day and we lived very friendly together   but your sister eats some of it   oh my sister may eat it to be sure she was not so well acquainted with it as i was  what may not be hoped from a child born with such amiable simplicity and such tenderness of heart may she resemble her mother more and more and all my wishes for her will be accomplished  the farmer sir john downton had shut himself up one morning in his study in order to give his attention to some affairs of consequence a servant came to inform him that farmer martin his tenant was at the streetdoor and desired to speak with him sir john ordered him to show the farmer into the drawing room and to request him to stay a moment until his letters should be finished robert arthur and sophia sir john downtons children were in the drawing room when mr martin was introduced he saluted them respectfully as he entered but it was easy to see that he had not learned his bow from the dancing master nor were his compliments of a more elegant turn the two boys looked one at the other smiling with an air of contempt their eyes measured him very familiarly from head to foot they whispered each other and laughed out so loud that the poor man blushed and did not know what countenance to put on robert even carried his incivility so far as to walk round him holding his nose and asking his brother arthur do not you perceive something of the smell of a dungheap and going for a chasing dish of hot coals he burnt some paper over it and carried it round the room to disperse as he said the unpleasant smell he then called a servant and desired him to sweep up the dirt that martin had left on the floorcloth with his nailed shoes arthur mean time held hissides laughing at his brothers impertinences  it was not the same with sophia their sister instead of imitating the rudeness of her brothers she reproved them for it endeavored to excuse them to the farmer and approaching him with looks of goodnature offered him wine to refresh himself made him sit down and took his hat and stick herself and laid them by in the mean time sir john came out of his study and approaching farmer martin in a friendly manner took him by the hand asked how his wife and children were and what had brought him to town sir answered the farmer i come to pay you my halfyears rent and at the same time he drew out of his pocket a leathern bag full of money you will not be displeased continued he that i have been something beyond my time our roads were so flooded that i could not carry my corn to market sooner  i am not at all displeased with you replied sir john i know that you are an honest man and have no occasion to be put in mind of your engagements at the same time he had a table laid before the farmer to count the money on robert stared at the sight of farmer martins guineas and seemed to look at him with a little more respect  when sir john had counted the farmers money and found it right the latter drew out of his greatcoat pocket a small jar of candied fruits i have brought something said he for the young folks will not you be so good sir john as to let them come out one of these days and take a mouthful of the country air with us i would try to entertain and amuse them too as well as i could i have two good stout nags and would come for them myself and take them down in my fourwheeled chaise  sir john premised to go and see him and would have kept him to dinner but mr martin thanked him for his kind invitation and excused himself for not being able to accept it as he had many bargains to make in town and was in a hurry to return home sir john filled his pockets with cakes for his children thanked him for the present that he had made to his and having wished him good health as well to support his fatigues as on his familys account saw him down stairs and took his leave  as soon as he was gone sophia before her brothers informed her father of the rude reception which they had given to the honest farmer sir john expressed his displeasure at robert and arthur and at the same time commended sophia for her conduct i see said he kissing her that my little sophia knows how to behave herself to honest people  as it was about breakfast hour he opened the farmers jar of fruits and eat some of them with his daughter and they both thought them excellent robert and arthur were at table too but were not invited to taste the fruits they devoured them with their eyes but sir john did not seem to observe their longings he resumed his commendations of sophia and exhorted her never to despise a person for the plainness of his dress for said he if we were to behave politely only to those who are well clad we should seem to direct our civilities to the dress not to the person who wears it people in the most homely clothing are often the most honest we have an instance of it in farmer martin he not only by his labor supports himself his wife and children but during these six years that he is my tenant he pays his rents so punctually that i have never had the smallest fault to find with him in that respect yes my dear sophia if this man was not so honest i could not supply the expense of maintaining you and your brothers it is he who clothes you and procures you a good education for it is in clothing you and paying the expenses of your instruction that i dispose of the sums which he pays me every halfyear  after the breakfast was finished he ordered the remainder to be locked up in the beauset robert and arthur followed it with desiring eyes and saw plainly that it was not kept for them in this their father soon confirmed them do not expect said he to taste these fruits either today or any other time when the farmer who brought them shall have reason to be satisfied with you he will not fail to send you some  robert but papa is it my fault if he did not smell well   sir john how did he smell then   robert of the dungheap insufferably   sir john whence could he have contracted that smell   robert from his loading carts with it every day   sir john what should he do then to get rid of it   robert he should  he should    sir john he should perhaps not put dung upon his grounds at all   robert there is only that way   sir john but if he did not enrich his land how could he draw a plentiful crop from it and if he had always bad crops how could he manage to pay me the rent of his farm  robert would have replied but his father gave him a look in which arthur and he plainly read his displeasure  the next sunday very early the good farmer was at sir john downtons door he sent up his compliments and kindly invited him to come and take an excursion to his farm sir john pleased with his hearty obliging manner would not mortify him by a refusal robert and arthur earnestly entreated their father to make them of the party and promised to behave themselves more civilly sir john yielding to their solicitations they mounted the fourwheeled chaise with joyful looks and as the farmer had a pair of excellent horses and drove well they were at his house before they had any suspicion of it who can describe their satisfaction when the chaise stopped cicely wife to farmer martin appeared with a smiling countenance at the wicket which she opened and saluted her guests and taking the children in her arms to help them down she kissed them and led them into the yard all her own children were there in their best clothes who welcomed the young gentlemen saluting them with great respect sir john would willingly have stopped a moment to talk with the little ones and caress them but mrs martin pressed him to go in lest the coffee should grow cold it was already poured out at a table which was covered with a napkin as white as snow the coffeepot was not of silver nor the cups of china yet every thing was in the neatest order robert and arthur however looked at each other slily and would have burst out in a laugh if they had not feared to offend their father but cicely guessing their thoughts by the looks which they exchanged made an apology for their fare which she confessed was not so fine as they would have had at their own house however she hoped that they would be satisfied with the cheerful entertainment of poor people with the coffee they had muffins of a delicious taste it was easy to see that mrs martin had used all her art in kneading and baking them  after breaksast the farmer asked sir john to look at his orchard and grounds to which he consented cicely took all the pains imaginable to make this walk agreeable to the children she showed them all her flocks which covered the fields and gave them the prettiest lambs to play with she then led them to her pigeonhouse every thing there was clean and wholesome there were on the ground two young pigeons which had just quitted their nest but did not dare as yet to trust their callow wings some of the mothers were sitting over their eggs and others busied in giving nourishment to their young which had just broken the shell from the pigeonhouse they went to the beehives cicely took care that they should not go too near them but however she gave them a view of the bees at work  as most of these sights were new to the children they seemed very much delighted with them they were even going to take a second review of them if farmer martins youngest son tom had not come to inform them that dinner waited they were served on pewter and drank out of delft ware but robert and arthur were still so full of the pleasure of their mornings walk that they were ashamed to indulge their satirical humor they thought every thing excellent it is true cicely had surpassed herself in preparing them the best cheer  after dinner sir john perceived two fiddles hung up against the wall what person here plays those instruments said he  my eldest son and i answered the farmer and without saying any more he made a sign to luke his son to take down the fiddles they played by turns some old tunes on the fiddles both sprightly and pathetic of which sir john expressed his satisfaction in the most flattering manner  as they were going to hang up the instruments again come robert and arthur said sir john it is now your turns play us some of your best tunes and at the same time he put the fiddles into their hands but they did not know even how to hold the bow and their confusion raised a general laugh  sir john then requested the farmer to put the horses to that they might return to town martin pressed him strongly to pass the night with him but at length yielded to sir johns excuses  well robert said that gentleman to his son as they returned how do you find yourself after your little journey   robert very well papa those good people have done their utmost to give us every satisfaction   sir j downton i am happy to see you satisfied but if farmer martin had not taken so much pains in doing the honors of his house if he had not offered you the smallest refreshment would you have been as well pleased with him as you now seem to be   robert no certainly   sir john what would you have thought of him   robert that he was an unmannerly clown   sir john robert robert this honest man came to our house and far from offering him any refreshment you made game of him which then is the best bred you or the farmer   robert  blushing but it is his duty to receive us well he gains by our lands   sir john what do you call gaining   robert i mean that he finds it his advantage to gather in the crops of our cornfieldsd and the hay of our meadows   sir john you are right a farmer has occasion for all that but what does he do with the grain   robert he maintains with it himself his wife and his children   sir john and with the hay   robert he gives it to his horses to eat   sir john and what does he do with his horses   robert he uses them in plowing the ground   sir john thus you see that one part of what he gains from the earth returns to it but do you believe that he consumes the remainder with his family and his horses   robert the cows have their part of it too   arthur and his sheep too and his pigeons and his poultry   sir john that is true but are his whole crops consumed upon his own ground   robert no i remember to have heard him say that he took part of them to market to sell for money   sir john and what does he do with this money   robert i saw last week that he brought you a leathern bag full of it   sir john you now see who draws the greatest profit from my lands the farmer or i it is true he feeds his horses with hay from the meadows but his horses serve to plow the fields which without these plowings would be exhausted by weeds he feeds his sheep too and his cows with the hay but their dung contributes to make the fallow grounds fruitful his wife and his children are sed with the corn of the harvests but in return they pass the summer in weeding the crops and afterward some in reaping them some in threshing and these labors again turn to my advantage the rest of his corn and hay he takes to market to sell them but it is in order to give me the money that he receives suppose that there remains some part for himself is it not fair that he should have a recompense for his labors now therefore once more tell me which of us two draws the greatest profits from my lands   robert i now plainly see that you do   sir john and without this tenant should i have that profit   robert oh there are many tenants to be had   sir john you are right but not one more honest than this i had formerly let this farm to another who impoverished the land cut down the trees and let the outhouses run to ruin at quarterday he never had any money for me and when i would expostulate with him he showed me clearly that his whole stock was not sufficient to answer my demand   robert ah the knave   sir john if this man were of the same kind should i receive much profit from my estate   robert certainly not   sir john to whom then am i obliged for what i do receive   robert i see that you owe it to this honest farmer   sir john is it not therefore our duty to receive a man well who renders us so great services   robert ah papa you make me see very plainly that i was wrong  for some minutes a deep silence ensued sir john then resumed the discourse thus robert why did not you play upon the fiddle   robert you know papa that i have never learned   sir john then farmer martins son knows something that you do not   robert that is true but then does he understand latin as i do   sir john and do you know how to plow can you drive a team can you sow wheat barley oats and other grain or rear a crop of them would you know how so much as to fix a hoppole or prune a tree so as to have good fruit   robert i have no occasion to know all that i am no farmer   sir john but if all the people in the world knew nothing else but latin how would things go then   robert very ill we should have no bread no vegetables   sir john and could the world do very well even though nobody knew latin   robert i believe it could   sir john remember then all your life what you have just seen and heard this farmer so coarsely clad who saluted and addressed you in so rustic a manner this man is better bred than you knows much more than you and things of much greater use therefore you see how unjust it is to despise any one for the plainness of his dress or the ungracefulness of his manner   the fathers reconciled by their children a drama in one act characters mr crumpton constantine his son alicia his daughter thomas son of the apothecary of the village grace his sister the scene lies in a garden under the windows of mr crumptons house in the country on one side a summer house and at the bottom of the stage a tuft of trees  scene i mr crumpton alicia and constantine alicia but papa    mr crumpton i repeat it to you let neither of you henceforward under pain of my displeasure have the least connection with the apothecarys children   alicia what has made you so angry then with mr garvey   mr crumpton am i obliged to give you an account   constantine no certainly it does not become us to question you  to alicia when my papa gives his orders it is our business to obey without reply   mr crumpton yes that is my meaning mr garvey is an obstinate disobliging person ungrateful to refuse such a matter to me who am his landlord and from whom he enjoys his fortune and livelihood   constantine that is scandalous papa and i do not know why we have been so long connected with the children of such people indeed if there had been one genteel boy besides in our neighborhood i should never have spoken a word to thomas   alicia o papa can you hear my brother talk so thomas and grace are such good children we should be very happy if we were as good as they   mr crumpton what is it to me whether they be good or bad once more i forbid you to have a word of discourse with them or else i shall keep you shut up at home   constantine let thomas dare so much as to come sneaking about this garden i will give him    mr crumpton what would you say i do not intend that they should be illtreated or affronted in the smallest matter   constantine  confused nay i do not mean that neither i only say that i will not let them come within a hundred yards of us oh i shall keep a look out   alicia yet you had so great a friendship for mr garvey you looked upon him as so honest a man as a man of so much learning and good sense you remember very well that it was he who taught my brother latin and gave me my first lessons in spelling merely through friendship before we had a master   mr crumpton all that may be but i forbid another word on the subject i will have nothing to say to him as you shall have nothing to say to his children what i think you cry dry up those tears miss have you then so little respect for your fathers commands that it costs you tears to obey them   alicia no papa but pardon this last mark of regard that my heart affords them i shall not be less obedient than my brother   constantine we shall see who will be most dutiful   alicia at least you will not insist that i should hate them it would not be in my power to obey you   mr crumpton neither to hate them nor to use them ill only to break off all connection with them this is my order   alicia i will do whatever is your pleasure but i have one favor to ask you   mr crumpton what is that   alicia that i may speak to them once more to tell them your orders   constantine for what all correspondence is at an end   mr crumpton i think your request reasonable and grant it you may tell them at the same time that their father must pay me in three days or else he will repent it   alicia how my dear papa does mr garvey owe you any thing   mr crumpton do you think that i would ask him for what he did not owe me but that does not concern you only remember to obey me  he goes out   scene ii alicia and constantine alicia well brother is this your friendship for thomas and grace   constantine well sister is this your obedience to your father   alicia you pretend to obedience it is hypocrisy nothing more you only flatter him to wheedle some money from him you love nothing in the world   constantine because i do not take pleasure in continually disobliging him would you have me run after these children now he has forbidden me   alicia you little deserved their friendship if it costs you no more to give it up but whenever your expectations from any one are at an end your affection for them soon vanishes   constantine as if i had ever any thing to expect from children of that sort   alicia what was that case then of mother of pearl which you prevailed on grace to give you not a week ago and those tablets that you contrived to coax so dexterously from tommy yesterday you have cringed to them a thousand times for a nosegay or an orange and now    constantine now i must obey but truly the apothecarys children are fine company to grieve after   alicia yes and i shall see you perhaps this evening in the middle of the dirtiest boys of the village   constantine i shall not lose much by the exchange   alicia and they still less   constantine i do not care but here comes mr thomas advise him as a tender friend not to come too near me   alicia if you do not like to see him you may go away   constantine i do not like to see him and i will stay   scene iii alicia constantine thomas carrying a little wooden house painted blue thomas  to alicia oh how glad i am to find you   constantine dear tom what have you there in that little house   thomas it is a present that mr billingsleys gamekeeper made me   constantine and you come to make me a present of it my dear friend   alicia  aside the hypocrite   thomas it is for miss alicia   alicia for me no no my friend since it is a present to you i will not deprive you of it  but pray what is it   constantine  imperiously come i will see what it is  endeavors to snatch the wooden house from thomas who holds it forcibly some ugly bird i suppose   thomas an ugly bird no you are out guess miss but i wont keep you in pain it is a squirrel oh a comical little beast it is he always strives to hide himself in your pocket then he comes to eat out of your hand and he runs after you like a little spaniel  he takes it out of its house and gives its chain to alicia dont let it go though he must grow tame with you otherwise he would take a trip to the grove   constantine  with a look of envy a fine present indeed a squirrel it smells like a polecat   alicia o the charming little creature how sprightly it looks   thomas i could have wished master constantine to have another to offer you and i will bring you the first that i have when he is a little used to you miss he will play such tricks as will make you die with laughing he is worse than a monkey   alicia for that reason master tommy i will not deprive you of it  to the squirrel come little rogue go into your house again you must take it back friend thomas   constantine yes do not you hear you must take it back   thomas how he is not mine now you would not disoblige me miss alicia no i know you would not  he runs to the summer house there i will leave him here on the bench   constantine  to alicia only dare to take it and see if papa will not make you pay dear for it   alicia i am almost inclined to take it because of your threatening my papa has not forbidden me to receive squirrels i am sorry for poor tom that i have nothing to give him in return but a sad farewell   constantine well leave it to me i will dismiss both him and his squirrel   alicia no no do not take that trouble  to thomas as be returns once more my friend i cannot accept your present i have such disagreeable news for you that i do not know    constantine yes yes mr thomas if you show yourself before our garden or only look at the walls of our house    thomas what could you have the heart sir to hinder me i thought you had more friendship for me   constantine our friendship is broken off to let you know and pray do not think    alicia i beg you will excuse his ill manners you do not know perhaps that your father has had a quarrel with ours   thomas pardon me i know it and it has made me uneasy enough however i did not think that the matter went so far as to break off our friendship and i should still less have expected it from master constantine   constantine sister will you send him away immediately or shall i go and acquaint my papa   thomas if you are to have any trouble on my account miss alicia    alicia do not fear my friend you may stay awhile my papa will not take it amiss   constantine we shall see that i will open the cause to him  he goes out but returns a moment afterward and slips into the summer house unperceived   scene iv alicia thomas thomas for heavens sake miss alicia tell me what have i done then to your brother   alicia in the first place the matter is that he is a little jealous on account of the squirrel that you have given me then he thinks that he will curry favor with our papa in taking part in his quarrel with yours for my papa is very angry and i do not know why   thomas nor i neither i only heard my father say as he walked about by himself i could not have expected this from mr crumpton he then went to find my mother and as my sister was with her then she must know what the business was   alicia in the mean time my papa has forbidden us to see you or speak to you   thomas what shall i see you no more shall i not be allowed to speak to you ah how shall i part with you what will my poor sister do who is so fond of you oh dear what have we done then   alicia comfort yourself my dear thomas we shall still be good friends and if we are forbidden to see each other who will hinder us to think one of the other thus for instance when i play with your squirrel i shall think of you i will always call him by your name oh how i shall love him   thomas how happy you make me in telling me so i do not know whether i should now grieve any more but here comes my sister she looks very dull   scene v alicia thomas grace alicia  running to meet grace and saluting her my dear grace   grace my good miss alicia  constantine appears at the bottom of the stage leading mr crumpton privately behind the summer house   thomas  to grace ah you are going to hear disagreeable news   grace and i bring you no better my father and mother are in such trouble    thomas did i not tell you so well what passed   grace your father perhaps may be angry with ours but certainly his demand is something unreasonable   alicia unreasonable that cannot be ah if it were so i should still have hopes of persuading him tell me however what is it   grace you know that handsome tuft of trees that is behind your garden   alicia oh yes where we used to go in the spring evenings to hear the nightingale sing a charming little grove   grace you know too that this little grove was given to my father by old mr drury in return for his services to him during his lifetime   alicia well   grace well mr crumpton wants to have it   alicia what my papa   thomas what our pretty little grove   grace my father told him that he should be very happy to oblige him that he should never forget how much he and his family were indebted to him but that his friend had desired him on his deathbed never to part with this grove that it might always serve to keep him in his memory   alicia with all the respect that i owe my papa i cannot d but he is in the wrong here but however he would not have it for nothing that is not his way of thinking   grace oh dear no he means to pay my father for it and even perhaps more than it is worth   thomas and what does he wish to do with it has he not a view of it as well as we   grace he wants to cut down all those fine trees   alicia and thomas cut them down   grace you know the hill that is behind the grove he says that will make a fine prospect now the grove is at the foot of the hill so to have the prospect he must cut down the grove   alicia ah now i see why he brought down an architect from town who talks to him about grottos and bridges and chinese temples my father dreams of nothing but improvements he has a plan of them continually in his hands and talks of them a hundred times a day even to me and i who made myself so happy to see all those fine things shortly ah i will have nothing to do with them let your father keep his grove   thomas what would become of the birds that chirp so sweetly on those venerable trees and who generally built their nests there because nobody disturbed them and we carried them food there   grace and the refreshing cool that we breathed there in the hot summer days   alicia and the echo that used to answer us from the hill when we sung   grace the prospect of a grove in full leaf is i believe as good as that of a hill   alicia and then what occasion has my father for a new prospect he has so many others on every side   thomas i should think that one of my own limbs was lop off at every stroke of the hatchet   alicia no no your father must not deprive himself of his grove   grace must not ah he will not keep it long   alicia why not my papa will never go and take it from him by force i suppose he has not the power   thomas but if he is angry with us and has forbidden you to see and speak to us i would rather give ten groves like that   grace and dont you think that i would too what should i do there without you miss alicia i should never have any desire to go into it   alicia my dear grace we used to be so happy in it do you remember when we used to go there in the evening and tell each other every thing that had happened to us in the day   grace yes and each brought her work you sewed and i knitted then when thomas brought us flowers we left off our work to make nosegays you gave me yours and i gave you mine that was enough to make us think of each other the whole next day   thomas and now that is all over never to return   alicia no we shall have no more such delightful moments it will make me grow sick and then my papa will be sorry and i will tell him that if he would restore me to health he must allow me to see my little friends again  they all three embrace and weep   grace but meantime the grove will be cut down it certainly must   alicia and why   grace ah miss alicia i have not told you all about ten years ago mr crumpton lent my father fifty pounds to set him up and you know that my father has never yet been able to pay him   alicia  aside ah this was the debt mentioned just now   grace if we will keep the grove mr crumpton will have  fifty pounds and my father does not know how to raise them amongst all his friends there is none but your papa himself that could furnish him with so great a sum and he is the very person that demands it   alicia  taking bath their hands oh if there be nothing but that i can settle it   grace settle it   thomas you miss   alicia  with joy in her countenance do you promise not to betray me   grace i betray you   thomas ah can you doubt but we will promise   alicia well then hear me you know  i cannot think of it without being moved still  you know how fone my mama was of me in her last illness one day when i was alone with her she called me to her bed side shedding a flood of tears she kissed me and taking a purse from under her pillow here my dear alicia said she take this i forbid you to let any one know that i have given it to you keep this money for important occasions you have a kind heart and a good understanding for your age it was mama however that said this you will know how to dispose of it worthily your father has a noble and generous soul but is something passionate and revengeful you may perhaps spare him occasions of vexation or sorrow on so extensive an estate as ours there must be many poor people who have suffered undeserved losses such you may assist in secret you may also repay such services as may be done you without having always recourse to your father it is through your hands that i have for these two years past distributed my favors and my assistance i hope that you have acquired sufficient discernment to distinguish those who have a claim to pity in short i doubt not but you will make the best use of this little sum which i trust to your hands for the benefit of honesty in distress i shall think that i myself have done the good which you shall do and it is the best means by which i can be present to your memory she was so exhausted that she could say no more but i shall ever remember this discourse as long as i live   grace  wiping her eyes excellent lady   thomas my father and mother never speak of her but with tears in their eyes   alicia my mama had a great friendship for them too she told me at her death always to look upon mr garvey as one of my best friends and to follow his sensible advice in every thing you see then that i have obligations to you how happy am i in honoring mamas memory in satisfying my own gratitude in saving my papa from an act of injustice in sparing him the sorrow that he would feel for it in preserving every thing the charming little tuft of trees our own friendship the pleasure of seeing each other as before    grace  throwing her arms round her neck o my dear miss alicia   thomas  taking her hand my father will bless you in his heart but he will never take your money   alicia certainly he will take it if i request him nobody in the world shall know any thing of it stay here my dear friends i will go for it   thomas i shall not take the charge of it however   alicia you shall my dear grace and thomas if you hinder her take notice i do not accept your squirrel i obey my father rigorously i never look at you again i never go either to your house or into the grove again   grace well miss since you speak in that manner    alicia  stopping her mouth you do not know what you say i will not even hear you stay for me i shall soon return if i am not interrupted i shall write a few lines to your father in case that i cannot join you again i will put the purse near the summer house there under that large stone mark the place well now do you hear   grace i am sure that my father will send me back with your money   alicia let him beware of that besides you will not know where to find me for alas it is perhaps the last time that we are allowed to discourse together   grace ah miss alicia what cruel words   alicia i must certainly obey my father but we are neighbors we are not forbidden to look at each other and whenever our eyes can meet unobserved    grace oh mine shall take care to seek yours and to tell them that i shall never forget to love you   thomas who will hinder us to be in your way when you go out to walk and then    alicia you are right a smile a little wink or side look can pass without being seen come take comfort all will go well but where is the squirrel as i am going into my room i will carry it up   thomas stop a moment i will go and fetch his house and carr it for you as far as your door  runs to the summer house   alicia good bye my dear grace   grace ah miss alicia i cannot believe that it is to be for ever   thomas  returning in a fright with the squirrels house bless me the squirrel is not here   alicia what my squirrel gone o dear thomas   thomas somebody must have opened the door for i remember to have shut it   alicia it can be none but my brother he was jealous that you made me a present of it and while we were speaking here he slipped into the summer house and opened his little door   thomas if he only carried away the squirrel to play with him a little   alicia i know him better than you do he has let him run away   thomas well stay he cannot be very far off if i can discover him upon some tree i need only show him a nut to make him come down immediately i will go and hunt all about   alicia  to thomas i wish you success in the chase my dear friend  to grace poor thomas i pity him he was so happy in making me that present   grace that is true indeed he never was at ease until he had brought it to you   alicia well i must leave you my dear grace i will take the terrace walk it leads to the house and do you go out by the little door of the garden and slip round along the wall you need only stand under my window without taking notice of any thing i will throw you the purse with a letter if my papa is not in my way i will come and bring them to you myself   grace o my dear generous friend what good nature  they go out different ways   scene vi mr crumpton constantine constantine well papa was i wrong you see what pains my sister takes to obey you   mr crumpton and what is this story of a squirrel   constantine i did not tell it to you while we were hid because they would have heard us but here is the affair the dear friend thomas made a present of the squirrel to the dear friend alicia the dear friend alicia received this ugly little beast with so much pleasure that she calls it her dear friend tommy but i have managed so that she has not had much amusement with it   mr crumpton how so   constantine they put the squirrels little house on the summer house bench i slipped in there whilst they were taking a tender farewell i opened the little door took the squirrel out and let him loose amongst the trees i saw him soon climb up into a tree and jump from branch to branch they will be pretty cunning if they ever catch him again   mr crumpton then sir you have done a very rascally action did not i forbid you to molest those poor children and you knew very well the trouble that you were going to cause to your sister   constantine since she disobeyed you did she not deserve to be punished   mr crumpton is it to you that the right of punishing her belonged run tell the gardener and his people to look for the squirrel and to bring it to me   constantine but papa you forbad my sister any communication with mr garveys children and will you suffer her to receive a present from them   mr crumpton was thomas informed of my intentions when he brought the squirrel   constantine at least alicia knew them and was not that disobeying you   mr crumpton it belonged to me to determine that she certainly would have showed me the present that she received and if i thought it proper i should order her to return it again i say run and let this squirrel be found again or you shall answer to me for it   constantine but papa you have heard them talk finely my sister has money unknown to you and she gives it to mr garvey to pay you should not i do better to go and watch grace to surprise her when she receives the purse and to bring it to you   mr crumpton only dare to do it you know my orders obey   constantine  murmuring i thought that i had done such fine things   scene vii mr crumpton musing yes i see that i have suffered my passion to carry me too far what a pattern of friendship gratitude and generosity do these children show it is true i had forbidden alicia  but should i have forbidden her should i suppress those sentiments in her heart to which i myself had given birth could i deprive her of the only happiness which she enjoys in this solitude the greatest happiness of human life an amiable and virtuous society with children of her own age a blessing the loss of which i could not make good with all my fortune and for what reason to satisfy an empty whim my dear alicia neither those grottos those bridges those chinese temples nor all those ornaments with which i meant to embellish my garden nothing in short could have made you forget the unadorned grove where friendship found so sweet a retreat what a lesson is this to me but for you i was also going to lose a valuable friendship however you preserve to me the precious blessing you save me from injustice and remorse how your noble conduct makes me feel the unworthiness of your brother illnatured boy in what an odious light has he shown himself but let me banish this mortifying idea from my heart i am impatient to know if mr garvey thinks as generously as his children the part that he takes will determine my happiness i have either lost a friend underserving of my attachment or i shall now find one worthy of me  alicia crossing the bottom of the stage on tiptoes mr crumpton perceives her and calls alicia  she goes on mr crumpton calls a second time alicia come hither   scene viii mr crumpton alicia mr crumpton where were you going why did you strive to avoid me   alicia  confused because  i was afraid to disturb you papa   mr crumpton you were going perhaps to seek the squirrel that thomas gave you as a present   alicia yes papa it is true he has given me one i suppose constantine told you   mr crumpton you did not receive it i presume   alicia i no  oh yes how could i avoid it poor tommy he was in such joy when he offered it to me   mr crumpton you must return it   alicia yes papa if i had it but it has run away   mr crumpton is this true alicia   alicia yes sir i assure you i can show you his house it is empty   mr crumpton who could have let it out this was a trick of constantines   alicia no papa do not accuse my brother of it the door must have been illsustened and so the prisoner escaped but tommy is in pursuit of him and if he catches it again he will bring it back to me   mr crumpton you mean then to have a second conversation with him what have you to say to him have not you told him my resolution and have not you taken your leave of him   alicia yes papa but  oh i was so sorry i shall not easily comfort myself   mr crumpton you find then a difficulty in obeying me   alicia oh it is not that never imagine it but could you love me still could you own me for your child if i were to tell you that this quarrel does not grieve me what would you think of me or what would my friends think if i could withdraw my heart from them at once without feeling the least concern   mr crumpton but is the offense offered me by their father so indifferent to you that you take no part in it   alicia oh i do take a part in it and i would give any thing in the world that you had full satisfaction   mr crumpton you know then what i ask of him and what he refuses me   alicia i know  i know  ah papa why do you ask me   mr crumpton because i would know if mr garveys children are acquainted with the affair and have entrusted it to you   alicia yes they told me  they told me all do not be angry papa   mr crumpton well what do you think of my demand does it appear unreasonable have not i a right to expect from mr garvey in return for all my kindness a slight compliment which i would repay him an hundredfold   alicia dear papa i am only a child how can i decide amongst big people   mr crumpton consult your heart i would know what it says   alicia pray excuse me my heart perhaps might say something that would displease you   mr crumpton i understand it would judge no doubt that i am in the wrong   alicia ah now you are going to be angry   mr crumpton only speak you will see   alicia i would not offend you for any thing in the world   mr crumpton you will not only tell me freely what you think   alicia well then i think that you are right and mr garvey too   mr crumpton both of us right ah you little flatterer that is impossible one of us must be right and the other wrong   alicia pardon me i spoke it as i think you have done mr garvey great kindnesses and are right to expect from him in acknowledgement a matter that you have so much at heart and he is right in refusing it you because he has reasons for not giving it up   mr crumpton but are his reasons just or illfounded   alicia it is not for me to be the judge of them you look upon it as his duty in gratitude to give you up his little grove and he looks upon the keeping of it to be also a duty of gratitude you would cut it down to make a fine prospect he thinks it an agreeable shady retreat for his children you are his landlord and have power he has nothing but the prayers and tears of his family   mr crumpton enough of this you are too dangerous an advocate well let him pay me the fifty pounds that i have lent him and he may keep his grove   alicia then it will be force    mr crumpton that will show which is right eh   alicia no papa i only meant  oh i do not know what i would say but the fifty pounds where can be have them   mr crumpton if you do not know neither do i however if he applied to you    alicia  embracing her father oh i cannot conceal it from you any longer and though you were even to punish me for it  i have deserved your anger  i have    mr crumpton come come let me go what does all this mean miss   scene ix mr crumpton alicia constantine hauling in grace grace constantine ah

you papa when grace and my brother interrupted us i submit to my pishment   mr crumpton  opns the letter and reads   most worthy miss i should not be deserving of your generous intentions in m favor if i were base enough to lead you into the slightest act of deceit by accepting the money which you offer me in order to pay your papa no my dear miss i am his debtor and shall have the misfortune to continue so until i can acquit my debt by my own resources i am unhappy in not being able on this occasion to meet your fathers wishes so cheerfully as i would on any other if mr crumpton without mentioning it to me had pursued the course which his power enables him to use i should never have expostulated he may assure himself that i should not even have formed in my own mind a single complaint against him at least i should not have to reproach myself with violating the sacred promise that i have past let him know these sentiments my worthy little friend his friendship and yours are more valuable to me than all the possessions in the world continue still in the same generous disposition toward me and my children  i have the honor to be etc    mr crumpton without shutting the letter locks at alicia alicia  running to him now papa you shall know how this money came into my hands and forgive me for not owning to you before    mr crumpton  kissing her i know the whole my dear alicia i heard your conversation i am delighted with the nobleness and generosity of your sentiments i do not blush to confess that perhaps but for you i was going to commit an action that would have made me unhappy all my life here is your money make that noble use of it which your excellent mother enjoined you do not fear that i shall ever suffer it to be exhausted by your bounty your little grove shall remain my dear children and friendship shall unite you still   alicia  taking his hand o papa i owe you now asecond life   grace  taking his other hand o sir what goodness ah how my father    mr crumpton tell him my dear grace that i request him to take his note again that i have a small alteration to make in it of which i will speak to him   constantine how papa you    mr crumpton hold your illnatured tongue you have given me today proofs of a very bad heart   constantine i have only obeyed you must not children obey their parents   mr crumpton without doubt they must but when the commands of their parents are unjust they must then first obey their duty and their maker if your heart did not tell you that mine yielded too much to passion i have no further hopes of you see how alicia has acted   constantine but mama did not leave me any money at my own disposal   mr crumpton because she foresaw the improper use that you might have made of it and then had not you words at least of comfort for your little friends and for a man who had once the care of your education but what is become of the squirrel have you given orders to find him   constantine i could see nobody in the garden   scene x mr crumpton constantine alicia grace thomas  thomas enters running and out of breath he holds the squirrel in one hand the other is wrapped in a bandkerchief stained with drops of

branch that broke with the spring that i made to jump after the runaway i ore my hand a little but i should have left an arm behind rather than not bring back the squirrel to miss alicia   alicia ah

not choose it amelia   amelia pray mama why so   mrs b i have no occasion i suppose to tell you my reasons a little miss ought always to obey her parents without allowing herself to ask them questions however to satisfy you that i have always a reasonable motive whenever i order or forbid you any thing i shall tell you your cousin henry can only set you an indifferent example and i should fear if you saw him too often that you would imitate his levity and indiscretion   amelia but mama    mrs b no reply i request you know that my orders must be followed punctually  amelia retired a little to hide her tears and soon after her mother being gone out she sat down in a corner and gave her grief full vent just then nanny who was lately come into mrs barlows service entered the room how mis amelia said she are you crying what is the matter may not i know what troubles you   amelia leave me nanny you cannot comfort me   nanny nay why not there was miss sophy at my last service always name to me whenever any thing ailed her my dear nanny she would say you see what has happened to me tell me what must i do and i had always good advice to give her   amelia i do not want your advice i tell you once more that you can do nothing for me   nanny give me leave at least to go for your mama she will perhaps be better able to comfort you i do not like to see so pretty a miss as you in trouble   amelia oh yes mama indeed   nanny i cannot believe that it was she who grieved you   amelia who should it be then   nanny i could never have thought it i should always suppose you so reasonable that your mama could not refute you any request ah if i had a child so well disposed as you she should be her own mistress but your mama loves to command and for a whim would oppose your most innocent wishes how can one have so amiable a child and take pleasure to thwart her i cannot express how i saffer to see you in this situation   amelia  beginning to cry afresh ah it will break my heart   nanny indeed i fear it will how red and swelled your eyes are you are very cruel to yourself not to let those who love you sincerely try to give you some comfort ah if miss sophy had been in half your trouble she would not have failed to open her heart to me   amelia i dare not mention mine to you   nanny not that for my part i care much about knowing it  oh it is perhaps because your mama make you stay at home while she goes to the play   amelia no she has promised me not to go there without me   nanny well what is it then your trouble seems to increase shall i go for your little cousin you may play along with him to divert you   amelia  sighing ah i shall not have that pleasure any more   nanny it will not be hard to procure it for you a young mis should have some company your mama has not a mind to make a nun of you   amelia i am not allowed to see him   nanny not to see him i do not know what your mama thinks miss sophys was just the same she would never let her have the least intimacy with miss semple but how we contrived to deceive her   amelia how was that   nanny we watched the moment when she went out to pay visits then either miss sophy went to miss semple or miss semple came to her   amelia and her mama did not know it   nanny it was i that guarded against that   amelia but if i were to go to see my cousin and mama should ask where is amelia   nanny i would tell her that you were in the garden or if it was a little late i would tell her that you were gone to bed and fast asleep and immediately i would run to find you   amelia ah if i thought that my mama would know nothing of it    nanny trust me for that she will never suspect it will you take my advice go and pass the evening with your little cousin never trouble yourself about the rest   amelia i have a mind to try it for once but you prmise me at least that mama    nanny go never fear  amelia in effect did go to see her cousin her mama came home a short time after and asked where she was nanny answered that she had been tired of sitting all alone so had eaten a good supper and was gone to bed  in this manner amelia deceived her unsuspecting mama several times ah much more did she deceive herself in acting thus before she was always cheerful and took pleasure in being near her mama and would run with joy to meet her whenever she had been absent a moment but now what was become of her cheerfulness she was ever saying to herself o dear if mama knew where i have been and she trembled whenever she heard her voice if at any time she saw her look a little serious i am undone she would cry mama has discovered that i have disobeyed her but this was not all that made her unhappy nanny would often cunningly tell her how generous miss sophy had been to her how often she had given her sugar and tea and how freely she had trusted her with the keys of the cellar and beaufet amelia took pride in deserving from nanny the same praises for considence and generosity she stole sugar and tea from her mama for nanny and found means to procure her the keys of the cellar and beauset nevertheless sometimes she felt the reproaches of her conscience i am doing wrong she would say to herself and my tricks will be found out sooner or later i shall lose the friendship of mama she then went to nanny and protested that she would never give her any thing again just as you please miss answered nanny but take care you may perhaps have reason to repent it stay till your mama comes home i will tell her how obeiently you have followed her orders amelia cried and did every thing that nanny desired her before it was nanny that obeyed amelia but now it was amelia that obeyed nanny she suffered every sort of rudeness from her and had nobody to whom she could complain the wicked girl came to her one day and said you must know i have a fancy to taste the pie that was looked up in the beauset yesterday besides that i want a bottle of wine you must go and look for the keys of your mamas drawers   amelia but dear nanny   nanny we are not talking about dear nanny do you mind what i ask of you   amelia why mama will see us or if she does not see us god almighty will see us and punish us   nanny he saw you all the times that you went to your cousin yet i never observed that he has punished you  amelia had received good instructions in religion from her mother she was strongly persuaded that god has always an eye upon us that he rewards our good actions and has only forbidden us what is evil because it is hrtful to us it was through mere thoughtlessness that she went to see her cousin contrary to her mamas orders but it always happens that from yielding to one error one fals immediately into another she saw herself obliged to do every wrong thing that her servant ordered her for fear of being betrayed by her  it may easily be imagined how much she suffered in this situation she one day withdrew to her chamber in order to weep at her ease oh cried she how much is one to be pitied who is disobedient unhappy child that i am slave to my own servant i can no longer do what is my duty but am forced to do what a wicked maid orders me i must be a liar a thief and a hypocrite lord have mercy on me saying thus she held up both hands to hide her face which was drowned in tears and began to reflect what steps she should take at length she rose all at once crying i am resolved and though my mama were not to let me come near her for a month though she were to  but no she will be reconciled to me she will call me once more her amelia i depend on her fondness but how dear it will cost me how shall i bear her looks and reproaches no matter i will confess the whole to her she then immediately sprung out of her chamber and seeing her mama walking all alone in the garden she flew toward her and embracing her closely covered her cheeks and her bosom with her tears grief and confusion stopped her speech   mrs barlow what is the matter my dear amelia   amelia ah mama    mrs b what is the meaning of these tears   amelia my dear mama   mrs b speak child what occasions this agitation   amelia ah if i thought that you could pardon me   mrs b i pardon you since your repentance appears so lively and so sincere   amelia my dear mama i have been a disobedient girl i have gone several times to see my cousin henry contrary to your orders   mrs b is it possible my dear amelia you who formerly feared so much to displease me   amelia ah i should not be your dear amelia if you knew all   mrs b you make me uneasy but trust every thing with me you must have been deceived you never gave me cause of complaint until now   amelia yes mama i have been deceived twas nanny nanny    mrs b what it was she   amelia yes mama and that she might not tell you i have often stolen the keys of the cellar and beaufet i have stolen for her i know not how much sugar and tea   mrs b unhappy mother that i am do i hear this shocking account of my own daughter leave me unworthy child i shall go and consult with your father how we should treat you   amelia no mama i will not quit you punish me first but promise me that your love for me will one day return   mrs b ah unhappy child you will be sufficiently punished  mrs barlow at these words left amelia quite disconsolate seated on a grassy turf and went to seek mr barlow and they concerted together the means of saving their child from her ruin  nanny was called up mr barlow after loading her with the severe repreaches ordered her to quit his house immediately it was in vain that she wept and pleaded for a less gorous sentence in vain she promised that nothing of the same sort should ever happen again mr barlow was inexorable you know answered he how mildly i have treated you and what indulgence i have shown to your faults i thought that my kindness might induce you to second my wishes as to my childs education and it is you that have led her into disobedience and theft you are a monster in my sight leave my presence and be careful to reform unless you wish to fall into the hands of a more terrible judge  it was next amelias turn she appeared before her parents in a situation worthy of pity her eyes were swollen with crying all the features of her face were changed a frightful paleness covered her cheeks and her whole body shuddered as if in the convulsions of an ague unable to utter a word she awaited in mournful silence the judgment of her father you have said he in a severe voice you have deceived you have offended your parents what could incline you to follow the advice of a wicked servant rather than of your own mother who loves you so tenderly and desires nothing in the world so much as to make you happy if i punished you with the indignation that your behavior inspires if i banished you from my sight for ever as i have the companion of your faults who could accuse me of injustice   amelia ah papa you can never be unjust toward me punish me with all the severity that you shall judge necessary i will bear the whole but begin with taking me once more in your arms call me once more your amelia   mr barlow i cannot embrace you so soon i am willing not to chasse you on account of the confession that you have made but i shall not call you my amelia until you have deserved it by a long repentance pay great attention to your conduct punishments always follow faults and it is you that will punish yourself  amelia did not as yet fully understand what her father meant by these last words she did not expect so mild a treatment she went therefore up to her parents with a heavy heart and curtsying to them repeated afresh her promises of the most perfect submission in effect she kept her worn but alas her punishment followed very soon as her father had told her the wicked nanny spread the most infamous stories concerning her she told all that had passed between her and amelia and added a thousand horrid lies besides she said that amelia by the humblest entreaties and by the force of presents which she had stolen from her parents had labored so long to corrupt her that at length the suffered herself to be persuaded to procure her secret meetings with her cousin henry that they saw each other every evening unknown to their parents and that amelia came often home very late these things she related with circumstances so odious that every one conceived the most disadvantageous ideas of amelia she was obliged to suffer the most cruel mortifications on this subject whenever she entered amongst a party of her little friends she saw them all whisper each other and look at her with an air of contempt and an insulting smile if ever she staid somewhat late in a company they would say it is plain she waits here until the hour of her appointment had she a fashionable ribband or an elegant dress they would say whenever one can get ones mamas keys one may buy what one pleases in short upon the least difference between her and any of her companions do not talk miss they would say thinking of your cousin henry confuses your ideas these reproaches were so many stabs to the heart of amelia often when she was quite overwhelmed with grief she would throw herself into her mothers arms and seek for comfort there her mother generally answered her suffer with patience my dear child what your imprudence has brought on you pray to god to forget your fault and to shorten the time of your mortifications these proofs will be of service to you all your life if you can profit by them god has said to children honor your father and your mother and submit in all things to their will this commandment is meant for their happiness poor children ye know not the world yet ye cannot foresee the consequences that your actions may draw after them god has committed the care of guiding you to your parents who love you as themselves and who have more experience and reflection to ward off every danger from you this you did not choose to believe but you now experience how wisely god requires of children submission to their parents since you have suffered so much by your disobedience my dear amelia let your misfortune serve for your instruction it is the same with all the commandments god prescribes to us only what is advantageous he forbids only what is pernicious to us we act therefore to our own hurt whenever we do what is wrong you will often find yourself in circumstances when it will be impossible for you to foresee how much vice may injure you or how much virtue may profit you recollect then what you have suffered by one single fault and regulate all the actions of your life upon this unerring principle every action which is contrary to virtue is contrary to our own happiness  amelia punctually obeyed the wise advice of her mother the more she was afterward obliged to suffer the consequences of her imprudence the more reserved she became and attentive to her own behavior she profited so well by this disgrace that through the prudence of her conduct she stopped the mouths of all who would speak ill of her and obtained the name of the irreproachable amelia   the old man begging mr annesey  to a servant why did not you make this good old man come in   old man sir i was asked but it was my own choice not to go in   mr ann and why pray   old man i blush to tell i am doing a thing to which i am not accustomed i come  to beg alms   mr ann you seem honest why should you blush to be poor i have some friends that are so be you of the number   old man excuse me sir i have not time   mr ann what

years   mr ann they have only done their duty   old man i was once just rich enough not to fear becoming chargeable to any body i lent my money to a gentleman that called himself my friend he lived merrily until at last he reduced me to poverty i beg pardon sir you are a gentleman too but i speak the truth   mr ann i have as much pleasure in hearing it as you have in speaking it though it were even against myself   old man i should have been wiser had i worked to the last but i was grown pale and withered and i looked upon this change as a signal from providence to repose myself i never disliked work sir when i was young that supported my health i had no other physician but what strengthens youth exhausts old age i was no longer able to work when i had lost my fortune i was desirous to work again i desired it with all my heart i felt for my arms but could not find them excuse me for dropping a tear when i think of it no moment of my life ever was more heavy than when i felt myself so weak   mr ann you then had recourse to your children   old man no sir they came to me of themselves i had only one daughter but i found a son in her husband they made me welcome to every thing they had and took care of me although i had not sixpence to leave them may god almighty take them to his heavenly table as they have taken me to their table in this world   mr ann what are they become cooler to you now   old man no sir but they are become poor themselves the floods have swept away their house and destroyed their flock so they have borrowed money to maintain me at case till my death the only thing that ever they did against my will i could wish them to have a sum for my funeral beforehand that i may not be a charge to them even when dead it is for this reason that i come begging alms i am an old man but a young beggar   mr ann and where do you live   old man i beg pardon sir but must not answer that either for myself or my children   mr ann excuse my indiscreet curiosity heaven forbid that i should seek to gratify it   old man sir i believe you in eight days look up to heaven you will then i hope see my dwelling it will not be concealed then   mr ann  offering him a handful of silver take this good old man and may god keep you   old man all that sir no it was not my intention i want but a crown the rest is of no service to me there is no want in

had some broth and some bread   mr ann at least take some provision with you   old man no sir i will not affront providence so much however a glass of wine  just one    mr ann more if you choose my friend   old man no sir only one i cannot bear more you deserve that i should drink with you the last drop of wine that i shall taste upon earth and in heaven i will tell from whom i received it bountiful god even a cup of water is not without its recompense from thee  mr ansley goes himself for a bottle the old man lifts up his hands to heaven my last refreshment heaven reward him one day who gives it to me   mr ann  returning with a bottle and two glasses take this glass my good old man i have brought one for myself too we will drink together   old man  looking up god be thanked for all the blessings of this life  drinks a little then touches glasses with mr annesley may the lord grant that your latter end be as happy as mine   mr ann my good old man stop here tonight nobody

i shall think of you sir   mr ann and i too of you o my good friend let me accompany you i find it hard to keep the promise that i gave you   old man then so much the better for you sir if you keep it  going   mr ann give me your hand once more my good old man it is full of blessings   old man i hope to take you by the hand in paradise   the pleasures and advantages of a sociable character ferdinand was by nature of a thoughtful and observing turn in his walks with his uncle nothing that struck his view was lost to his reflections his cousins complained that while he appeared to enjoy so much himself he sought so little to contribute to the general amusement of the family they thought at first of requesting their father not to take him with them any more but a more gentle method of correcting him soon occurred they agreed together to hold the same conduct with him for some days that he maintained toward them one went to see westminsterabbey another the regalia and armoury at the tower a third the exhibition at somersethouse but when they came home the accounts which they generally gave to each other of what they remarked were suppressed instead of that mutual communication of the pleasures of the day which made their evenings pass so delightfully before a grave reserve and a tiresome silence took place amongst them ferdinand remarked this change with as much surprise as mortification he felt the want of those effusions of communicative cheerfulness which indeed rarely originated from him but in which he never failed to interest himself accustomed as he was to reflection he easily perceived the injustice of his own behavior and soon became as free as he had before been reserved when he yielded to this amiable principle which is implanted in men by nature in order to connect and unite them by sentiment his heart tasted the pleasures of benevolence and friendship and his ardent desire of knowledge found new means of gratification from the lights which he collected from others at the same time that he imparted his information to them  a good heart compensates for many indiscretions a drama in one act characters mr vaughan mary anne his daughter frederick his nephew dorothea his niece servant peter an old coachman scene an apartment in mr vaughans country house  scene i mr vaughan this is what one gains by taking charge of other peoples children this frederic how i loved him he was i believe dearer to me than my own son and the scapegrace now plays these pranks how could he change so far from what he promised in his infancy such goodness of heart such spirit such cheerfulness the courage of a lion and the mildness of a lamb one could not help loving him but let him never appear before me again i will never even hear him mentioned   scene ii mr vaughan dorothea dorothea did you send for me uncle what are your commands   mr vaughan i have fine news for you concerning your rogue of a brother   doroth  turning pale concerning frederick   mr vaughan there read that letter from richard or i will read it to you myself   reads  dear papa  i am sorry to have none but disagreeable news for you however it is better that you should receive them from me than from another our dear frederick  oh yes he deserves that affectionate name now  our dear frederick goes on very indifferently he sold his watch some days ago and what is still worse the greatest part of his school books and books of devotion i will tell you how i came to know it at a standing of secondhand books i asked the other day by chance for the whe duty of man for as i had worn mine out by dint of reading it i thought i could not do better than to buy another the bookseller showed me one which i knew immediately to be fredericks i was positive of it as his name was upon the title page i bought it for sixpence but did not say a word about it for fear of prejudicing our schoolfellows against him i contented myself with showing it to the head master who sent for the bookseller and asked him from whom he had that book the bookseller confessed that he had bought it from my cousin and frederick could not deny it but said that he had sold it because he wanted money and that meantime until he should be able to buy another he had borrowed one from a friend who had two the head master would know what he had done with this money and frederick told him though i suspect his account to be all a fib oh thought i to myself we must find if he has not parted with some of his necessaries too i thought first of the watch that you gave him for his new years gift to let him see how his time went which was a matter that he minded very little as you may remember i asked him what oclock it was he seemed confused and told me that his watch was at the watchmakers i went thither that moment in order to be certain there was not a word of truth in it i expostulated with him as an affectionate cousin ought but he answered me that it was no concern of mine and that his watch was much better as he had disposed of it than in his sob as he had no longer occasion to know the hour for his business who knows what he may have done worse for one cannot guess the whole  well what do you say to this dorothy   dorothea dear uncle i own that i am as much displeased at my brother as you are notwithstanding    mr vaughan a little patience this is not all the best of the story is to come  reads  only hear what he has done since the day before yesterday he went out in the afternoon without leave evening came on he did not return supper bell rang he was not to be found in short he staid out the whole night and did not come in until the next morning you may imagine how he was received they asked him where he had been but he had invented all his stories beforehand and indeed though every thing that he said were true  however he is to appear this evening before all the masters and if they do him justice he will be expelled shamefully or at least sent home what afflicts me most is his ingratitude for all your kindnesses the disgrace that he brings on us and the irregular way of life that he follows i cannot believe that he told truth in speaking of the place where he spent the night and why do not you mention it but i wish that he may it would be still worse and he would only be the more worthy of your resentment he threatens now to run away and go home yes yes let him come let him only put his foot upon my threshold he will see the consequence let him go where he spends his nights as for you dorothea i desire you never to speak a word to me in his favor they may put him in prison send him home expel him ignominiously it is all equal to me i shall never concern myself about him he may go to some seaport and ship himself as cabinboy for the westindies i have used him as my son too long   dorothea true my dear uncle you have been as a father to us and even our own parents could not have shown more care and kindness to us   mr vaughan i have done it with pleasure and take no merit to myself for it your mother while i was abroad on my travels did the same for my children so it became my duty and i never to this day declined it but    dorothea ah if my brother has forgot himself for a moment it is owing only to his impetuous temper you have had him long under your eye whenever he had done a fault his repentance and sorrow for having offended you always exceeded the offense   mr vaughan well and how many indiscretions have i pardoned him when he burned his eyebrows and hair with his fireworks when he threw a stone through one of our neighbors windows and broke a large lookingglass when he fell into the mire and spoiled a new suit of clothes when he overturned the handsomest carriage that i ever had did not i forgive him all this i attributed these mischievous freaks to a petulance that did not however as yet show a bad disposition but to sell his watch and his books to leave his school anights and lie out to fly against his masters and still to have the face to think of coming home to me   dorothea my dear uncle be pleased first to hear what he can say in his justification   mr vaughan hear him heaven forbid that i should even see  i shall tell all my tenants to receive him with a good stick if he offers to come amongst them   dorethea ah no your heart could never consent to such harshness you will not deny the request of a niece that loves and honors you as her father   mr vaughan you shall see whether that will be difficult to me   dorethea will you have me think then that you no longer love the memory of your sister that you no longer love me   mr vaughan you i have no fault to find with you and therefore your brothers misbehaviour shall never change my sentiments as to you but if you love me do not teae me with any more solicitations study only to live happy in my friendship   dorothea how can i live happy while i see my brother in disgrace with you   mr vaughan he has deserved it but too well why not tell what he did with the money and where he lay out   dorothea it appears from the letter that he confessed both it is only richard that will not believe him  looks at mr vaughan with the tears in her eyes ah dear uncle    mr vaughan  a little softened well he shall have one chance more on your account i will wait for the head masters letter   scene iii mr vaughan dorothea servant mr vaughan what do you want   servant a messenger sir would speak with you   mr vaughan what has he brought   servant a letter from the school  gives him the letter   mr vaughan  looking at the superscription right i was waiting for this it comes from the head master i know his hand where is the messenger let him wait for my answer   servant shall i show him up   mr vaughan no i will go down i wish to inform myself from his own mouth  goes out dorothea following him the servant makes signs to her to stop   scene iv dorothea servant servant harkye miss dorothea come here   dorothea what have you to say   servant master frederick is here   dorothea my brother   servant if he be not come yet he is not far off   dorothea who told you so   servant the messenger that overtook him on the road ah miss what has master frederick done   dorothea nothing unworthy do not believe him capable of it   servant ah i never thought so of him heaven knows we all loved him and would have given our lives for him he satisfied us for the least service that we could do him he spoke for us to your uncle whenever he was in a passion with us and he was a friend to all the poor people in the neighborhood i wonder how his schoolmaster could be angry with him ah i see how it is they were going to punish him for some arch prank and he being a fine spirited young gentleman would not be used so roughly   dorothea where did the messenger find him   servant about a stage off he was sleeping under a willow on the bank of a little stream   dorothea my poor brother   servant the man stopped till he awoke you must think how surprised master frederick was on seeing him he imagined that this man had been sent after him to bring him back and he told him that he would sooner be torn in pieces than go with him   dorothea ah i know his stout resolute way   servant the messenger protested to him that he had such a regard for him if he were sure to be scolded or even to lose his place for it he would not molest him he then told him his message and how they spoke of him at school   dorothea and what did my brother resolve to do   servant although he was spent with fatigue he walked on by the messengers side and they came together as far as the edge of our grove master frederick struck in there to go and hide himself in the grotto and there he will stay for the messengers return to know how your uncle will take matters   dorothea oh if i could speak to him   servant it is likely that he wishes it as much as you   dorothea my uncle often walks that way if he should meet him in the first of his passion oh be so kind as to run and tell him to hide himself in the barn behind the trusses of hay i will go to him as soon as my uncle walks out   servant never fear miss i will bring him there myself and help him to hide himself  goes out   scene v dorothea alone what troubles he continually causes to me yet i cannot help loving him   scene vi dorothea mary anne dorothea ah dear cousin how i did long to speak with you and yet alas i have but very ill news for you   mary anne i know the whole my papa just now gave me my brothers letter to read that from the schoolmaster has redoubled his anger against frederick   dorothea i do not know how to go about justifying him   mary anne i would wager that he is innocent do you know richards hypocrisy he does all the faults and is cunning enough to lay the blame of them upon others this is not the first instance of his striving to hurt your brother in my papas opinion twenty times has he by underhand complaints had him almost turned out of the house and then when matters have been cleared up he himself has been found the only person in fault i see even from his letter that he is a pickthank and that frederick at worst has been only imprudent   dorothea what comfort your kindness affords me yes my brother is naturally well inclined free sincere generous unsuspecting but he is also petulant daring and inconsiderate he is headstrong in his resolutions and loses respect for those that do not treat him according to his humor   mary anne and richard is envious dissembling hypocriical and fawning like a cat that gives you at fast a paw as soft as velvet and afterward strikes you with her talons at the moment when you depend most on her kindness how willingly would i give my brother with all his false virtues for yours with all his imperfections on his head the worst is that frederick is not here   dorothea and if he were   mary anne ah where is he then let me run to him i long to see him   dorothea his i think i hear my uncle talking to himself   mary anne well you are fredericks sister it is but right that you should see him first i will stay here  my papa and try to soften him do you run to the poor wanderer and give him some words of comfort and hope   dorothea yes and a good lecture besides i a ture you for he deserves it at all events  goes out   scene vii mr vaughan mary anne mr vaughan i am so provoked with this boy that i have not been able to write to send back the messenger however he may stay here till tomorrow morning let me compose myself a little   mary anne how papa are you still angry with my poor cousin is his crime so very great then   mr vaughan truly it becomes you much to excuse him i see that your head is no better than his and you would have done worse perhaps in his place yet you have both of you a good example before you   mary anne who is that   mr vaughan my good boy richard   mary anne oh yes my brother is a boy of great veracity indeed very generous he is a pretty pattern   mr vaughan i know that dolly and you are no friends to him i myself from your opinions of him had conceived a prejudice against him but his master gives me such a good account of him today    mary anne nay did not all his masters quite sicken you with his prises here they knew his fathers fortune and people always hope to wheedle presents from a father by flattering him concerning his son   mr vaughan i grant they may have flattered me a little with regard to him however from his earliest childhood he has never played me a single prank of the thousands that frederick has   mary anne his pranks never hurted any body but himself   mr vaughan you would make one mad did he hurt nobody but himself when he overturned my chariot a carriage elegantly gilt and quite new that had just cost me two hundred pounds   mary anne it was but an accident imprudence is pardonable at his age peter was trying the carriage and frederick teazed him so much to take him up on the seat that at last he did after they had gone a little way he dropped the whip and peter went down for it the horses finding the reins in weaker hands set off luckily the harness gave way and nothing suffered but the carriage   mr vaughan that was not enough perhaps and who upon the whole has more reason to complain than i   mary anne frederick who had his head terribly cut but above all poor peter that lost his place by it   mr vaughan i cannot think of it yet with patience that fine adventure cost me above eighty guineas   mary anne and how much grief did it cost the goodnatured frederick he will never forgive himself for having occasioned poor peters disgrace   mr vaughan two goodfornothing fellows sit to go together i am surprised however that you pick out the worst characters and plead their cause really it is a pity that you were not born a boy to be companion to your cousin i think you would have had charming adventures together   mary anne nay but    mr vaughan hold your tongue your teazing tires me i am going to take a turn in the garden go find dorothea and both of you come to me  goes out without his hat   scene viii mary anne i shall have a good deal of trouble to bring him about however let us not despair he is only illnatured in words   scene ix mary anne dorothea dorothea  half opening the door and peeping in hist   mary anne well   dorothea is my uncle out   mary anne he is just gone where is frederick   dorothea he waits for us on the back stairs   mary anne you have no more to do but take him to  room   dorothea no that will not do jenny is there   mary anne why cannot we bring him here nobody comes here when my papa is out   dorothea you are right and it will be easier too for him to slip out upon occasion stay here i will bring him up   scene x mary anne how curious i am to hear him tell his story and i shall be glad to see him too it is above a year since he left us ah i hear him   goes to the door to meet him scene xi mary anne dorothea frederick mary anne  embracing him ah my dear cousin   dorothea he deserves this kindness indeed for the trouble that he has caused us   mary anne i see him and all is forgotten   frederick my dear cousin do i find you then still the same you have never been so hard upon me as my sister   dorothea if i were as much so as your uncle ah then    frederick in the first place what does he say can it be true that he is so enraged against me   dorothea if he knew us to conceal you here we should have no more to do but to quit the house and go about our business   mary anne oh it is very true do not think of appearing before him yet awhile he is in a humor to do you a mischief just now   frederick what can our head master have written to him   dorothea a handsome encomium upon your exploits   mary anne my brother had touched a little upon the subject by yesterdays past   frederick what has richard written then i have occasion for nothing more to justify me he knows the whole matter as well as i for i entrusted him with every thing   mary anne one needs only to judge of you from his letter   frederick well if i be not innocent i am the greatest rogue    dorothea that is saying nothing you must be either one or the other   frederick and could you think me guilty what is my crime selling my watch   dorothea no more than that who can tell if your shirts too and your clothes    frederick very true i would have sold every thing if i had occasion for more money   dorothea a very pretty defense truly and to pass whole nights from the school   frederick one night sister   dorothea and to fly against a proper chastisement   frederick say rather against an outrage that i did not deserve if i had submitted to it i should always have borne a blot in the opinion of my uncle and if they had expelled me i should never have appeared before you   mary anne but dear frederick what can you say in your defense we should know it in order to clear you to papa   frederick here is the fact some days ago they talked of a fair that was to be in the neighboring village our master gave a few of us leave to go there in order to amuse ourselves and gratify our curiosity   dorothea ah then it was for oranges and tarts that your watch and your whole duty of man went or perhaps for a sight of monkies and tumblers   frederick surely my sister must have a great taste for these things to suppose that one could spend money on them no it was not so i was dry and went into a public house to have some beer   dorothea why this is worse still   frederick really sister you are very severe but do let me finish while i was sitting there    mary anne  listening at the door we are undone my papa i hear him   dorothea run run   frederick no i will wait for my uncle and throw myself at his feet   mary anne oh no dear cousin he is not capable of listening to you do for my sake    frederick you would have me   mary anne yes yes leave me to manage for you  she pushes him by the shoulders to the door of the back stairs shuts it upon him and returns   scene xii mr vaughan mary anne dorothea mary anne ah papa i see you are returned already from your walk   mr vaughan i am looking for my hat hang it i do not know where i have left it   dorothea  looking about here here it is   mr vaughan you could not think of bringing it to me   dorothea i must have been blind sure not to see it   mary anne who can think of every thing   mr vaughan truly you have so many things to take up your attention   mary anne i was just thinking of poor frederick   mr vaughan must i constantly have that name rung in my ear   mary anne well papa let us talk no more about him would not you choose to finish your walk before the dew falls   mr vaughan no i will go out no more this evening  mary anne and dorothea look at each other shaking their heads with an air of disappointment it is too late besides i have just been told that my old coachman is below and would speak with me   mary anne and dorothea what peter   mr vaughan whatever damage he has caused me the mischief is done and he has been sufficiently punished for it i would know what he has to say to me   mary anne he might very well wait until you returned from your walk   mr vaughan no no i shall dismiss him the sooner after all   merry anne and derothea whisper together  to mary anne when your father   to dorothea when your uncle speaks to you i think that you should listen to him after all   dorothea endeavors to steal away where are you going dorothea   dorothea  confused i have business down stairs   mr vaughan well tell peter to come up  dorothea goes out   scene xiii mr vaughan mary anne mr vaughan after all i pity the poor man i never had so good a coachman my horses were so sleek that one might see ones face in their coats and he never embezzled their corn at the alehouse   mary anne ah if you had kept him you would have spared poor frederick many a sorrowful moment   mr vaughan say no more of him it was he that occasioned me to discharge peter and to be at present without a coachman for after him i conceived a dislike to all others i shall never find one to replace him   scene xiv mr vaughan mary anne dorothea and peter doroth uncle here is peter   peter i beg pardon sir but i cannot think that you are still angry with me i hope you will not take it amiss that i have made bold to wait on you as i passed the house and to beg you to let me have a discharge   mr vaughan did not i give you one   peter i never had any other than there take your wages quit my house this moment and never let me see you again you did not give me time sir to ask for a gentler discharge   mr vaughan you did not deserve more ceremony from me after destroying my finest carriage i wish that frederick had broke his neck at the same time   peter what can one say sir a coachmans sense is in his whip and i had just lost possession of mine but i shall be wiser for the future   mr vaughan well it is all over how do you live   peter ah dear master since i left your house i have never had a happy moment you know upon quitting your service i went to live with major bramfield oh what a master he could never speak but with his cane lifted up rest his soul   mr vaughan he is dead then   peter yes to the great joy of his soldiers he never gave me his orders without swearing like a turk his horses had their full measure of corn and his people plenty of hard knocks but not much bread   mary anne ah poor peter why did you stay in his service   peter where could i go what kept me there besides was that my wife found employment in the house in washing and mending the linen she earned at least half as much as maintained our children every one trembled before the major death alone made him tremble and laid him low at present i am out of place and do not know where to lay my head   mr vaughan but you know that i never wish any one to starve much less an old servant   peter ah i always thought so but those terrible words never let me see you again sounded continually like a clap of thunder in my ears ten of the majors greatest oaths could not have frighted me so much   mory aunt and you have had no master find   peter ah mise it is not here as in london in the poor little villages about here people want their corn more for themselves than for their horses i worked at daily labor in the fields my wife spun and my children went about asking charity but we all together made so little that we were not able at the weeks end to pay the rent of a poor garret very soon we had nothing but the earth for our bed and the  for our covering my poor wife died of grief and hardship  wipes his eyes   mr vougean you deserved it all why did not you come and ask my assistance   mary anne  is dorothea now my papa shows himself once more a good sign for frederick   peter ah sir what a woman it was sure never was a better wise whenever i came home at night without having earned a farthing and thought that i must go to bed hungry i always found half of her morsel of bread left purposely for me when i foamed with rage like one in despair and would destroy every thing round me she always restored me to my calm senses and made me a reasonable man again now she is dead and i cannot bring her to life there began my real unhappiness and heaven knows where it will end   dorothea ah poor peter   peter i had no more hopes of finding a service in these parts so i set out one fine evening with my little girl in my arms and i took my boy by the hand we walked a great part of the night and slept the remainder under a hedge next morning by break of day we were in sight of a town luckily there was a fair there that day i earned some money by carrying burdens but sir i must say it was an angel an angel from heaven master frederick    mr vaughan an angel what frederick that reprobate   mary anne and dorothea  approaching peter with looks of joy and curiosity what frederick frederick   peter dear master use me ill if you will but not that fine generous child i would rather that you should trample me under your feet   dorothea oh tell us peter tell us   peter my little lucy went to ask a charity at the door of a public house master richard and master frederick were sitting there at a table with some beer before them   mr vaughan ay fine inclinations truly in an alchouse   dorothea nay uncle he only went to refresh himself   mr vaughan what business had he in the town at all   mary anne he had leave to see the fair your good richard you see was there too   peter he presently knew my child and rose from table in spite of all that his companion could say he made poor little lucy drink a glass of beer took her by the hand and leading her out heard from herself a brief account of our misery he then desired her to bring him to me and found me in the next street drinking out of my hat at a well as the heat of my work had made me dry i thought that i should run mad with joy upon seeing him all shabby and dirty as i was i took him in my arms before every body and hugged him so close the folks were afraid that i should stifle him ah he was heartily glad to see me too at last as there were a number of people about us he told me to lead him to a place where we might be by ourselves and i took him to a barn where i had already bespoke my bed for the night   mary anne ah papa i would lay a wager    mr vaughan silence well peter   peter i told him all that i have now told you the dear child began to cry as if he would break his heart i should beg for you cried he as i am the cause of your misfortunes but i will not sleep without relieving them here peter said he feeling in his pockets take what money i have about me i was not for taking it that made him angry i told him that it was money given him for his amusement and that as for me i was used to hardship he frowned and stamped with his feet and i verily believe would have hit me if i had not taken his purse   mr vaughan how much was there in it   peter almost a crown he would keep no more than sixpence it shall never be said continued he that an honest servant of my uncles who has neither robbed nor defrauded any one shall be obliged in his old age to go begging with his children and not have so much as a lodging take a little room before three days will return and i will support you ever until i shall have written to my uncle we have both provoked him against us but he is too humane and too generous to abandon you to misery   mr vaughan did he really say so peter   peter i can take my oath of it master   mary anne well well we can believe you finish your story   peter how do you employ your children said he as he took my billy upon his knee employ them said i they go about selling nosegays and toothpicks and when nobody buys they ask charity that is not right said he they would never learn any thing by that trade but idleness and profligacy you should make your boy learn a trade and put the girl out to a decent service   mary anne frederick was very right there papa   peter yes said i but how can i offer the children to any body in these rags if i had only three guineas i could soon settle them there is a weaver hard by that employs young hands and would take my billy if i could give him two guineas fee and a dairymans wife would take lucy into her service if she was a little clad then i could go and offer myself for service in some rich family and not be reduced to stroll about like a vagrant   mr vaughan and what did frederick say   peter nothing sir he went away but two days after he returned where is the weaver that will take your son apprentice carry me to him so i did and he spoke with him privately for a while and the dairymans wife said he that will take charge of lucy  where does she live i took him there too he left me at the door went and spoke to the woman in her dairy joined me again without saying a word and we came away after we had walked about forty yards he stopped and taking me by the hand my honest old friend said he make yourself easy as to your children he then pointed me to a shop of secondhand clothes that happened to be not far off where he had paid beforehand for this jacket and this great coat  dont i look like a squire in them   mary anne o my excellent cousin goodnatured frederick   mr vaughan  wiping his eyes i see now where the watch went   peter that is not all sir did not i catch him slipping money into my pocket i was positively for returning it to him and told him that he had already done too much for me but if ever i saw him fall in a passion it was them he assured me sir that you had sent it to him for my use and when i was for coming here directly to thank you he told me that you would not have it mentioned ah thought i to myself mr vaughan was so good a master perhaps he would take me again for all that i did not dare to come as master frederick had forbidden me   mr vaughan o frederick my dear frederick you have still then that noble and generous heart that i always took you to possess from your infancy   mary anne and what determined you at last to appear again before my uncle   peter the case was this they would not take my billy without a copy of the register of his baptism and for that i must come here to the clerk of this parish as i entered the village i heard that my lord vasty wanted a coachman it seemed as if master frederick had sent good luck along with me i waited on my lord who promised to take me if i could bring him a proper discharge from my last master i could not go into the other world to ask the major for one so i took my chance though sadly afraid to apply to you and should you even refuse me i shall at least have returned you my acknowledgments for the relief that you were so kind as to convery to me through the hands of master frederick   mr vaughan no honest peter you are indebted for them to himself alone it is he who has stripped himself to cover you but he is also indebted to you for the return of my favor from what a misfortune you save him yes but for you but for you so great was my resentment against him i should have banished him from my presence for ever   peter say you so sir then i should be the happiest man in the world what to save him from misfortune as he has me each of us to owe that obligation to the other   mr vaughan that sneaking varlet richard had almost turned my heart against him how could i trust that knave who has so often imposed upon me but the head master of the school    mary anne why papa he must have imposed on him as well as you   mr vaughan but bless me they write me word that frederick is run away if he should grow desperate if any misfortune should happen to him   peter a horse a horse i will bring him back to you if he were at the worlds end  going to run out   dorothea  holding him my dear uncle would you really pardon him would you take him to your arms once more   mr vaughan ay though he had sold all his clothes though he were to return as naked as he was born  dorothea makes a sign to mary anne and runs out   mary anne what if he were here papa   mr vaughan here has any one seen him where is he where is he   peter ah if he was here if he was here i would jump up to the cieling for joy   mary anne well papa do you see him   scene xv mr vaughan frederick mary anne dorothea peter frederick entering kneels to his uncle peter shows an extravagance of joy dorothea and mary anne melt into tears frederick ah uncle my dear uncle will you forgive me   mr vaughan forgive you i love you a thousand times better than before you deserve it and shall never leave me again   frederick no uncle never never  turning he sees peter and takes him by the hand ah if you had seen the misery of this poor man and his children if you had been the cause of their distress   peter twas i twas i myself why should i have let you climb upon my seat or have left you to manage a pair of fiery horses but who could refuse you any thing i could not though the carriage were to run over me through it so mark master frederick never ask me any thing improper again i should agree to it i know but i should go and drown myself directly   mr vaughan why did not you write me an account of all this instead of selling your watch your books and perhaps your clothes it was at least an imprudence in a child like you who knows not the value of things   frederick yes that is true but to let this family be a moment longer in their distress seemed to me as bad as murder besides as you had turned peter away in a passion i was afraid that you should forbid me to assist him and that by disobeying your express orders i should make myself more blameable   mr vaughan what then you would have disobeyed me there   frederick yes uncle but in that only   mr vaughan kiss me my brave frederick  after all there is one article in the letter which makes me hesitate that is your lying out where did you pass the night   frederick i had carried peter the money that day our master was not at home in the evening and i knew that the doors would be shut at ten oclock i thought to be home before and so i should if i had not gone astray after dark   dorothea poor brother where did you lie then   frederick i found an empty old shed and there i stretched myself upon a great stone and never slept so well in my life i was so happy to have relieved peter   mary anne ah that illnatured richard he took good care not to tell us all this and yet he knew it   mr vaughan from this moment i withdraw my regard from him and you alone    frederick no uncle i will not be happy at the expense of another and far less at that of your son   dorothea  taking his hand how much ought i to love such a brother   mr vaughan well let him remain at the school you shall never leave me i wish to have you always near my heart and will have masters for you of all sorts if they were to come a hundred miles   peter  making a low bow my worthy master you are always the same   mr vaughan  patting him on the shoulder peter have you agreed with lord vasty   peter bless your heart sir i had not my discharge   mr vaughan you shall not need one i see i shall make frederick and you happy in having you near each other once more but never let him mount upon your seat again we shall take care of your children too   peter  sobbing and crying for joy dear master  sir  are you serious is not this a dream frederick master frederick shall my poor children  ah let me go and see my old friends in the stable   old colin mr dexter percival his son percival papa i know a very good servant to recommend to you when you discharge old colin   mr dexter who has given you that commission have i any thoughts of sending him away   percival would you always keep that old fellow i think a young servant would do much better for us   mr dexter how percival that is a very bad reason for being tired of a good servant you call him an old fellow child you ought to blush for it it is in my service that he is grown old and perhaps the cares which he took of your infancy and the sorrow that he felt for your fits of illness have hastened old age on him you see then how ungrateful and unreasonable it would be to take an aversion to him on account of his age and do you think yourself any better founded in saying that a young servant would answer our purpose that decision is above your age and requires more experience than you can possess at another time i will make you sensible of the advantage that an old servant has above a young one in diligent and faithful service   percival i believe it papa since you say so but he wears a wig and it is so droll to see a man in a wig standing behind your chair at dinner i can hardly turn my eyes toward him without being ready to laugh out   mr dexter that does not show a good disposition boy i should never have suspected you of it do you know that he lost his hair in a long and dangerous sickness to ridicule him is it not to insult god who sent this sickness on him   percival but he is always grumbling and is not so merry as the other servants   mr dexter colin may be serious but is not a grumbler it is true he is not so nimble as a young puppy of eighteen or twenty but does he incur your dislike on that account o son that thought makes me shudder then you will have an aversion to me too if god should grant me a long life   percival oh no papa i am not so wicked   mr dexter and do you think that it is not so to hate colin because his age hinders him from being so alert as formerly   percival i am wrong papa i confess and i assure you that i am very sorry for having    mr dexter why do you stop for what are you sorry do you say   percival if i discover my fault to you perhaps you will be angry with me and i shall gain nothing by it but a punishment   mr dexter you know child that i am not fond of punishing and that i try that method very seldom it is by kindness and good advice that i endeavor to correct your sister and you i do not know what fault you have committed therefore cannot promise absolutely not to chastise you is it on those terms that you intend to make a confession you know my affection for you that is the only security that i can give you and you may depend on it with as much confidence as on my promise   percival well papa i own that  i called colin  an old rogue   mr dexter how is it possible could you so far forget how you should behave to an honest man and did colin hear you   percival yes papa and that is what troubles me most   mr dexter it is very well to be sorry but it is not enough to be concerned for having affronted one of our fellow creatures to his face one ought to feel the same sorrow for affronting him in his absence   percival yes i am sorry to have used colin ill at all but what grieves me most is that i treated him so before his face for    mr dexter you have begun to open your heart to me conclude   percival yes papa  for colin when i used him so ill shed tears and said the pains and infirmities of my old age are not enough but i must moreover be the laughter of childhood   mr dexter poor colin i know him well that ill treatment would go to his heart it is indeed hard at his age to be the laughing stock of a child but how much more must he suffer in receiving this treatment from a child whom he has known from his birth and served with an attachment that can never be requited   percival ah papa how much am i to blame i will ask his pardon and be assured that in all my life he shall never have reason to complain of me   mr dexter very well child on this condition alone god and i can pardon you we are all weak and liable to be carried away by our passions for a moment but when we return to ourselves we must thoroughly repent for our fault we must force our pride to make amends for it and use all our resolution to avoid it for the future but i should wish to know what could make you behave so ungenerously to colin had he offended you   percival yes papa  at least i thought so i was playing with my popgun and aimed to shoot a pea at his face have done master percival says he or i shall go and complain to your papa his threatening made me angry and then i called him names   mr dexter it was on purpose then that you strove to vex him   percival i cannot deny it   mr dexter that aggravates your fault and that was what made him shed tears   percival ah papa if you give me leave i will go to him this moment and ask his pardon i shall not be easy until he forgives me   mr dexter yes child we should never put off for a moment the performance of our duty i shall wait for you here  percival goes out and returns shortly after with an air of satisfaction   percival papa now i am pleased with myself colin has forgiven me with all his heart and i do not think that i shall ever commit the same fault again   mr dexter god forbid that you should without his grace you can never answer for the firmest resolution   percival and what should i do for that purpose   mr dexter pray for his assistance he will not refuse it to you   percival i will pray for it from the bottom of my heart but papa there is another thing that i have just now done without your leave and which perhaps will make you angry   mr dexter what is that child   percival the new crownpiece that you gave me as a christmasbox i have given to colin   mr dexter why should i be angry at that i am very well pleased that you should do good actions of yourself without acquainting me you may dispose of all the money that i give you it is your own and you could not make a better use of it we should early accustom ourselves to a prudent generosity did colin seem satisfied   percival he dropped tears of joy and i was pleased to see it   mr dexter i applaud you for that sentiment my boy a humane heart always rejoices to soften the distresses of its fellow creatures all the virtues produce joy in our souls but none fills them with sensations more delightful and more lasting than beneficence   percival ah if ever i possess the means i will relieve all those about me that are in distress   mr dexter my last prayer to heaven shall be to strengthen this virtue in your heart and to render you capable of putting it in practice   percival and shall i be every time so well pleased as today   mr dexter it is the only pleasure that never grows weak endeavor above all things to enjoy it in your family if your servants are honest people you ought to gain their affections still more by kind treatment than by money and at the same time not neglect to make them small presents now and then if you bestow them seasonably and with a good grace you will make your servants your firmest friends   percival but papa have they not their wages   mr dexter they have them for their service no more but small presents will create affection in them and they will go beyond their duty   percival i do not understand you very well papa   mr dexter colin will serve as an instance to explain my meaning i give him his wages his clothing and his food for serving me when he has served me are we not quit does he owe me any thing more at the same time you know he takes care of every thing in the house he has of himself undertaken the trouble of inspecting the other servants and has often saved me great expenses he does all this through good will without any particular order because i gained his gratitude by occasional presents when your years will allow you to mix in the world you will hear nothing in every family but complaints of the negligence and ingratitude of servants be assured my dear that the fault lies oftenest with the masters who endeavor to inspire them with fear rather than with attachment   percival now i understand you perfectly and i will one day make use of your instructions and your example   mr dexter you will never have reason to repent following them i inherited them from my father and shall always remember what he used to tell us on this subject   percival ah papa if it be not too much trouble i should be glad to hear the story   mr dexter i take pleasure in making you this return for acknowledging your fault and for your generosity to honest colin captain flood a brave officer who had retired from the service lived upon his estate with his wife an amiable lady and five children worthy of such excellent parents the inhabitants of the neighborhood possessed the greatest respect for them and this family all together formed the most pleasing sight imaginable the sweetness of mr floods disposition and the excellent order that subsisted in his house gained him the good will and admiration of all those who had the happiness of knowing him the young people in those parts were eager to be in his service and whenever a place was vacant in his family by a servants dying or going away it was sought as a desirable situation content appeared in the faces of all his people to see them one would have taken them for dutiful children round their father his orders were so just and so moderate that not one of them ever had a thought of disobeying him harmony reigned amongst them as amongst brothers if ever they dsputed it was which had most zeal in the service of their master and most attachment to his interests mr fulmer who was formerly an intimate of captain floods and had like him retired to his estate in another county stopped one day at his house in passing that way on his road to london after a variety of discourse the conversation fell at last upon the disagreeable circumstances frequently attending the care of a family mr fulmer complained of the fatiguing employment of watching over servants that he had never found any but such as were insolent idle or inattentive to their masters business as to that said mr flood i cannot complain of mine for these ten years i have had to weighty subject of displeasure i am very well satisfied with them and they are the same with me that is a happiness not very common said mr fulmer you must have some particular secret for making good servants and for keeping them in that perfection the secret is very simple answered mr flood and here it is continued he pointing to a small desk i do not understand you said mr fulmer but mr flood without making any reply opened the desk it contained six drawers with these titles  extraordinary expenses  for myself  for my wife  for my children  servants wages  gratuities to them  as i have always by me resumed mr flood a years rent of my estate beforehand i make six portions of it at the beginning of every year in the first drawer i put a certain sum which is inviolably reserved for unforeseen occasions in the second what i intend for my own expenses the third contains the money necessary for the domestic charges of the family and my wifes pinmoney the fourth sufficient for the proper education of my children the wages of my servants are in the fifth and in the sixth are the gratuities that i bestow them it is to this last drawer that i owe the happiness of having never had bad servants their wages are for what their duty requires of them but the presents that i distribute to them occasionally are for the performance of what is not strictly comprised within their duty for services in which their affection to me outstrips my orders and my wishes   alfred and dorinda on a fine summers day mr vernon had promised to go a walking with his two children alfred and dorinda in a very fine garden a little way out of town he went up to his dressing room to prepare himself and the children remained in the parlour alfred delighted with the pleasures that he promised himself from his walk jumping and running carelessly to and fro in the room brushed the skirt of his coat against a very valuable flower that his father was rearing with infinite pains and which he had unfortunately just brought in from before the window in order to preserve it from the heat of the sun o brother what have you done said dorinda taking up the flower which was broken off from the stalk she was holding it still in her hand when her father who had finished dressing himself entered the parlour how dorinda said mr vernon in an angry tone do you pluck a flower that you have seen me take so much pains to rear in order to have seed from it dear papa answered dorinda trembling pray do not be angry i am not angry replied mr vernon growing more calm but as you may take a fancy to pluck flowers too in the garden that i am going to see and which does not belong to me you will not take it amiss that i leave you at home  dorinda looked down and held her tongue alfred could not keep silence any longer he approached his father with tears in his eyes and said it was not my sister papa it was i that plucked off the flower so it is i that must stay at home take my sister along with you  mr vernon touched with the ingenuous behavior of his children and their affection for each other kissed them and said you are both dear to me alike and you shall both come with me  alfred and dorinda leaped for joy they went therefore to walk in the garden where they saw plants of the most curious sorts mr vernon with pleasure observed dorinda press her clothes on each side and alfred take up the skirts of his coat under his arms for fear of doing any damage as they walked among the flowers the flower that he had lost would without doubt have given him a good deal of pleasure but he enjoyed much more in seeing mutual affection candor and prudence flourish in his children  the froward little girl oye children who have had the misfortune to contract a vicious habit it is for your comfort and encouragement that i tell the following story in which you will see that amendment is easy whenever one forms a sincere and courageous resolution  rosalind until her seventh year was the joy of her parents at that age when the growing light of reason begins to show us the ugliness of our faults she on the contrary had contracted one which cannot better be described to you than by the example of those snarling ours that growl incessantly and seem always ready to run at your legs and bite them if any one by mistake touched her playthings she would give that person a sidelook and grumble between her teeth for a quarter of an hour if any chid her though ever so gently she would start up and stamp with her feet and throw the chairs about the room neither her father nor mother nor any one of the family could bear with her now it is true she sometimes repented of her faults nay she often shed tears in private on seeing herself become the aversion of every body even to her parents but habit soon got the better of her and her temper became more cross every day one evening it was new years eve she saw her mother go toward her room with a small basket under her cloak rosalind would have followed her but mrs faukner ordered her to go back to the parlour upon this she put on the sullenest face that ever she showed and clapped the door to so violently that she made all the windows rattle half an hour after her mother sent for her what was her surprise on seeing the room lighted up with twenty candles and the table covered with the most elegant toys she could not utter a word trnsperted as she was with joy and admiration come hither rosalind said her mother and read on this paper for whom these things are intended rosalind went to the table and saw amongst the toys a slip of paper on which she read the following words written in large ltters  for an amiable little girl in return for her good behavior  she looked down and did not say a word well rosalind said her mother for whom is this intended  not for me said rosalind with the tears in her eyes  here is another paper said mrs faulkener see if this does not concern you  rosalind took it and read for a froward little girl who is sensible of her faults and in beginning a new year will take pains to amend them oh that is i that is i said she throwing herself into her mothers arms and crying bitterly mrs faulkener also dropped tears partly of sorrow for her daughters faults and partly of joy for the repentance that she showed come said she after a moments silence take what is intended for you and may god who has heard your resolution give you force to execute it  no mama answered rosalind the whole belongs to the person meant in the first paper keep it for me until i am like her you can tell me when i am so this answer gave mrs faulkener much pleasure she therefore immediately put all the toys into a drawer and giving the key to rosalind said there my dear child you shall open the drawer when you yourself shall think it the proper time  near six weeks passed without the least instance of illhumour from rosalind she threw her arms round her mothers neck and sobbing asked may i open the drawer mama yes my dear you may answered mrs faulkener clasping her tenderly in her arms but pray tell me how you have managed to get the better of your temper so i studied it continually replied rosalind it cost me some trouble but every morning and evening and a hundred times in the day i prayed to god to keep up my courage  mrs faulkener shed the most delicious tears and rosalind became mistress of the toys and soon after of the affections of all her friends  her mother related this happy change in presence of a little miss who had the same fault and she was so struck with it that she immediately formed the resolution of imitating rosalind in order to become amiable like her this attempt had the same success and thus rosalind was not only more happy herself but rendered those also happy who chose to profit by her example what child of spirit would not wish to enjoy the same honor and the same happiness  the useful disappointment one fine morning in the month of june ambrose prepared to set out with his father on a party of pleasure which for a fortnight before had taken up all his thoughts he had risen contrary to his custom very early in order to hasten the preparations for his jaunt however just as he thought that he had reached the object of his wishes the sky darkened all at once the clouds grew thick and a violent wind bent down the trees and raised up a tempest of dust ambrose went down every moment into the garden to observe how the sky looked he then skipped up the stairs three at a time to examine the barometer but the sky and the barometer were both against him for all this he did not scruple to give his father good hopes and to assure him that these unfavourable appearances would disperse in a moment that presently it would be the finest weather in the world and he concuded that they ought to set out directly to have the benefit of it  mr powell who did not repose a blind confidence in his sons prognostics thought it more prudent to wait a little just then the clouds burst and discharged a heavy shower of rain ambrose who was doubly disappointed began to cry and obstinately refused to be comforted the rain continued until three oclock in the afternoon at length the clouds dispersed the sun resumed his luster the sky its clearness and all nature breathed the freshness of the spring ambrose recovered his good humor by degrees in proportion as the sky brightened his father took him out a little way and the calmness of the air the singing of the birds the fresh green of the fields and the sweet perfume that breathed all round him restored peace and satisfaction completely to his heart do not you remark said his father to him the agreeable change just now produced all round you recollect how dull every thing yesterday appeared to us the ground parched up by a long drought the flowers without color and hanging their languid heads and in short all vegetation seeming to be at a stand what must we suppose to have so suddenly made nature appear young again the rain that has fallen today said ambrose  the injustice of his complaints and the folly of his behavior struck him sensibly as he pronounced these words he blushed and his father judged that his own thoughts would be sufficient to teach him another time to sacrifice without reluctance a selfish pleasure to the general advantage

did not intend that he should be of use to me in his service but that i should to him in his fortune you told me i recollect that his mother was not able to bring him up but is it true that she is reduced absolutely to indigence   capt d  laying his hand on his breast yes sir it is the exact truth   the prince and by what misfortunes   capt d by this very last war which has enriched so many

scene vii the prince the page asleep the prince what reduced to so distressful a situation by the war dreadful scourge how many families has it plunged into misery still however it is better that they should be unhappy by the war than by me it is necessity and not my choice that has made me take up arms  he rises and after walking about a little stops before the pages chair amiable child  how he sleeps at his ease it is innocence in the arms of sleep he thinks himself in the house of a friend where he ought not to be under constraint perfectly in nature  walks about again his mother but indeed i should not concern myself much for her if she were like the captain i will put her to the proof in order to know her and then  then it will be time enough to take my measures  he leans ever the back of the armchair and looking fondly at the page perceives a letter hanging out of his pocket but what is this a letter  opens it and reads at the bottom your affectionate mother catharine dorffen ah it is from his mother shall i read it i wish to know her character she will not dissemble with her own child let us see  reeds  my dear son the difficulty that you find in writing has not i see hindered your complying with my request and your letter is even longer than i could expect this willingness in you convinces me that you love me i am sensible of it and thank you sincerely for it you tell me that you have been introduced to the prince that he has been so good as to approve of you that he is the best and mildest of masters and that you love him very much already  he looks at the page what my friend you have written so to your mother i only do my duty then in making you a return and in seeking to give you proofs of my friendship you have reason to love him my dear child for without his generous assistance what would be your lot in this world you have lost your father and although your mother be still living you are not the less to be pitied fortune has put it out of her power to fulfill her duty to you that is my greatest grief and the most cruel of my distresses while i had only to think of myself misfortunes could never affect me but when your image offers itself to my thoughts my heart is ready to burst and my tears never cease much tenderness much sensibility appears here and if she be as excellent a woman as she is a tender mother  and why should she not she is i have not a doubt of it i cannot my dear lead you myself in the road to fortune as i could wish i am obliged to remain here in solitude and retirement but i shall never cease to give you my advice with all the earnestness of affection and while my voice can reach you it shall constantly entreat you to follow the paths of honor and virtue as a fresh proof of that obedience which you have hitherto shown to me i request you always to carry this letter about you  looks at the page well he has been obedient if ever you should be in danger of failing in your duty or neglecting the advice that i gave you when i kissed you at parting and bedewed you with my tears then my dear son remember this letter open it think of your mother your unfortunate mother who is only supported in her solitude by the hopes that she builds on you what has he not a brother think that she would die with grief were you to behave amiss and that you yourself would stab the heart that loves you above all things upon earth she sees his danger she is right for he is much exposed here ought the to have sent him hither it is not suspicion or distrust that make me speak thus your behavior never gave me cause for them no my dear child but your brother has made my tears flow you i hope will spare the feelings of your mother more than he has done so then the eldest  the ensign  i must inform myself more of this you have always behaved with duty and respect i own it with tears of joy go on my dear child become an honest man and your mother be she ever so poor ever so unhappy will soon forget her misfortunes and distress very well i like this woman misfortune exalts her sentiments instead of depressing them you tell me at the end of your letter that all your companions have watches i know that you should have one too however you break off there and do not express even a wish for one this reserve pleases me and i am unhappy in not being able to reward it you know my dear that i cannot and therefore you will pardon me business of importance calls me to the capital i am going thither and this journey will take from me what little money i have left it is a necessary expense and i cannot avoid it but be assured that in the end i shall do every thing in my power to satisfy your wish and should i even stint myself of necessaries i will never suffer my hearts best beloved to want an encouragement to virtue i hope soon to see you again and am  this woman is worthy of a better lot i will keep this letter and show it to my wife but no it is this childs treasure why deprive him of it  he puts the letter into the pages pocket again with what tranquillity he sleeps still heaven they say prepares the happiness of its children while they sleep  he takes him by the hand ho my little friend  the page awakes and looks at the prince for some time he is a charming child upon my life come my little friend awake it is broad day and you cannot sleep here any longer rise   the page  rising slowly yes sir   the prince you are fast asleep still here go into my bedroom  he goes in put out the light and shut the doors now go to that place where you found the watch make haste not

 the prince joy sparkles in your eyes when i speak of her  aside what affection they bear to each other even in poverty but is your mother very good   the page  taking the princes hand between both

forbid to open my lips about it if his colonel knew   with an air of confidence oh that colonel is an illnatured man   the prince he shall know nothing of it i promise you speak then what has been the matter what has your brother done   the page a great many things i dont know myself quite how it was i only saw that my mother was mighty angry about it and to hide my brothers fault she gave away all that she was worth in the world  he goes near to the prince and speaks low only for that she said he might have been broke   the prince broke for what   the page ah sir i cannot tell that   the prince what not to me   the page they would not let myself know that   the prince  laughing they were very right i think but as to you since you have not a watch i suppose you asked your mother in your letter to buy you one   the page only once no more   the prince oh then she was angry with you   the page no no sir so far from that she wrote to me that she would spare from the little money that she had and buy me one i am sorry that i spoke to her of it she can hardly live as it is that grieves me very much   the prince so it should a good son should not be an expense to his mother it is his duty on the contrary to seek all means of relieving her as to the watch if that were all one might content you  he takes out his purse hold my little friend here are twelve guineas that i can spare i will make you a present of them give me your hand   the page  holding his hand while the prince counts cut the money are they for me sir   the prince yes certainly but tell me what do you think to do with this money   the page could not i buy a watch with it   the prince yes and a very handsome one but however when we consider the matter you have no absolute occasion for a watch there are enough here  while he speaks the page looks earnestly at him if i were in your place i know very well what i would do i would lay that money out better however just as you please i am going to dress stay here until i come back   the page  calling him sir   the prince well what do you want   the page my mother is in town she sets off this morning and i could wish to take my leave of her  coaxingly will your highness give me leave   the prince no my boy there is no occasion for that your mother shall come to you for this time you shall see her have a little patience  he goes out   scene viii the page she will come here i shall see her here what can be the reason of that no matter if she comes and sees me that is enough one two three   counts all the money twelve guineas to buy a watch how happy i am i think i have it a ready in my hands i hear it click and wind it up myself but when the prince said that he knew very well what he would do if he was in my place what did he mean by that what would he do then ah he has watches in all his rooms so he does not know what it is to want one but he told me too that a good son should relieve his mother no doubt he was thinking then of mine twelve guineas  looks at them it is a great deal of money indeed a great deal of money if my mother had them they would be of great service to her  he presses the money to his breast with both his hands ah a watch a watch  lets his hands fall but then a mother too and so kind a mother yesterday too she was so dull she looked so pale and so ill i do believe that giving her this money would recover her at once  shall i go without it myself for her sake   with resolution yes i will  but let her come soon for i may change my mind i have the watch at heart still  puts his singer on his mouth not a word i hist somebody comes   scene ix mrs dorffen captain derenhoff the page the page  running to meet his mother ah mama   mrs dorffen  looks anxiously round without minding the child i do not know brother but i am uneasy what can his highness want with me   capt d there look at that child he is going to give him back to you  she looks at the child with surprise and concern who meantime hangs on her quite joyful but in fact it was nonsense to bring him here what can the prince do with him the other pages grow up appear like men and enter into the army but he   with a look of contempt he is such a diminutive creature he never will be good for any thing the milk that you gave him was poisoned by your griefs he is a plant that is spoiled at the root he will never have strength or figure   mrs dorffen  sorrowfully oh brother   capt d in short when you see the prince be sure not to say a word to him of this child it would be to no purpose rather solicit him in favor of the ensign he has some appearance at least he is a man   mrs dorffen in favor of the ensign   capt d yes he has sent for him   mrs dorffen you frighten me can he have learnt    capt d  coldly it may be so nay indeed it is probable  leaning upon his cane and shaking his head what do you think would be the consequence if he knew that the puppy meant to decamp and had taken up money and that it is only on my account who settled the affair   with vehemence i tell you and you will see it i shall suffer for my own good nature and perhaps be put under arrest myself i wish i had never concerned myself about your children however i never shall again   as he goes off grumbling he turns back no i never shall as long as i live  goes out   scene x mrs dorffen the page the page  seeing her concern my uncle is always in a bad humor but let him talk on mama never fear   mrs dorffen be quiet child you dont know    the page oh i know more than he does the prince is not what he says he never does harm to any body so far

large purse that was full of gold a little before you came ah if the prince chose mama if he chose  oh he is rich i promise you   mrs dorffen but how was this i do not understand it he must have had some reason   the page certainly his watch was stopped he had been hunting all day yesterday and forgot to wind it up and this morning   he runs to the bedroom and opens the door there mama there is the place where he lay so he called me and bid me look at my watch and as i had none    mrs dorffen he gave you that money   the page yes he gave it to me to buy one  showing the money again twelve guineas mama   mrs dorffen look at me am i to believe you   the page indeed you may but i am not in a hurry for a watch i shall have one some time or other  taking his mothers hand take this money

unfortunate mother   the page  taking his mothers hand again but you will take this money though i beg you my dear mama not to refuse me   mrs dorffen yes my dear i will take it as others may impose upon you i shall take care to    the page to do what to buy me a watch   mrs dorffen why if you remain with the prince you will want one   the page oh no no the prince has watches in every room he told me himself that i should not want one   mrs dorffen but what he has given you was to buy one   the page that is what he told me however   mrs dorffen you are deceiving me my dear and even your fondness for your mother should not make you tell a story   the page a story then you do not believe me now i wish that his highness were here i wish he would come  turning about ah here he is himself   scene xi the prince mrs dorffen the page the page  running to meet the prince is not it true sir that you gave me twelve guineas at first to buy a watch   the prince  smiling yes my man   the page and did not you tell me afterward that i should not want one   the prince yes that is true too   the page  turning immediately toward his mother well mama now   mrs dorffen  confused your highness will be so good as to excuse the simplicity of a child who forgets the respect    the prince excuse it madam that simplicity delights me and i could wish to find it in every body it is so agreeable to nature well my man your mother would not believe you then   the page  looking a little vexed no sir at first she would not believe me and afterward she would not accept the money   the prince what do you say accept why have you thought so little of my present as to give it away again i cannot suppose that   the page  hesitating sir    the prince if i thought so i should not be very ready to give you more come then tell me the truth is it so   the page  pointing to his mother ah sir my mama is so poor   the prince  chucking him under the chin good little soul have you given up then the only object of your wishes in order to relieve your mother it would be very hard indeed that you should lose a watch for doing so  he takes out his own there if i had but this single watch i would give it to you to reward your affection   the page  taking it joyfully ah sir but does it go   the prince never fear it goes very well  the page runs to his mother to show her the watch   the prince come my little friend put up your watch and since you have made so good use of the little that i gave you  gives him his purse here take this there are a hundred guineas instead of the first twelve   the page  looking at him with astonishment sir   the prince do you hesitate here take them   the page what the purse sir and all that is   going to return it indeed it is too much   the prince yes for yourself but i give it to you that you may dispose of it and who do you think wants it most   the page who wants it  looks at the prince and his mother by turns there mama take it   mrs dorffen  coming forward toward the prince your highness    the prince pray no acknowledgements madam you will find that it is very little and i fear it may be of more harm to you than advantage but  pointing to the page i need not tell you that this child is too weak and too little for my service at his age children are hardly able to do much for others in short i hope you will have no objection to take him back again you are silent   mrs dorffen your highness will excuse    the prince what   mrs dorffen i own sir i am wrong to blush for a poverty which i did not bring upon myself and i may without disgrace ingenuously confess it to my sovereign  coming nearer and looking steadfastly at him yes fir my circumstances are too narrow to maintain and bring up my son i have long looked forward to the future with an anxious eye and now my fears are real i shall be the victim of grief ah if i must carry back with me into the sorrowful retreat of misery this child that your highness returns to me who is the only object of all my concern this child who is too young as yet   endeavoring to contain her tears to  feel the loss of a father  ah pardon a mothers weakness   the page  taking the princes hand sorrowfully mama is crying sir   the prince well supposing that you were to live with your mother   the page  with a look of entreaty your highness will not send me home   the prince no do you think not this considence my little friend pleases me madam he may stay and yet it would be a pity if his morals his innocence  but no there is nothing to fear as yet   mrs dorffen  looking at him attentively his innocence did your highness say   the prince there is no fear madam you would imagine perhaps that i wish to draw back my word but dont be uneasy   mrs dorffen  fearfully yet might i take the liberty without breaking through the respect that i owe your highness to request you to explain yourself    the prince madam what i meant was this i have for some time past been extremely dissatisfied with my pages their company and example might perhaps  yet after all it is but a perhaps and one may try    mrs dorffen  eagerly seizing her sons hand no sir   the prince  affecting displeasure no as you please madam   mrs dorffen my sons innocence is too dear to me i shudder at the dangers to which i was going to expose him   the prince but consider    mrs dorffen i consider nothing i see my son in the midst of the flames and if i can but save him no matter though he should be naked   the prince but without fortune without education madam what will become of him   mrs dorffen whatever it shall please heaven i submit to the divine will if he cannot support his birth let him go labor in the fields let him die in poverty but retain his innocence   the prince  in his natural manner this is thinking nobly yes madam i see you deserve every thing that i can possibly do for you  coming nearer to her and speaking with earnestness in what can i be of assistance to you tell me how i can serve you only speak you see a friend before you   mrs dorffen  with emotion ah sir    the prince tell me first of all what is your situation how are you with regard to your estate   mrs dorffen it will be absolutely impossible sir for me to save it   the prince your debts then are pretty considerable you are at law now i am told do not they give you any hopes   mrs dorffen none sir one cause concerning a small inheritance should have been decided long ago in my favor my title is indisputable but interest and money are against it necessity brought me hither to town in order to endeavor a compromise but i could not succeed   the prince so much the better you shall have justice now without making any sacrifice i give you my word of honor and accept moreover a pension of a hundred a year i hope that it will put you above every necessity   mrs dorffen  throwing herself at his feet oh sir so much goodness how shall i    the prince  raising her what are you doing madam rise i request you i only discharge what i owe to the memory of a man whose widow you are i do for you no more than i would do for any one whose virtue i esteemed tell me would you still hesitate to take back your child   mrs dorffen sir could i so forget    the prince and you my little friend would you like to go back with your mother   the page  playing with his watch with my mother yes sir   the prince and yet now i know that you love me would not you like as well to stay with me   the page yes very well sir   the prince now if that be so were i to give you back to your mother it would be sending you away from me and you have asked me so earnestly to keep you here besides your mother has thrown you into my arms i must therefore take another way to settle matters stop here madam i shall be with you in a moment   scene xii mrs dorffen the page mrs dorffen  throwing herself into an arm chair o blessed day o unexpected happiness   the page well mama well are you glad   mrs dorffen  drawing him to her affectionately o my son my dear son   the page but you do not rejoice you ought to be merrier mama   mrs dorffen even my happiness makes me blush it reproaches me for the little trust that i had in providence and for the sorrow that i felt when you came into the world it was but a moment after i had heard of the loss of your father i looked at you with pity and lamented that you ever saw the light  she takes him in her arms and kisses him yet it was you that was to relieve your unfortunate mother your young hands were to dry up her tears o heaven what can i now desire more nothing nothing but to be sure of your brothers lot and then my happiness would be complete   the page my brothers why mama what of him   mrs dorffen if the prince knew what he has done    the prince and if he did there would be nothing of it you saw how good and how generous he is   mrs dorffen to us my dear who are not guilty of any crime   the page besides he promised me that he would not tell and that the colonel should know nothing of it   mrs dorffen  frightened what he promised you   the page yes indeed so you need not be afraid   mrs dorffen i am thunderstruck you have told him then   the page nay hardly any thing only all that i knew and then he asked me concerning my brothers behavior and so i could not tell a fib you know you bid me never to do so   mrs dorffen but my dear child    the page why mama are you uneasy   mrs dorffen uneasy o heavens can you ask oh if the prince should enquire farther if he should be informed  you may ruin your mother and your brother you may plunge us all into the deepest misery   the page  ready to cry the deepest misery   mrs dorffen somebody comes   she kisses and encourages him say not a word dry up your tears they will only perhaps make the matter worse do not be uneasy   scene xiii mrs dorffen the page the prince followed by captain derenhoff and ensign dorffen the prince come in gentlemen  to the ensign you are ensign dorffen then the son of that brave major   ensign dorffen  bowing very low yes sir   the prince that is a great recommendation with me your father was a man of honor and a brave officer i have no doubt but his example rouses your emulation and that you strive to make yourself worthy of him   ensign dorffen sir i only do my duty   the prince that is doing every thing the bravest man can do no more there sir is your mother her virtues and the hopes that may be formed of this amiable child have given me the most favorable idea of your family and therefore i wished to see you all assembled here   ensign dorffen  still bowing your highness does me particular honor   the prince no more certainly than you deserve   ensign dorffen your highness judges favorably of me   the prince really sir i only want to be confirmed in the opinion that i am tempted to form of you at present in order to make your fortune and yet that air of freedom and confidence that becomes you so well    ensign dorffen ah sir   the prince denotes permit me to say a heart either very noble or very corrupt the son of such parents cannot be suspected certainly not therefore sir what can we do to serve you a step higher would not advance you much in rank what think you   ensign dorffen  rubbing his hands no certainly sir   the prince now if we were to pass over this step a company the rank of captain it is the main object with you young gentlemen but first   turning short round to capt derenhoff sir what is your opinion of your nephew   capt derenhoff  something confused mine sir my opinion   the prince one would think it to be unfavourable   capt derenhoff no sir rather much the contrary i believe that he has courage and will be a brave    the prince  looking with satisfaction at ensign dorffen ay is that true   capt derenhoff besides he has a promising figure   the prince he is a fine lad i confess but his behavior his morals i am ashamed indeed to ask you about such trifles in short what is his character   capt derenhoff  smiling oh a little too airy sometimes petulant after all sir you know that does not misbecome a soldier   the prince i know really that is something new to me i want now madam only your testimony what will you say of your son   after a pause nothing   mrs dorffen what should i say of him   the prince what you think the truth   mrs dorffen but can i sir if i had reason to praise him would you wish me to do it in his presence or should i speak to his prejudice before him who can determine his fortune   the prince  smiling excellent madam to the fondness of a mother you join the address of a woman i cannot but admire you  in a serious tone sir every one has his way i have mine when i mean to advance an officer i begin with putting him under arrest what do you think of it   ensign dorffen  frightened sir    the prince yes that is my manner give up your sword to the captain an air of more modesty would have excused all but this confidence this undaunted toe  what can be expected from a person who with your conscience is master of such assurance who should be sensible that he has deserved my displeasure who knows how unworthily he has treated the best of mothers and who nevertheless  sir let him be confined for a month i will have no explanation upon what is past and that on your account madam and because of the manner in which i came by my information but particularly because circumstances make me presume that his fault is of a weighty nature   with a severe and determined voice captain if hereafter any thing should happen i desire to be informed of it immediately you understand immediately i mean to advance this young man and neither you  to the captain nor  in a gentler tone you madam shall make me alter my plan  never give him any thing never the smallest trifle by way of present his pay may serve him and let him learn to contract his expenses  making a sign with his hand go sir to your confinement  the two officers go out   scene xiv the prince mrs dorffen the page the prince well madam you seem dejected   mrs dorffen  respectfully sir i am a mother   the prince but you are not one of those weak mothers who to spare their children a slight mortification choose not to correct them   mrs dorffen that would be a very false tenderness no sir i only fear that he may have lost for ever his princes favor   the prince do not be uneasy madam my design is barely to make him worthy of the favors that i mean to bestow on him his youth claims some indulgence therefore i excuse his levities and indiscretion but i shall not always do so what in one person brings back the love of virtue along with repentance will in another strengthen his inclination to vice upon the whole make yourself easy the young gentleman will come to himself and i shall proportion my favor to his improvement  turning to the page as to this child do you know what my intentions are   mrs dorffen whatever they are sir they will only aim to secure his happiness o sir i have never let pass a day without paying to your virtues the tribute of my homage but i now see how far it fell below them   the prince what would you say madam you do not know me my object is to give the state a worthy member and myself a faithful servant and to raise up for my son a friend who may one day be ready to sacrifice his life for him as his father has done for me   scene xv the prince mrs dorffen the page attendant attendant please your highness the master of the royal academy   the prince let him come in i hope madam that you need only
