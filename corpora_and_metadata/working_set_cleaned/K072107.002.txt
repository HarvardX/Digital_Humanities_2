praefatio london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxv  an essay on old maids part iii on old maids in ancient history chap i conjectures concerning the existence of old maids before the deluge a dutch author distinguished by his erudition and his misfortunes has endeavored to prove in a dissertation of more learning than modesty that when our progenitors were first created it was the intention of heaven that eve herself should become an old maid and that original sin was introduced into the world by the disobedience of our frail mother not literally in eating a mysterious fruit but in wandering from the path of virgin purity this fanciful hypothesis did not arise in the heavy air of holland  the idea was entertained by some illustrious fathers of the church and the great living historian of the roman empire in those sarcastic remarks on christianity which are the only blemish in his exquisite composition has observed it was their favorite opinion that if adam had preserved his obedience to the creator he would have lived and died in a state of virgin purity and that some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise with a race of innocent and immortal beings in a note to this passage the great historian informs us that justin gregory of nyssa augustine etc strongly inclined to this opinion but he has not attended with his usual accuracy to the idea entertained by the last of these fathers on this curious point augustine in the   th book of his city of god enters into a long and rather indelicate discussion of it he affirms that paradise would have been peopled not by a harmless mode of vegetation but by an actual intercourse between the sexes yet unstimulated by any wanton or passionate desire and as a proof that man might have possessed this perfect command over his innocent frame the good father and his learned commentator lodovicus vives allege the most whimsical and ludicrous occurrences that were ever recorded by a serious pen the curious reader may find these extraordinary anecdotes related in very coarse but explicit language at the    th page of the english translation of st augustine printed in    0 i ought perhaps like the holy father himself when speaking of matters much more indecent to ask the pardon of chaste eyes for pointing out to them such indelicate wonders but i flatter myself the kind sisterhood will forgive the coarseness of the story for the sake of my zealous solicitude to indulge their curiosity i trust i may afford them both amusement and instruction by showing them how strangely men of the most reverend character have been betrayed by frivolous speculation into the grossest absurdity  perhaps without the sanctity of augustine i am now exposing myself to a similar censure but if an enquiry into antediluvian virginity should be considered by any morose or skeptical readers as a frivolous speculation let them remember that i am professedly following the example of those great antiquarians who have astonished the present enlightened age by the profundity of their researches the elaborate works of these gentlemen evidently prove that they have two considerable and separate points to pursue the first and most important to display their own extensive erudition the second and inferior to inform or to amuse their reader which like all other secondary aims must be frequently sacrificed to the more important after the mavelous intimate acquaintance which the learned mr bryant has shown with the family of chus the grandson of noah every author who professes to treat of an ancient institution may be reasonably expected to give some account of whatever relates to it either immediately after or long before the deluge and the respect which i bear to the sisterhood makes me ambitious of showing them that i have diligently ransacked such memorials of past ages both genuine and fictitious as i thought likely to elucidate the history of their longneglected though venerable order yet as it is an established privilege of authors to point out their own particular merits and the particular failings of their brethren let me here modestly boast of my own candor in not endeavoring to raise the antiquity of the interesting order to which my pen is devoted at the expense of truth a failing that almost all my brother antiquarians may be said i fear to have learned from each other for my own part i wish the chaste sisterhood in all points that concern both themselves and others to distinguish rumor from fact  on these principles i shall proceed to tell them that eve herself has been said to have instituted a religious order of certain young women who were to continue virgins and to preserve unextinguished the fire which had fallen from heaven on the sacrifice of abel st romuald abrege du tresor chronologique  this chaste institution is reported to have arisen in the ninetyninth year of the world an advocate for the existence of antediluvian chastity may appeal to an evidence of respectable authority to no less a personage than the prophet enoch the seventh in a direct line from adam in certain fragments still preserved of this most early writer we are told that some women in the age of this ingenious patriarch had devoted themselves to a life of virginity but it is proper to add that although the composition of enoch is mentioned in the epistle of st jude the authenticity of these fragments has been forcibly called in question and though quoted and defended by some of the fathers yet most modern authors of eminence and particularly the learned sir walter rawleigh in the first book of his history of the world seem inclined to consider them as a fiction  the very concise narration which moses has given us of events before the flood has tempted the fanciful rabbis of the jews and other writers on sacred history to amuse themselves with the composition of various antediluvian romances among the most remarkable and amusing of these we may reckon the fable of an amorous connection between the apostate angels and the daughters of men a fable so fascinating to a lively imagination that our divine poet has introduced it in the most serious manner as a part of satans answer to belial in the  d book of paradise regained before the flood thou with thy lusty crew false titled sons of god roaming the earth cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men and coupled with them and begot a race ver     etc we may observe also that in his greater poem this sublimest of bards alludes more than once to this illicit commerce betwixt the angelical and human kind as the idea was founded on a misconstruction of the following passage in the sixth chapter of genesis the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose this strange story has been sometimes an object of the most serious credit and a very learned modern divine heidegger has annexed to his elaborate history of the patriarchs a dissertation to prove from scripture from reason and from the nature of angels that these aetherial spirits whatever shape they might assume were utterly incapable of begetting children  if we might venture to consider this fable as genuine history we might certainly draw from it a very strong argument against the existence of antediluvian old maids for if the evil spirits were permitted to exercise such power over the females of the infant world what fair individual could be supposed to have preserved her chastity when both men and demons were personally engaged in its destruction  but rejecting this fabulous interference of these licentious angels and adhering to the more just interpretation of the mosaic history let us now examine what we may fairly conclude on the point in question the family of seth are represented as orderly and devout but as the state of the world seemed to require a hasty increase of its inhabitants it is not probable that any female even in that sober race should have proved so unreasonable as to decline concurring in the important work of peopling the wide wilderness of the earth if any peculiar sanctity or selfdenial may be supposed to have existed for a short time among this more innocent division of the human race it was soon overpowered by the influence of the most licentious examples the purity of the sethites was corrupted by the temptations they found among the children of cain and the state of female manners at this period is very forcibly described in the following lines of milton for that fair female troop thou saw that seemed of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay yet empty of all good wherein consists womans domestic honor and chief praise bred only and completed to the taste of lustful appetence to sing to dance to dress and troll the tongue and roll the eye to these that sober race of men whose lives religious titled them the sons of god shall yield up all their virtue all their fame ignobly to the trains and to the smiles of these fair atheists and now swim in joy ere long to swim at large and laugh for which the world ere long a world of tears must weep paradise lost book xi ver     these verses compared with the former quotation from paradise regained afford a striking proof how ingeniously the great poet adopted the most opposite interpretations of scripture as they happened to suit his poetical purposes  i cannot help remarking that although some lines in the passage just quoted are supremely beautiful yet in the close of it both the genius and the justice of this incomparable poet appear to have deserted him the puerility of expression in the two last lines is particularly unhappy and the assertion that female wantonness was the chief cause of the deluge appears rather uncandid and cruel let us however apologize for the noblest of bards on this occasion by observing that he was probably misled by his reverence for a learned and holy character as his description seems to be borrowed from the annals of eutychius the patriarch of alexandria  though i cannot subscribe to this severity on the first female inhabitants of the world yet after what i have alleged i may venture i think to terminate this chapter by asserting that from every thing which a diligent enquiry can collect on this very deep and delicate question we have the strongest reason to suppose there never existed such a being as an antediluvian old maid  into what blind and unjust conjectures are we poor mortals betrayed when we attempt to estimate the constitution and character of our remote predecessors  i had just closed the preceding speculation against the existence of an antediluvian old maid when i was agreeably surprised by the arrival of a packet from a learned friend who had promised to collect for me in his travels over europe and asia every scrap of antiquity that could afford me any light in my maiden researches although the favor which i have now received from him abundantly proves that i was grossly mistaken in my conjectural account of antediluvian virginity i shall suffer what i had written to stand as a warning to future antiquarians not to indulge themselves in such hasty decisions  i cannot more strongly express my zeal for the sisterhood than by presenting to them with a sincere delight this very choice morsel of antediluvian history which destroys my hypothesis and by thus asserting their primaeval honor at the expense of my own historical sagacity  my friend the learned traveller writes me word from spain which he is now visiting on his return that as soon as he reaches england he shall correct for the press a journal of his tour that in a supplement to his travels he intends to insert some other ancient tracts which he has fortunately rescued from oblivion that he will there recount the incidents which led to their discovery and clearly prove that the fragment with which he has favored me must have proceeded from the pen of enoch himself he assures me that he has sent a most faithful translation and that he can demonstrate by unanswerable arguments that this fragment was contained among those very writings of enoch which the pious tertullian declared he had perused and from which the celebrated postellus confessed he had borrowed very freely in his elaborate treatise on the origin of things  but i shall wave all farther preface that i may no longer detain the reader from a precious and interesting moral tale of the most eminent author that existed before the deluge  and among the ninety and three daughters of enoch there was none like note by the editor i am inclined to suppose that the name of this interesting personage kunaza has been misspelt in the haste of transcription and that it ought to be written kanaza which signifies in the arabic language to deposit as a treasure a signification that the word might naturally acquire from the singular history of the maiden whose name it originally was  as we use the verb to hector from the old trojan hero   kunaza she was beautiful but despised her beauty she was nimble as the deer yet delighted not in the dance  she looked with pity on those who trusted in the fleeting pleasures of the earth  she saw that love was poisoned with jealousy and that marriage was embittered by strife  her soul was enamoured of heavenly contemplation and she said to her father  o my father permit me to live and to die a virgin conduct me through life by the light of thy spirit and teach me to walk with thee in the way of our creator  and her father rejoiced in the purity of his child but the kindred of kunaza held her continence in derision  they said to her there is no plant that bears not seed and no creature that does not produce young  thou will be the only fruitless thing upon the face of the earth and when thou departest there will be none to lament thee  but kunaza disregarded their scoffs and in the two hundred and ninetyfirst year of her age she rejected the last offer that was made to her of marriage  now it happened at this time that the angels appointed to watch the earth forgot their duty  they saw that women were beautiful and they burned with impure desires for the daughters of men  they prospered in their career of uncleanness they made the earth a scene of abomination  they begot a multitude of giants and they boasted of their enormities  for semiexas the prince of the licentious angels commanded twenty of their chiefs to appear before him  and they bound themselves by an oath to assemble together on the ninth night of every new year and to recount in order the feats of their impurity  and they assembled on the summit of a mountain which was called hermoniim or the mountain of the oath  but the moon hid her head and the stars refused to witness the vaunts of their uncleanness  and they rejoiced in the darkness which their discourse engendered because their deeds had been evil  and semiexas their prince first related the evil which he had done  and atarkuph related the evil which he had done  and arakiel related the evil which he had done  and chababiel related the evil which he had done  and sapsick related the evil which he had done  and of the twenty impure spirits one only continued silent and the silent one was pharmarus  and their prince semiexas was offended by his silence and commanded him to speak  and pharmarus looked up with a look of indignant derision and he said  ye are spirits of low ambition ye are contented with the shadow of victory where there is no resistance  but i rejoice to contend with reluctant caprice i delight to triumph over the coy maiden over the maiden of much delay and of many excuses  and as he spoke there arose from the assembly of angels a noisy burst of insurmountable laughter  the mountain was shaken to its base by the shout of their derision  and semiexas their prince exclaimed o pharmarus inventor of magic o thou dealer in dark things is there verily such a maiden upon the face of the earth  and pharmarus answered and said o thou prince of the impassioned angels i wonder not that thou art slow to believe me  for thou have met with no female that could resist thy perfection the beauty of woman has yielded unto thee as the soft air yields to the imperious wing of the eagle  but attend and i will impart to you the wonderful things i have discovered among the daughters of men  as we ourselves have panted for the pleasures of earth as we have burnt for the enjoyments of corporeal existence  so has woman also had the ambition to exchange her nature and to cloth herself in the perfection of spirit  i sought the embraces of kunaza the maiden daughter of enoch but though the prime of her youth is departed she disdainfully turned from my entreaty  she has renounced the delights of her nature she has determined to give her virginity to the grave yet in time she shall accede to my wishes for i have studied the weaknesses of woman  her principal weaknesses are four and i will make an experiment on the influence of each  i will awaken her pride and that alone may tempt her to unite with pharmarus  i will excite her avarice and she may then be eager to give her beauty in exchange for the glittering spoils of the earth  i will stimulate her desire and her powers of resistance will melt away  i will inflame her curiosity and what is there which the maiden who thirsts for a secret will not give to obtain it  i swear by the subtlety of the serpent she shall not escape from my passion  i will triumph over the coy perversity of the virgin or i will shake this round earth to its center  and the prince semiexas answered and said well have thou spoken pharmarus thou inventor of magic thy speech is worthy of thyself thou dealer in occult machinations  go and prosper in thy devices and when we next assemble divert us with the relation of thy success  he spoke he dissolved the assembly and pharmarus departed from his fellows  he departed to employ himself alone in the evil of which he intended to vaunt in their next meeting but he was doomed to meet them no more  and now he pondered in solitude on various wiles he exerted all the subtlety of his spirit to circumvent the virgin  he approached her under the guise of a friend he became familiar with the maiden in the shape of an instructor  she listened with avidity to his knowledge her understanding feasted on the wonders he revealed and it happened on a certain day while he conversed with her on the art of divination that pharmarus suddenly exclaimed  o kunaza thou art yet to learn that on this day thy sister kezia has brought a young anack or giant into the world  the wonders of nature are worth the attention of the wise let us hasten to the tent of thy sister let us examine how she has improved by her travail the little race of the earth  and kunaza arose with pharmarus and she hastened to the tent of her sister  and behold all things had happened as pharmarus had foretold to kunaza  for kezia the seventieth daughter of enoch had conceived by semiexas the prince of the licentious angels she had brought him a male child and this was the first anack that was born upon the earth  and kunaza beheld the infant and she was astonished in surveying its stature  she embraced the babe with amazement and she delighted in the magnitude of its limbs  and she delivered the babe to its mother kezia and she observed the proud transport of the mother in contemplating the dimensions of the child  and the first temptation of pharmarus began to work in the bosom of kunaza and her heart said in secret to itself how pleasant a thing it must be to look with the eyes of a mother on the smiling face of a young giant  and pharmarus read all her inmost thoughts he exulted and burned to be alone with the virgin  and he prevailed on kunaza to walk abroad from the tent of her sister that he might show her some latent wonders of the creation  and as he walked by the side of the maiden he strove to fan the rising wish she had felt to experience the proud delights of a parent  but the mind of the maiden had argued with itself and these were the dictates of her mind  o kunaza make use of thy reason and resist the temptation of pride which is founded upon folly  of the ninety and three daughters of thy father there is not one who may not bring forth a young anack  could thou be proud of what the most foolish of thy sex may accomplish of a work in which fools may excel  o kunaza if thou were destined by thy nature to feel the weakness of pride let thy pride at least be confined to a venial exultation in the excellence of thy spirit  and pharmarus read these unuttered words in her soul and he saw that she would not fall by the influence of pride  and he now labored to tempt her with treasures and to bribe her into compliance with his desire  he offered her a metal whose polished splendour should emulate the sun and a stone whose luster should contend with the brilliancy of her eyes  he exclaimed o kunaza give thyself to pharmarus and he will make thee to be called the richest among women  but the subtle angel could not raise for a moment the base passion of avarice in the noble heart of kunaza  the maiden answered and said the true wealth of a woman is peace of spirit and her brightest ornaments are modesty and meekness  and pharmarus marvelled at her discretion and he was inwardly vexed with a great vexation  but he suppressed the murmur of disappointment and hastily engaged in new stratagems against the maiden  and as he still walked in converse with kunaza he stopped beneath the inviting shade of a majestic palm  and he said thou intelligent maiden who delightest in the history of the earth attend and i will instruct thee in mysterious wonders that relate to this tree  but observe its goodly growth and observe the happy creatures that sport within the ample space of its longextended shadow  and kunaza surveyed the tree she saw that it was supreme in beauty  the ground beneath it was flowery and fragrant as paradise the most tender and lovely animals of the creation were assembled in its shade and every animal was happy with its mate  o kunaza said the false and artful pharmarus i will now tell thee the blessings that belong to this spot  thou beholdest the first nuptial couch of thy parents it was here that eve first reclined when the envy of the guardian spirits had expelled her from eden  it was here that she became first acquainted with connubial endearment and felt herself repaid for the paradise she had left  and the angel of union gave a blessing to the tree under which the first mother reclined  he blessed the tree and all the ground that extends under the shadow thereof  he blessed all the creatures that sport around it he ordained that every daughter of woman who reclines beneath its shade shall experience unutterable joy beyond the common joy of her sex  but this blessing has been long forgotten by the heedless offspring of man it is a joyous secret reserved for me to impart to my beloved  so spoke the subtle pharmarus and as he spoke he infused into the wondering virgin the thrilling flame of desire  the bosom of kunaza began to heave and her breath on a sudden grew short  and pharmarus exulted in his subtlety and was preparing to complete his triumph  and a piercing cry was heard from afar and kunaza started up at the sound  she listened and the cry redoubled and kunaza exclaimed as sure as we have life it is the cry of a woman in travail  and she heard the sound a third time and she said verily it is the expression of that pain which was inflicted upon woman for listening to a subtle tempter  it is a warning to the weak kunaza i thank thee my good angel i feel that thou have saved me from the subtlety of pharmarus  and as the virgin spoke she sprung forward and hastened toward the place from whence the cry had proceeded  and pharmarus began to pursue her but he stopped in his pursuit and reflected that the influence of his temptation was vanished from her frame  he roamed in discontent about the earth and employed himself in darker devices to ensnare the maiden  and he sent curious gifts which he had collected from the extremities of the earth to entice the virgin again from the tent of her father  he promised to entertain her with all the latent wonders of the creation and he drew her by magical illusion into the inmost recesses of a gloomy grove  he appeared to her in all his false grandeur as the prince of magic whom the elements obey as their lord and to whom light and darkness are one  whose word can render what existeth invisible and make the thing which is not appear as the thing which is  and kunaza marvelled at his powers and he took her by the hand and said  o thou maiden of angelical spirit who have a passion to dive into the mysteries of the universe  listen to me give me thy love and i will fill thy capacious mind with that mysterious knowledge for which thy heart pants  thou have upbraided me that i seek to deceive thee and thou have mentioned the example of thy parent eve  but i will show thee thou deceivest thyself if thou have courage to learn the real truth from the dead  tell me thou most angelic among the daughters of men shall i set the apparition of thy first parent before thee shall i call up the departed eve from the grave to tell thee what it truly becomes all her daughters to do  and kunaza pondered and said verily it would please me to see and hear the departed spirit of the first woman  and pharmarus exulted and said my soul delights in thy fellowship o thou most magnanimous of mortals  and he struck the earth with his foot the ground trembled and was rent asunder  from the opening thereof there issued a thick smoke and after the smoke there arose a venerable phantom  and the phantom had the visage of eve and it bowed the head and spoke  deceive not thyself with false pride o my daughter let me warn thee not to live and die in a foolish ignorance of delights which thy frame has been fashioned to enjoy  such were the words of the phantom and it waited not for reply but sunk again into the earth  and the face of kunaza was covered with confusion and she was almost ashamed that she was yet a virgin  and pharmarus read her inmost thoughts and exulted  he saw that his illusions began to prevail over her senses and he continued to tempt her still farther  he pressed her trembling hand and he exclaimed thou alone art worthy amongst women to participate in the deep discoveries of my spirit  o bless me with thy beauty kunaza and i will enrich thee with a wondrous power which no mortal but thyself shall possess  i will enable thee to elude the ravage of time and when seven centuries have rolled over thy head to appear still as lovely as thou art in this moment  i will teach thee to make thyself invisible with the rapidity of thought and by passing unseen at thy pleasure to penetrate every secret thou can wish to discover  thus spoke the insidious pharmarus and the curiosity of the maiden was inflamed  there were many things that she panted to know and in her heart she coveted supernatural power  and pharmarus saw that his temptation had entered into her soul and he exulted in the success of his devices  he continued to solicit the maiden and her bosom was convulsed with a doubtful conflict  her cheek became red as the crimson rose but she threw back her head upon her shoulder to avoid the flaming eyes of pharmarus  and as the pine bends beneath the passing wind so was the reason of kunaza bowed down by the sudden gust of desire  she trembled in the struggle of passions but her virtuous spirit arose with new vigor as the tree arises from a transient pressure and points directly to the heaven by whose influence it prospers  and the soul of the maiden now communed with itself and said  o kunaza suppress the evil ambition that subtlety is kindling in thy bosom  pharmarus may enable thee indeed to elude every mortal eye but from the sight of god and his angels there is none who can teach thee to escape  then wish not to purchase supernatural power by the sacrifice of a greater good by losing the inestimable peace of an innocent spirit  and while her soul was thus communing with itself every evil desire departed from the purified heart of the virgin  she turned her face to pharmarus she looked on him with a look of disdain and said  away from me thou unworthy spirit the soul of kunaza is empowered to abhor and deride thy insidious machinations  thou seek to rob me of a treasure which if i should weakly suffer thee to take all the potent spells of thy magic can never restore it to the repentant mourner again  and the frenzy of rage and disappointment began to swell in the soul of pharmarus  he cast a furious glance upon the virgin and said  by the powers of darkness thou art as subtle as the serpent himself had thy parent eve been possessed of thy cunning she had made the prince of tempters a fool  but i swear by the flames that burn within me thou shall not escape from my embrace i will make thee the proud mother of a young giant  and he grasped the virgin with the vehement grasp of outrageous desire and she shrieked aloud in the agonies of terror  and at the sound of her shriek the angel gabriel alighted upon the earth pharmarus saw him and was abashed for a moment  then all his evil passions rekindled with double fury and he prepared to contend with gabriel for the possession of kunaza  but his powers of resistance were withered by the glance of rebuke that flashed from the radiant visage of the protecting spirit  and gabriel seized him with the arm of justice and power and exclaimed with mild dignity to the maiden  o kunaza thou have fought a good fight and all the faithful spirits of heaven are thy friends  know that the seraph uriel and i are sent from the throne of god to punish the false and licentious angels who have debased their nature with the impurities of the earth  and in honor of thy virtue it is ordained by thy maker kunaza that thy enemy pharmarus shall fall the first victim to the just vengeance of heaven  open earth and imprison in thy caverns the treacherous guardian who has attempted to violate the purest of thy daughters  the earth opened to her center at the command of the avenging angel and there with a chain of penal fire   it is with great concern i inform my reader that this invaluable fragment does not extend beyond the preceding imperfect sentence i am persuaded that every person of feeling every true friend to virginity must lament that we are not made fully acquainted with the final destiny of the interesting kunaza we may however safely affirm that after she had resisted so successfully all the base machinations and power of the prince of magic she could never fall by the strength or artifice of man i trust therefore that her name and character will now obtain the honor they deserve from all the nations of the modern world and that the sisterhood in particular will never fail to revere her as the original president of old maids  chap ii conjectures concerning old maids among the jews egyptians and some other nations of antiquity in the first centuries after the deluge it seems to have been the wish of every individual to assist in the great business of repeopling the desolated world at a time when a numerous progeny was considered as real opulence and a peculiar mark of the divine favor it is not probable that any female should have willingly precluded herself from the most envied distinction indeed the hebrew women appear to have been actuated by the most lively desire of increasing the number of their respective families children were regarded as such a treasure that several wives of the patriarchs whom nature had disappointed in this expectation very cheerfully corrected the unkindness of their own constitution by presenting a handmaid to their husbands among all the mosaic institutions there is no trace of any order of men or women devoted to a single life and though some of the fathers who have studied in their writings to raise the honor of monastic virginity have affected to derive it from miriam the sister of moses by asserting that she died a virgin at the age of an hundred and thirtythree years it is said with more probability that this musical sister of the jewish legislator was herself married to hur a man of eminence in the tribe of judah st jerome whose zeal for chastity has sometimes transported him beyond the limits of sober reason expresses an inclination to believe that several women before the christian era received the gift of prophecy from god as a reward for their living a life of virginity  but it is remarkable that the celebrated hebrew prophetesses were married women deborah was the wife of lapidoth and huldah whose prophecy is recorded in the   d chapter of the second book of kings is not only mentioned as the wife of shallum but is said to have dwelt in the college of jerusalem a sufficient proof that virginity was not required in those females who made a part of that hallowed institution the heroine as well as the prophetess might contribute to the glory of her nation without any claim to this chaste perfection jael who is celebrated in a song of triumph for the slaughter of sisera was the wife of heber the kenite and the more noble judith immortalised for delivering her country by the destruction of holofernes was at the time of her exploit a young widow throughout the history of the jews from their father abraham to their utter dispersion i cannot recollect the existence of any one distinguished old maid nor is it probable that many ancient virgins were ever to be discovered in a nation where every man was at liberty to marry as many wives as he thought himself able to support and where the wisest of their princes was so weak as to encumber himself with a domestic establishment of many hundred concubines  as the egyptians were distinguished by a melancholy cast of temper and a passion for gloomy retirement we might be led to imagine that the women of that country were the first who devoted themselves to the mortifications of religious celibacy but there is a remarkable assertion in herodotus which seems to preclude us from such a conjecture in speaking of egypt he expressly says  herodotus p   0 edit wessel no woman is ever consecrated to any divinity male or female the holy office belonging solely to men yet the same great historian informs us that women acted a principal part in the hallowed mysteries of this artful people not indeed as we may fairly conjecture for the purposes of chastity as he says that in the temple of the egyptian jupiter at thebes as in that of belus at babylon a virgin was secluded for the god and supposed to sleep with the divinity himself in a magnificent bed prepared for that purpose in the highest apartment of the building from this ceremony and from other circumstances we may conclude that egypt was not very fertile in the production of old maids parents of the poorer sort sold their female children to procure subsistence for themselves and we cannot reasonably suppose that many ancient virgins existed in such a country where two of its sovereigns according to the historian i have quoted prostituted their own daughters in the most public manner the first to supply his exhausted treasury and the second to detect a very artful thief see the amusing story of rhampsinitus and his daughter in the second book of herodotus   if we must not expect to find an old maid in egypt we have still less chance of meeting with this rarity among the babylonians this ingenious people had devised a very happy expedient which is highly approved by herodotus to prevent their womens being exposed to the mortifications of a single life by the want of personal attractions it was their annual custom to produce all their virgins who had attained the marriageable age in a kind of public auction the most beautiful were sold for considerable sums and this purchase money was distributed in such a manner among the homely damsels as to procure for each of them a husband such a civil institution is in itself almost sufficient to have prevented the existence of an old maid among them but their religious ceremonies if we may give them credit had still a greater tendency to produce this effect as every woman was required once in her life to admit the embraces of a stranger in or near the temple of their goddess mylitta  in phoenicia where venus and adonis were particularly worshipped the commerce between the sexes was still more licentious we may indeed observe that among several nations of antiquity the sacrifice of female chastity was considered as a religious duty persons of the highest rank among the armenians as we are told by strabo devoted their virgin daughters to the goddess anaitis it was their custom that these young women should be prostituted for a considerable time in the service of their divinity and settled afterward in marriage no man refusing a matrimonial connection with such hallowed females  strabo lib xi   the pagan mythology was calculated to promote the most corrupt state of manners and in some of the voluptuous nations of antiquity the virtue of continence seems to have been utterly unknown in lydia says herodotus every girl plays the harlot  yet in the luxurious region of asia some religious institutions were established for the protection of chastity the famous temple of diana at ephesus had a train of holy virgins and for their perfect security the priests to whose guardianship they were entrusted were all eunuchs yet we cannot venture to affirm that this sanctuary produced a number of old maids for it is probable that these young votaries of diana like the vestals of rome whose history i shall consider hereafter had the privilege of marrying toward the middle season of life this we may also conjecture to have been the case with the religious virgins in persia who seem to have been guarded with peculiar sanctity from an anecdote related by justin  darius the son of artaxerxes not satisfied with those imperial honors to which his father had raised him demanded of that monarch his favorite mistress aspasia the aged sovereign unwilling to grant and afraid perhaps to refuse the passionate request of his son was reduced to a mortifying expedient for securing the lady from so dangerous a rival he made her for that purpose a priestess of the sun justin  plutarch relates this incident with some variations but in a manner which equally shows that chastity among the persians was very strictly guarded in a religious asylum yet virginity as the story sufficiently proves was not a necessary qualification for the character of a priestess  among all the kingdoms of antiquity none perhaps contributed less than persia to the sisterhood of old maids as the persians are distinguished by a peculiar ceremony which strongly proves that both sexes considered celibacy as an object of abhorrence not only as an enemy to human enjoyment but as precluding them from the happiness they expected in a future life from this idea arose their extraordinary custom of marrying the dead which consisted of hiring either a husband or a wife for every person who happened to die single at an early period of life this strange kind of marriage is said to have been generally solemnised in such cases soon after the burial of the deceased being regarded as a necessary passport to the regions of bliss  in scythia perhaps some good old maids may have existed whose single life was the consequence of their possessing a delicate frame or a tender heart for we are told by historians that no female in that martial country was permitted to marry till she had slain with her own hand an enemy in battle  among the warlike amazons a very different cause might produce the same effect as these formidable ladies made it a point of national honor to support their empire with the least possible assistance from the other sex we may reasonably suppose that she was considered as the truest amazonian patriot who united virginity with valor i must indeed confess that the amorous adventures of some amazonian queens are not very favorable to this hypothesis but if quintus curtius informs us that thalestris requested an embrace from alexander and discovered more acrior ad venerem foeminae cupido quam regis  quint curt lib vi cap   eagerness for amorous pleasure than the young and voluptuous hero himself let us remember the more chaste deportment of her predecessor on the amazonian throne the celebrated penthesilea who lived and died a virgin in the licentious court and army of priam during the siege of troy she was slain as quintus calaber relates by the inflexible achilles who wished however as the poet says that he had married his lovely antagonist instead of killing her  quintus calaber lib i ver   0  from the example of this virtuous heroine i am persuaded that if a considerable number of old maids existed among any of those ancient people whom the greeks regarded as barbarians it must have been in the nation of amazons i am aware that in the profound researches of mr bryant the very existence of this nation is disputed but as the champion of the sisterhood in all ages i cannot assent to this opinion of a most learned writer nor permit the daring antiquarian to annihilate so illustrious a community and thus as it were to deflower in a moment at least a million of ancient virgins  while i contend for the existence and the chastity of these female warriors who are described in the most lively and circumstantial manner by the poets and historians of antiquity i must not forget their rivals both in courage and continence the gorgons these also were a nation of women according to diodorus siculus who informs us that bordering on the amazons in libya and looking with envy on their neighbors they frequently infested their country till the more powerful amazons armed in the immense skins of african serpents and led to battle by their queen merina subdued the gorgons in a severe engagement in which they took three thousand prisoners diodorus siculus lib iii cap     i must own that many contradictory opinions have been held concerning these more doubtful heroines the gorgons some critics have considered them as lovely young women whose beauty was so powerful as to fix every beholder in motionless amazement others have supposed them to have been frightful old hags whose deformity was so hideous that no one could look at them without shuddering and some late writers with a skeptical refinement have denied their human existence and believed them to have been those celebrated mares of africa who were said to conceive by the south wind but to support the ancient dignity of the sisterhood i shall adhere to the evidence of that very respectable old grecian palaephatus who wrote a treatise expressly to explain the poetical riddles of his country in which he explicitly declares that the three princely gorgon sisters stheno euryale and medusa were three voluntary old maids   palaephatus chap iii on the old maids of greece in those ages which are honored with the name of heroic virgins seem to have been treated with very little respect every hero appears to have thought himself entitled to the caresses of the maiden captives whom his own prowess or the chance of war had placed within his power and the venerable nestor at the age of fourscore and five does not retire to sleep without that agreeable reward of ancient heroism a fair and affectionate damsel the warm and enthusiastic admiration with which critics of the most liberal spirit have contemplated the genius of homer has led some of them to assert that his poems are so wonderfully comprehensive as to include every character which human life can exhibit but this praise may be considered as hyperbolical since it is certain that we cannot discover either in the iliad or the odyssey a portrait or even a sketch of a single old maid perhaps as this immortal bard is so minutely faithful in his delineation of manners and customs we might infer that no such character existed in his time and indeed the more we reflect on the religious and political institutions of greece the more reason shall we find to believe that the number of grecian old maids must have been at all periods very inconsiderable  it was the ruling passion of the greeks to aggrandize their country and as they justly considered citizens as the real wealth of every state they thought it the first of patriotic duties equally incumbent on both the sexes to enrich the republic by increasing its numbers plato carries this point so far as to say that all persons in the article of marriage ought to consult the service of the public in preference to their own private enjoyment  plato de legibus lib vi  the same illustrious philosophic statesman proposes a heavy tax upon those who continued single beyond the age of thirtythree such a tax is said to have existed at sparta where every public institution had a peculiar tendency to encourage population their public dances says plutarch and other exercises of the young maidens naked in sight of the young men were incentives to marriage and to use platos expression drew them almost as necessarily by the attractions of love as a geometrical conclusion follows from the premises to encourage it still more some marks of infamy were set upon those that continued batchelors for they were not permitted to see these exercises of the naked virgins and the magistrates commanded them to march naked round the marketplace in the winter and to sing a song composed against themselves which expressed how justly they were punished for their disobedience to the laws life of lycurgus in langhornes plutarch   athenaeus informs us that their punishment was still more severe and that on a certain festival these unprofitable servants of the state were dragged round an altar and beaten by the women of lacedaemon that their pride might be awakened by this indignity and incline them to become husbands and fathers  athenaeus lib xiii   in a country where such customs prevailed it is not probable that many women should have declined the most important of public duties for the sake of securing to themselves the dishonorable tranquillity of a single life indeed we must do them the justice to observe that the ladies of greece appear to have been in this point the sincerest of patriots it seems to have been their general sentiment that to live and die unmarried was the most humiliating disgrace and affliction that the destinies could inflict  o the guilty bed of those from whom i sprang unhappy offspring of parents most unhappy lo to them i go accursed a virgin and a slave       antigone ver       never shall i taste of hymens joys or know a mothers pleasures in her infant race but friendless and forlorn alive descend into the dreary mansions of the dead      ver      franklins sophocles such is the natural and pathetic lamentation with which the interesting antigone of sophocles prepares for death  this great and judicious poet has given exactly the same sentiment to his more fiery electra who at the time she is mourning for her murdered father and meditating the most tremendous vengeance against her imperious and guilty mother cannot refrain from lamenting that she is herself hopeless of children and of nuptial rites   sophoclis electra ver      so prevalent was this idea in the mind of every grecian female  euripides carries it still farther and assigns similar language to his electra though he represents her as actually married by the tyranny of her parents to an honest labourer who generously abstains from her bed in deference to her rank  from these examples we may conclude that a grecian female hardly ever expressed an inclination to become an old maid and indeed whatever her own private wishes might be the iniquitous laws of her country made her so much the slave of her relations that she had little or no power of fixing her own situation in life nothing says the accomplished sir william jones in speaking of grecian laws that relate to women nothing can be conceived more cruel than the state of vassalage in which women were kept by the polished athenians who might have boasted of their tutelar goddess minerva but had certainly no pretensions on any account to the patronage of venus all unnecessary restraints upon love which contributes so largely to relieve the anxieties of a laborious life and upon marriage which conduces so eminently to the peace and good order of society are odious in the highest degree yet at athens whence arts laws humanity learning and religion are said to have sprung a girl could not be legally united with the object of her affection except by the consent of the  or controller who was either her father or her grandsire her brother or her guardian their domination over her was transferred to the husband by whom she was usually confined to the minute details of domestic economy and from whom she might in some instances be torn for the sake of her fortune by a second cousin whom probably she detested nor was her dependence likely to cease for we may collect from the speech on the estate of philoctemon that even a widow was at the disposal of her nearest kinsman either to be married by him or to be given in marriage according to his inclination or caprice yet more a husband might bequeath his wife like part of his estate to any man whom he chose for his successor and the mother of demosthenes was actually left by will to aphobus with a portion of eighty minas the form of such a bequest is preserved in the first speech against stephanus and runs thus this is the last will of pasio the acharnean i give my wife archippe to phormio with a fortune of one talent in peparrhetus one talent in attica a house worth a hundred minas together with the female slaves the ornaments of gold and whatever else may be in it  for all these hardships which the athenian women endured a very poor compensation was made by the law of solon which ordered their husbands to sleep with them three times a month joness commentary on isaeus page       in a country where women at every period of their life were so miserably dependent as to be disposed of like inanimate property we have reason to apprehend their having suffered every species of cruelty and oppression if greece did not abound in voluntary old maids we may believe that some lovely females of that celebrated region were kept in a wretched state of celibacy by the iniquity of a tyrannical parent or guardian if a superstitious and cowardly old father happened to dream that a grandchild would prove fatal to his peace he probably imitated the absurd precaution of acrisius and attempted to confine his daughter like danae in a subterranean chamber on a bed of brass  pausanias p      since cowardice and superstition are not to be corrected by the instructive history of that beautiful captive and old men are even yet to learn that female chastity is more endangered than protected by a rigorous confinement  however frequent such examples of parental persecution may have been among the greeks we do not find many traces of them in the history of that interesting capricious people there is indeed an amusing anecdote in herodotus which may serve to show that parents used to threaten their children with the dreaded continuance of a virgin life polycrates of samos being angry with his daughter for opposing his visit to the persian noble oraetes because she had been alarmed by a terrific vision threatens the affectionate but teazing girl that if he returns in safety she shall for a long time remain a virgin to which she replies with great filial tenderness by praying that his threat may be accomplished since she would rather remain a virgin  herodotus lib iii some time longer than be utterly deprived of her father  we may however believe that parental tyranny was not so often exercised in attempts to keep a daughter single as in those of marrying her to a person she abhorred perhaps in the latter case there was the greater probability of her becoming an old maid not from the spirit of contradiction but because an unhappy girl so persecuted had no resource to shield her from a detested marriage but the sacred altar of some maidenly power who offered an asylum to virgins in distress  that such places of refuge existed we have a very striking proof in a passage of that singular poem the cassandra of lycophron the prophetess in the midst of her misfortunes breaks forth into the following declaration of her future glory nor among mortals shall my name become extinct and in lethean darkness lost to me the daunian chiefs and those who dwell within the walls of marshy dardanus shall build a temple upon salpes banks there shall the virgins whensoeer they wish to fly the marriage yoke averse to join with suitors vain of their hectorean locks it is worthy of observation that cassandra considers personal vanity in a man as a blemish not inferior to deformity as to hectorean locks the learned are not perfectly agreed on the manner in which the hair of hector was dressed but the ingenious editor of lycophron seems to have fairly proved that the trojan hero set the fashion of wearing a toupee  or marked with some defect of form or birth there shall they fold my image in their arms their firmest guard from nuptial tyranny            lycophron ver         i think it proper to add that cassandra in promising this asylum to persecuted virgins mentions a circumstance which might lessen perhaps the influence of her protection she declares that her chaste votaries must disfigure their faces with a medical lotion and dress themselves in the habit of the furies whether after annexing this condition to her patronage she was likely or not to have many virgins in her sanctuary is a point that i submit to the judgment of the ladies observing however that none of my fair readers are proper judges of the question except those who have been persecuted by the addresses of a very odious suitor  from the preceding part of this chapter some readers of a skeptical cast may be inclined to doubt if greece ever produced an old maid but if the testimony of a poet may be admitted the question is explicitly decided that the character really existed at athens we are expressly informed by aristophanes in a verse which i have adopted as a motto to this essay and which for the sake of my curious fair readers i shall now translate endeavoring at the same time to collect as much light as i can from its comic author concerning the real condition of attic old maids  in the comedy which bears the name of lysistrata that lady conceives the lively project of instructing her own sex to obtain an absolute dominion over the men and to force them into a conclusion of those wars by which greece was perpetually distracted as she proposes her pacific expedient with more wit than modesty my fair readers will undoubtedly approve my delicacy in not giving them a minute account of it and the more so as it is sufficient for our present purpose to observe that lysistrata after touching on the vexations that war produces to married women proceeds to the following sentiment of disinterested compassion but let us wave our grievances  i grieve for virgins in their chambers waxing old        it is very remarkable that although lysistrata thus mentions the old maids as objects of her solicitude the poet does not venture to introduce upon the stage a single ancient virgin either in this play or in a drama where he had i think a still fairer occasion to display the character with all his licentious vivacity i mean his comedy of the female orators ekklsiaoysli  a very short account of this witty but indecent composition will be sufficient to show that an old maid might have appeared among the persons of the drama with a very comic effect aristophanes undoubtedly intended in this comedy to ridicule the political whimsies of plato who contends in his republic that property and women should be possessed in common the poet exhibits with infinite humor the ludicrous evils arising from such a system the women of athens usurp the government and praxagora the heroine of the comedy adopting the ideas of plato establishes a new set of laws i shall speak only of that which relates to my subject by one of her statutes it is enacted that no young man shall receive the favors of a young woman till he has first gratified the inclinations of an old one the modern reader might expect the poet to introduce after this incident even a chorus of old maids but licentious as he was aristophanes had more respect for the sisterhood it is true indeed that he brings some ancient ladies on the stage and represents them not a little solicitous to take advantage of a law so express in their favor but they are very far from appearing in the character of old maids as one of them gives us clearly to understand that she has no claim to that title  i would by no means insinuate that the remarkable conduct of aristophanes in not exhibiting an old maid might tempt us to suspect that no such character existed in his time the only inference i would draw from it is this that the old maids of athens were either entirely sequestered from society or guarded with such a religious veneration as the most licentious of comic poets presumed not to violate that such personages really existed i not only think the speech of lysistrata a sufficient proof but i apprehend their condition as she intimates was owing to the frequency of war among the grecian republics  how far the women of this martial country considered themselves as neglected and aggrieved by that contentious spirit which detained their warriors in distant fields of battle we have a memorable example in the following very singular anecdote recorded by strabo  to revenge the death of their king teleclus who was slain as he went to sacrifice at messena the lacedaemonians engaged in a war against the messenians and took an oath either that they would not return home till they had taken messena or that they would all die in the attempt  in marching forth to this enterprise they left only their very young and very old citizens to guard their own city after the tenth year of the war the women of lacedaemon assembled and sent a deputation of their own sex to the army to reprove the men as not engaging on equal terms with the messenians since these remaining in their own country were still producing children while they who had left their women desolate were encamped in a state of hostility at the risk of letting their own country decay by a deficiency of men the lacedaemonians still respecting their oath and considering at the same time the argument of the women detached from the army the youngest and most vigorous of their countrymen who did not violate an engagement by their return since while they were yet boys they had marched from home with the band of young men this detachment was directed to connect themselves with the virgins at lacedaemon all with all for the greater chance of increasing population  strabo lib vi i have literally followed strabo in this singular history but as it is related also by justin with some variations i shall insert his account of it in this note for the satisfaction of the curious reader  his igitur moribus ita brevi civitas  lacedaemon convaluit ut cum messeniis propter stupratas virgins suas in solenni messeniorum sacrificio bellum intulissent gravissima se exsecratione obstrinxerint non prius quam messenam expugnassent reversuros tantum sibi vel de viribus suis vel de fortuna spondentes quae res initium dissentionis graeciae et intestini belli causa et origo fuit itaque cum contra paesumptionem suam annis december in obsidione urbis tenerentur et querelis uxorum post tam longam viduitatem revocarentur veriti ne hac perseverantia belli gravius sibi quam messeniis nocerent  quippe illis quantum juventutis bello intercidat mulierum foecunditate suppleri sibi et belli damna assidua et foecunditatem uxorum absentibus viris nullam esse  itaque legunt juvenes ex eo genere militum qui post jusjurandum in supplementum venerart quibus spartam remissis promiscuos omnium feminarum concubitus permisere maturiorem futuram conceptionem rati si eam singulae per plures viros experirentur ex his nati ob notam materni pudoris partheniae vocati justin lib iii c    to those who were born from this connection they gave the title of partheneiai the offspring of virgins  in a state where the women could present so tender so patriotic and so successful a remonstrance to their absent heroes we cannot i think reasonably suppose that the number of old maids was very considerable perhaps in this point as in all others of delicacy and refinement sparta was confessedly inferior to athens as the latter was more eminently distinguished by the patronage of the virgin goddess minerva we may justly believe her to have furnished to her guardian deity the more numerous train of ancient and immaculate votaries  the mythological descriptions of the grecian poets are generally founded on some historical fact and the poem of nonnus contains a very remarkable passage which almost persuades me that the women of greece at some early and obscure period of their history were so vehemently devoted to the arts of minerva that they neglected or renounced the more interesting rites of venus and almost endangered the continuance of the world as the passage to which i allude has the advantage of exhibiting venus in a new point of view it may amuse the reader to see it at full length the poet having informed us that his hero bacchus gave a banquet to his attendants proceeds thus  etc nonni dionys lib    to this gay audience as the goblet passed leucus the selftaught lesbian framed the song of titans armed against heaven joyous he sung the triumph of highjudging jove and how in the dark caves of tartarus he pent old saturn stealing his avenging fire and vainly cased in winters watery helm but mild lapethus earths pacific son sat near the skilful bard and from the feast gave him the choicest dainty then required the sweet and favorite song that well describes the cyprian goddess at the loom employed and vying with the blueeyed queen of arts he with sweet prelude sung how venus touched with passion for the works of manual skill held in unpracticed hands minervas web and the light cestus of the loves exchanged for the laborious shuttle coarse the thread the paphian goddess spun  scarce of less size than the gross cordage which of willow framed with some rude art the old mechanic used to splice the timber of his newbuilt bark she through the day and through the night intent hung over the loom of pallas and rejoiced in the new labor foreign to her hand frequent she smoothed the vest and having poised the dangling weights her growing web she plied solicitous to play minervas part nor trifling was her toil but in her work the massive thread projected of itself the woof of her enormous texture broke and of her double labor now she made the sun a witness and the conscious moon part of her sportive train around her danced amusive with a gay and rapid hand pasiphae turned the wheel while pithos care smoothed the rough wool and sweet aglaias zeal gave to their common queen the ready thread now mortal life declined and harmony once the glad harbinger of bridal joy mourned the neglect of marriage  hopeless love loosed from his bow his ineffectual string viewing the barren unploughd field of life no dulcet flute then sounded no shrill pipe ushered with festive glee the nuptial god but earthly being wasted and the chain of wedlock that sustains the world dissolved minerva now her busy rival saw in anger mixed with tenderness she viewed the thick rough threads of the unskilful fair now she informed the gods and spoke in scorn accusing venus and her father jove  thy ordinance is changed celestial sire nor can i keep what all the fates conspired to make my portion tempted by my loom thy daughter venus now invades my right it is not the sister and the wife of jove it is not our sovereign juno that usurps minervas province no this wrong is done to the immortal patroness of arms by the soft queen of dalliance for thy heaven when did the unwarlike cytherea fight where are the titans by her cestus slain that she insults thy warrior  dian say when in the center of thy sacred grove have thou beheld minerva lead the chase or who in childbirth calls the blueeyed queen she spoke and the inhabitants of heaven assembled eager for the wondrous sight of venus at the loom  soon as they saw the produce of her hand unused to toil scornful they rolled the spurious work aside and with a smile sarcastic hermes said thine is the distaff to minerva leave thy useless cestus  since thy arm has strength nimbly to dart the flying shuttle take the spear and aegis of the martial maid i know why venus plies the applauded loom thy wiles escape not me  thy bridegroom mars quick from thy hand with amorous haste requires a vest of nuptial elegance  for mars form the rich robe but in thy recent work weave not the lance for what are arms to thee no let thy variegated tints display the lightdispersing god whose beams revealed thy latent paramour or if thou will frame thy old chains and let thy modest hand paint in thy glowing web thy spurious lord and thou too love a distaff for thy arms for thy laborious mother twist the yarn that i may see the lightwingd boy at work his bow a spindle and his dart a thread with golden venus broider mars in gold and let him bear a shuttle for his shield weaving himself with beautys busy queen but rather venus from thy lovely hand toss to the wind thy threads  thy cestus take and over the enjoyments of the earth again preside for nature suffers and the world wanders forlorn while thou art at the loom thus as he spoke the olympian synod smiled and casting far aside the unfinished web in reverence to pallas beautys queen kind cherisher of mans increase retired to her own cyprus  from her cestus love bestowed new charms on natures varying form and richly sowed the wellploughd waste of life such was the carol of the lesbian bard on cytherea in the loom unskilled vying with pallas patroness of arts   i rejoice in being able to enliven and illustrate this philosophical essay by so apposite a passage from the very poet however obscure from whom mr bryant has struck so much light in his profounder researches i have given almost a literal translation of the preceding song and i flatter myself that my candid readers who are familiar with the decisive style of our antiquarians will allow me to consider it as a striking proof that a confederacy of very beautiful ancient spinsters was once formed in greece who resolutely devoted themselves to the quiet labor of the loom instead of assisting in the more important business of forming new citizens to support their country evident as this point must appear from these remarkable verses it might puzzle perhaps even the very learned gentleman just mentioned to decide at what period of the grecian history these spinsters lived and how long they persisted in their dangerous resolution from the conclusion of the song i am inclined to believe that they resembled a certain society of modern ladies under the guidance of a seraphic president entitled madonella a lady whose adventures are related with infinite humor in the first volume of the tatler and who having devoted herself and her associates to a life of virgin purity and retirement was rapidly and ingeniously induced to take an active part in the necessary increase of the world  my desire to do all possible honor to the sisterhood has made me extremely solicitous to discover every attic old maid whose name might reflect a luster on the community but in my historical enquiries for this purpose i have not been so successful as i expected to be many grecian ladies have been celebrated for an attachment to philosophical studies and i concluded that in the list of these i should find several individuals who in chastity as well as learning were the faithful votaries of minerva monsieur menage has compiled with extensive erudition a little history of all the female philosophers of whom any traces can be found in the writings of the ancients their number amounts to sixtyfive but it is very remarkable that if we except st catherine there is only one lady in this long catalogue who is celebrated for her virginity and how far that might be either real or meritorious may still be a question as this lady did not live single but was the wife of the philosopher isidorus  thus disappointed among the ancient female professors of philosophy i reflected with singular pleasure that those more venerable poetical old ladies the sibyls would supply this defect and of all the old maids that antiquity could furnish i considered them as best entitled to the honorable distinction of being classed at the head of the sisterhood i imagined their title to this high rank to be fully confirmed by the sentence of st jerome who speaking of them in the first part of his eloquent invective against jovinian expressly says that virginity was their characteristic and divination the reward of their virginity quid referam sibyllas erithraeam et cumanam et octo reliquas nam varo december fuisse autumat quarum insigne virginitas est et virginitatis praemium divinatio  sanct hieron adversus jov p      but examining the history of these reverend ladies with that attention which it deserves i soon perceived that the fervent and generous saint had given them credit for a quality which they were very far from possessing the learned servatius gallaeus who has obliged the world with a thick quarto volume on these interesting females completely exposes the mistake of st jerome and laughs at him as a ridiculous champion contending for the chastity of a harlot nor can we wonder that the credulity of the candid saint should be treated with derision since one of the sibyls for whose continence he contends very freely acknowledges in a remarkable verse of her own   that she had formerly indulged herself in all the criminal excesses of licentious passion  after all my laborious endeavors to investigate the history of old maids in greece i must close this chapter upon them with the modest ignorance of a grecian philosopher confessing all i know is that i know nothing to the virginity of these ancient and perhaps ideal ladies i may apply the following ingenious simile of a great modern poet like following life in creatures we dissect we lose it in the moment we detect   chap iv on the vestals and other old maids of rome before the christian era as the roman empire was founded on a rape and no less than six hundred and eightythree sabine virgins were forcibly converted into wives according to the account of that accurate antiquarian dionysius of halicarnassus we cannot expect to meet with many old maids in the early periods of the roman history indeed in the first ages of the republic the patriotic ambition of the romans and the express letter of their law operated with equal force against a life of celibacy cicero in the opening of his third book de legibus has given us the very words of the statute by which the censors were directed not only to examine and enroll the children of every roman family but to take care that no citizens should lead a single life equitum peditumque prolem describunto coelibes esse prohibento  and we learn from a valuable fragment preserved in aulus gellius that the most eminent senators of rome considered marriage not as a state of private enjoyment but as a public indispensable burden which every man was bound to support for the good of the community as the subject is curious and interesting i shall present to my reader not only the fragment to which i allude but a considerable passage from the author who has given it a place in his miscellaneous and amusing work  the sixth chapter in the first book of aulus gellius begins in the following manner  the oration which metellus numidicus a man of dignity and eloquence delivered in his censorship to exhort the people to matrimony was read to a large and learned audience in this oration it was thus written if romans we had the power of living without a wife we should all be free from that trouble but since nature has so disposed it that we can neither live very commodiously with them nor without them exist at all we must provide rather for perpetual security than for transient pleasure it appeared to some that the censor metellus whose intention was to exhort the people to marry ought not to have made such a confession concerning the trouble and perpetual vexations of the married life since instead of exhorting he seemed rather to dissuade and deter his oration they said ought rather to have taken a contrary turn he should have asserted that marriage in general was attended with no vexations and if at any time it appeared to produce some these he should have said were light and trifling very easily endured and obliterated by a superior portion of emolument and delight nay that these very vexations were neither common to all nor owing to the nature of the connection but occasioned by the failings and injustice of particular husbands but titus castricius maintained that metellus had spoken both with truth and propriety it is one thing said he to speak as a censor and another to speak as a rhetorician we allow the latter to use expressions fraudulent and bold subtle and captious if they have but a certain air of truth and the power of exciting by any artifice the passions of the audience he observed moreover that it is disgraceful to a rhetorician even in a bad cause to leave any part of his ground deserted and unfought but for metellus he said who spoke to the roman people with that sanctity of character as a man whose life had been distinguished by accumulated honors it became him to utter nothing but what he himself and his whole audience might esteem strictly true and the more so as he spoke upon a subject of which the experience of every day enabled every man to judge confessing therefore those vexations which were notorious to all men and deserving by that confession the confidence of his auditors he at last with ease and rapidity persuaded them of that important and essential point that the preservation of the state depended on the prevalence of marriage  without stopping to make any farther remarks on the eloquence of metellus  from whose honest confession we might infer that the most spirited of the old romans were not perfectly able to manage their wives  i shall only observe that in the first ages of the republic the censors seem to have attended very minutely to this part of their office which had so strong a tendency to prevent the existence of old maids valerius maximus informs us that the censors camillus and posthumous levied a fine on those citizens who had grown old in a single life and brought it to the public treasury plutarch also in his life of camillus relates that as the wars had made many widows he obliged such of the men as lived single partly by persuasion and partly by threatening them with fines to marry those widows  from the latter circumstance we may infer that virgins of a marriageable age were at this period very scarce in rome and indeed we may believe that in the active patriotic days of the republic there would not have existed a single roman old maid had not the singular religious establishment of the vestal virgins formed a kind of nursery for that respectable sisterhood to whom this work is devoted  as i presume that my fair readers have but a slight acquaintance with these most interesting nuns of antiquity although their name surviving that fire for whose eternity they prayed is still applied in poetical language to modern ladies of distinguished purity i shall here insert the curious account of the vestals which is preserved in the abovementioned most excellent antiquarian dionysius and i shall insert it in the words of his accurate and elegant translator mr spelman  the virgins who serve the goddess were originally four and elected by the kings according to the laws established by numa but afterward from the multiplicity of their functions their number was increased to six and has so remained to this day they live in the temple of the goddess into which none are hindered from entering in the daytime but it is not lawful for any man to remain there in the night they are under a necessity of continuing unmarried during the space of thirty years which time they employ in offering sacrifices and performing other rites ordained by the law during the first ten years their duty was to learn their functions in the second ten to perform them and during the remainder of their time to teach others after the expiration of the term of thirty years nothing hindered such as desired it from marrying upon their quitting their veils gellius quotes antistius labeo a man of great learning in the time of augustus for many particulars relating to the vestals among the rest that they could not be admitted under six nor above ten years of age i imagine because it was necessary they should be virgins  the election was performed in the following manner  the pontifex maximus chose twenty virgins who in an assembly of the people drew lots which of them should succeed the deceased vestal and the virgin upon whom the lot fell was taken by the pontifex maximus  spelmans note  and the other ensigns of their priesthood and some though very few have done this the end of whose lives has not been so very happy as to tempt others to imitate them so that the rest looking upon their calamities as ominous remain virgins in the temple of the goddess till their death and then the pontiffs again choose another to supply the vacancy they receive many distinguishing honors from their country by which the desire of children and of marriage is taken away they are also subject to great punishment in case of delinquency which by the law the pontiffs are appointed both to enquire into and punish those vestals who commit lesser crimes they whip with rods but if they suffer themselves to be debauched they are delivered up by the pontiffs to the most shameful and the most miserable death for while they are yet alive they are carried upon a bier with all the formality of a funeral their friends and relations attending them with lamentations being arrived at the gate collina they are placed in a subterraneous cell prepared within the walls in their funeral attire without any sepulchral column funeral rites or other customary solemnities there seem to be many indications of the priestess who does not perform the holy functions with purity but the principal is the extinction of the fire which the romans dread above all misfortunes looking upon it from whatever cause it proceeds as an omen that portends the destruction of their city and they bring fire again into the temple with many expiatory rites  it is also well worth relating in what manner this goddess has manifested herself in favor of those virgins who have been falsely accused  it is said that once the fire being extinguished through some carelessness of aemilia who had then the care of it and had entrusted it to another virgin who was newly chosen into their number and then learning her duty the whole city was in great disorder and an enquiry made by the pontiffs whether some defilement of the priestess might not have occasioned the extinction of the fire upon this they say that aemilia who was innocent but distracted at what had happened stretched out her hands to the altar and in the presence of the priests and the rest of the virgins said o vesta tutelary goddess of this city if during the space of near thirty years i have performed the holy functions to thee with holiness and justice and have preserved a pure mind and a chaste body appear in my defense and assist me and do not suffer your priestess to die the most miserable of all deaths but if i have been guilty of any impiety let my punishment expiate the guilt of the city  having said this she tore off a piece of the linen garment she had on and threw it upon the altar after this prayer they say that from the ashes which had been long cold and retained no spark of fire a great flame shone forth through the linen so that the city did not stand in need either of expiations or of a new fire  but what i am going to relate is still more wonderful and more like a fable  they say that somebody having falsely accused one of the virgins whose name was tucia and being unable to object to her the extinction of the fire he supported his accusation by false inductions drawn from probable conjectures and testimonies and that the virgin being ordered to make her defense said only this  that she would clear herself from the accusation by her actions and having said this and called upon the goddess to be her guide she proceeded to the tiber the pontiffs consenting and all the citizens attending her when she came to the river she was so hardy as to undertake a thing which of all others is looked upon as impossible even to a proverb and having taken water out of the river in an empty sieve and carried it as far as the forum she poured it out at the feet of the pontiffs after which they say her accuser though great enquiry was made after him could never be found either alive or dead spelmans dionysius vol i p       if some of these calumniated vestals were thus marvellously preserved others seem to have been destroyed with the most savage barbarity in spite of favorable occurrences that might have been humanely construed into a supernatural assertion of their innocence in the rhetorical fragments of seneca a fair delinquent is mentioned who being convicted of impurity was brought to suffer death by being thrown from the summit of so high a rock that it was terrific even to those who looked down from it in a state of security erat altitudo montis etiam secure despicientibus horrenda  in the moment preceding her punishment she appealed to vesta in vindication of her purity and being flung from the precipice descended without injury to the ground when a set of inhuman orators maintained that she ought to be brought back and thrown a second time from the rock alleging that her wonderful escape rather indicated the anger than the protection of the gods since it was their design not to save the life of this convicted criminal but to lengthen her punishment seneca does not inform us that she perished in consequence of this cruel argument and indeed i am tempted to hope for the honor of human nature that the whole story was nothing more than the fiction of a fanciful declaimer  however this may be the anecdote affords us a striking proof of the extreme severity with which the romans regarded the frailty of a vestal indeed the same author furnishes us with a proof of this point yet more extraordinary for he gives us part of a criminal oration against a vestal who was accused of incest not for any evident act of incontinence but merely for having written a verse which forcibly expressed her sense of those pleasures which the married fair ones enjoy this curious morsel of heartinspired poetry is happily preserved and i must gratify my female reader with a translation of it though i may injure the spirit of this feeling poetess by converting her single latin verse into the following english couplet happy the nymphs who gain the nuptial bed o let me die if it is not sweet to wed felices nuptae moriar nisi nubere dulce est    we find in the austere rhetorician the most bitter invective against these natural sentiments of a tender female how expressive cries the declaimer is her language how apparently flowing from the inmost soul not only of an experienced but of an enraptured woman  she is guilty of incest though not actually violated who wishes for violation quam expressa vox quam ex imis visceribus emissa non expertae tantum sed delectatae incesta est etiam fine stupro quae cupit stuprum   let me add however in justice to seneca that he gives us also the opposite side of the question we confess replies the defender of this poetical virgin we confess to you she is guilty of one crime she is possessed of genius how then could she fail to envy cornelia the mother of the gracchi or that happy parent who gave birth to cato unum crimen vobis confiteor ingenium habet quidni invideat corneliae matri gracchorum quidni illi quae catonem peperit   we are not told what was the fate of this ingenious vestal and she also like her sister who is mentioned in the preceding anecdote of the rock might be a mere creature of fancy and her offense invented for the exercise of declamation  if our humanity is gratified by this supposition yet other ancient writers afford us a melancholy assurance that several unhappy vestals actually suffered the savage fate of being buried alive for my own part when i read of such events i feel that all the splendour of roman glory is entirely eclipsed by these infernal acts of barbarous superstition let me remark however for the credit of the republic that this punishment was introduced by the elder tarquin it was first inflicted in his reign upon a hapless victim whose name was pinaria i shall not enumerate all the unfortunate females who shared this inhuman destiny but content myself with observing that according to the calculation of the abbe nadal who has given a copious history of the vestals in the memoirs of the french academy from the establishment of these virgins under numa to their suppression in the reign of theodosius a period of about a thousand years we cannot assign more to each century than a single victim as to the number of honest and unsuspected old maids which this religious society might produce in the same space of time this is a point requiring so much nice calculation that i shall leave it to be settled by our own indefatigable antiquarians  we may fairly suppose that in spite of those unpromising omens by which many of the elder vestals were deterred from wedlock according to the abovementioned account of dionysius some of these superannuated priestesses were eager to assert their privilege and ventured to marry indeed we have a singular proof that this sometimes happened in a few remarkable verses of the christian poet prudentius who has exhibited a picture of the vestals which is certainly painted with more zeal than politeness as the passage is curious and has not been fully quoted by the modern historian of these interesting ladies i shall endeavor to amuse my fair readers by a poetical translation of it  now let me search into the vestals fame to modestys bright crown what seals her claim the little slaves in childhood are immured before the judgment of the mind maturd can grow of virgin fame devoutly fond and spurn the weight of the connubial bond on joyless altars which her heart must hate the captive virgin is condemned to wait not scorning pleasure but from bliss confined untouched her body not untouched her mind restless the bed on which unlovd she lies and for the loss of bridal rapture sighs hope fans this fire for her the torch may flare and nuptial fillets bind her hoary hair since when through stated years her vows are paid vesta rejects the antiquated maid while fit for nuptial joys no nuptial kiss enriched her bosom with a mothers bliss a veteran vestal now her priesthood ends she quits the altar on which youth attends to hymens rites a wrinkled bride she is led and learns to wanton in an icy bed quae nunc vestalis sit virginitatis honestas discutiam qua lege regat decus omne pudoris ac primum parvae teneris capiuntur in annis ante voluntatis propriae

nupta tepescere lecto prudentius in symmachum ver      though the picture which this pious poet has given us may be considered as a piece of coarse painting it was undoubtedly drawn from the life in one point i fear he judged but too well i mean in the general unhappiness which he attributes to the younger vestals from the time and mode of their introduction into this religious servitude we cannot suppose that they felt themselves very easy under it when they grew old enough to acquire a knowledge of social life and to experience the full force of all the natural passions the romans seem to have been sensible of the many mortifications which must have attended the life of these lovely captives and they endeavored to compensate the evils of their condition by frequently increasing the various honors that were paid to every individual of this holy order even the coldblooded augustus bestowed upon them some marks of his favor and as the historian dion cassius asserts admitted these sequestered virgins to the enjoyment of all those civic rights which the policy of rome had confined to mothers among the many privileges that belonged to the vestal there was one that must have been peculiarly delightful to a feeling heart i mean the privilege of saving the condemned the romans attached such an idea of sanctity to the person of a vestal that if a criminal in his way to execution was fortunate enough to meet one of these virgins the bare sight of so pure a personage was sufficient to expiate his offenses and the happy incident immediately restored him to life and liberty on these occasions however it was necessary for the priestess to affirm that such meeting was the mere effect of chance yet in the most turbulent and sanguinary days of the republic the lives of some political delinquents have been saved by the supplication of the vestals the vindictive sylla himself is said to have granted the life of caesar to the intercession of these compassionate virgins highly provoked as he was by the resistance of that spirited and ambitious youth perhaps the extreme eagerness which caesar afterward showed to obtain the office of supreme pontiff was partly owing to his generous desire of displaying his gratitude to these holy virgins to whose tenderness he was indebted for his life for it was the duty of the supreme pontiff to superintend this female society to retire into a place of privacy with every young vestal who had committed any trivial offense and having stripped the fair delinquent to scourge her in proportion to her demerit it was perhaps in this high office that the celebrated humanity of this merciful tyrant was most uniformly exerted and however the roman empire might justly murmur at his usurped authority when we consider the characteristics of this great man we may reasonably conclude that no tender vestal ever thought herself much aggrieved by falling under the rod of caesar it had indeed been happy for this tender sisterhood if the succeeding emperors had superintended them with that gentle spirit which on such occasions displayed itself in this the most liberal and most accomplished of tyrants but among the many monsters who succeeded this extraordinary usurper in the government of the roman world there were some who appear to have delighted in the horrible enormity of burying even an innocent vestal alive the younger pliny has related a transaction of this kind in which the spirit of the lovely victim appears in so interesting a light that i shall insert the story in the words of mr melmoth that amiable translator whose delicacy of sentiment and elegance of language have placed him on a level with his engaging original  domitians vengeance generally raged with the greatest fury where his evidence failed him most that emperor had determined that cornelia maximilla one of the vestal virgins should be buried alive from an extravagant notion that those kind of exemplary severities did honor to his reign accordingly in the character of high priest or rather indeed in that of a lawless and cruel tyrant he convened the sacred college not in the pontifical court where they usually assemble but at his villa near alba and there by a sentence no less wicked as it was passed when she was not present to defend herself than as it was the effect of passion and revenge he condemned her of having violated her vestal vow yet he himself had been guilty not only of debauching his brothers daughter but was also accessory to her death for that lady being a widow in order to conceal her shame endeavored to procure an abortion and by that means lost her life however the priests were directed to see the sentence immediately performed upon cornelia as they were leading her to the place of execution she called upon vesta and the rest of the gods to attest her virtue and amongst other exclamations frequently cried out is it possible that caesar can think me polluted under the influence of whose sacred functions he has conquered and triumphed whether she said this in flattery or derision whether it proceeded from a consciousness of her innocence or contempt of the emperor is not certain it was usual with domitian to triumph not only without a victory but even after a defeat  but she continued exclaiming in this manner till she came to the place of execution to which she was led at least like a criminal though perhaps not really one as she was going down into the subterraneous cavern her gown hung upon something in the way upon which turning back to disengage it the executioner offered her his hand which she refused with some horror as if she could not touch it without impurity thus she preserved the appearance of a consummate chastity to the concluding scene of her life and her last care was decently to fall euripides in his tragedy of hecuba  celer likewise a roman knight who was accused of being her gallant during the whole time his sentence was executing upon him in the square near the senate house persisted in saying what crime have i been guilty of i have been guilty of none melmoths pliny the eleventh letter of the fourth book  if the personal security of these unhappy virgins was thus wantonly invaded by the barbarity of the pagan emperors the chaste reputation of the sisterhood has been treated with equal cruelty and injustice by the outrageous zeal of some christian authors we have already seen with what indelicate contempt the pious poet prudentius has spoken of vestal purity saint ambrose in his treatise on virgins proceeds still farther against it having asserted that virginity was only affected among the gentiles the good saint exclaims who will urge against me the virgins of vesta or the priestesses of pallas what kind of purity is that which depends not upon morals but upon age which instead of being perpetual has a stated period prescribed  there is greater wantonness in that virtue whose fall is assigned to the latter season of life they who allow a final period to virginity teach their own virgins that they are released from the duty and destitute of the power of perseverance but what kind of a religion is that in which young maidens are commanded to be chaste and old women wanton quis mihi praetendit vestae virgins et palladis sacerdotes qualis ista est non morum pudicitia sed annorum quae non perpetuitate sed aetate praescribitur petulantior est talis integritas cujus corruptela seniori servatur aetati ipsi docent virgins suas non debere perseverare nec posse qui virginitati sinem dederunt qualis autem est illa religio ubi pudicae adolescentes jubentur esse impudicae anus  divi ambrosii de virginibus lib i   my concern for the credit of many an honest though unknown vestal old maid obliges me to observe that the holy ambrose has given a very unfair and a very ungenerous representation of this chaste community but severe as he is toward them his severity may be considered as moderation when compared with the merciless treatment they have received from his brother saint the vehement saint jerome that eloquent and impetuous father of the catholic church seems to lay his daring axe to the very roots not only of pagan but of all heretical virginity expressly saying that the virgins such as are called so among diverse heretics and particularly the manichaean are to be considered as harlots and not as virgins caeterum virgins quales apud diversas haereses et quales apud impurissimum manichaeum esse dicuntur scorta sunt existimandae non virgins  sanct hieron epist ad eustochium de custodia virginitatis   let me add however as an instance of candor in this zealous saint that although he appears so bitter an enemy to all unorthodox virgins in the preceding passage from his letter to eustochium the daughter of his friend paula on the preservation of virginity  yet in his invective against jovinian who had questioned the extraordinary merit of the most perfect chastity he launches forth into a spirited panegyric on the virgins of the heathen world allowing that title not only to the sibyls but to cassandra herself though this unfortunate heroine had been very grossly injured both by a divinity and a mortal being deluded by apollo and ravished by ajax  i shall not stop to comment on this inconsistency in the rapid and energetic st jerome as i intend in the subsequent part of my work to speak more at large not only of this celebrated advocate for a single life but of many other saints whose pious labors have been particularly directed to that most attractive subject virginity  it is not surprising that some of these holy writers should in the heat of their zeal make very free with the reputation both of the young and old maids among the pagans we may forgive the excesses of mistaken piety but when a critic of modern times  when an author writing in a country that piques itself on delicacy and politeness  when a frenchman in the courteous age of lewis the fourteenth rashly attempts to dishonor all the virgins of the heathen world i esteem it my duty as the voluntary champion of the insulted sisterhood to expose and chastise this very arrogant and licentious delinquent the person who has been guilty of this high misdemeanor is monsieur morin who in the year      produced in the french academy of belles lettres a composition entitled a critical history of celibacy in the close of it this presumptuous author not only traduces the poor mortal virgins of antiquity but attempts to dishonor even the virgin goddesses themselves  that the sisterhood may be judges of his offense against them i shall translate some passages of the treatise in which their purity is so grievously insulted i shall begin with the instances he produces of that high esteem for chastity which the heathens professed  virginity passed amongst them for something divine and sacred the greeks called those who professed it  demigods or equal to gods and the latin etymologists derive the word coelebs from coelum  coelebs quasi coelestis  implying that those who live in celibacy are celestial beings they regarded this virtue as a supernatural grace et plusquam foemina virgo virgin a title higher far than wife   they believed that the gods granted it only as a special favor how can we otherwise explain the fervent supplication of daphne when she saw herself on the point of losing her virginity  da mihi perpetua genitor charissime dixit virginitate frui dedit hoc pater ante dianae grant me dear sine a virgin to remain  this dian asked of jove nor asked in vain what are we to understand by the metamorphosis of this maiden into a laurel if not this that chastity was considered by the heathens as a sure passport to immortality of

pure so without end my virgin wealth endure   such is the adjuration of a sibyl in tibullus  it was a universal principle of paganism that the gods were pleased with chastity casta placent superis  their sacrifices were not thought complete without the assistance of a virgin they might indeed begin them without this necessary minister or make the libation  libare but they could not complete the ceremony which was expressed by the latin word litare they were persuaded that this virtue is what advances us nearest to divinity  they said that as god is alone sufficient to himself and finds in his own essence all that is necessary to him for sovereign beatitude so also virgins instead of foolishly seeking their happiness in the possession of other creatures find it without wandering from themselves in their purity in their innocence in their integrity plotinus lib v cap     they all maintained that if the divinity was at any time pleased to communicate itself to human nature this neither could nor ought to be with any other than a virgin decet enim naturam intactam impollutam puram et vere virginem cum deo conversari philo  it is true these are not the expressions of a pagan but of philo the jew which is not less worthy of observation  macrobius says almost the same thing in terms very similar nulli aptius jungitur  incorrupta quam virgini macrobius in somnio scipionis  the incorruptible unity of god cannot unite with any creature more suited to itself than a virgin  let us hear a platonician naumachius  the french authors are very apt to quote the ancients in such a manner as to perplex instead of informing their readers mr morin had only annexed the name naumachius to this singular translation from a greek author whom he calls a platonician i was for some time unable to discover this obscure advocate of virginity but at length have found that he is one of the many poets but little known whose fragments are preserved in the collection of stobaeus the best critics are of opinion says the intelligent fabricius that naumachius was a christian indeed this appears highly probable from the passage in question which i shall here insert with a poetical version of it to do all the justice in my power to this neglected encomiast of old maids          stobaeus p   0 edit   0  it is lovely as a spotless maid to live blessed in that joy which pure ideas give

heavenly terms is taught and the rapt virgin teems with radiant thought  unfold the sentiments of his sect on this system of life  it reflects honor on a maiden to preserve with solicitude the purity of her body and of her soul this condition gives her a great superiority over all persons of her own sex disengaged from the cares of the world she has the eyes of her mind continually fixed upon a spiritual life from whence she derives all the delights of true wedlock in filling her heart with such divine words as enable her to conceive and to produce the most luminous meditations  here indeed we have magnificent language sublime ideas and speculations of singular beauty but unluckily when compared with practice and reality we shall find them empty words and nothing more these fine declaimers were not destitute of light but as they knew god and did not honor him as god we may also say that if they perceived the excellence of virgin purity they succeeded no better in the observation of its laws whoever is disposed to search into the secret history of such persons among them as lived in celibacy and affected the most scrupulous continence may discover if not gross debauchery at least many absurdities and an absolute farce to begin with their goddesses  vesta the most ancient of all was she not represented in her temple with an infant in her arms whence had she taken it  minerva had her erichthonius who was almost continually at her side her adventure with vulcan is well known and enables us to declare that if she could on any ground pretend to the character of a virgin she certainly had no claim to the title of untouched her common appellation she had even some temples consecrated to her honor in the character of a mother  diana had also her gallant virbius or hippolytus and still worse her endymion the only pleasure she took in indulging her eyes with the contemplation of his sleeping form tells us enough and indeed too much for a virgin  the muses in their time passed for very liberal coquettes myrtilus who is quoted by arnobius boldly affirmed that they were the indulgent intimates of a certain megaleon who had a taste for music and poetry he even assigns children to all of them and mentions all their several names  their vestals whose chastity they so highly extolled were only obliged to remain single to the age of thirty when they were restored to all their natural rights they did not fail to exercise these rights before that period and we must not believe that the romans buried alive all the vestals who indulged themselves in that liberty no only those indiscreet virgins who had not learned the secret art of conducting themselves according to that useful maxim si non cast saltem caute  if not with chastity at least with caution memoires de lacademie etc tome quatrieme p  0    such are the unwarrantable liberties which monsieur morin has taken with pagan virginity  in answer to the attack which this petulant frenchman has made on all the old maids of antiquity both mortal and divine i shall only observe that the inference he draws from the pagan sentiments he produces is diametrically opposite to what it ought to be not only according to the rules of delicacy and candor but according to the laws of sound reasoning having shown us very copiously and very fairly that the heathen ladies set the highest value on virginity he ought undoubtedly to have said that although the personal history of some ancient nymphs and goddesses might induce us to believe that incontinence was prevalent in the days of heathenism yet when we consider the forcible and graceful terms in which some of these frail nymphs lament their own weakness we ought certainly to conclude that many honest virgins though their names have not reached us existed in the pagan world and maintained in the midst of its tempting licentiousness a very happy and honorable agreement between their principles and their practice  some of the pagan goddesses should undoubtedly have been excepted from this general censure three in particular whose virginity though it will not i fear reflect much honor on the sisterhood was so unquestionable as to become a kind of proverb i mean the furies whose maiden purity is asserted in a striking fragment of sophocles  sophocles apud suidam   it may perhaps extenuate the offense of monsieur morin against the sisterhood to remark that he was led into this wanton cruelty toward the virgins of paganism by his desire of paying an oblique compliment to those more numerous old maids the roman catholic nuns of whom i shall speak at large in the subsequent part of this work at present i have a few more observations to make on the ladies of ancient rome  these ladies may be said like the heroes of their country to have reached the extremes both of virtue and of vice there are two anecdotes in the roman history which particularly discover the variation of female manners the first is beautifully recorded by livy in a few words which must lose i fear a great part of their graceful energy by the following translation  the patrician matrons had expelled from their religious assembly virginia the daughter of aulus for violating the dignity of their order by her marriage with voluminous the plebeian consul a short altercation arising from female resentment blazed forth in a general contest of indignant spirits when virginia justly boasted that she had entered the temple of patrician modesty in the character of a modest patrician the wife only of one man to whom she was led a virgin and that she could neither repent of that husband nor of his honors and exploits she enhanced by a very noble deed the magnanimity of her speech  she set apart a sufficient space in the house where she resided for a moderate sanctuary she placed in it an altar and having assembled the plebeian matrons and lamented to them the injustice of the patricians this altar she said i dedicate to plebeian modesty and i exhort you that as there exists among the men of this city a rivalship in valor there may be such also in modesty among its matrons let it be your endeavor that this altar may be if possible more sanctified than theirs and acquire the reputation of being attended by chaster votaries to this pleasing picture of spirited modesty we find a striking and melancholy contrast in the conduct of those roman ladies who in the consulship of acilius balbus and porcius cato were so extravagantly licentious that the senate thought proper to consult the sibylline oracle for some method of averting the public evils arising from female depravity they were directed to supplicate the divinity who presided over the tender affections and accordingly built a new temple to venus under the title of verticordia  the corrector of the heart  this extraordinary fact is related by valerius maximus and clearly alluded to in the following verses of ovid  supplicibus verbis illam placate sub illa et forma et mores et bona fama manent roma pudicitia proavorum tempore lapsa est cumaeam veteres consuluistis anum templa jubet veneri fieri quibus ordine factis inde venus verso nomina cord tenet ovid fast lib iv v     propitiate venus  on that heavenly friend your charms your manners and your fame depend in rome of old weak chastity decayed our sires consulted the cumaean maid she cried  to venus a new temple frame hence the kind goddess holds her moral name ovid seems to have been as partial to the fair sex as any individual of the poetical choir yet we cannot say that his poetry taken altogether leads us to think very highly of roman chastity in the celebrated age of augustus if the state of manners could be fairly estimated from the suspicious testimony of a satirical poet we might suppose the condition of this tender virtue still more deplorable in the succeeding reigns and we might absolutely despair of finding a single roman old maid after the days of juvenal this outrageous declaimer in that most gross and virulent libel against the fair sex his sixth satire considers the man as perfectly insane who expects to meet with a chaste woman in rome but such indelicate sarcasms are disgraceful only to their author and i doubt not but many good wives and virgins for such surely existed even in the days of juvenal despised the gross invective of this frantic moralist as much as those of modern times have despised the less indecent sarcasm of pope that every woman is at heart a rake it is very remarkable that the three satirists who have written against the lovely part of the creation with the most acrimonious hostility were three old batchelors at least we have never heard that juvenal had a wife and of boileau and pope we know not only that they were never married but in all probability never flattered by the endearments of any amiable woman i have made this remark because it will naturally lead me to what reflects the highest honor on the sisterhood  a comparison between old batchelors and old maids in an important point which very forcibly expresses the different characters of each community  we find that these three poetical and moral old batchelors in those raging fits of sour spleen which they falsely supposed the enthusiasm of genuine virtue calumniated woman though a gentle being from whom they had received no injury and with whom they could never form a perfect acquaintance now observe the contrast among all the old maids who have written either verse or prose  and their number is infinite  i never heard of one who had vented her illhumour in such bitter and contemptuous invectives against the stronger and more injurious sex no the ancient virgin has that natural tenderness and generosity of heart that whatever her ignorance of man may be whatever ground she may have to complain of his neglect she still considers him to use the words of shakespeare as the paragon of animals the excess of virtue has been known in many male moralists to degenerate into a sullen and preposterous contempt and hatred toward the whole human race but for the honor of the fair sex in general and of my candid friends the old maids in particular i beg it may be for ever remembered that they are perfectly free from that most disgusting and most wretched of all mental infirmities misanthropy  but to return to the main subject of my present chapter the old maids of ancient rome  i cannot indeed exhibit such a list of these ladies as i could wish but the deficiency without doubt arises not from the rarity of the character but from the inexcusable inaccuracy which i have before lamented in the ancient historians and biographers who have failed to commemorate the merits of the sisterhood i am happy however in being able to conclude and to embellish this chapter with the name of one illustrious old maid who may be regarded as a peculiar favorite of minerva since she was not only eminent for her chastity but excelled in one of the most elegant among the arts i mean the celebrated lala who though not a native of rome exercised the profession of painting in that city during the youth of marcus varro he probably gave a full description of this amiable person in one of those   0 volumes which he is said to have written though the works of this most learned roman have unfortunately perished the name and merits of lala have happily survived we are told that she painted with great rapidity that she excelled in the portraits of women and that her pictures bore a price superior to what was given to the most skilful painters of her time her claim to honorable distinction in this volume is grounded on the unquestionable evidence of that profound naturalist antiquarian and connoisseur the elder pliny who certainly could not be deceived in such a point of natural history and who asserts in the most positive language that lala was a perpetual virgin  with this lady i must close my very imperfect account of the pagan virgins and when i reflect how many good but unknown old maids existed before the chaste lala i cannot help breathing a sigh of regret similar to that which horace expresses in reflecting on the many brave but uncelebrated warriors who lived before agamemnon chaste was their fame yet now in darkness drowned their hapless virtue no kind herald found   but let us hasten to console ourselves with a view of the more fortunate ancient virgins of the christian sisterhood these instead of wanting an encomiast have perhaps been sometimes extolled in too lavish panegyrics as this however is a question of great delicacy we will proceed to a candid and ample discussion of it in our subsequent chapters  i shall begin with considering the infinite increase of old maids after the establishment of the christian era  end of the third part part iv on old maids after the christian era chap i on the infinite increase of old maids after the christian era i am now arrived at the most hazardous part of this important essay and i feel that the future conduct of it must be attended with many difficulties to do full justice to my maiden subject i hold it necessary to dwell on several of those ancient fathers of the church who considered virginity as the darling object of their pious lucubrations but as i wish to render these volumes attractive to every class of readers let me here declare that i shall zealously endeavor to speak of all the saints who have touched on this interesting topic before me in such a manner that i may hope not to tire the volatile or offend the pious  by the pious i mean only the good people of our reformed religion being aware that i must expect little or no mercy from a catholic reader for although i declare myself the friend and champion of the honest protestant old maid i am very far from being an advocate for monastic virginity indeed it is with pity and indignation that i consider how many thousand of the most lovely females have been immured to languish in a cloister by parental tyranny or have been led by the insinuating arts of superstition to enter on a voluntary seclusion from all the most amiable duties and delights of human life though i am willing to believe that sincere purity has often resided in a convent i cannot but consider the protestant old maid who supports with cheerful content a virginity which is the consequence rather of accident and necessity than of choice as a more exemplary and interesting personage than the romish nun who in her zeal for chastity renounces mankind for ever i am convinced that the former character neglected and depreciated as it may have been is more truly consonant to the genuine spirit of christianity that simple and sublime religion which is a friend to social happiness and an enemy to every selfish principle  since nature reason and faith may all incline us to cooperate in the preservation of our species it is astonishing that any powers could be found sufficient to counteract their united influence and to make a number of human beings persist in renouncing the most precious privilege of their existence the privilege of communicating their own enjoyments both transient and eternal to new beings more dear to them than their own personal advantage the severe pains of childbirth are graciously compensated by such a profusion of tender delight that the most selfish timidity could not decline the burden after thinking on its reward the more we reflect on the generous energy of the maternal feelings the more shall we be surprised at the multitudes of women who in the first ages of christianity devoted themselves to a single life the whole sex appears to have been inflamed with a passion for virginity and a respectable author who has lately given us an amusing history of women informs us that in the fourth century a single city contained no less than twenty thousand virgins who had taken a vow of perpetual chastity alexanders history of women oct edit p     vol ii  this book would be more valuable if the ingenious writer had quoted his authorities  notwithstanding the extreme humility which they professed i am afraid there was a strong mixture of secret pride in this unreasonable conduct all the primitive christian maidens seem to have coveted such a sepulchral panegyric as the following couplet bestows on our queen elizabeth she was and is what can there more be said on earth the chief in heaven the second maid camdens remains p        perhaps the nuns of the ancient church had pretensions to this ideal sanctity less equivocal than those of our virgin queen however this may be it is a curious and interesting speculation to search into the immediate causes of such wonderful facts and to examine the particular source of those ideas that could so forcibly counteract the tender bias of nature in the female character of those times the ardent zeal with which the early christians embraced a life of celibacy may be ascribed to two causes first to the advice of st paul who strongly dissuades them from marriage and secondly to those flaming pieces of ecclesiastical eloquence in which the fathers of the church were pleased to magnify virginity and to pour into the heated imagination of their female disciples an unquenchable love for this imaginary virtue as i advance in this essay i shall give a particular account of these remarkable orations in the present chapter i shall confine myself to consider the advice of st paul and the immediate consequences which it seems to have produced  i trust that i shall not be thought to fail in that respect which every sincere christian owes to this eloquent and admirable apostle by declaring that i have frequently read his strong exhortation to a life of celibacy with surprise and concern his epistle to the corinthians in which he affirms that it is better not to marry instead of making me a convert to his opinion induces me to exclaim with milton our maker bids increase who bids abstain but our destroyer foe to god and man it is true indeed that st paul is very far from uttering such a prohibition and in his first epistle to timothy he foretells that this prohibitory doctrine shall arise from seducing spirits   timothy iv  in the second chapter of the same epistle he appears to be so far from an advocate for celibacy that he almost seems to intimate that women must work out their salvation by the production of children   timothy ii      yet his address to the corinthians is so pointed in favor of a single life his sarcastic expression it is better to marry than to burn might to many weak or prudish or enthusiastic females exhibit wedlock in such a degrading point of view that perhaps his strong exhortation to a life of virginity might influence many of his maiden disciples more forcibly than an absolute prohibition of marriage could have done at all events when we consider the extensive veneration which was justly paid to this apostle we may fairly conclude that the multitude of primitive old maids was infinitely increased by his first epistle to the corinthians as st paul expressly tells us in this epistle that concerning virgins he had no commandment of the lord chap vii ver     we may question without a shadow of impiety the utility of his advice  i confess that at the first view it appeared to my understanding not consistent with that benevolent and temperate wisdom which certainly adorned the character of st paul but the excellent mr lock in a note to his paraphrase of this epistle suggests an idea that may justify the apostles dissuasion from marriage not as a general precept but as a temporary counsel it is supposed by our great christian philosopher that st paul might speak in this epistle out of a prophetical foresight of the approaching persecution under nero on this supposition he might dissuade his disciples from marriage not as an enemy to connubial enjoyments but as fearing they would more sensibly feel the misery of their impending oppression if they were torn from all the delightful comforts of a married life  however wise and welltimed the apostles advice might be we have reason to apprehend that the extravagant attachment to virginity which some of his female disciples conceived was the occasion of many domestic quarrels and much private distress at least we have one memorable example of this effect if we may give any credit to the mavelous adventures of his follower thecla who is celebrated by several fathers of the church as the first and most illustrious of the virgin martyrs as the anecdotes of this lady are very remarkable i shall extract a little sketch of her life from jacobus philippus bergomensis who published in      a latin folio on illustrious women addressed to beatrice queen of bohemia  thecla was a native of iconium a city of asia she was born in an elevated rank of life and possessed with the advantages of birth the superior attractions of beauty her mother theoclia was preparing for the delight of marrying her daughter to a noble and comely youth whose name was thamirus when st paul arriving in their city happened to lodge in the house adjoining to that in which thecla resided the virgin was so fascinated by the eloquence of the apostle that no entreaties could prevail on her to quit the window where she had placed herself to hear him and where she sat for three days without tasting any food in fenestra itaque domus suae per triduum quasi sui oblita ad audiendum hominem pellecta sine ullo prorsus cibo consedit ut inde a nemine amoveri potuerit  jac bergomensis page     theoclia lamented to the destined husband of her daughter this wonderful fascination but the lover and the parent were equally unsuccessful in their attempts to divert the maiden from her attachment to the preacher the mortified thamirus departed in anger to enquire into the character and doctrine of this new prophet whose discourse had produced so mavelous an effect on his alienated mistress having learned that he was a christian who by his exhortations deterred virgins from wedlock the indignant lover gave full scope to his resentment and delivered the preacher in bonds to the magistrate sextilius by whose order he was committed to prison the devout thecla having bribed the jailer contrived still to feast on the eloquence of the imprisoned apostle being detected in her secret visits she was carried before the proconsul where being solicited to fulfill her engagement with thamirus she disdained to reply the enraged proconsul ordering the apostle to be scourged and driven from the city condemned the obstinate virgin to perish in the flames but thecla being already fortified by the instructions of paul and arming herself with the sign of the cross escaped unhurt and triumphant from the fire into which she was thrown and quitting her native city went to antioch with paul the prefect of antioch became enamoured of her beauty and attempted to violate her chastity but the resolute virgin so vigorously resisted the princely ravisher that she beat his crown from his head tore his mantle asunder and threw him into a state of idiotism or frenzy she was now accused of forcery and condemned to be devoured by wild beasts she marched however undaunted to her punishment and happily found in her purity a preservative against the fury of bears and lions the heart of the proconsul was softened by her miraculous preservation and she obtained her freedom  after these adventures she had a joyful meeting with her preceptor paul at smyrna and having received from him every instruction that could render her innocence more perfect she retired to seleucia where having communicated her own virtues to many virgin companions she closed a life of sanctity illustrated by many miracles in the month of october and in the sixtyninth year of our lord  such is the history which a reverend encomiast of the fair sex has given of this illustrious virgin and it corresponds with the account of other pious biographers who have expatiated on the merits of the chaste thecla in their various lives of the saints the enlightened readers of our country will perhaps consider with an equal degree of incredulity the different adventures of this wonderful maiden it is hardly more probable that st paul should instigate a young damsel to disobey her parent and to violate a nuptial promise than that the hungry and enraged beasts of the forest should be rendered harmless and gentle by the influence of virginity but in whatever light these asserted facts may appear to the intelligent readers of our age and country it is certain they were received during many centuries with implicit belief and veneration the extraordinary merits of thecla were a favorite topic with many holy preachers and st ambrose in particular descants upon them in so high a strain that his discourse must have had great effect upon his virgin disciples  thecla doceat immolari quae copulam fugiens nuptialem et sponsi furore damnata naturam etiam bestiarum virginitatis veneratione mutavit namque parata ad feras cum aspectus quoque declinaret virorum ac vitalia ipsa saepe offerret leoni fecit ut qui impudicos detulerant oculos pudicos referrent cernere erat lingentem pedes bestiam cubitare humi muto testificantem sono quod sacrum virginis corpus violare non posset ergo adorabat praedam suam bestia et propriae oblita naturae naturam induerat quam homines amiserant videres quadam naturae transfusione homines feritate indutos saevitiam imperare bestiae bestiam exosculantem pedes virginis docere quid homines facere deberent tantum habet virginitas admirationis ut eam etiam leones mirentur non impastos cibus flexit non citatos impetus rapuit non stimulatos ira exasperavit non usus decepit assuetos non feros natura possedit docuerunt religionem dum adorant martyrem docuerunt etiam castitatem dum virgini nihil aliud nisi plantas exosculantur demersis in terram oculis tanquam verecundantibus ne mas aliquis vel bestia virginem nudam videret  divi ambrosii de virginibus lib ii p  0 let thecla exclaims the holy father in the second division of his treatise upon virgins let thecla teach you to suffer martyrdom who flying from the bonds of matrimony and condemned by the fury of her betrothed husband changed even the nature of savage beasts by inspiring them with reverence for virginity when she was exposed to be devoured when she shrunk from the sight of men and offered her vitals to the lion she converted the cruel wantonness of the spectators into a respect for modesty then might you have seen a wild beast fawning at her feet and testifying by a gentle murmur that he had not power to violate the sacred body of a virgin the savage adored his prey and forgetting his own natural qualities assumed that nature which man had thrown off you might see by this interchange of nature man assuming ferocity and commanding a beast to be cruel and a beast instructing man in his duty by kissing the feet of a virgin so truly admirable is virginity that even lions revere it the sight of their prey did not allure them though exasperated by hunger anger did not provoke them though stimulated by the rage of the people their custom of devouring criminals did not deceive them their natural qualities ceased to operate upon them they taught us religion by adoring the martyr they taught us even chastity by confining their kisses to the feet of the maiden declining their eyes to the earth as if ashamed that any male creature though only a savage beast should look upon a naked virgin  when the merits of thecla were thus celebrated by one of the most popular and eloquent of the episcopal saints we may reasonably imagine that female ambition was universally awakened the warm imagination of pious maidens was heated to such a pitch of enthusiasm that a passion for the glory of martyrdom extinguished all their natural affections instead of wishing to become the mothers of welleducated children they desired only the purity and the renown of thecla to be adored by lions and extolled by saints how far the most eminent fathers of the church conspired to inflame and perpetuate this supernatural ambition in the tender sex i shall endeavor to show in some succeeding chapters concluding the present with a few remarks on the illustrious thecla  this holy maiden being celebrated as the familiar friend and disciple of an apostle was generally considered as a model for every welldisposed virgin and perhaps in the very long list of female saints it is impossible to pitch on any individual whose miraculous adventures had so powerful an effect in diffusing an universal ardour for the honors of virginity and increasing the multitude of old maids nor is it in the dark ages alone that we meet with panegyrics on the immaculate thecla in the sixteenth century she inspired a doctor of the sorbonne with poetry claude despence who is styled by his biographer the most judicious and moderate doctor of his time composed in latin verse an heroic epistle from thecla to st paul printed at paris      in a folio containing all the latin works of despence   chap ii on some of the most early christian authors who have touched on virginity  tertullian  st cyprian  on the canonical virgins some ages elapsed before the christian virgins were settled in regular communities it was not till the close of the fourth century that the first nunnery was erected in verona by zeno the bishop of that city see mosheims ecclesiastical history translated by maclaine vol i p  0   the origin of nunneries is a point involved in considerable obscurity and has given birth to many pious and dull disputes st syncletica of alexandria has been celebrated as the mother of nuns as st antony has been revered as the father of monks but the history of this holy parent of religious old maids is not very clearly established the curious reader who wishes to consult the various opinions concerning her may find them collected in the preliminary dissertation to an elaborate work entitled histoire des ordres monastiques religieux and militaires printed at paris in eight quarto volumes  but the christian writers of a much earlier date abundantly prove that multitudes of pious maidens had devoted themselves to a single life before any convents were raised for their reception  tertullian who wrote in the second and third century composed a very curious treatise to persuade these holy virgins to cover their faces with a veil and one argument that he urges for this practice is so singular that i cannot forbear to insert it  he tells them it is highly proper to shade a countenance of such dangerous power as to occasion the fall of angels from heaven alluding to the text of genesis in which the sons of god are said to have been connected with the daughters of men for who can presume says tertullian that such angels would choose to cohabit with the relics of mortal impurity and not rather burn for virginity that flower which even excuses the incontinence of man quis praesumere potest tales angelos maculata jam corpora et humanae libidinis reliquias desiderasse ut non ad virgins potius exarserint quarum flos etiam humanam libidinem excusat  tertull de virgin veland p       the next eminent christian writer who treats expressly of virgins is st cyprian who has addressed to them a discourse of admonition on their conduct and apparel the good bishop of carthage declaims against earrings paint and false hair as inventions of the devil inconsistent with that simplicity of habit by which virgins should be distinguished he exhorts them to avoid public baths and nuptial feasts he felicitates them on their escaping the curse of childbirth and encourages them to persevere in their chastity by an assurance that their rank is glorious and that the purity of a virgin approaches very near to the perseverance of a martyr quarum ad gloriam merces secunda est sit et virtus ad tolerantiam proxima  sanct cyprian de habitu virg p  0    such is the general tenor of st cyprians address to the pious sisterhood but i cannot collect any light either from cyprian or tertullian concerning the number of christian females who had in their times made a public profession of virginity there are however two circumstances which may induce us to believe that these holy maidens amounted even at this period to an immense multitude  in the first place a veneration for celibacy was carried to such excesses in the second century that many preachers declaimed against marriage as the suggestion of the devil this gloomy doctrine is said to have been first taught by saturninus of antioch the learned bingham in his christian antiquities has enumerated many sects who were addicted to this perhaps the most absurd of all superstitions which yet prevailed to such a degree and was so forcibly supported by eustathius a preacher of the fourth century that to use the words of bingham many women forsook their husbands and husbands their wives from the persuasion that no one who lived in a married state could have any hope in god  the prevalence of such an idea had certainly a strong tendency to increase the number of those religious maidens who still residing under the roof of their parents yet made a public profession of virginity by enrolling their names in the book or canon of the church and thence acquired the title of canonical virgins  but there was a second circumstance peculiar to this early period which had perhaps an effect equally powerful and extensive in augmenting this maiden community i mean a very extraordinary custom which crept into the primitive church to the scandal of the good and the entertainment of the licentious the custom condemned indeed by saints and councils yet sometimes avowed and vindicated by its adherents which permitted the canonical virgins to attach themselves to a favorite preceptor and even to share his bed without ceasing to make a public profession of their virginity  this fact is so singular that the modern skeptical reader may incline perhaps to question the truth of it many witnesses concur in its support and as the consideration of so strange a custom may instruct us in the state of ancient manners i doubt not but the more discreet virgins of the present age will thank me for exhibiting to their view the very dangerous temerity of their primitive sisters  among the epistles of st cyprian there is one addressed to pomponius which shows us in very explicit language the good bishops opinion of these resolute or rather rash virgins who confessing that they slept with men still asserted their integrity quae se cum viris dormisse confessae sint asseverare se integras esse  sanct cyp epist iv  the saint very forcibly condemns their conduct and justly observes that however innocent they may be no one can long be safe who approaches so near to danger saint cyprian proceeds to censure the boldness of those more determined virgins who attempted to justify their perseverance in so perilous a practice  let not any one says the wary saint consider herself as sufficiently excused or defended by offering her person to the test of inspection since the professional judges of virginity are frequently deceived nec aliqua putet se hac excusatione defendi quod inspici et probari possit an virgo sit cum et manus obstetricum et oculus saepe fallatur  sanct cyp epist iv  from these singular expressions we may conceive how strenuously the canonical virgins contended for the maintenance of this tempting though dangerous custom which to use the metaphor of dodwell had taken deep root in the church  this learned commentator on st cyprian has illustrated the custom that i am now speaking of in a latin dissertation he affirms it was first introduced into the christian church by paul of samosata bishop of antioch who was perpetually attended by two of these fair and faithful virgin disciples the practice became so common that the canonical virgins who thus cohabited with their pastors were distinguished by a particular greek appellation   many of the fathers declaimed with great energy against this class of virgins and the eloquent st chrysostom in particular has left us an animated discourse on this unorthodox cohabitation divided into two parts the first addressed to females and the second to his own sex from this division it seems probable that the more wealthy pious maidens admitted indigent preachers to reside under their roof while on the other hand the wealthy priest afforded a similar refuge to the poor canonical virgin this friendly and tender intercourse was often perhaps very innocent but as it afforded much room for licentious surmises against the clergy it was expressly prohibited by the council of nice the warm and eloquent chrysostom begins his address to these inconsiderate virgins with the most pathetic lamentation  virginity says the indignant saint the most honorable of all conditions has now incurred the most humiliating disgrace and it suffers not from its enemies but from those who still presume to profess themselves its faithful votaries  there were a few individuals among the greeks who by the aid of philosophy were enabled to triumph over avarice and anger but the flower of virginity never flourished among them in this point they have always acknowledged our manifest superiority confessing that such purity was above the reach of nature and did not belong to our species   it was in this point that all the gentiles have marvelled at our perfection  but they can admire it no longer and their admiration is turned into laughter and derision the devil attacked us in this band because he perceived that our virgins were the most effulgent phalanx in all the host of christians but he has so confounded this phalanx that it would be better for us in future to have no virgins at all if they can thus be driven to neglect their duty   the cause of all these evils is this that virgin purity exists only in name while the essence of it is supposed to be confined to the body which is the least part of virginity the more essential parts and those which chiefly denote it are disregarded they have ceased to distinguish themselves by decency of habit by the silence which becomes a virgin by compunction and other marks of a religious spirit  such is the language in which st chrysostom begins his exhortation to those professed virgins who permitted men to dwell under their roof in the course of it the saint grows so vehement in his anger as even to hint at burying the fair offenders alive but since that privilege is not allowed him he contents himself with indignant lamentation he mentions one circumstance which exhibits in a most striking point of view the gross indelicacy of ancient manners  every day says he the midwives are running to the houses of virgins as if hastening to a labor yet not to assist one in the pangs of childbirth though even this indeed has happened to some of them but that they may be examined like young female slaves when they are purchased to discover which has been violated and which is pure one has readily acquiesced in this probation  another has refused it and by this refusal is reduced to shame even if she is still uncorrupted one has suffered another has not suffered yet the latter is put to shame not less than the former as being unable to obtain credit for her purity and wanting the evidence of such an inquisition  what a disgusting idea of the fourth century the age of chrysostom does this anecdote present to us i have translated this singular passage from the saint very faithfully for my maiden readers at the extreme hazard of offending their delicacy  i have ventured to incur this painful hazard in the hope of thus guarding them against an infirmity which is sometimes objected to old maids i mean the infirmity of railing against their own time and preferring past ages to the present the good spinster who justly considers the point of view in which st chrysostom exhibits the virgins of his century will bless her stars that she was born in our happier days when the dignity of the virgin character is supported with more ease and grace and when the calumniated maiden can gain credit for her innocence without being reduced to such a shameful test of her integrity the severe st chrysostom would not allow the opulent virgin to retain even a male servant under her roof he laughs at those who made the infirmity of their health a plea for this indulgence and he draws a very ludicrous picture of those nocturnal occurrences which his warm imagination suggested to him as arising in the houses where the virgin mistress was attended by a male domestic having endeavored to prove that women only ought to wait upon women he closes his address to his female disciples by displaying in the most magnificent imagery those high honors to which immaculate virgins are entitled  remember says the eloquent enthusiast in what quarter of the battle you are stationed  it is yours to stand and combat round the leader of the conflict round the person of the king himself  as in every war the whole army cannot occupy the same ground but some are posted in the wings some in the center some in the rear and some in the front of the array while others wherever the king appears appear also and cooperate on every side with him thus to the chosen band of virgins is this post of honor allotted  nor is it more the office of those attendants who are decked with habiliments of gold who ride on horses adorned with golden trappings who carry the golden armor and the regal gems to denote the presence of their king than it is the office of a virgin to show the presence of her lord these attendants indeed appear round the regal chariot of their sovereign but the virgin may if she is willing be like the cherubim and herself become the chariot of her king  such are the dazzling and extravagant flights of saintly eloquence by which the females of the primitive church were allured to a life of celibacy nature very wisely made the mutual attraction of the two sexes so very strong that the most vehement efforts of superstition often failed in attempting to keep them asunder though the most brilliant and seducing rhetoric was assiduously employed for this purpose  saint chrysostom in the second part of his discourse where he addresses himself to the priests who kept canonical virgins under their roof very heartily acknowledges that it is pleasant to reside with women exclusive of any matrimonial or licentious enjoyment but he endeavors to convince the clergy who indulged themselves in this temperate pleasure and asserted its innocence that their condition was little better than that of tantalus he enumerates the many evils that may arise to man from residing with a female even without a violation of their mutual chastity and he compares a priest who has enervated his mind by such a gratification to a poor lion whose mane has been cut off whose teeth and talons have been taken from him and who is metamorphosed from the tremendous lord of the forest into a wretched animal weak and ridiculous  vigilant and solicitous as the fathers were to prevent this domestic connection between the priests and virgins there were many obstinate offenders who resisted and despised their public exhortations and their private advice the authority of the great st basil himself was not sufficient to prevail on an aged priest whose name was paregorius to dismiss a canonical virgin residing in his house it appears from a letter still extant addressed by st basil to this old delinquent that he pleaded the age of seventy as his excuse and resolutely opposed the severity of his malicious superior who had attempted to rob his declining life of so innocent a comfort st basil however is very far from admitting this apology and closes his letter with a vehement threat of excommunication if the aged paregorius still fondly persisted in his attachment to his fair attendant  love and religion are often found together and are never perhaps so warm and vehement as when they are united the priest who attached himself to a canonical virgin with the endearing appellation of sister was gradually and perhaps insensibly led to the highest pitch of disinterested passion the writings of athanasius have incidentally preserved to us a very memorable example of the strange excesses that may arise from this ardent affection  the archbishop of alexandria declaiming against the wickedness and impudence of his antagonists the arians in his first apology asserts that instead of being ashamed of the crimes imputed to them they persevered without a blush in their offenses leontius continues the primate being censured on account of a young woman called eustolia and forbid to cohabit with her made himself a eunuch for her sake   that he might continue to dwell with her in security in his epistle to the monks athanasius speaks again of this disinterested lover and he there expressly affirms that leontius had made this voluntary sacrifice of himself for the liberty of sleeping with eustolia his wife according to his own account says the angry saint though still called a virgin  the goodnatured reader who will consider the generous frailty of leontius with less severity than athanasius did may rejoice perhaps to be informed that the loss of manhood did not prevent this affectionate enthusiast from rising to a mitre the same austere saint who has indignantly recorded his mavelous and unorthodox attachment to his eustolia has told us with equal indignation that he was made a bishop  of all the tender martyrs of love leontius has perhaps the strongest title to our compassionate admiration and i am induced to recommend his history to our poets from a persuasion that in the hands of some impassioned genius his eustolia might form a pleasing companion and a potent rival to the pathetic and enchanting eloise of pope  before i close this short account of the prohibited domestic connection between priests and professed virgins it may be proper to observe that dodwell supposes this custom to have descended to the primitive clergy from the most illustrious of the pagan sages erant enim apud ethnicos etiam foeminae quae philosophiae praetextu virorum familiaritati assuescerent  inde  ecclesiasticorum profluxerit exemplum a viris etiam magnis philosophicisque commendatum  diss cyp iii  this learned critic imagines that many an honest heathen old maid attached herself to some eminent philosopher of her time and was contented with his doctrine without aspiring to his caresses he mentions the intimacy of cicero and cerellia as a case in point that such an innocent but dangerous attachment has existed even in modern days we have a memorable and a mournful instance in the history of swift and stella that singular genius had the talent and the inclination to sport very cruelly with the passions of women but as his ingenious and more manly godson and biographer very heartily confesses without the power to indulge them see mr sheridans life of swift  this ingenuous confession is perhaps the best of all possible apologies for the misanthropical spirit imputed to swift for they must be imperfect and uncandid judges of human infirmities who do not expect to find and who cannot readily pardon a large portion of misanthropy in a great but unhappy character immaturely deprived or never perhaps possessed of so common yet so invaluable a faculty  but peace to the ashes of this admirable writer and peace to those of that fairer object of our compassion his unfortunate stella who had the strange misfortune of uniting those discordant titles wife and old maid may her severe and unmerited fate be an eternal lesson to every sensible and warmhearted spinster not to contemplate with too tender an admiration either the wisdom or the wit of any cold philosopher  chap iii on methodius bishop of olympus and his banquet of virgins a spirit of pious gallantry so inflamed the first writers of the church that their pens were incessantly employed in the praise of consecrated virgins among the early episcopal champions of the sisterhood methodius was particularly distinguished by the purity of his zeal and the platonic form of his composition we have but few personal circumstances transmitted to us concerning this elegant encomiast of virginity who being first bishop of olympus and afterward of tire closed his scene of religious glory by acquiring the palm of martyrdom in the persecution of dioclesian of the many writings which he is said to have left one alone has escaped the ravages of time and this although its title was sufficient to awaken curiosity and regard did not find an editor till about the middle of the last century it is entitled the banquet of virgins and bears an evident resemblance to the celebrated banquet of plato love had formed the great theme of panegyric in the dialogue of the pagan philosopher and virginity is treated in a similar manner in the chaster composition of the christian bishop i trust that my fair readers will eagerly receive an account of this curious performance and the more so if i first relate to them an anecdote from which it will appear that the banquet of virgins even before its publication attracted the attention of a queen a famous and learned queen who had the ambition like our elizabeth to rank herself in the order of old maids though on a very dubious and disputed title  in the paris edition of methodius by pierre poussines a french jesuit who resided at rome there is a letter from the editor to his friend henri de valois which gives an amusing account of a literary morning that he passed in the vatican library with several men of letters and their royal patroness christina of sweden among the curious volumes that holsten the librarian presented to the company there was a copy of methodius on the sight of it the queen of sweden said immediately to poussines here is the book that we eagerly expect from you alluding to his translation of the greek text which he had just completed at the request of his friend the librarian before the jesuit could reply to this flattering compliment a man of distinguished learning he tells us interposed in this mortifying manner from me most illustrious queen is the banquet of methodius to be expected i have occupied this ground nor shall i yield it to any one  i was struck dumb says the unlucky jesuit i confess for how could i oppose a person my superior in age connected with me in friendship a favorite at rome and honored indeed in all countries for his singular merit while i was inwardly lamenting my own fruitless labor continues poussines the queen took me aside and said what can we do in this business have you no expedient to propose  none replied the modest though mortified jesuit but to withdraw as becomes my time of life and my profession  with the letter thus relating his disappointment and dated in      poussines sent a copy of his methodius to his learned friend at paris and in the following year it was handsomely printed in folio at the royal press of that city though poussines does not mention the name of his successful rival on this occasion yet we know from the octavo edition of methodius published at rome in the preceding year by the celebrated leo allatius that he was the learned person alluded to in the letter of the jesuit  but let us turn from the editors to the work itself  the banquet of methodius contains a series of orations pronounced by eleven virgins in honor of virginity to the eloquence of these fair and chaste orators we are introduced by the following conversation between gregorium a female attendant of the virgins and eubulius supposed to be a borrowed name for the pious author of the dialogue  eubulius you are come very seasonably gregorium for i was lately in quest of you from a desire to learn some particulars concerning the assembly of marcella theopatra and the other virgins collected at the banquet and chiefly concerning their discourses on chastity for it is said they contended on that topic with such spirit and energy that they omitted nothing which could illustrate their subject if therefore you are come on any other business wave it at present and do not hesitate to give me the circumstantial narrative i request of you   gregorium it seems i am disappointed in my hope and another has got the start of me in relating to you the incidents of which you enquire being persuaded that you had not heard a syllable of what has happened i piqued myself on my solicitude to bring you the first intelligence it was on this account i hastened hither as fast as i could being very anxious that no one should anticipate my intention   eubulius be comforted for indeed my good friend i have heard none of the particulars circumstantially my informer could only tell me that such dialogues arose but when i requested an exact account of them he confessed his ignorance   gregorium do you wish as i really came for this purpose to hear every thing that was said or shall i pass over some things and relate only what i think worthy of recollection   eubulius just so but first inform me gregorium where the assembly was held tell me what was the collection of their viands and how you poured to them their wine   while in their golden cups they pledged each other looking up to heaven a quotation from the opening of the fourth iliad with the variation of a few words to suit the purpose of the pious author   gregorium you are always dreadfully learned in conversation eubulius for you make all others appear ignorant   eubulius there is no occasion for you gregorium to rally me at present on this point but as i have requested tell me without farther preface the whole process from the beginning   gregorium i will attempt it  but first answer me do you know arete the daughter of philosophy   eubulius assuredly   gregorium being invited into her garden i mean that toward the east we proceeded to feast on the fruits in season and i said theopatra to me for i collected all the particulars from her this is an awkward parenthesis it would have been better if gregorium had begun by saying she spoke only in the character of theopatra and was not herself present at the banquet  i and procilla and tysiana walked over a very rough difficult and arduous road but when we approached continued theopatra to the spot a majestic and comely woman advancing with gentle grace and clad in a garment of snowy splendour received us she was in truth all celestial inimitable beauty a modest sanctity adorned her countenance her look expressed both austerity and mildness united in a such a pleasing manner as i never saw before in all points she appeared negligent of her charms and wore no foreign ornament this personage advancing with much joy caressed each of us with the endearments of a long absent mother o my daughters she exclaimed you have with difficulty reached me eager to conduct you into the field of perfection after a journey in which you have been alarmed by a variety of reptiles for i surveyed you from this eminence often staggered in your approach and i was afraid lest ye might perish by a fall from the precipice but thanks to that bridegroom to whom i have united you my children and who has accomplished all things according to our prayers having said this let us advance she cried within the boundary as the gates are yet open on our entrance we found thecla agatha and marcella prepared for the banquet she told me that arete immediately said you also take your places here by these your companions for we now happily amounted to the number ten the scene was supernatural in beauty and full of perfect tranquillity the air which pervaded it was blended with the purest light and was of the softest temperature in the center a stream as smooth as oil afforded the sweetest beverage its water limpid and pure formed itself into fountains which spreading like a river supplied all the garden with many copious rills the trees were of various kinds and rich in their recent burdens great was the beauty of their fruit that hung amiable the greek expression here has a singular resemblance to the words of milton   the ground was decorated with neverfading and variegated flowers that diffused the sweetest fragrance near us was a lofty agnus castus a tree so called and sacred to chastity  under which we rested because it was extensive and shady   eubulius happy woman you appear to me to be describing a second paradise   gregorium your remark is just  as soon therefore as we had partaken of every dainty refreshment and various recreation so that no delight was wanting she said that arete thus introduced the subject  o my young damsels the boast and pride of my aspiring spirit o ye lovely maidens who cultivate the unploughed fields of christ with your virgin hands  methodii p   edit par  enough of food and feasting for with us all things are in perfect plenty what therefore remains for me to wish or to require that each of you would favor me with a speech upon virginity let marcella begin since she is first in place and also the senior and when she has well exercised her talents i will take shame to myself if i do not render her an object of envy by fixing on her brow the spotless foliage of wisdom on this theopatra in whose words gregorium describes the scene she said marcella immediately began   as i fear the majority of modern readers would not relish the pious prolixity of these rhetorical virgins i shall only introduce a little summary of their respective orations  marcella begins her discourse with an assertion that virginity is supernaturally great wonderful and glorious and that it requires a lofty soul to support it she considers it as a plant sent immediately from heaven and unknown to the first ages of the world she represents god as purifying human nature by degrees like a master leading his infant scholars through the rudiments of language to the sublimest contemplations permitting in the infancy of the world promiscuous marriage between brothers and sisters refining wedlock by degrees and at length recommending in the person of christ a life of voluntary continence as the summit of rational perfection she concludes with a long passage from the fourteenth chapter of revelations to prove that the order of virgins has the first distinction in heaven though inferior in number to other societies in the celestial host  theophila the second of the female orators considering the speech of marcella as a little too severe upon marriage asserts the innocence and the dignity of procreation in language that discovers her to be a wonderful adept in all the mysteries of nature particularly as she speaks in the character of a sequestered virgin she is interrupted by marcella and the two maidens enter into some altercation on the possibility of producing an infant in opposition to the will of god theophila adjusts their difference by illustrating in a figurative manner the formation of an embryo she vindicates the human frame as the exquisite work of divine power she affirms that even those children who are licentiously begotten are assigned to the protection of tutelary angels she compares the church to a rich and variegated field adorned with the flowers both of continence and propagation   but although she maintains the honor of marriage she concludes with declaring the preeminence of virginity  the third speaker is distinguished by the poetical name of thalia who is anxious to obviate the ill effects which she supposes to have arisen from a misconstruction of the divine command increase and multiply for this purpose she contends that all things said of adam and eve in the mosaic history should be understood in a figurative sense as alluding to the connection between christ and the church thalia then examines and illustrates the art the energy and the design of st paul in his exhortation to celibacy she insists on his expression it is good for a man not to touch a woman   cor i    and she contends that the apostles allowance of wedlock is like an indulgence granted to the sick of eating forbidden food upon a solemn fast  such are the heads of thalias oration which is however so copious that eubulius exclaims when the recital of it is finished well gregorium she has at last reached the shore after traversing a wide ocean of words the good man expresses at the same time an eager desire to hear the residue of these chaste and pious harangues upon which gregorium proceeds to the speech of theopatra this virgin delivers only a concise encomium on chastity with a few texts of scripture very fancifully interpreted  thallusa the fifth orator enforces many religious precepts for the conduct of a maidens life and concludes with observing that gold is an excellent symbol of virginity in two particulars first as it is of a shining nature and secondly not subject to rust  agatha who now takes her part in the dialogue gives a singular caution to her own sex by remarking that lovers are the devil and his agents  etc  a position which she endeavors to illustrate by a prolix and curious comment on the parable of the wise and foolish virgins in scripture  procilla who speaks in the seventh place represents christ as the great encomiast of virginity by a strange misapplication of the uxorious poetry of solomon  thecla hastens with great eagerness to deliver the eighth oration and as she begins to speak she is complimented by arete as a person superior to all her sex in religious doctrine and particularly instructed by the apostle st paul the speech of thecla is far from answering the expectation which her character excites she begins with a kind of pun on the greek word which expresses virginity   she proceeds to a dissertation on the great and red dragon of the apocalypse exhorting all virgins to the most resolute resistance of this formidable monster having concluded what she had to advance on the general topic she desires permission to pronounce a second discourse against a vain and wicked belief in the influence of the stars and she supports with so much spirit the free agency of man that eubulius expresses his admiration in a lively panegyric on the force and splendour of her eloquence  tysiana the ninth virgin of the assembly pronounces a mystical harangue on the feast of tabernacles in leviticus  domnina the tenth and last among the guests of arete begins her discourse by declaring that no person under the old law could be acceptable to god nor till virginity under the auspices of christ began to reign over nature she affirms that this happy dominion of chastity was clearly foretold in the book of judges by the fable of the trees electing a sovereign alleging that the plant rhamnus which in our version of the bible is denominated the bramble is a just and proper symbol of virginity  arete now closes the conversation by remarking that purity of mind and body are equally essential to constitute the perfect virgin she proceeds to commend and to crown the ten maiden orators and the entertainment concludes with religious singing thecla taking the principal part and the rest of the assembly joining in the following chorus which is frequently repeated  for thee i am chaste and possessing a resplendent lamp o bridegroom i rise to meet thee  upon gregoriums finishing her account of the banquet eubulius starts this curious and delicate question which are the better virgins they who are chaste from a quiet purity of constitution or they who in practicing this virtue are obliged to struggle with desire  gregorium hastily decides in favor of the first but eubulius arguing the point with her much in the manner of plato at last convinces her by allusions to the physician who subdues a fever and to the pilot who passes through a storm that the palm of honor is certainly due to those maidens who have labored through a fiery trial and successfully contended with an imperious passion  such is the banquet of methodius which though certainly the production of a pious and elegant mind is so little adapted to modern taste and manners that i dared not venture on a more ample description of it the preceding abridgment may i think be amusing to many readers as it will render them acquainted with a singular composition but little known and as it forcibly shows that among the early pastors of the church one of the favorite points that piety and learning pursued was to increase the multitude of old maids  chap iv on the saints who have written panegyrics on virginity  st athanasius as many most eminent fathers of the church appear to have contended for the palm of eloquence on this tempting ground and successively exerted all their powers of persuasion in magnifying the merits of virginity i intend to give a little sketch of their respective compositions in chronological order  the next holy encomiast who seems to have honored the canonical virgins with an express panegyric is the celebrated athanasius who became bishop of alexandria in the year     though we find in the printed works of this illustrious saint a little treatise in praise of virginity it is proper to remark that the most judicious of the catholic critics will not allow this to be the genuine production of athanasius it consists of good advice to the pious virgin on the articles of dress and prayer it exhorts her never to plunge her whole body into water nor to take even the liberty of looking at herself when she is naked  in speaking of holy meditation athanasius or whoever the author may be has a passage that strikes me as sublime remember says he the twelfth hour for in that our savior descended into hell hell shuddered in beholding him and cried aloud who is he that comes with great power who is he that trampleth on the brazen portals of hell and unbindeth the chain of my captives  in the close of this treatise after delivering many precepts in a very clear and simple style the author breaks forth into a fervid and magnificent panegyric on virginity which he calls a precious pearl not visible to the multitude and found only by few   he concludes with the following remarkable expression these things have i written to thee my dear sister thou dancing girl of christ   the learned dupin considers this indecent metaphor as a proof that the treatise in question is not the genuine work of athanasius  but if such an argument were sufficient to prove a saint not the author of productions ascribed to him the whole band of saintly writers might be almost reduced to nothing since the zeal of the catholic fathers even when they are praising continence is very apt to hurry them into the use of an indelicate or voluptuous image  if the treatise in question is not in truth a work of athanasius it contains however such sentiments on the subject as he is known to have professed in one unquestioned production of this illustrious saint there is a passage which not only shows his unbounded respect for virginity but explains to us in some degree the reason of that extraordinary and indefatigable ardour with which the fathers in general allured the young females of their time into an eternal abstinence from wedlock  in the close of his apology to the emperor constantius the spirited athanasius inveighs with great indignation against the gross injuries which the religious virgins had suffered from their arian persecutors and he introduces his animated invective against the brutality of these ruffians by a short but significant encomium on the virginity which they insulted the catholic church says the indignant saint is accustomed to call the females who possess this virtue the spouses of christ and even the gentiles look upon them with wonder as the temple of the word for in no other sect is the venerable and heavenly profession justly supported but among us christians alone and this therefore is a great and particular evidence that with us there is assuredly the true religion  sanct athanas vol i p     edit colon        we can no longer wonder at the eagerness of the fathers to increase the multitude of monastic virgins when we find they could thus produce them as an argument to confirm the truth of christianity history perhaps can hardly show us a more lamentable abuse of reason than this by which an institution certainly inconsistent with the general good of mankind and of course inconsistent with the genuine spirit and principles of our benevolent religion is unworthily called a strong evidence of its truth  it is plain from this passage that athanasius gave little or no credit to professions of virginity among the heathen and his assertion to consider it in a more ludicrous light is certainly uncandid toward the pagan old maids some succeeding saints in their encomiums on virginity have treated these ancient ladies with a more liberal respect as we shall see in the course of our enquiries i will close this chapter by observing that a saint of alexandria who wrote many years before athanasius allows that a female society existed among the indians who continued virgins were called venerable and seemed by studying the stars to acquire the powers of divination st clement of alexandria in the  d book of his stromata or miscellanies page     of the oxford edition   chap v on saint basil and his panegyric on virginity among the many ecclesiastical writers of the fourth century there is no character more eminent than st basil who succeeded to the bishopric of caesarea in     he has been distinguished by the appellation of great and has received perhaps a still higher title in being called the christian demosthenes  in the works of this eloquent saint we have a long and elaborate discourse on the incorruptible perfection of virginity he professes in the opening of this discourse which is addressed to an episcopal brother to draw a large and complete picture of true virginity at full length and this picture i shall now attempt to copy but in the size of a miniature  saint basil begins by asserting the great excellence of virginity and to explain this consummate excellence as he says in a single sentence he affirms it is by this virtue alone that a human being can resemble god as this is the prime idea on which almost all the fathers have grounded their excessive praises of monastic celibacy i shall digress into one observation concerning it  although this idea had certainly a very dazzling effect when embellished by saintly eloquence yet if justly examined it exhibits to a mind not tinctured with superstition a very ludicrous absurdity for in truth it is saying that a human being can only resemble the great author of all things by producing nothing surely it would be more consistent both with reason and piety to say that if human weakness may in any degree aspire to an humble resemblance of the divine nature it must be in the tender and faithful discharge of those duties which belong to the parental character  but i return to st basil  having asserted the infinite value of virginity he copiously enumerates the many dangers to which so precious and delicate a treasure is exposed he fully explains to the pious virgin how an insidious enemy may encroach on her unsuspecting innocence through the avenues of her five senses he dwells on the peculiar perils that belong to each and explains how the gratification of her palate though apparently innocent may insensibly lead her to the loss of her chastity he observes that our nature consists of a rational and irrational part that the creator has made man like a centaur  etc sanct basil de vera virginitate tom i p      giving him a manly form from the head to the breast and assigning to his lower half the nature of a beast st basil proceeds to show the necessity of keeping this inferior division of the human frame in perfect subjection to the superior and more noble part and this he says is chiefly to be effected by refusing to indulge the palate with any savoury viands  having expatiated on the dangers arising from the sense of tasting he proceeds to the most perilous of all the sense of feeling and on this point he seems to think it impossible to arm the virgin with too great a degree of caution  since exclaims the saint there is a fire in all our limbs those who wish to preserve the body entirely free from burning must avoid the touch of every limb lest the energy of this fire residing in parts should be thus communicated not only to the part which has been touched but to the whole body and to the very soul itself as the throwing of a stone into a reservoir does not only agitate that part of the water on which the stone fell but raising circles one after another drives them with a continual agitation to the very margin  so an amorous glance or a speech containing the sweets of licentious pleasure being vehemently thrown as it were into the soul of a virgin as into clear water awakening other amorous ideas as in the deep agitates her whole frame which is struck according to the fancy of the striker  i have translated this figurative passage not only as a specimen of st basils eloquence but because it contains a remarkable simile which occurs no less than three times as dr warton has observed in the writings of pope whether he borrowed it from st basil or not i shall leave to the decision of the critics only transcribing those lines of the poet which have the strongest appearance of being copied from the expressions of the saint  as on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes the sinking stone at first a circle makes the trembling surface by the motion stirred spreads in a second circle then a third wide and more wide the floating rings advance fill all the watery plain and to the margin dance temple of fame ver     to proceed with st basil  his discourse is full of metaphorical ornaments  he calls the senses the windows of the soul which says he either opens these windows like a chaste woman with care and moderation to admit useful light or looks out of them like a harlot to gaze on every licentious spectacle and display her own wanton vivacity  having shown the necessity of securing these windows with many bolts he points out to the pious virgin the dangers that may attend her in scenes of nuptial festivity and unreserved conversation he tells her that the discourse of a virgin should not only be extremely pure it should also be moderate she should rather incline to hear others than to speak herself and to prove the justice of this maxim the saint observes that nature has given her two ears and only one tongue he excites her to the contemplation and the love of her celestial spouse with a magnificence of language highly calculated to dazzle and to inflame every female enthusiast he expatiates on the enormous sin of corrupting a canonical virgin he considers even the touch of a fraternal hand and the salute of friendship as dangerous familiarities  in pointing out to his fair friends the manifold dangers to which they are exposed he relates a mavelous adventure of a clerical eunuch and a canonical virgin the story though related by a saint is infinitely too gross for the chaste ears of the present age but i may be allowed to repeat the saints reason for recording it as it decently acquaints us with the strange abuses of his time  we are entitled i think to pardon says the saint for relating these particulars as we mention them not only to put the virgin on her guard but to repress those busy eunuchs who have slipped into the church since it is clear that their introduction is the contrivance and the work of the devil  the good bishop in the warmth of his indignation against these imperfect churchmen enters into a very curious account of their dangerous imbecility and illustrates it with some ingenious similies which i forbear to insert from an apprehension of wounding the extreme delicacy of the sisterhood indeed the saint himself apprehensive that some females might be startled at his mode of handling his subject introduces an apology which it may be proper to translate with some abridgment both for his sake and my own  let no one says st basil object to this discourse as improper for the modesty of a virgin from its discussing too deeply the formation of man for in the first place there is no mature virgin so silly as to be ignorant of any thing belonging to him out of whose side she was taken her very limbs without instruction are all acquainted with the various purposes of nature and her lips know their office in affairs of love   we therefore are not to be accused if on this occasion we have unfolded such matters as are by no means unknown to virgins though regarded by them with a necessary silence and secondly if they are really ignorant of mans nature lest this ignorance should itself be an introduction to sin we are justified in explaining to them that nature for their own security  the saint having expatiated on all the rigid duties of monastic virginity addresses the bishop to whom his discourse is inscribed and concludes by observing that continence is the only effectual caustic to fear and destroy the multiplying hydra of licentious desire  chap vi on st gregory nazianzen and his poem in praise of virginity  on some latin poets of the dark ages who have written on the same subject the next holy encomiast of virginity may undoubtedly be considered as the most extraordinary person that ever reflected luster on the annals of the church for he united two characters in himself which some morose critics of modern times have supposed incompatible and was both a saint and a poet i mean the illustrious gregory nazianzen the friend of the great st basil whose epitaph he has written in some of the most affectionate and pathetic verses that friendship ever inspired a composition that does the more honor to this canonized poet as basil had mortified his ingenuous pride by placing him in the wretched and obscure bishopric of sasima which he afterward exchanged for the episcopal throne of constantinople an irksome though splendid elevation from whence he retired in the year     to poetical solitude in the wilds of cappadocia where he closed his remarkable life in     at the age of sixtytwo  among the various productions of this sainted bard we have a panegyric on virginity containing about seven hundred verses a slight sketch of this poem will i trust be amusing to my fair and curious readers it opens with an air of triumph  etc our palms virginity shall bind thy brow from the pure heart flow with melodious joy ye songs of purity  the heavenly zeal of continence is lifes most precious gift outshining amber ivory and gold it is this that bursts the bondage of the world and lifts the highaspiring soul to heaven assist ye chaste ones as the hymn begins the virtuous all have part in virtues praise all hail virginity from god derived giver thyself of good of innocence the lovely parent and associate fit for the unfettered sanctities of heaven   the poet proceeds to descant on the heavenly powers and to celebrate the virginity of the angels he then touches on the evils that arise from the flesh giving a short account of the first formation of man and the incarnation of christ he considers our savior as coming to instruct the world in the principles and practice of true virginity a condition says the poetical saint as much superior to marriage as heaven is to earth and a divinity to a mortal  after thus magnifying the merits of continence the poet indulges himself in bold and spirited personification he introduces marriage and celibacy pleading in opposition to each other  marriage speaks first and the poet seems to act fairly by throwing into this harangue many forcible arguments in its favor but as i am unwilling to trespass on the patience of my readers and apprehend that some of them may not relish a very prolix specimen from the poetry of a saint i shall only translate the verses in which virginity is introduced as replying to marriage and a few of the most striking passages in her speech   etc thus marriage  then with mild and modest brow in tattered garments and with naked feet with eyes to earth declined with parting lips half open held by diffidence and cheeks where the pure blood diffused a pious glow virginity within her loosened veil hid her meek countenance and mute remained her let me thus encourage with due praise  offspring of heaven and rich in heavenly power mixed with the choir of angels though on earth often deigning to appear in earthly shape  speak here in thy defense while by thy side i stand thy guard for heavendescended queen to me thou came and ever may thou come kindly attentive to thy servants prayer who summons me reluctant to this scene me ever bent to serve my heavenly lord in daily labor and with nightly song with purifying prayer and tears that flow to wash out my offenses who presumes to call me from these pure and pious tasks to idle contest and a war of words with this vindication of her own hallowed dignity virginity begins her reply professing to disregard the opinions of men she declares that she would not condescend to answer her antagonist did she not tremble      lest some one raised and fluttering in mid air on the new plumes of callow maidenhood should quickly sink to earth the victim of this artful lure   on this consideration she enters on a long attempt to refute all the arguments which had been alleged by marriage her persuasive opponent she begins by a subtle distinction to invalidate the plea of utility and delight arising from the production of children she affirms that parents are parents only of the bodies not the minds of their offspring and as a proof of this she asserts that they only lament the bodily infirmities and not the mental disorders of their progeny  this satirical reflection on parental folly hardly affords sufficient ground for the inference which the fair pleader wishes to draw from it but virginity begins to argue with more sound reason and with more poetical spirit also when she exclaims what mortal can depend on giving birth to such an offspring as his heart desires for who can tell the secret how to plant the child of happy or unhappy growth  the painter draws the image he beholds in his just portraiture the sculptors hand fully commands similitude of form and ductile gold obeys his plastic will from perfect seed the happy farmer rears the perfect grain that answers to his hope but the vain mortal who would leave on earth a copy of himself however great his own integrity cannot decide whether his genial efforts may produce a judas or a paul no  infants are not molded to the wish of a fond parent but as one who seeks amusement in the turning of the dice throws them uncertain whether he may throw an odd or even number not his hand but the vague movements of the dice decide so marriage gives not birth to good or bad at the bare option of its votaries but as the secret laws or the caprice of nature may determine   having thus shown the uncertainty of those parental delights on which marriage appeared to pride itself virginity proceeds to a magnificent encomium on her own superior pleasures her own beauty and excellence as the chaste spouse of christ she then enumerates all the miseries that can arise from the various incidents of married life she concludes her oration by exhorting all who regard her to persevere in a single state and to place themselves in paradise by the merits of chastity  the poet declares that those who heard the two pleaders bestowed the palm on virginity he concludes his poem however in a manner much more candid than we might have expected from one passage of it in which christ is said to have been born of a virgin that marriage might sink to the ground   for in the three last verses of this singular composition he introduces our savior acting as a kind of moderator between the disputants by seating marriage on his left hand and virginity on his right  it is not in this panegyric alone that our poetical saint has expressed his affection to virginity he has written poems of admonition to virgins containing many hundred verses the points he chiefly recommends are plainness of apparel and a disposition to solitude and silence he encourages his disciples to triumph over all the licentious passions by reminding them of the success with which human resolution has subdued the most furious of the savage beasts as an example of this he affirms that he has seen a man riding a lion like a horse and a bear appearing to fly by the art of his conductor      the orations of this illustrious father contain also many proofs of his incessant attention to the interests of virginity but the tender compassion with which he considered the sufferings of the sisterhood under the apostate julian seems to have rendered him too credulous in his first invective against that deluded monarch he gives an account of some outrages inflicted on christian virgins too horrid to be related in this work and i am persuaded too savage to be true  when we reflect on the warm heart and the elegant genius of this holy bard we cannot but regret that he did not live in a period more propitious to the cultivation and the display of his many amiable talents  as i have devoted this chapter to a poetical encomiast of chastity i shall here break through the chronological line which i intended to observe for the sake of exhibiting in one point of view the little group of poets who successively celebrated this maidenly perfection  be not alarmed my good reader i mean not to trouble thee with a long history of all the woeful verse which the idle monks have scribbled on the continence of every sainted abbess for though their fictions are often bold their poetry is seldom entertaining  allow me however to terminate this volume with a brief account of the most remarkable characters in the monastic quire of chaste and pious bards who reechoed through the dark ages the incessant praise of virginity  the first of these both in personal rank and in point of time is sextus alcimus avitus nephew to the unfortunate emperor of that name the poet became archbishop of vienna and after acting a very busy and important part in the christian world died with a great reputation for sanctity in the year     this venerable bard has addressed to his sister fuscina a poetical exhortation to monastic virginity a state to which he tells us many females of his family had been devoted he excites the young fuscina to the virtues that may become her religious character by various examples and to teach her a brave contempt for unmerited calumny he relates the following very singular anecdote which i have selected as the only amusing passage in his long composition eugeniae dudum toto celeberrima mundo fama fuit christi quae cum pro nomine vitam fuderit ante tamen fortes processit in actus namque habitum mentita viri non proinde virile pectus praeficitur sanctis a fratribus abbas tum patris officium complens ac vest virili foemineum occultans sexum

tuta manet multis licet acta procellis alcimus avitus ad fuscinam sororem the copy of avitus which i have followed is printed in a collection of the old ecclesiastical poets by george fabricius basil quarto i mention this circumstance because the story of eugenia contains many more verses in the edition of fabricius than mattaire has printed in his corpus poetarum latinorum   the world has echoed with eugenias fame who nobly perished for her saviors name but ere she gloried in a martyrs fate brave was her heart and her achievements great her sex disguising with a manly air she lived an abbot in a house of prayer to reverend monks she taught the words of truth over age presiding in the bloom of youth the fiend against her framed an hellish plot her life to threaten and her fame to blot but by her innocence and modest care the latent virgin triumphed over the snare beneath the habit of a man concealed the sad she comforted the sick she healed but soon deluded by her manly form a matron with licentious passion warm tried though in age with her decaying charms to lure the youthful abbot to her arms when foiled how love will hazard each resource the old and desperate dame resolved on force on her lone bed in feigned disorder laid she begs the fancied holy fathers aid and as he comes with charitable pace she springs to seize him in a loathed embrace the unknown virgin in the abbots shape for succor cries and struggles to escape the guilty matron frantic with despair frames for the fancied priest an impious snare father eugenius she proclaims aloud to the attentive slanderloving

deed when with that pride which innocence allows the fancied criminal her fraud avows aside she throws her wellsustaind disguise confessed a maiden by admiring eyes the applauding populace with transport see the devil defeated and the virgin free thus ever safe true chastity shall dwell secure to triumph over the snares of hell   the singular adventure of this female abbot will i think induce my reader to wish for a few more particulars relating to so interesting a personage and by the aid of that pious and gallant historian of holy virgins arthur du monstier i am enabled to add that eugenia was the daughter of philip a roman of high rank who was prefect of alexandria in the reign of commodus she was distinguished by her personal beauty and adorned with every mental accomplishment her application to literature was great her memory uncommonly retentive and she was equally eloquent in the greek and latin language with these attractions at the age of fifteen she was demanded in marriage by aquilius the son of aquilius the consul but the young eugenia being converted to christianity made her escape privately from her heathen parents and disguising herself in the habit of a man took refuge in a religious house not far from alexandria here she met with the remarkable occurrences recorded in the poetry of avitus it is said that she converted both her parents to her new religion that her father suffered martyrdom and that eugenia herself returning to rome with her mother whose name was claudia experienced the same fate in the reign of gallienus  such is the account given of eugenia in the curious work of du monstier entitled sacrum gynecaeum a pious biographical treasure containing all the sanctified females of the christian world her merits are celebrated by almost every writer who has touched upon the catholic virgins and her name is mentioned with honor by two succeeding latin poets of whom i am now to speak  the first of these is venantius fortunatus a poet on whose history i enter the more willingly as it is connected with that of a fair lady who if she were an old maid as some of her biographers have asserted was undoubtedly among the most remarkable of the sisterhood being at once a queen and a saint a virgin and a wife this singular personage was the lovely princess radegunda who being taken prisoner in her infancy by clotaire king of the franks was married in soissons at the age of fifteen and in the year     to that savage hero the destroyer of her fathers kingdom and the assassin of her brother this unfortunate princess is universally described as a model of beauty but her personal charms were surpassed by her piety she wore an under vest of haircloth and loaded her delicate body with a chain of iron du monstier affirms that although she lived a few years with the king her husband she obtained from that amorous monarch the privilege of remaining a virgin the more modern author of that amusing book entitled anecdotes of the queens of france anecdotes des reins et regentes de france   tom       is inclined to prove the falsehood of this problematical fact by the expressions of her first biographers who describe her as rising early from the bed of the king but without venturing to decide on so nice a question i shall proceed in the more certain history of radegunda  after residing three years with clotaire she obtained his permission to retire and founding an abbey at poitiers she enjoyed in it all the tranquil pleasures of religious retirement she possessed an affection for literature and she was happy in the society of two the most eminent authors of that age gregory bishop of tours the historian and fortunatus the poet who had the honor of being secretary to the pious radegunda and was promoted to the bishopric of poitiers  fortunatus was an italian of an elegant mind and insinuating manners it was probably to flatter the chaste fancy of his royal mistress that he composed his singular poem on a celestial synod and the virtue of virginity de senatu curiae caelestis et virtute virginitatis  fortunati poem lib    this performance opens with a full convocation of all the eminent heavenly virgins and martyrs when they are assembled before the throne of god the voice of the divinity announces his design of rewarding the pious and chaste passion of an earthly maiden and describes the holy tenderness and ardour with which she panted for a celestial spouse the verses that include this description are remarkably spirited and elegant for the age in which they were composed  the maiden is represented as thus venting the fond enthusiasm of her soul dic ubi sis quem expecto gemens qua te urbe requiram quave sequar nullis semita nota locis ipsa venire velim properans si posset in astris pendula sydeream planta tenere viam nunc sine te fuscis graviter nox incubat alis ipsaque sole micans est mihi caeca dies lilia narcissus violae rosa nardus amomum oblectant animos germina nulla meos ut te conspiciam per singula nubila pendo et vaga per nebulas lumina ducit amor ecce procellosos suspecta interrogo ventos quid mihi de domino nunciet aura meo  tell me where art thou whom i die to see where is the latent road that leads to thee how would i haste my souls desire to meet could starry paths support my pendent feet now without thee i feel oppressive night and dark to me the suns meridian light in vain the richest flowers their fragrance shed for all the sweets of earth to me are dead each passing cloud to see thee i pursue for love directs to heaven my wandering view i bless the storm on which thy feet have trod and ask the winds where i may find my god having proclaimed the merits of this chaste and servent devotee the sacred voice declares that she shall possess the sanctity she desires and her name is enrolled in the eternal register nomen perpetuo scribitur inde libro  the poet proceeds to tell how the newlyconsecrated virgin is decorated with all the jewels of heaven he affirms however that the chaste and humble virtues are her best ornaments he magnifies the excellence of virginity compared to the miseries of a married life and he concludes with a prayer addressing the whole poem to the chaste and pious agnes whom his royal mistress radegunda had raised to the dignity of abbess in the religious house which she herself had founded perhaps it may be a groundless conjecture but i am inclined to believe that fortunatus composed this poem with infinite art intending an oblique and concealed compliment to the problematical virginity of radegunda herself though in the close he addresses himself to agnes as the virgin who had thus made a kind of holiday in heaven my conjecture arises from the following remarkable circumstances  in the long description of this celestial ceremony the name of this virgin so interesting to all the powers of heaven is not once mentioned although it is said to be inscribed in the eternal volume this singular omission persuades me that the poet wished to compliment some lady as a virgin of uncommon sanctity whom he did not think it prudent to name his cold manner of addressing the poem to agnes appears to me as a kind of mask to his real intention besides there are some passages in his enthusiastic description of the chaste female so highly honored by heaven which do not agree with the condition of agnes and may be applied with an elegant propriety to his royal mistress radegunda after describing this anonymous virgin as decorated with a long catalogue of celestial jewels the poet exclaims his cumulata bonis thalamo regina sedebit atque poli sobolem sub pede virgo premet  decked with these gems a heavenly queen she will reign and rule a virgin over the angelic train   there is also another poem of fortunatus expressly on the virtues of radegunda in which after having compared her to the most celebrated of the holy virgins for charity and abstinence for devotion and fortitude he adds caetera nunc taceam melius quia test tonante judicioque dei glorificata manent  to speak thy farther merits i refrain which from thy conscious god full glory gain   such are the grounds of my conjecture whether radegunda was in truth an old maid and whether her ingenious secretary intended to pay her an oblique compliment for the peculiar delicacy with which she has been supposed to acquire and support that venerable character are points which i must now leave to the discussion of the curious however great the chastity of this pious queen might be it has not escaped detraction and our poet himself has been suspected of possessing too lively an interest in her heart some late biographers of the fair royal saint have considered this calumny as the immediate suggestion of the devil provoked by the peculiar purity of radegunda but it appears to have arisen rather from the carelessness of some early writers who finding in the poems of fortunatus that he had been accused of being a little too fond of the abovementioned agnes made a mistake in their account of this matter and transferred his supposed affection from the abbess to the queen the truth seems to be that fortunatus lived in a very pleasing and innocent familiarity with these two pious ladies they amused themselves in sending little presents of sweetmeats and other monastic delicacies to their ingenious friend he acknowledged their favors with poetical gallantry the extempore verses which he composed on such occasions are printed with his poems they do honor to the tenderness of his heart and the elegance of his genius but though they often breathe the warm spirit of affection they are far from throwing any stain on the purity of his morals his royal mistress is said by the authors of the literary history of france to have ended her life in     our poet died in  0  and his festival is yet celebrated at poitiers on the   th of december  the following pious herald of chastity in the dark ages was an illustrious character of our own country i mean the great aldhelm bishop of shireburn in dorsetshire during the saxon heptarchy this canonized bard was not only distinguished by peculiar sanctity but excelled in the sister arts of poetry and music and has been celebrated as the person who introduced latin verse into england  his poetical talents were great indeed for the period in which he flourished and he exerted them in a composition of heroic verse extolling the most eminent votaries of virginity both male and female in the latter catalogue the following are his heroines  the virgin mary and the saints caecilia agatha lucia justina eugenia agnes thecla eulalia scholastica constantina eustochium demetrias anastasia rufina secunda anatolia victoria  as a specimen of aldhelms poetry i shall select his verses on caecilia whose talents have rendered her the most interesting of female saints  porro caeciliae vivacem

martyrs crown they gain and heaven repays them for their mortal pain such is aldhelms panegyric on the celebrated st caecilia and as it may amuse the curious to compare this mitred bard with our old poet chaucer who has told the same mavelous story i shall insert in a note a few lines from the latter the night came and to bed must she gone with hire husbond as it is the manner and prively she said to him anon  o sweet and well beloved spouse dear there is a conseil and ye wol it here which that right fayn i would unto you say so that ye swear ye wol it not bewraie valerian began fast unto

me that angel seen and him behold and if that it a very angel be than wol i don as thou have prayed me the second nonnes tale tyrwhitts chaucer vol iii p  0 it is justly observed by this excellent editor that chaucer originally composed his story of caecilia as a separate work and afterward united it to the canterbury tales  that he closely copied the life of saint caecilia in the golden legend of jacobus jannensis  and that he mentions his own performance in the list of his laudable and pious works  and for to speak of other holiness he has in prose translated boece and made the life also of saint cecile legende of good women   the poem of the saxon bishop is to be considered only as a kind of supplement to his elaborate treatise in prose on the same interesting topic the author of aldhelms life in the biographia britannica has by trusting to the authority of bid committed a mistake in his account of these separate performances which he represents as a single work of verse and prose intermixed they are not only distinct productions but have been published apart it appears that the prosaic essay was first written as in the close of it the author intimates his design of handling the same delicate subject once more in verse  as this chapter is already longer than i intended i shall only select one passage from his prosaic treatise exhibiting a most singular scale of virtue if i may use such an expression by which human merit was measured in the age of this accomplished saint  in quodam volumine angelica relatione refertur quomodo virginitas castitas jugalitas tripertitis gradibus separatim differant quae sicut trifaria disparis vitae qualitate sigillatim sequestrantur ita discretis meritorum ordinibus tripliciter dirimuntur angelo hoc modo alternatim distinguente ut sit virginitas aurum castitas argentum jugalitas aeramentum ut sit virginitas divitiae castitas mediocritas jugalitas captivitas ut sit virginitas sol castitas luna jugalitas tenebrae ut sit virginitas dies castitas aurora jugalitas nox  p aldhelmi liber de laudibus virginitatis cap xix edit wharton  to london      it is recorded says aldhelm in a certain volume from the narration of an angel how virginity chastity and wedlock differ from each other and mark in three degrees the quality or worthiness of life how according to the angels discrimination virginity is gold chastity silver and wedlock brass how virginity is wealth chastity a competence and wedlock poverty how virginity is peace chastity redemption and wedlock captivity how virginity is the sun chastity the moon and wedlock darkness how virginity is day chastity the dawn and wedlock night  the ingenious prelate continues to illustrate this angelical division of human merits by many more metaphors of equal force and then tells us the precise meaning of these three significant terms  a necessary explanation as without it a modern reader would be little able to understand the anonymous angel thus quoted by aldhelm virginity says the good bishop is a voluntary attachment to a single life chastity is that state of purity observed by those who after the ceremony of marriage separate and abstain from matrimonial intercourse for the sake of heaven despising that ordinary wedlock by which children are lawfully produced  this very curious triple estimate of human merit occurs also in the poem on virginity and as that poem is extremely scarce i shall transcribe the verses  humani generis triplex distantia fertur quae modo per mundum triquadro cardine degit et studet in terris mercari regna tonantis denique nonnullos sortitur vita jugalis qui recte vivunt concessa lege tororum et praecepta dei toto conamine mentis conservare student thalami sub jure manentes posthaec castrorum gradus

connexa prius thalamorum vincula rumpunt tertia virgineis fulgescit vita lucernis cujus praecellit praefatos infula ritus mundani luxus calcans ludibria falsa virginitas summo virtutum vertice floret dum soror angelicae constet castissima vitae sanct althelmus ut supra such was the doctrine of the famous aldhelm which throws a considerable light on the practices of the times in which he lived when the great purpose of marriage was often defeated as in the case of king edward the confessor by a vain pretension to superior sanctity this poetical prelate was so passionate an admirer of pure virginity that he put his own continence to many singular and dangerous trials it is related by his elegant and affectionate biographer william of malmsbury that aldhelm did not like other priests avoid the company of women but often detained some virgin by his side both sitting and lying and while he held her in his embraces repeated his whole psalter to the confusion of the devil vel assidens vel cubitans aliquam detinebat quoad carnis tepescente lubrico quieto et immoto discederet animo derideri se videtur diabolus cernens adhaerentem foeminam virumque alias avocato animo insistentem cantando psalterio  will malms de vita aldhelmi anglia sacra vol ii p      however this conduct might increase the veneration which was paid to this extraordinary saint i cannot help condemning it as an instance of cruelty and injustice  great as his exultation and triumph might be on thus deriding the devil as his biographer expresses it by a mavelous display of his own subdued desires he had certainly no right to sport so wantonly with the passions of those religious old maids for they could hardly be young ones whom he thus made the uneasy instruments of his own chaste reputation  in speaking of the most eminent poets who amused the dark ages by celebrating the wonderful virgins of that period i ought not to omit the venerable bede he has enlivened his ecclesiastical history by inserting a poetical panegyric on the chaste aedilthryda a lady who chose to fly from the bed and throne of her husband ecfrid king of northumberland for the sake of preserving her virginity in a cloister for this pious exploit she is extolled in the highest terms by the holy bard who in singing her praises seems to felicitate himself with a gallant complacency that he is superior to virgil in the happy choice of his subject bella maro resonet nos pacis dona canamus   luxus erit lubricis carmina casta mihi bedae hymnus de aedilthryda  it is however remarkable that the greatest poet of our country has mentioned this obstinate royal virgin in terms of indignation and reproach milton in his history of england has condescended to relate the adventure of this pious fugitive in the following language  another adversity befell ecfrid in his family by means of ethildrith his wife king annas daughter who having taken him for her husband and professing to love him above all other men persisted twelve years in the obstinate refusal of his bed thereby thinking to live the purer life so perversely then was chastity instructed against the apostles rule at length obtaining of him with much importunity her departure she veiled herself a nun then made abbess of ely died seven years after the pestilence and might with better warrant have kept faithfully her undertaken wedlock though now canonized st audrey of ely miltons history of england page    birchs edition   milton has not deigned to enter into a very whimsical part of this ladys history but a monastic historian informs us that her husband repenting of the indulgence he had granted to her and inflamed with new desire determined to force her from her religious retreat and to consummate his marriage she escaped both from his love and his resentment by a series of the most extraordinary miracles which the curious reader may find very circumstantially related in the first volume of dugdales monasticon after sustaining great hardships she is said to have expired a perfect virgin in the year     and the miracles displayed at her tomb were not inferior to those by which her life was distinguished  i cannot close the volume without lamenting the sufferings of the fair sex in the ages of ignorance and superstition when all the saints of the time most zealously asserted that it was meritorious in a married woman to remain a virgin domestic life must have been frequently embittered by tragicomical contention and perhaps the mind of many a wellmeaning woman has been half distracted by the struggle which such doctrine may have produced between tenderness and devotion it may however afford us some consolation to reflect that whenever these good ladies were misled by the priesthood into a painful sacrifice of innocent delight their pride was incessantly gratified by the pious honors that were lavished upon their rigid virginity yet their passion for such honors was sometimes repressed by the stronger feelings of personal vanity as we may collect from a ludicrous miracle related by gregory of tours that historian gives us a circumstantial account of a noble and pious pair who being married in their youth passed through life together with this extraordinary continence at the particular request of the lady she happened to die first and as her good man attended her funeral he exclaimed while the body was sinking into the grave i thank thee eternal god that as i received this treasure from thee so i return it immaculate to thy goodness upon this the dead lady said with a smile why do you mention matters on which you are not interrogated multos postea in uno strato recumbentes annos vixerunt cum castitate laudabili quod postea in eorum transitu declaratum est nam cum impleto certamine puella migraret ad christum peracto vir funeris officio cum puellam in sepulchrum deponeret ait gratias tibi ago aeterne domine noster quia hunc thesaurum sicut a te commendatum accepi ita immaculatum pietati tuae restituo ad haec illa subridens quid inquit loqueris quod non interrogaris  greg turonensis hist francorum lib i cap      the sequel of the miracle is not less striking the husband died soon afterward and though he was buried in a tomb not contiguous to that of his wife it was observed the next day that their sepulchers were united the devout historian seems to consider these incidents as proofs of the most signal chastity but they may with as much reason be alleged as proofs that the spotless lady who had so strongly petitioned her husband to release her from the duties of a wife did not relish his public declaration that she died an old maid  end of the second volume
