the gotham election a farce  by mrs centlivre   quirites defossa in loculis quos sportula fecit amicos juv sat  0 london printed and sold by s keimer at the printingpress in paternoster row       to james craggs jun esquire cofferer to his royal highness the prince of wales and member of the honorable house of commons sir do me the honor to afford your protection to these two petites pieces i am sure none ever stood in more need of so generous a friend and a defender as you are though i dare not say they deserve this benefit by any real merit of their own yet they have one title to the protection of all well natured people which is that they have enemies undeserved and were persecuted by those that did not know em  if they had gone through a legal course of theatrical justice though it might have been partial yet i should have submitted to it as others had done before me but to be prejudged and condemned unheard was harder measure than any body else meets with at this time a day  the election which had the honor to pass your approbation was objected against as a party  matter i fancy both sides will agree that there are unreasonable heats and extravagancies belonging to each of em which deserve to be exposed laughed at and exploded by all true lovers of their country since by such arts our enemies find the way to poison our constitution  for the other it was said there would be offense taken at the exposing a popish priest good god to what sort of people are we changed are those worthy gentlemen the emissaries of our most avowed and irreconcilable enemy to be treated with so much tenderncss is not their very profession treason in any subject of great britain have our neighbors in france treated the clergy of the reformed religion with the same regard but let that pass since they have their friends and advecates even here i hope i have some too it is not an unpardonable sin with every body to wish well to the liberties and religion of ones country no sir i assure my self you have goodness enough to overlook a great many other faults where you find an honest and disinterested zeal for our present happy constitution you whose good judgment ever engaged you on the right side the protestant succession and the interest of britain you who scorned to herd with the betrayers of your country or raise your fortunes on the ruins of your fellow subjects you who so generously espoused my interest when you knew my intention of dedicating to his royal highness then duke of cambridge will have the goodness to protect a woman who has no other merit but her good inclinations and perpetual wishes for the prosperity of the present government these were principles which you know she was not ashamed of owning even when it was almost criminal to pay any marks of respect to that royal family under which our laws and our liberties are now so happily secured  i wish sir that you may find any thing in either of these little comedies that may entertain you at some leisure hour i know very well that your time is at present too precious to be thrown away upon trifles that house of commons of which you are so worthy and so ornamental a member have the noblest and greatest task now lying before them the vindication of our public honor to all europe and the extricating us out of such difficulties as only one set of men in the world could plunge us into but they will meet their reward and you with those worthy patriots engaged with you will find yours in the thanks of the present age and the blessings of that of posterity  i might here expatiate on the many excellent qualifications you are master of did i not know it would be harder to obtain your pardon for touching upon that subject than for presuming to shroud these little pieces under the protection of your name besides i think it needless at high noon to tell the world that it is light since all that have eyes must see the day and all that have the honor to know mr craggs knows his character is above my reach consequently would suffer from the attempt of any pen so weak as mine therefore shall only beg leave to subscribe with the profoundest respect sir  your most obliged most obedient and most devoted humble servant susanna centlivre  the preface when i writ this little farce i was not without hopes of having it represented on the stage what i proposed to my self was the honor to show their royal highnesses the manner of our elections and entertain the town with a subject entirely new it has had the good fortune to please several persons of distinction and taste in the reading and some of our best judges assured me it could not fail to entertain from the stage but the subject being upon elections the master of the revels did not care to meddle with it and the players act nothing without his license so that i had given over all thoughts of its appearing in public but the word election it seems immediately furnished out a thousand scandalous stories and i was become the subject of every coffeehouse in town and notwithstanding my friends endeavored to do me justice as often as they heard me aspersed yet for my clearer justification they were of opinion i ought to print it since several persons had been so industriously malicious as to report that this farce was a most impudent notorious libel upon her late majesty than which there is nothing more false and the world will see how little ground there is for such a report its so far from being a satyr upon her that there is not one personal reflection designed through the whole piece i was obliged indeed to make an opposition of parties to heighten the humor it had been impossible to have writ any thing upon the subject without it but i dare be positive that the persons among whom the scenes lie would have given more diversion than offense to the spectators of either party i endeavored to make every thing appear as natural as i could and for that reason only i stuck wool in the hats of my whigs and laurel in those of the tories though i would be glad to know why the latter made use of the laurel to dislinguish themselves when they were laboring to give up all the conquests we had won i should have thought a sprig of rosemary had been the properer emblem of the then approaching funeral of our church and state since the chevaliers friends were endeavoring to bury our religion and liberty under tyranny and popish superstition had parliaments been part of the legislature among the ancients and our manner of elections known to and practiced by them apollo would certainly have shown vengance on the unworthy wearers of his favorite tree the laurel was ever held the emblem of joy and reward of virtue hence it was worn by victors in the olympic games but have englishmen reason to rejoice in those measures that paved the way for a french government and a popish king  the roman soldiers who followed their triumphs were crowned with laurel to denote an expiation of the blood which they had shed in the wars but our lawrelwearers can draw no parellel from thence except deserting our allies selling our trade disgracing our generals giving up those glorious conquests they had won deserved to be crowned with laurel or that they would be thought to wear it as an expiation of the blood of the catalans and of the twelve thousand cut to pieces at denain by the fatal cessation of arms  whatever reason they had for wearing it i am glad they had not an opportunity of making use of it in the triumph they designed over the laws and liberties of their country  here i cannot omit taking notice how much the popish faction increased under the traitorous management of the late ministry and we see by their daily insults that it is at the hazard of life or interest at least that we dare vindicate our religion and liberty had the author of lady jane gray made her a papist and gardener a bishop of the church of england and the play been represented on the french stage what protestant would have dared to call it a popish play without running the danger of the galleys if the title of a certain monarch who was also set up by the people in opposition to the right line were to be represented on the theater of france not even the first peer of that nation durst to have vented one murmur much less his without he were furnished with philosophy enough to endure the bastile and yet the papists and their abettors dare to do it here it is with the utmost indignation that i see those wholesome laws neglected which ought to be put in execution against such professed enemies of our church and state for to the indolence of our people in power are all our present divisions and distractions owing though for the author of that excellently writ poem abovementioned i dare answer for him is under no concern for any thing that faction can either say or write since it is very evident their malice is not levelled against him but against our religion and liberties which he has in that piece vindicated so well and set the cruelties of rome in so true a light that a great part of our clergy may blush to see the stage become a better advocate for protestantism than the pulpit and as often as that tragedy shall be represented the authors memory shall be honored to posterity whilst those pretenders to the church the highflying and nonjuringparty shall be remembered with the utmost detestation  dramatis personae men tlckup a candidate for gotham sir john worthy another candidate talked on but not seen friendly an

ha ha i can but laugh to think how my wifes brother the mayor has overreached his daughter   enter sir roger trusty sir roger mr alderman credulous your most humble servant sir i am glad to see you so merry pray what may be the occasion   ald family affairs sir roger my brother has disposed of his daughter  that is all   sir rog humph not as he expected though i believe for her advantage i hope aside   ald ay ay sir roger we fathers know what is good for our children better than they do themselves they have naught to do but to submit to our pleasures passive obedience is as absolutely necessary in our wives and children as in subjects to the monarch is not your opinion the same sir roger   sir rog yes whilst husbands fathers and monarchs exact nothing from us contrary to our religion and laws but pray mr alderman how came you so passive i remember you wore other principles in eighty eight  this is not natural alderman   ald eighty eight that is a long time ago i know some men that have worn out twenty setts of principles since eighty eight both men of the robe and men of the gown   sir rog more the pity alderman i am sorry nature did not distinguish men of such principles from the rest of her handywork that we might enjoy her gifts more amply and be more thankful for the blessings when i reflect that i am of the same species with the betrayers of my country for sure that crime is the greatest of all others i could almost wish to wear any other form of the creation life is a blessing or a curse according to the fame we purchase and he that redeems twenty of his fellow creatures from the slavish yoke of tyranny does an action worthy of a man that bears the image of his creator whilst he who seeks by treachery to inslave his kind to feed ambition avarice or revenge is only the pest of human society and ought to have a mark set upon him that we might shun him as we would the plague   ald ay ay so it ought to be sir roger but i have read somewhere nature to mans breast has made no windows to show us what they act within doors   for my part i am for the church and my country   sir rog so am i their interests are inseparable who gives up one betrays the others for my part i intend to stand or fall by both therefore i hope you will do me the honor of your vote mr alderman   ald why truly sir roger i am preengagd i will not tell a lie for the matter   sir rog to who pray   ald why to squire tickup   sir rog tickup why he is a fellow not worth a groat and a known jacobite   ald nay look ye as that his means and his religion is nothing to me let his creditors take care of one and our parson of the the other for my part i am for the church as i said before and would rather be a papist than a presbyterian   sir rog why where is the necessity of your being either come come there is a more convincing argument than what you have named  mr tickup is recommended by some great man on whom you have dependence   ald great man why yes truly he is a pretty large man and i have i trust heaven very great dependence on what he says the parson of the parish you know ought to be regarded sir roger and he told me that mr tickup was a good churchman and prayed me to vote for him and to get all my friends to do the same if i would promote the interest of the church   sir rog ay the interest of the church of rome not that of england why i will undertake to prove this fellow deep in the interest of young perkin and that he and his friend at villa coumbe has bought up and sent for his service more than  000 horses within these last four years and can such a man be a proper person to represent you in that august assembly where the people of gotham expect to have these pernicious measures redrest   ald why i am confounded at what you tell me   sir rog i am amazed to find you in the interest of the highboys you that are a cloathier what can you be for giving up trade to france and starving poor weavers   ald trade pish pish our parson says that is only the whigs cant and that if the bill of commerce had passed it would have been of signal service to us   sir rog which way i pray alderman   ald nay i never asked him that though no doubt but he can tell you for he is a learned man and understands matters better than i do   sir rog it is much to be wished for the honor of our religion and the safety of our state that those learned men were more industrious in the cure of souls and less busy in politics  but come come mr alderman there is yet a secret behind the curtain pray what could mr tickup or any of his friends oblige you with that is not in my power to have done  you and i have been good friends and if a brace of hundreds had been wanting  why we could have served you as well as they   ald so so i find whereabouts you are already well there is nothing kept a secret in this damned town however i had not those two hundred pounds by way of bribe i assure you sir roger   sir rog ha ha why then you had two hundred pounds   ald yes i confess mr blowcoal our parson did give me bills for two hundred pounds part of a sum he said that was given him for charitable uses and bad me dispose of it to proper objects as i thought fit but not to bribe votes i assure you   sir rog no no no no twas to build churches i suppose and reward secret merit ha ha ha ha but i am sorry for your sake that they made their payment in paper  pray let me see those bills  who are they upon   ald see them ay  there they are sir roger gives him bills   sir rog looks on em upon sir charles wealthy as i suspected  why he is a bankrupt not worth a groat ha ha ha why you are bit alderman bloucoal has bit you ha ha ha charity quotha yes this is charity with a vengance   ald how am i tricked but you are not in earnest sir roger are you   sir rog as certainly as that i my self lost five hundred pound by the same banker i tell you sir carles wealthy has been gone off this month   ald the devil he has odsheart i am finely served why i am out of pocket the lord knows what death i shall lose all patience   sir rog look ye mr alderman if you will yet hear reason i will make up all this matter see here pulls out a purse here is  00 guine as in this purse all ready cash hang paper here is the best provision for charitable uses  mr alderman hark how religiously they chink what say you will you cheat them as they have cheated you come for once serve your self and your country old boy   ald but are you sure those bills are not worth a farthing sir roger   sir roger claps the bills into his pockets and takes out some papers and tears em in small piece sir rog sure on it aye as sure as i am that my name is roger trusly  and thus i sacrifice them to your resentment mr alderman and now    ald death hell and the devil i am undone  but if i am not revenged    sir roger plays with the purse it was a cursed trick inded to affront an alderman of a corporation at this rate   ald give me the purse sir roger slaps it into his hand and now sir roger i am yours if i do not fit parson blow coal say i am the son of a dead cinder  i will bring sixteen votes sir roger egad i will overreach the rogues i warrant em this purse is a pledge for my performance  exit sir rog and these bills a pledge for that purse ha ha ha takes out the bills i will send my servant to receive the money immediately i think
