an account of the extraordinary medicinal fluid called ether  by m turner surgeon in liverpool  printed by john sadler mdcclxi  the publisher of the following short account of the ether having prepared and successfully made use of it in his private practice for several years has at length determined to endeavor to extend it is utility by thus making it public as he knows of no one who has ever published it is medicinal virtues or offered it to sale in it is perfection or given the criteria by which they who are unacquainted with it might distinguish the genuine from the spurious and he doubts not but every candid person who examines it will agree with him that it carries with it the strongest marks of a valuable addition to the materia medica and therefore ought to lie no longer in obscurity  an account of the ether etc this truly extraordinary chemical preparation is not a new discovery having been known and esteemed as a valuable curiosity by many of the greatest chemists and philosophers both ancient and modern particularly by sir quere   st at the end of his optics isaac newton and the honorable treatise on the producibleness of chemical principles mr boil who both mention it in their works though not by this name and therefore before any thing is said of it is virtues as a medicine it may not be improper to explain the nature of it and enumerate a few of it is remarkable properties considered as a curiosity in chemistry in which light chiefly it has hitherto been viewed by those who have been acquainted with it  it is a kind of ethereal oil produced by the decomposition of the vinous spirit by means of the vitriolic acid and differs essentially both from vinous spirits and essential oils in several respects though it agrees with them in some as will appear hereafter but as the vinous spirit may be decomposed by means of all the three mineral acids viz the vitriolic the nitrous and the marine and as these all act differently on the spirit they will of course produce three different kinds of ether which from the name of the acid employed in making them are termed marine nitrous or vitriolic the last only is the kind here understood it is properties being more singular and extraordinary and as an ether more perfect than either of the others the reason of which seems to be that the vitriolic acid is a much stronger agent on the spirit and more perfectly decomposes it than either the nitrous or marine  it is the most light most volatile and most inflammable of all known liquids it swims upon the highest rectified spirit of wine as oil does upon water and flies away so quickly as hardly to wet a hand it is dropped upon from which properties it probably has obtained it is name it is so readily inflammable as to take fire at the approach of a candle before the flame touches it any electrified body will also produce the same effect  it is one of the most powerful solvents known in chemistry it is neither acid nor alcaline and therefore is perfectly free from that faline acrimony with which all the common volatile spirits abound it has a greater affinity with gold than aqua regia has although it will not dissolve it in the mass or whilst in it is metallic form but if you add ether to a solution of gold in aqua regia it presently takes all the gold from it is former solvent keeping it perfectly dissolved and suspended without the least precipitation and becomes of a yellow color the ether thus saturated with the gold does not mix with the aqua regia but may readily be separated from it by simple decantation and thus a true and safe aurum potabile is readily prepared for those who want such a medicine the union of these two substances is very remarkable one being the heaviest solid body we know and the other the lightest liquid  the ether is remarkably cold when dropped upon the hand and it affects the thermometer in an extraordinary manner for if the ball of either a mercurial or spirituous thermometer be immersed in it the spirit or mercury immediately sinks considerably though both the ether and the thermometer have stood a sufficient time together to be brought to the temperature of the room before the experiment was made the thermometers dipped into water or spirit of wine in the same manner suffer not the least alteration  they who choose to see a further account of the singular effects which this curious fluid produces may peruse what doctor frobenius a german chemist has published concerning it in the philosophic transactions for the years      and       but the most valuable qualities of the ether are it is medicinal ones it having been found by repeated experience to be an excellent remedy in most nervous diseases particularly in fits of all sorts whether epileptic convulsive hysteric hypochondriac or paralytic in habitual headaches gout rheumatism pains in the stomach windy disorders of the stomach and intestines hooping cough asthma pleuritic pains and deafnfss all which diseases have in a singular manner been removed by it and that the publisher may contribute all the assistance he can in extending the use of this medicine the following methods of applying it are given which have been attended with success  particular directions for using the ether in the headache a fit of the headache is almost instantly removed by applying the ether externally to the forehead by means of a bit of linen rag in the manner hereafter directed for it is external application or it may be applied to any other part of the head where the pain lies being first shaved if necessary if the pain is violent a dose of it should be also taken inwardly in stubborn cases it will likewise be serviceable to snuff a little of the ether up the nostrils either alone or mixed with equal parts of lavender water hungary water or brandy or it may be more convenient to apply a bit of linen rag wetted with ether up the nostrils any of these means or all of them must be repeated if the pain is so urgent as to require it to cure this disorder radically when it is of long standing and to prevent it is return the medicine must be taken inwardly for a considerable time every night at bedtime or in violent cases every night and morning in a small draught of cold water according to the general direction for taking it inwardly given p    in some particular cases vomits are very serviceable  a vertigo a vertigo giddiness or swimming in the head will generally be removed by proceeding in the sam manner as for the headache  the epilepsy no disease is more difficult to cure than the epilepsy or falling sickness yet several instances have occurred where the most violent degrees of it have been cured even in grown persons by taking a dose of this medicine regulary every night and morning for a considerable time the dose must be regulated according to the age of the patient as mentioned in the general direction page    if a pain is felt in any part of the head the ether must be applied to that part occasionally and it must be previously shaved if necessary it will be proper to give a small dose of tinctura sacra or of the pill rufi at proper intervals as once a week or fortnight it will also in most cases be necessary to give now and then a vomit if it be suspected that the patient has worms proper medicines to destroy them ought also to be given  in convulsions in convulsions or convulsive disorders give the ether inwardly a dose two three times a day or oftener according to the exigence of the case and it should also be applied externally to the forehead or any other part of the head during the fit if the patient is full of blood bleeding is necessary and if costive a dose of manna senna or any gentle laxative or a clyster should be given  hysteric and hypochondriac disorders this medicine has excellent effect in hysteric fits and in all that train of symptoms which hysteric and hypochondriac persons are subject to such as risings in the throat threatening suffocation difficult breathing flutterings and palpitations of the heart frequent fainting lowness of spirits violent pains in the head languor of the whole body dullness of the mind and senses with constant anxieties and inquietude etc the dose must be repeated according to the urgency of the symptoms and the medicine must be continued some time after the complaints disappear to prevent a relapse it will be serviceable during the use of the ether especially in case of costiveness to take at proper intervals a gentle purge such as tinctura sacra pill rufi rhubarb or glaubers salts bodily exercise of all sorts contributes greatly to the cure of these complaints especially riding on horseback  palsy in palsies and all paralytic complaints the patient if a grown person must take the quantity of a tea spoonful of the ether every night and morning the dose must be lessened in young people according to their age it will also be proper to snuff a little of it up the nostrils once or twice a day or apply a bit of rag wetted with it up the nostrils the ether must also be applied externally to the part affected at least once every day it should likewise be applied now and then to the forehead or any other part of the head especially if the tongue eyes or any part of the face or head be affected if the arms or hands are paralytic the application should be made to the lower and back part of the neck as well as to the part affected if the disease has seized the thighs legs or feet the application must not only be made to them but likewise to the back bone at the loins as this medicine cannot on account of it is volatility and pungency be properly applied to the whole of a paralytic limb at once but only to a small part of it the application therefore may be made sometimes to one part and sometimes to another as shall be thought proper  this disease will require a longer or shorter continuance of these means according to the degree of it and the time it has continued a vomit should be given and repeated now and then as the patient can bear it but if vomits seem too fatiguing a dose of tinctura sacra may be given in their room paralytic patients should use as much bodily exercise as possible and the head neck and the whole spine as well as the parts affected should be frequently rubbed with a hot and dry cloth till they appear red  gout this medicine is of singular service in the gout not only while it continues in the limbs but particularly when it flies inwards and attacks the head stomach or any of the internal parts in which cases a few doses will not fail to give present relief it should be taken in the quantity of a tea spoonful two or three times every day or oftener if the case be violent during the gouty fit it carries off the gouty matter by urine which it renders very thick and turbid at any time when there is a necessity to abate the excessive pain in the part affected the ether may be applied to it externally according to the method given p    it will be proper to continue taking the ether once or twice a day for some time after the fit is gone and to begin taking it again about the time of it is expected return by which means though it may not prevent the return of the fit which in many cases perhaps ought not to be desired yet it will shorten it is continuance and moderate the pain of it  rheumatism in rheumatic complaints the patient must take a dose of this medicine every night and morning or oftener if the pains are violent and it must be continued till the disease is removed or longer to prevent a relapse if the pain is fixed in any particular part the ether must be applied to it twice a day as directed hereafter it must be observed that  very much conduces to the cure of obstinate ic rheumatisms and must be repeated at proper intervals if necessary the blood in this disease being generally very sizy  disorders of the stomach and intesti this medicine presently cures flatulent cholics removes all windy disorders of the stomach and intestines and corrects acidities lodged there it is also found to have excellent effect in correcting that weakness or bad habit of the stomach and intestines which studious persons and such as lead sedentary lives are particularly subject to and is attended with four belchings heartburn windy distensions pain and uneasiness in the stomach and bowels it must be taken every night and morning according to the general direction below care should be taken to prevent costiveness in these cases which is best removed by chewing rhubarb or taking it any other way or by a dose of manna or glaubers salts taken occasionally  the ether is an extraordinary diuretic in dropsies it is an excellent medicine in an asthma and the hiccup and may be looked upon as a specific in that disease of children called the hoopingcough or chincough in all which cases it must be taken inwardly according to the general direction below and the repetition of the dose must be regulated by the violence of the disease  a dose of it taken at going to bed after drinking too freely has been found to prevent the headache sickness etc which usually follow next morning  it has removed deafness and hardness of hearing by moistening a little cotton with a few drops of it putting it into the ear and holding the finger for a few minutes over it at the same time snuffing a few drops of it mixed with spirit of lavender up the nostrils or putting a bit of rag wet with the ether alone up the nostrils  it has frequently removed a temporary dimness of sight attended with a swimming or uneasiness in the head by external application to the forehead and is a promising medicine in that sort of blindness called a gutta serena and in beginning cataracts in which cases it should be taken inwardly as well as applied to the forehead and up the nostrils  it is likewise found to be of great service in removing pleuritic pains and stitches in the side by applying it to the affected part in the manner directed for external application  the method of taking the ether inwardly the general dose for a grown person is a common tea spoonful and the best vehicle to take it in is a small draught of cold water if it be only stirred in the water with the spoon and the mixture drank immediately it strikes the nostrils by it is volatility but may be thought by some as agreeable when so taken as when the two liquors are more intimately mixed by shaking them together in a phial and from thence pouring them into a glass to be drank for though it has but little smell in this manner it is more warm to the palate than in the other the patient may use the way of mixing he likes best and if he has any objection to water may take it in any other agreeable cold liquor children in the month may take two or three drops for a dose those of a year old may take seven or eight drops those of five or six years old may take from twenty to twentyfive drops and so increasing according to their years or it may perhaps be better in giving it to children to mix a tea spoonful of ether with a convenient quantity of water and shaking it well give at a dose about one twentieth part of this mixture to a child a month old about one eighth part to a child twelve or fourteen months old to those about five years old one third part of the mixture half of the mixture to those about seven years old and two thirds of it to those about fourteen years old  the method of applying the ether externally to apply it externally you must procure a bit of linen rag of such a dimension as to be conveniently covered by the palm of the hand moisten this rag with a little of the ether as it lies upon your palm and instantly apply it to the part affected pressing it very close so as to prevent the escape of it is fumes for two or three minutes in which time the rag will be found dry and may be taken away it will be more convenient on some occasions as in applying it to paralytic parts rheumatic pains and the gout to place the rag upon a piece of a soft thin bladder and when moistened with the ether o bind it gently upon the part a slight redness usually appears upon the part after the application but it quickly vanishes but it may sometimes happen where the skin is very tender and too much ether has been applied to the forehead or within the ears that it may affect the skin more than the patient chooses which is avoided by applying a less quantity for the future this is the secret of a present famous practitioner who having a method sometimes of concealing his application is said to cure the headache fixed rheumatic pains etc by the touch of his hand  it is very easy to conceive from the extreme subtlety of this medicine that it must produce many excellent effects in such diseases as those above mentioned as it is converted into vapor by a much less heat than the common animal one so that being swallowed it can hardly subsist in any part of the human body under any form but that of an extremely penetrating volatilizd vapor and it is perceptible by it is smell as it passes through the pores of the skin several hours after taking so that it is stay in the body is longer and it is effects there more durable than might be expected from such a subtle substance  notwithstanding the extreme subtlety of the ether it is perfectly innocent and safe to take as it contains nothing that is acrimonious or corrosive so that it may be given even to the youngest children without hesitation it neither purges nor vomits nor does it increase any of the sensible evacuations except that of urine and sometimes that of sweat if taken when in bed but as it is so distinctly perceived by the smell passing through the cutaneous pores of those who take it it is highly probable that it increases insensible perspiration  another observable property in this medicine is that it does not coagulate or thicken the serum of the blood but thins it and therefore has direct contrary effects to all the common spirituous compositions when either taken inwardly or externally applied and is essentially different from the most subtilizd vinous spirits for though spirit of wine is used in making it yet it is so far decomposed by the process that it is nature is entirely changed in consequence of this quality in the ether the publisher has successfully dissolved some particular obstinate tumors by applying it to them when other means have failed  this hint he hopes will not pass unnoticed by the gentlemen of the faculty as it is evident no application whatever can equal it in subtlety and dissolving power  the medicine so much celebrated in germany and so frequently commended and used in practice by the late famous professor hoffman under the title of his liquor mineralis anodynus was nearly of the same nature with the ether but not so powerful nor so highly subtilized  repeated experience has confirmed the efficacy of this medicine in all the diseases before mentioned and from the consideration of it is uncommon qualities it may be presumed to be an excellent remedy in many others if judiciously given hence it seems surprising that so valuable an addition to the materia medica as the ether doubtless is should have been so much neglected or so little known but the reasons are that the process whereby it was made was kept secret by some who rated the preparation at a very extravagant price and not sufficiently attended to by others who considered it only as a chemical curiosity not as a medicine  the chief merit the publisher of this account pretends to is the ascertaining the medicinal virtues of this curious preparation by several years experience and making them more publicly known the reducing it is price which has hitherto been so extravagant that had it is virtues and properties been known only a small number of the afflicted could have enjoyed the benefit of it and the bringing it to a greater degree of perfection than any hitherto sold what he offers being a perfectly rectified vitriolic ether  it may not be improper to give the marks by which good ether may be known it is perfectly colorless except it has received some accidental tinge from the cork of the phial in which it has been kept and so volatile as to strike the nose very powerfully it is smell is more or less sulphurous according to the management of some part of the process wetting the finger with it or dropping a little upon the hand it vanishes instantly and leaves no moisture behind so that the part scarcely seems to have been wet half a dozen drops dropped together upon a table will disappear in a few seconds of a minute and leave only the appearance of a large oily ring behind but if it leaves the least watery or spirituous moisture or does not evaporate in much less than a minute it is not good the best ether will dissolve in or mix with a certain quantity of water and that is the best which requires the largest quantity of water to dissolve it if therefore to six tea spoonsful of water in a small phial you add one of the ether to be examined cork up the phial and shake them very well together and upon standing a little while some part of the ether appears at top in form of oil sufficient to cover the surface of the mixture it may be pronounced good provided it also answers in the other methods of trial and the more appears the better is the ether but if none appears or not enough to cover the surface of the mixture it was either adulterated or not well rectified if to this mixture of ether and water you add a little salt of tartar and any fermentation ensues the ether was not well rectified upon shaking briskly a phial containing ether if the bubbles or proof as they are usually called do not disappear in less time and in larger bubbles than any other liquor the vinous alcohol perhaps excepted it is not genuine  it is the more necessary to observe these rules of proving the quality of the ether as the imperfect sorts have been found to disagree with the stomach and produce other bad effects besides disappointing the patients expectation  the ether that has the forementioned properties for there are preparations sold by the same name which are very imperfect imitations of it is made and sold by m turner surgeon in liverpool the ounce phial two shillings the half ounce one shilling the phials are square the word ether inscribed on one side and m turner on the opposite and sealed with a lion gardant etc proper abatement will be made to druggists apothecaries or the gentlemen of the faculty who use any considerable quantity to prevent it is escape and loss a small quantity of water is put into each phial which should be kept with the cork downwards by which means the ether is prevented by the interposition of the water from evaporating  the publisher has also appointed it to be sold by mr r board chemist and druggist in grace church street and mr j wilkie bookseller at the bible in st pauls churchyard london and mr peter wilson bookseller in damestreet dublin
