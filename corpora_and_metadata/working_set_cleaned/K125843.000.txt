the roguish miller or nothing got by cheating a true ballad a miller there was and he lived at his mill which was built on a stream at the foot of a hill he cheated all day and he drank all the night for cheating and drinking was all his delight while his moments in tippling unheeded did roll this still was his saying  be sure to take toll whoever sent corn to be ground at his mill he spoilt it he changed it he pilferd it still in villainy thus a long course he did run for he fancied that cheating was very good fun he cared not what came of his body or soul while this was his saying  i will always take toll if you sent a full sack of good corn to his mill a sack of bad flour he sent you back still for he fancied that when he the wheat had once ground the difference would not be easily found now to change good for bad was as if he had stole and he not only changed it  but always took toll the neighbors often sent him their money to pay but he always refused it and sent it away had he taken the money he would have got but his due but the payment that is lawful for him would not do what was honestly his he despised on the whole because he got more from  the taking of toll one day when a farmer had sent a good sack of his corn to be ground and then sent for it back he called to his man and demanded straitway if for this he had taken the toll on that day the man strait declared that though naught he had stole yet that he had taken  the full of the toll he then called his maid and he asked her good lack if toll she had taken from that very sack she declared that she had but he fond of pelf said for fear that you should not i will take it myself so rashly he ventured the loss of his soul and mended his practice  by thrice taking toll at length he grew bolder and bolder in sin and cheating he deeper and deeper got in of satan alas he was quite at the beck where he first took a pound he at length took a peck no church he frequented to pray for his soul who would might go thither  so he could take toll the farmer the squire the parson likewise agreed to observe him with still keener eyes but the justice he cheated to such a degree that no longer with patience his frauds could he see so he sent him to jail by the laws just control and a mittimus paid him  for taking of toll come all honest millers whoever you be and listen to counsel that is given by me be content like fair tradesmen with moderate gains and look for a lawful reward of your pains if it is paid you in money be pleased on the whole and if you take any  take moderate toll o seek not each way to defraud that you can nor cheat in the flour nor cheat in the bran be honest and all men will flock to your mill and though others want custom yours never will stand still and when to your maker you give up your soul you will rejoice that you always  took moderate toll z  sold by s hazard printer to the cheap repository for religious and moral tracts at bath  by j marshall  at the cheap repositories no    queen street cheap side and no   aldermary church yard london and by all booksellers newsmen and hawkers in town and country  great allowance to shopkeepers and hawkers  entered at stationers hall  price an halfpenny or  s  d per  00  s  d for  0  d for
