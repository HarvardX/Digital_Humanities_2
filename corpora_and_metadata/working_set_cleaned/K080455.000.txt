the life of thomas cranmer archbishop of canterbury  the life of thomas cranmer archbishop of canterbury  by william gilpin m a prebendary of salisbury and vicar of boldre in newforest near lymington  london printed for r blamire in the strand  mdcclxxxiv  preface the character of archbishop cranmer has been equally the subject of exaggerated praise and of undeserved censure the protestant is as little inclined to acknowledge that he had any failing as the papist is to allow him any virtue the historian therefore who means to be impartial will often of course give offense to the warmer advocates of both sides  at the hazard however of this i have endeavored to do justice as well to the failings as virtues of this celebrated reformer every cause in which truth is concerned is the better i should think for having all things but truth sifted from it and in discriminating the lights and shades of a character the greater the character is the nicer should be the discrimination for the very foibles of an amiable man are fascinating queen elizabeth used to tell the artists who drew her picture that she did not like shade it was a mere accident  it may be so but it is such an accident that the truth of portrait cannot be had without it  besides by impartial treatment you add respect to the character you represent general applause is always suspected while just censure gives weight to praise  but the question recurs is your censure just  in censuring some parts of the archbishops conduct particularly his intolerant principles i have little doubt of having the general sense of good men on my side  as to the indelicacies and improprieties of his behavior i can only appeal to my own feelings what i should not wish to approve in myself i cannot but censure in another i always however give my reasons and if they have no weight they must be dismissed archbishop cranmer certainly filled one of the most difficult stations considering all its circumstances in which a man could be placed and the only matter of surprise is that the false steps he made were so few  one thing more let me add we shall not easily find a character that can allow deductions so well his virtues so far outweigh his failings that on the whole we may esteem him one of the first persons of the age in which he lived his public life contains an important part of ecclesiastical history and his private life an admirable lesson of clerical instruction  to this let the ministers of the gospel chiefly attend and instead of thinking too harshly of his failings let us endeavor to bring as much seriousness and real concern for christianity as he did into all the duties and offices of religion  in composing the following work i claim little merit but that of digesting and reducing within a narrower compass the labors of others i have had little affistance except from common printed accounts the works of mr strype an historian of great integrity have been my principal guide whose authority in doubtful points i have generally preferred  in gratitude also i must acknowledge particular obligation to the late mr jones of welwin the learned friend and i believe the executor of the celebrated author of the nightthoughts  but i never was personally acquainted with him  this gentleman had once entertained the design of writing the life of archbishop cranmer and with this intention had made considerable collections but laying his design aside he was so obliging as to put his papers near twenty years ago into my hands  we had both i found drawn from the same authorities only i had the mortification to observe that he had been much the more industrious compiler he had also through the means of several of his learned friends at cambridge particularly the late dr buker gained access to many sources of information less obvious to common inquirers  our plans too rather differed his was chiefly to explain the opinions of the archbishop mine attempts rather to illustrate his character notwithstanding however this difference mr joness papers were of considerable use to me  i have now deposited them agreeably to his last will in the library of dr

a family which had long lived in reputation in those parts he was a lover of country diversions and seems to have given his son an early taste for them  the circumstances indeed of mr cranmers youth were not such as usually usher in the life of a scholar no man could manage a pack of hounds better or handle the longbow with more dexterity or with the crossbow take a surer aim in horsemanship he so excelled that after he was an archbishop he scrupled not to ride the roughest horse in his stables  but amusements with him were only relaxations he gave himself up to study with equal eagerness and his proficiency in countrydiversions showed merely the versatility of his genius  the experiment however is dangerous and the example not to be followed by those who are not well assured they have his strength of parts and steadiness of temper to secure them from an extreme  at the usual age mr cranmer was sent to cambridge which was not then the seat of the muses schoolmen were the classics of that age and nothing was heard from the chairs either of science or religion but what would have inspired an improved mind with disgust this solemn trifling which was then called learning engaged mr cranmer at least ten years  about the year    0 martin luther began first to draw the attention of mankind many reformers before his day particularly wicliff huss and jerome of prague at different periods had seen and exposed with great acuteness and strength of argument the corruptions of the church of rome but it pleased god to use these inquisitive minds only as the dawning of that day which he intended gradually to open the corruptions of the church therefore having not yet received any effectual check continued to spread and in the days of luther had grown to an enormous height venality and rapacity were the reigning characteristics of the sovereign pontiff and of that band of ecclesiastics who retained under him the very idea of religion was lost except where it was necessary to uphold some parading ceremonies of the church which were all the remains now left of christianity morals were never thought of and so far were the ruling powers from being hurt by the scandalous lives of the clergy that they invented every method to exempt them from the jurisdiction of all courts except their own in them every trespass found the gentlest treatment an easy fine would satisfy even for murder  nor is it surprising that the inferior clergy should lay aside all decency of manners when they looked up to such pontiffs as had long filled st peters chair particularly alexander vi and julius ii even leo x flattered by the wits of the age as the revivor and patron of arts and letters tho an elegant prince was a detestable ecclesiastic they who wish to see the causes which advanced the reformation drawn out at length may find them detailed with great perspicuity and elegance in the life of charles v by dr robertson vol ii page     oct ed   we need not wonder therefore if so complex a system of corruption as the roman hierarchy appears to have been at that time needed little developing luthers doctrines spread rapidly through germany and tho it was the single corruption of indulgences which gave the first impulse to this disgust yet from one error the minds of men presently passed to another and the tenets of luther were eagerly embraced not only by the lower classes of people but even by some of the princes of the empire particularly by the elector of saxony one of the best and by his sufferings shown to be one of the most magnanimous princes of his time  but tho the ardent and intrepid spirit of luther had thus awakened a great part of germany from its lethargy yet his opinions found their way but leisurely into other parts of europe in england they were received with great caution serious men began to see the corruptions of the clergy but they were afraid to question the infallibility of the pope they were convinced of the propriety of seeking truth in the bible but examined with great timidity the doctrines it contained  indeed as far as appears the writings of erasmus introduced the first idea of systematic reformation in england this reformer was a man of a very different temper from luther and yet in his way perhaps he contributed as much to discountenance the corruptions of the romish church luther fearless in the path of truth was animated rather than daunted by opposition erasmus cautious and respectful to authority shrank from danger and sought truth only in the regions of tranquillity luther in vehement language talked of extirpating error root and branch erasmus wished only to open the eyes of men and to leave them by degrees to reform themselves he satisfied himself with exposing what was wrong but did not presume to point out what was right luthers opposition ran ever in the form of fierce invective or serious argument erasmus tho always in earnest chose commonly to cloth his sentiments in ridicule luther was remarkable for the boldness of his measures and a course of intrepid action while erasmus trusting to his pen never ventured abroad as the champion of religion but defended it from his closet and the art of printing getting then into use his opinions soon made their way into the different parts of europe  thus it happened through the providence of god that these two men tho in different ways were equally adapted to the work of reformation if luther were the more spirited reformer on the spot erasmus was better qualified to make proselytes at a distance if luthers rough and popular address were better suited to the multitude the polished style and elegant composition of erasmus found readier access to the gentleman and the scholar  the works of this celebrated writer began to be received in england at the time when mr cranmer was a student at cambridge and all men who pretended to genius learning or liberality of sentiment read them with avidity to the general scholar they opened a new idea  that of thinking for himself and to the student in divinity they pointed out the scriptures as the only source of religious truth the sophistry of the schools began apace to lose credit and the universities soon produced ingenious men who thought they could not employ their time better than in studying the naked text of the scriptures which at length drew on a freedom of inquiry these students were commonly known by the name of scripturists  mr cranmer ranked himself very early in this class of men and with great assiduity applied to the study of the scriptures the more he studied the more enlightened he grew he daily saw more reason for rejecting the false aids in which he consided and began to entertain many doubts and suspicions which he yet kept to himself  his mode of study was calculated for improvement rather than for ostentation he read few books but made himself a thorough master of those he did read a general scholar he thought another name for a superficial one his character as a student is thus marked by one of his biographers in percurrendis conferendisque scriptorum judiciis tardus quidem lector sed vehemens erat observator sine calamo nunquam ad scriptoris cujusquam librum accessit ita tamen ut memoriam interim haud minus quam calamum exerceret melch adam vitae theol   an imprudent marriage at this early period of his life interrupted his studies and threw him out of his preferment in jesus college of which he had been elected a fellow he was now reduced to difficult circumstances the slender income of a lectureship which he obtained in magdalen college seems to have been the whole of what he now enjoyed but tho it produced him little emolument it tended greatly to increase his reputation his lectures which were considered as ingenious and learned compositions were always attended by a numerous academical audience of every description they were chiefly directed against the romish superstitions he rubbed the galled backs says fuller and curried the lazy hides of many an idle and ignorant friar i know not that these expressions give us a just idea of mr cranmers talents they imply a sarcastic manner which was not his strong sense and argument were the only weapons he employed  he had scarce been married a year when his wife died and such was his reputation in the university and particularly in his own college that on this event he was reelected into his former station  he had soon an opportunity of showing his gratitude some agents of cardinal woolsey being employed to draw together a body of learned men from both the universities to fill the college of christchurch in oxford which that prelate had just founded mr cranmer among others was applied to but he did not care to leave his old friends to whom he had been lately so much obliged tho a better income was offered and a more promising road to preferment  in the year      strype is mistaken in fixing it in      he took the degree of doctor in divinity the scripturists it is evident had great influence in the university at this time as we find dr cranmer appointed one of the examiners in theology  in this situation he did very eminent service to religion by allowing no student to proceed to his degree who did not appear to be well acquainted with the scriptures his strictness however was tempered with so much gentleness and benignity that the disappointed candidate unless a very disingenuous man plainly saw that the examiners conscience drew from him a reluctant severity  the university however soon felt the good effects of dr cranmers attention the young divines caught a new object of pursuit and entirely changed their mode of study he would often afterward say that in the course of his life he had met with many eminent scholars who had told him with great ingenuity how much they thought themselves obliged to him for the check he had formerly given them at cambridge had it not been for that they would add we might have persisted all our lives in our early prejudices  sect ii while dr cranmer was thus employed about the year      an epidemical distemper attended with many symptoms like the plague broke out at cambridge a great alarm was spread the schools were shut up and every man endeavored to provide for his own safety by flight dr cranmer retired into essex to the house of mr cressy a gentleman of fortune at waltham whose sons had been his pupils at cambridge and whose education he still continued to superintend these circumstances were the foundation of all his future fortunes  that great ecclesiastical cause king henrys divorce was at this time in agitation the legatine court which should have decided that business was just dissolved and had left the affair in its old uncertainty  henrys devotion to the sea of rome had made him thus far submit with patience to its delays but his eyes were now in a great measure opened he began to see that clement whose character was a compound of dissimulation and timidity had been acting a double part and that while he openly pretended every thing in favor of the divorce he was in fact no other than the dupe of the emperor with this clue the english ministry was able to unravel the mazes of the popes duplicity and this last affair the dissolution of the legatine court and the avocation of the cause to rome after so many affected delays at length convinced even henry himself that the pope meant nothing in earnest  while the monarch vexed at this new disappointment was revolving in his mind the indignities he had suffered he relaxed himself with a short journey or progress as these journeys were then called through some of the southern counties on his return he spent a night at waltham where his retinue as was usual on such occasions were lodged among the neighboring gentlemen fox provost of kings college in cambridge and gardener afterward the celebrated bishop of winchester then attended the king and were invited with some others to the house of mr cressy where they passed the evening with dr cranmer the conversation turned on the only topic which was then discussed among courtiers the unhandsome behavior of the court of rome and on all sides the popes dissimulation and the kings forbearance were spoken of with acrimony and admiration  dr cranmer who seemed to have digested the whole business in his mind said he thought a method might be pursued which would tend to bring the matter to a happy issue when all with great eagerness desired to know what he meant he told them his idea was to collect the opinions of all the universities in europe on this simple question whether it was lawful to marry a brothers wife their approbation of the marriage he said would satisfy the kings scruples or their disapprobation of it would bring the pope to a decision  dr cranmers opinion seemed very plausible both to fox and gardener who failed not the next morning to mention it to the king it struck henry at once who with that indelicacy which was natural to him cried out with an oath that cranmer had gotten the right sow by the ear  he was immediately sent for and had a long conference with the king which ended in henrys commands to put his sentiments in writing both with regard to the divorce itself and the manner in which he proposed to conduct it  the great merit of dr cranmers proposal which is not immediately evident seems to consist not so much in changing the judges as in narrowing the question instead of inquiring whether the popes dispensation gave legality to henrys marriage with his brothers wife he wished to inquire simply whether such a marriage was not contradictory to the divine commands if the universities determined that it was not so the king must then give up his scruples and keep his wife of this however he was under no apprehension but if the universities determined that such a marriage was unlawful the king might then if the pope were refractory do without him saying the marriage was in itself null  henry therefore being resolved to adopt this new plan began next to adjust the proper mode of executing it he read dr cranmers papers with great attention and was persuaded that he who had shown himself so much a master of the case was the only person in whose management of it he could thoroughly confide at the same time he thought an obscure ecclesiastic had not dignity of character enough to represent his person abroad he joined therefore in commission with him the earl of wiltshire and the bishop of london recommending him in a particular manner to the friendship of the former  the earl of wiltshire with whom dr cranmer ever afterward maintained a strict friendship was one of the greatest ornaments of the english court in a public character he had appeared to advantage once in spain and a second time in germany at home he had borne with equal credit the offices of treasurer of the household and lord privy seal in private life his manners were very amiable he was one of the most learned men of his age and one of the best philosophers and tho a courtier and a statesman had employed much of his time in the study of the scriptures which he made the rule of his life to his request it was owing that erasmus composed his valuable treatise on a preparation for death but what still made this excellent man more celebrated than all his virtues was his being the father of ann bolleyn who was at this time well known to be the intended consort of henry  in the year    0 the three commissioners set out on this extraordinary occasion bending their course first to italy where they found success in some of the universities which were even dependent on the pope dr cranmer offered to dispute the matter fairly in the rota  the pope at first was very angry declaring to those about him that he would not suffer his power to be discussed by friars alluding probably to the undignified character of dr cranmer but finding afterward of what consequence he was he became very desirous of attaching him to his interest and with this view conferred on him the office of penitentiarygeneral of england with full powers to bind and loose dr cranmer could not avoid accepting the popes favor but as it was a power he never meant to use he considered it as a very insignificant sinecure  at the end of the first year the three delegates having traversed the universities of italy the commission was dissolved and a new one made out directed solely to dr cranmer who was styled consiliarius regis et ad caesarem orator it bears date january         no disgust seems to have been taken at the other commissioners but as dr cranmer was the person on whom the king chiefly relied it is probable he had from the first determined to entrust the matter solely to him as soon as his character had acquired a little consequence  very great success attended his commission few scruples were raised and he had little more to do than to collect the hands and seals of such universities as favored the kings intentions which were on the matter almost all he applied to  this expedition so readily projected and so cheerfully undertaken does not perhaps place dr cranmer in the most advantageous point of light there were good political reasons no doubt to induce the king to wish for a divorce his marriage with catharine was by no means generally approved either at home or abroad the legitimacy of mary in treaties of marriage with neighboring princes had been questioned and the terrible effects of the late civil wars in england occasioned by disputed titles were wounds not yet entirely healed male issue to the king which might prevent such consequences was therefore very desirable to all men  but reasons of state however admissible in a cabinet should never be supposed to influence a churchman we allow that dr cranmer might think the marriage wrong but tho it possibly might be a point of conscience with the king it could however be none with him and there was manifestly a difference between advising not to do a thing and advising to undo it when already done at least in a matter of so disputable a nature he knew that in the old testament the marriage of a sister was allowed and among the patriarchs often practiced and that the marriage of a brothers wife was in some cases enjoined the new testament was silent on the subject there could therefore be no moral turpitude in it nor any thing but the common law and usage of nations to restrain it  on the other hand the baseness and ungenerous behavior which followed the contrary part were evident at sight to repudiate a woman with whom the king had cohabited near twenty years as his wife and to illegitimate a daughter bred up in the highest expectations and now marriagable were acts of such cruelty that it seems to indicate a want of feeling to be in any degree accessory to them to this may be added that the notoriety of the kings passion for ann bolleyn which all men believed to be  if not the first mover at least the principal spring of his pretended scruples threw a very indelicate imputation on all who had any concern in the affair no serious churchman one would imagine could be fond of the idea of administering to the kings passions it is with concern therefore that we see a man of dr cranmers integrity and simplicity of manners acting so much out of character as to compound an affair of this kind if not with his conscience at least with all delicacy of sentiment and to parade through europe in the quality of an ambassador defending every where the kings pious intentions  but the cause animated him with the illegality of the kings marriage he endeavored virtually to establish the insufficiency of the popes dispensation and the latter was an argument so near his heart that it seems to have added merit to the former we cannot indeed account for his embarking so zealously in this business without supposing his principal motive was to free his country from the tyranny of rome to which this step very evidently led so desirable an end would in some degree he might imagine sanctify the means  this was not the only foreign business in which dr cranmer was employed he was entrusted with many private dispatches from the king he had matters of trade also to negotiate for the merchants of england once he was obliged to furnish himself with campequipage and attend the emperor who had taken the field against the turks in every employment he showed himself to be a man whose knowledge was by no means totally confined to his profession but was of a more general cast than the simplicity of his character led men to suppose  if dr cranmer began to think favorably of the reformation before he left england he became during his stay abroad an entire convert that freedom with which men discussed religious opinions in germany was very agreeable to a man of his liberal turn and he felt himself every day sitting looser to those prejudices which had hitherto involved him osiander whom he found at nuremburgh contributed among others very much to inlighten his mind the unrestrained conversation of this reformer appeared to him at first as a kind of libertinism it sounded harshly in his ear and he would ask if such an opinion were false how it could possibly possess itself of the minds of the greatest and most learned men of all ages through such a tract of time osiander carried him boldly still higher into antiquity tell me not said he what austin says and jerome but what peter says and paul read your bible and say honestly whether such and such doctrines are not plainly repugnant to such and such passages of scripture  sect iii in the midst of these researches the attention of dr cranmer was suddenly recalled to other objects he received a message informing him that the king intended to reward his services by bestowing on him the sea of canterbury then vacant by the death of dr warham  whatever exalted ideas dr cranmer might entertain from the kings favor it is very certain he was both surprised and perplexed at this message two things especially occurred to him as matter of great difficulty the first was the oath he was obliged to take to the pope which appeared to him as an insuperable obstacle the other was a more private concern he had engaged abroad in a second marriage and however liberal his own sentiments might be on that subject he knew the prejudices of the world ran strongly against him i call them prejudices only because i think it does not appear that the secular clergy at that time were absolutely required to take the vow of celibacy  whether he urged his scruples to the king who in a matrimonial business could not surely be a rigid casuist does not appear it is certain however that the affair of the marriage was made easy to him and that the kings message brought him immediately to england history does not fix the time of his return with any precision lord herbert says he was present at the kings marriage with ann bolleyn which the latest accounts celebrate on the   th of january      archbishop parker says he actually performed the ceremony fox says it was impossible for he was certainly then in germany the controversy is scarce worth deciding  in however contemptible a light the popes authority was at this time considered the new archbishop it seems could not legally be consecrated without bulls from rome henry it may be imagined might have dispensed with this form but to get rid of forms is often the last work of reformation the price of the commodity however was greatly fallen the popes formerly exacted more than a thousand pounds of our money for their bulls of consecration but the new archbishop or rather the king who seems to have managed the matter contrived to procure them for less than half that sum  with regard to the oath of fidelity to the pope which the archbishop was obliged to take at his consecration he protested that he took it in no sense but such as was wholly consistent with the laws of god  the kings prerogative  and the statutes of the realm  that he did not bind himself from speaking his mind freely in matters of religion  the government of the church and the rights of the crown  and that he meant on all occasions to oppose the popes illegal authority and condemn his errors  this oath taken in a sense so very opposite to its real intention has often been alleged against the archbishop and indeed it seems rather to injure the feelings of a delicate mind his friends however suppose they sufficiently apologize for his behavior by observing that he made his exceptions in an open manner without any mental reservation and that he fully satisfied those who were empowered to administer the oath  thus was a private churchman raised at one step to the first dignity of his profession and tho the truth of history has obliged us to confess that he took some steps not quite so direct as might be wished in this hasty advancement yet we cannot by any means consider him as a man who had formed any settled plans of ambition which he was resolved at all hazards to support but that in what he did amiss he was rather violently borne down by the kings authority his mildness and simplicity were unequally matched with the impetuosity of henry who having no scruples of his own considered little the scruples of others to this may be added that the primate thought himself strongly attached by gratitude to his prince and indeed the errors of this excellent person as we shall have other occasions to observe were less owing to the temptations of vice than to the weakness of some unguarded virtue  thus much at least may be said in apology for those parts of his conduct at this time which seem rather to require one  as to the king his placing so good a man at the head of the church deserves little praise if we may judge from the general tenor of his character which was throughout unprincipled and inconsistent he meant nothing more than to advance a man who had shown himself so ready a casuist and was able to take so vigorous a part against the church of rome which henry was at this time determined to oppose  very soon after his consecration the primate was called on to finish the great cause of the divorce by passing a final sentence  the queen had retired to ampthill a royal mansion near st albans where she lived with great discretion and drew the pity and respect of the whole nation by the decency and dignity of her sufferings the town of dunstable which lay almost in sight of her windows was appointed by henry with his usual indelicacy as the place where the archbishop and his associates were to sit in consistory as henry well knew the queen would not answer the summons the vicinity of the place being of no consequence had the appearance of an additional affront  the queen treated the summons she received with that indignation which was expected and being pronounced contumacious a final sentence of divorce was passed  there was something also very indelicate in placing the primate at the head of this court as he had already taken so principal a part in the cause it gave great offense to the queen and shocked the archbishop himself but henry who had no idea of decency would hear no reason against it  within a few weeks after the divorce on the  th of september      the princess elizabeth was born and the king ordered the archbishop to be her godfather  sect iv the definitive sentence which had passed in england it may easily be supposed occasioned much clamor at rome where menaces of excommunication in a very lofty tone were thrown out in return the king and the primate joined in an appeal to a general council a theme then very popular both among protestants and papists this appeal they notified to the pope who was then at marseilles it was entrusted to the care of bonner afterward the celebrated bishop of london who executed his commission with his usual vehemence the incensed pope on the other hand equally impetuous talked of throwing the minister headlong into a cauldron of molten lead on which bonner alarmed at the idea precipitately retired  francis i was at this time joined in bonds of strictest amity with england the part which henry had taken in the affairs of europe after the fatal battle of pavia had rivetted the generous heart of the french monarch to him with more than political friendship francis had seen with real concern the progress of the breach between henry and the sea of rome and had resolved to take this opportunity of an interview with the pope to endeavor to repay his obligations to the king of england by bringing his disagreeable difference with the pontiff if possible to an accommodation he made the attempt but found the pope full of resentment and it was with the utmost difficulty that he at length prevailed on him to promise that henry might still expect a favorable sentence from the conclave if he would make his submission before a short day which was appointed but this was only half the obstacle henry was as lofty as the pope and could as ill brook submission as the other could bear control  there happened to be in the french kings retinue at marseilles a churchman of very eminent abilities bellay bishop of bayonne an accidental circumstance had just thrown the eyes of all men upon him the night before the pope made his public entrance it was discovered that the president of the parliament who had been appointed to receive him with a latin oration had unluckily chosen a subject which would certainly give the pontiff offense and yet there was no time for a new composition in this article of extremity when the whole business of the ceremonial was deranged bellay offered his service to speak extempore and did it with such uncommon propriety and elegance that he was marked from that time as a man of the first genius in france  this person the french king made choice of to persuade henry into the agreement he had just made with the pope the bishop knew mankind and could adapt himself to their foibles henry was well tinctured with the erudition of those times and affected greatly the character of being a patron of learning bellay knew him thoroughly and drawing the discourse from business to letters would often put him in mind of the great reputation he had in europe for learning and how much the whole catholic cause was indebted to his pen by artfully insinuating these topics he at length engaged henry to accept the accommodation which francis had made for him and to send a courier with his submission to rome  this treaty with the pope was not transacted so secretly but in part it transpired and gave the first alarm to the protestant party whom it entirely convinced of the fickleness of the kings temper and of the slender grounds they had for the certainty even of a bare toleration none was more distressed than the archbishop but with his usual calmness and caution he held his peace and trusted for the protection of religion to that almighty hand which had begun the reformation of it  in this suspense the minds of men remained many weeks and they whose principles waited on every change began already to waver and to talk publicly of the precipitancy of the late innovations which ran the risk of throwing the kingdom into such a serment as could not easily be allayed  at length the long expected courier arrived from rome and produced a new agitation in the minds of men all was now declared to be over and such a breach made with the pope as could never again be healed  the account of the matter was this contrary winds had detained the courier it seems beyond his day the bishop of bayonne who after all his services in england had himself undertaken a voyage to rome to negotiate with the pope pressed his holiness to make some allowance for the uncertainty and danger of winds and seas especially as it was then in the depth of winter and to suspend a definitive sentence for one week only but the emperors influence and the popes own irascible temper prevailed for hastier measures nay even the usual forms of business were accelerated and after a shorter hearing than in such a case was commonly allowed a definitive sentence was passed confirming the kings marriage with catharine and declaring him excommunicated if he did not put away his present queen  two days after the definitive sentence had passed the kings submission arrived the pope stood aghast but it was now too late the sentence could not be reviewed the cardinals of the opposition holding firm to the established rules of the conclave  if any event could authorize man to point out the immediate finger of god this certainly might  many historians have entertained doubts of the kings sincerity in this business and it is certain the parliament at this time was beginning to take measures not very agreeable to the popish interest but however this may be reconciled it is difficult to say what henrys meaning could be if it was not pure he had already felt his own strength and was under no necessity either to amuse or temporize nor was duplicity among those faults which are commonly laid to his charge  while affairs with the court of rome were thus depending the emissaries of the popish party allowed themselves unbridled license in england we are amazed that such a prince as henry could bear to be told in his own chapel that unless he restored religion dogs should lick his blood as they had licked the blood of ahab but there was a grossness in the manners of those times which we must carry along with us in all our inquiries into them the actions of men were perhaps more restrained than they are now their tongues were certainly more licentious and henry who had no idea of delicacy himself was less offended than might be imagined at the gross indelicacy of others  but of all the efforts of the popish clergy at this time the delusions of the maid of kent were the most extraordinary this enthusiast falling into artful hands was managed in such a way as to draw the attention of the whole kingdom her prophecies were uttered in very free languages and she poured the vengeance of heaven with a very liberal hand on the king and his abettors her impostures were at length detected and she suffered death with her accomplices  sect v the parliament in the mean time took vigorous measures in support of religious liberty such a spirit was raised in the commons that they debated freely on the great question of the supremacy of the pope  a question which if ever moved before had been always treated with the utmost distance and timidity it was carried however now against the sea of rome with a very high hand  in elder times when parliaments questioned only some exorbitant claim of the pope  his power to raise money in england or to confer benefices on foreigners however spirited such inquiries appeared at the time posterity saw they had been carried on without foresight a few branches might be lopped off but as the trunk itself was left standing it was able at the returning season to shoot as vigorously as before  one would have imagined that an act so destructive of popery as the act of supremacy would at least have been retarded by some dissenting voices among so many who were friends to the sea of rome in their hearts but tho it met with opposition yet it was much less opposed than could have been imagined and by few persons of consequence lee of york tunstal of durham and stokesly of london all papists and two of them bigoted acceded to it gardener was even strenuous in its support the realm and the church said he with that subtilty which was characteristic in him consist of the same people and as the king is head of the realm he must therefore be head of the church  this act was obtained chiefly by the abilities of the primate who discovered such a fund of learning and good sense on the question and delivered his sentiments in such a flow of natural and easy eloquence that he silenced opposition and gave his cause all the luster which reason and argument could give  when the prejudices of men began to cool and the consequences of this very important act were seriously considered all sober men of every denomination acknowledged the utility of it they hoped a more orderly clergy would now succeed whose manners might be more easily inspected and whose conduct would be amenable to civil authority they hoped an end would now be put to those contests between the civil and ecclesiastical powers which had often cost the nation so dear they saw a way opened for the redress of many grievances which could not easily approach the court of rome at so remote a distance and so entrenched in forms in short they foresaw a variety of advantages from the simplicity of the government as it was now established and from the abolition of that gross absurdity in every political system an imperium in imperio  the protestants had still farther cause for rejoicing they considered this act as the only thing which could open a way to reformation for tho in itself it had no immediate connection either with doctrine or discipline yet without it no step could be taken toward the reformation of either besides they thought the abrogation of the decretals was a great step toward the introduction of the bible and imagined they should be able through so wide a breach to push out every error and every corruption of the church  when this celebrated act passed another as a kind of appendage to it passed also  the act of succession which settled the crown on the children of the present queen declaring mary the daughter of catharine in effect illegitimate  this act involved in ruin two excellent men fisher bishop of rochester and sir thomas more the parliament had declared the denial of the kings supremacy to be high treason and imposed a testoath to be taken by all people in office and indeed universally if required fisher refused it and more when questioned talked in very ambiguous language he might as well have spoken plainly henry impatient of control considered his ambiguity as guilt the primate labored with every application of his interest and talents to preserve these victims of lawless power with more he had lived on terms of great familiarity and was prompted to employ even casuistry to save him on one hand said he you are doubtful as to the point in question on the other you are certain you ought to obey your prince let doubt then give way to certainty  more smiled and laid his head upon the block  this was not the only innocent blood which was shed at this time that queen for whose sake henry had put away a wife with whom he had lived twenty years was herself in little more than three become the object of his aversion and was condemned to death on the merest surmise a few unguarded expressions were the utmost that could be proved against her she was a lady of a gay and lively temper and in such dispositions little verbal levities are not only consistent with the purest manners but even sometimes perhaps indicative of them henry however wished not to find her innocent and indiscretion had the force of crime  among the many suspicious circumstances which attended this very mysterious affair it was not one of the least that during the discussion of it the archbishop was directed by an order from the king to keep his house at lambeth the popish party were universally bent against the queen and it was supposed were afraid of the primates interposition and influence  henry however when it served his purpose introduced him as an actor in the affair the life of the queen was not all the king aimed at her daughter the lady elizabeth must also be declared illegitimate to make way for the posterity of his future consort to this end he resolved on the strength of some surmise of a precontract to be divorced from her before he put her to death but tho the earl of northumberland who was supposed to be the other party made the most solemn allegations that no such contract had ever existed yet the king was determined she should be found guilty and the archbishop was to be his instrument to him it is said the queen made a private confession of her crimes and the comment of history on her confession is that having been sentenced to be burnt or beheaded as the king pleased she was terrified into a consession to avoid the more rigorous part of the sentence on the strength however of this confession the archbishop passed a sentence of divorce  immediately after this sentence she was beheaded and the king void of every idea not only of feeling but of decency the very next day married jane seymour by this precipitancy however he made a better apology for the unfortunate ann bolleyn than the most zealous of her advocates could have done  when we consider the whole of this black affair  the want of legal evidence to prove any crime  yet a sentence of death passed in consequence of that insufficient proof  a precontract supposed which was to void the marriage  and yet the crime of adultery still charged  the terrifying mode of the sentence  and above all the kings known attachment to another lady  we are surprised to find a man of the archbishops character submitting in any shape to be an actor in so complicated a scene of barbarism cruelty absurdity and injustice the confession had certainly all the appearance of being extorted  by both parties the contract was denied on oath  and if both parties had even confessed it it is probable that the archbishop might have found strong arguments to prove in any other instance that a consummated marriage was a more inviolable bond than a precontract and still more so if the parties first contracting had given up their mutual vows the whole in short has the appearance of a dishonest submission to a tyrants passions and we can apologize for it only as we have done for some other of this prelates compliances by supposing that his meekness was violently borne down by the kings impetuosity  indeed the plenitude of a kings power was never so thoroughly impressed on the minds of men as in this reign tho it took in future reigns as far as such jargon can do a more systemized form the vox dei which was afterward too freely supposed to issue from the people was however now supposed to issue solely from the throne when therefore we find these great condescensions to a prince in men of eminent characters we must not measure them by the liberal notions of later times but must make some allowances for those high ideas of kingly power which prevailed in those periods in which they lived  it is true we are told the primate made a spirited application to the king in the queens favor but on this apology it is probable none of his advocates will be very forward to expatiate the more innocent he thought her the more guilty he must think himself  how far his acting ex officio was an apology let those define who think themselves obliged to perform the functions of an office which requires unlawful deeds  sect vi queen anns death was considered by the popish party as the signal of victory they had little conception that the protestants could unite under any other leader who could have interest with the king but they formed a wrong judgment and had the mortification to see the primates influence in no degree diminished all therefore who wished well to a reformation looked up to him as the only person who was capable of conducting it and indeed he was every way qualified to answer their wishes by prudent caution discrete forbearance and pure simplicity of manners he was able to oppose and counteract the designs of some of the most artful men of his time for there are seasons when simplicity will have the advantage of art and will mislead even the designing man who judging from his own feelings considers a plain and open behavior as a mask  it was very necessary indeed that the protestant cause should have at least one able leader for except the archbishop himself there was not a man who favored it and had the power to conduct it the earl of essex it is true who was then secretary of state was a man of great ability no one had taken a juster measure of the times or understood with more exactness that difficult part of the ministerial office the management of parties but essex sat at another helm which called for all his address and he could rarely assist the archbishop however wellinclined except when the affairs of the church coincided with the business of the state nor was he enough acquainted with theological matters to give a consequential opinion in any of the intended alterations of religion  among the bishops of those times who favored the reformation were latimer bishop of worcester shaxton of salisbury and barlow of st davids these were the primates natural coadjutors but none of them was able to give him any material assistance  latimer possessed every virtue that could adorn a christian prelate no man opposed vice more successfully or kept the clergy of his diocese in better order but in traversing the arts of party he had no address perfectly sincere himself he had little comprehension of the duplicity of others and seemed to think that nothing was requisite to give either a party or an individual a proper direction but a genuine display of truth he considered only what was right to be done not what the times could bear  shaxton had lived more in the world than latimer but was still a worse associate to the archbishop he had an unaccommodating sourness about him which was continually taking or giving offense his moroseness was marked strongly in the lines of his visage which almost prejudiced men at sight against every proposal he could make nor was he without a tincture of pride and self importance which are bad in any man worse in a churchman and worst of all in a reformer  barlow was as little depended on by the archbishop as either of the other he was a man of sense and learning but was so indiscrete so totally unguarded and his conversation so full of levity that the primate was always afraid of any communication with him on matters of business and would sometimes say on coming to the conclusion of a long debate this is all very true but my brother barlow in half an hour will teach the world to believe it is but a jest  perhaps indeed it was not to be regretted that the primate had no associate under the wise councils of one prudent man the arduous business of reformation probably prospered better than it could have done in the hands of many in the whole system of human affairs it is certainly the nicest point to conduct the religious opinions of the public the more quietly and gently every change is introduced the better altercation is fatal to the attempt and altercation is generally found in a multiplicity of voices a multiplicity of opinions succeeds a multiplicity of voices the passions armed with religious zeal soon enter the lists and all is presently confusion  the wisdom and decisive judgment of a single leader prevented this by attending carefully to times and seasons and throwing out only such innovations as he found men were able to bear the prudent archbishop introduced imperceptibly the most consequential changes  his difficulties however were very great to form a religious establishment out of the general confusion in which all things were now involved appeared a work of infinite perplexity that flux of opinions which the reformation occasioned was an endless source of discord and the more men receded from that central point of authority which had drawn them together the wider they spread from each other every man had his favorite tenet in which he thought the sum of christianity consisted little sects began to form themselves and the primate soon found how impossible it was to impress the large idea of religion upon the narrow mind of party  the same diversity of opinion which distracted the people was found among the leaders every one had his own creed and the mischief was that no man thought it a hardship to impose his own creed on others some thought the ceremonies only of the romish church were antichristian and adhered with firmness to its doctrines others rejected the doctrines but were dazzled with the splendour of its ceremonies some again thought it prudent as a conciliating measure to retain every thing that could be retained with innocence while others cried out loudly for utter extirpation and thought the farther they got from popery the nearer they advanced to truth  the difficulties in the way of reformation which arose thus from the different opinions of protestants were still greatly increased by the opposition of papists this large body of men it may easily be imagined were more than ordinarily inflamed by the turn which affairs were likely to take against them if they were before formidable for their numbers they now became more so when embodied in a suffering cause supporting one common end and availing themselves of all those arts which are generally made use of by the instruments of declining party among these arts the most obvious and the most effectual was to soment jealousy and discord among the various sectaries of the new religion to which of themselves they were sufficiently inclined  but the difficulties which arose from the popish party would have been more easily surmounted if the king had not been at its head the fame which henry had acquired as defender of the faith had invariably attached his haughty mind to the doctrines of popery the supremacy indeed slattered his ambition and he was glad as far as that was an object to coincide with the circumstances of the times but he was careful to have it believed that he was no convert to the opinions of the new faith and that his heart had not received the least impression against the religion of his forefathers whatever advantage therefore the protestants gained during this reign they were entirely indebted for it either to the pride the caprice or the interest of the king  amidst all these difficulties the archbishop endeavored gradually to mature in his own breast every part of the great scheme he had in view before he ventured to bring it forward  he began in the spirit of equity with redressing the abuses of his own courts tho together with these abuses he retrenched his own sees and those of his officers this gave the public an early and favorable impression of his designs  the great number of idle holidays with which the calendar was charged became the next object of his censure the archbishop himself to the astonishment of those around him sat down to a hot supper on the eve of st thomas of canterbury as these holidays interfered with feed time and harvest it was generally not unpopular to abolish them  it was popular also as well as highly necessary to regulate the public discourses of the clergy the pulpit eloquence indeed of that time was little more than a gross attempt to exalt the power of the church the good archbishop saw its abuse and endeavored to make it the vehicle of instruction but the regulations he yet made were few  with his usual caution he felt his ground as he proceeded and it was not till long afterward that he completed his intention on this head by the publication of the homilies  how exceedingly a reformation in preaching was wanted we may judge from the following extracts from sermons which we may suppose were the best the times produced as they were thought worthy of being made public  in one of these sermons the priest inveighing against irreverence to the ministers of religion tells the following story st austin says he saw two women prating together in the popes chapel and the fiend sitting in their necks writing a long roll of what the women said presently letting it fall st austin took it up and asking the women what they had said they answered only a few paternosters then st austin read the bill and there was never a good word in it  in another sermon we are told that four men had stolen an abbots ox the abbot did a sentence and cursed them three of them were shriven and asked mercy the fourth died without being absolved so when he was dead his spirit walked by night and scared all who stirred from their houses after sun set it happened that once as a priest went in the night with gods body to a sick man the spirit met him and told him who he was and why he walked and prayed the priest to tell his wife to make amends to the abbot that he might absolve him for he could have no rest till then so this was done and the poor soul at length went to rest  in a sermon upon the mass the people are told that among the benefits arising from it on the day they hear it all idle oaths and forgotten sins shall be forgiven on that day they shall not lose their sight nor die a sudden death nor wax aged and every step thitherward and homeward an angel shall reckon  the immediate tendency of such discourses was obvious  sect vii thus far the primate however cautious ventured with less hesitation what he had yet done was little more than fell under his own proper authority but it required more address to strip the popular opinions of the times of that error and absurdity which adhered to them some steps however were taken which at least narrowed a few of the grossest of the popish doctrines  tradition was not expresslly disavowed but the bible and creeds were made the rule of faith  images were not forbidden but the people were instructed to consider them only as incentives of devotion  prayers to saints were allowed but christs sole mediation with the father was insisted on  sprinkling holy water scattering ashes and creeping to the cross were tolerated but the people were assured they made no atonement for sin  the existence of purgatory was not disputed but all indulgences and mercenary pardons were declared invalid  how far indeed the archbishop himself was enlightened cannot easily be known at this day but it is probable that whatever had been his own private opinions he would not have ventured farther in public than he now did  the doctrine of transubstantiation was left precisely as it stood our ecclesiastical writers all agree that the primate himself held that opinion till within a few years of his death which is the more surprising as wicliff near two centuries before had said much to bring it into discredit how firmly attached the primate was to it at this time appeared on the following occasion  john lambert a man of eminent piety having denied the real presence was cited before the archbishop who with a mixture of mildness and gravity expostulated with him on his maintaining so unscriptural an error lambert retired modestly but it appearing afterward that he was not converted the affair was carried before the king the king resolving himself to confute so notorious a heretic cited him to enter into free debate on the subject the royal pedant entered the place of combat surrounded by his bishops and nobles the archbishop sat at his right hand and assisted at this very extraordinary disputation lambert being confounded with an assembly so little suited to the freedom of debate yielded an easy victory to the king who triumphing over him in the true spirit of a polemic condemned him to the stake we do not find that the archbishop took any part in his death it were to be wished he had rid his hands of the disputation likewise  the primate showed the same attachment to the doctrine of transubstantiation on another occasion vadian a learned foreigner having written a treatise against the corporeal presence thought it a proper work for the archbishop of canterbury to patronize and presented it to him concluding that his graces opinions on that subject were as liberal as his own but the archbishop was not a little displeased he informed vadian that his book had not made a convert of him and that he was hurt with the idea of being thought the patron of such unscriptural opinions  in the year      the archbishop finished a great work which he had long had in hand the printing of an english bible  wicliff was the first englishman who undertook to render the holy scriptures into his native tongue but wicliffs translation was now obsolete and to be found only as a matter of curiosity in a few libraries in the year      tindal translated and printed the new testament in the low countries but his translation which was rather a hasty performance was very incorrect and nobody was more sensible of its deficiences than tindal himself he was public spirited enough to have amended the faults of it by a new edition but his finances were too scanty for such an undertaking the zeal of tunstal bishop of durham furnished him the means tunstal tho a papist was the most moderate of men and being desirous of removing a stumbling block as quietly as possible he privately bought up the whole impression at his own expense and burnt it a copy of this impression supposed to be the only copy remaining was picked up by one of the late lord oxfords collectors and was esteemed so valuable a purchase by his lordship that it is said he settled  0l a year for life on the person who procured it lord oxfords library being afterward purchased by osborn at greys inn gate this curious book was marked by the undiscerning bookseller at fifteen shillings only at which price mr ames bought it when mr amess books were offered to the public by mr langford in may    0 this book was sold by auction for fourteen guineas and a half in whose hands it is now i have not heard  this money being returned into tindals hands enabled him to republish his work in a more correct form by the great industry however of the popish party this edition also was in a good measure suppressed and indeed it was at best an inaccurate translation being the performance only of a single man who labored also under many disadvantages  this version however inaccurate as it was the archbishop made the basis of the work he now intended and the method he took was to send portions of it to be corrected by the bishops and other learned divines reserving to himself the revisal of the whole  stokesley bishop of london was the only prelate who refused his contribution it is no wonder said one of the archbishops chaplains with more humor than charity that my lord of london refuses to have any hand in this business it is a testament in which he knows well he has no legacy this bible through the means of the lord essex was licensed by the king and fixed to a desk in all parochial churches  the ardour with which we are informed men flocked to read it is incredible they who could purchased it and they who could not crowded to read it or to hear it read in churches where it was common to see little assemblies of mechanics meeting together for that purpose after the labor of the day many even learned to read in their old age that they might have the pleasure of instructing themselves from the scriptures mr fox mentions two apprentices who joined each his little stock and bought a bible which at every interval of leisure they read but being afraid of their master who was a zealous papist they kept it under the straw of their bed such was the ecstasy of joy with which this blessing was received at that time  when it was uncommon  soon afterward under the authority of convocation the archbishop took a farther step the creed the lords prayer and the ten commandments were allowed to be taught in english a plain exposition also of the more obvious points of faith and practice was published in a treatise which was generally called the bishops book from the hands through which it went its real title was the institution of a christian man it was afterward enlarged and published under the royal license and then became the kings book  these were the principal steps which the archbishop took in the business of reformation  all taken between the years      and      his difficult circumstances allowed no more it is wonderful indeed he did so much for except in the matters of supremacy and transubstantiation the king and he had very different sentiments on every topic of religion and the passions of henry those gusts of whirlwind made it dangerous for any one to oppose him but the archbishop tho he tried this hardy experiment oftener than once never lost his favor  in the business of monasteries he risked it most  henry had already laid his rapacious hands on some of the smaller houses and finding the prey alluring he determined to make a second and more daring attempt the larger houses afforded his avarice a more ample range the affair was brought into parliament and men seemed to think they were at liberty to speak their opinions freely they agreed that the wealth of the church was a dead weight on the nation  that it debauched the clergy and drained the people  and that it was just and right to lay public hands on this useless mass of treasure  at the same time having been shocked at seeing the king appropriate to himself as he had lately done the piety of ages or lavish it in wanton donations on the avarice of his courtiers they cried let us strip the clergy of their wealth but let us pass a law that it may be employed in some national service  of the party which held this language the archbihop was at the head with great earnestness he spoke in this cause and proposed various schemes for throwing this mass of sacred treasure into some useful channel he mentioned the endowment of schools the maintenance of scholars at the universities the foundation of hospitals and almshouses nay rather said he than suffer it to be consumed in private channels let us expend it on high roads  one of his schemes was new and seems to have been happily conceived he proposed to institute colleges of priests in every cathedral composed of students just removed and well recommended from the universities here they were to apply themselves to divinity under the eye of the bishops who being thus acquainted with their worth and abilities might collate them from these seminaries to parochial charges  but this and all his other beneficial schemes were overruled the king was determined to apply this wealth to other uses and hinted his intentions to the house in a very intelligible manner the royal hint gave a sudden change to the deliberations of parliament every man trembled at the idea of opposition simple terror effected then what venality has since effected essex immediately gave way the boldest speakers were silent the primates was the last mouth which opened in this cause  his honest zeal showed the goodness of his heart and that was the reward of his labor  sect viii the opposition which the king met with in this business from the protestant party is thought by many historians to have lessened the archbishops influence and to have thrown weight at this time into the opposite scale it is certain the bishop of winchester and other leaders of the popish party began now to assume unusual spirits and to appear with more importance at court  the bishop of winchester was one of those motley ministers half statesman and half ecclesiastic which were common in those needy times when the revenues of the church were necessary to support the servants of the crown it was an invidious support and often fastened the odium of an indecorum on the kings ministers who had as ministers always have opposition enough to parry in the common course of business and it is very probable that gardener on this very ground has met with harder measure in history than he might otherwise have done  he is represented as having nothing of a churchman about him but the name of a bishop he had been bred to business from his earliest youth and was thoroughly versed in all the wiles of men considered either as individuals or embodied in parties he knew all the modes of access to every foible of the human heart his own in the mean time dark and impenetrable he was a man who as lloyd quaintly says was to be traced like the fox and like the hebrew to be read backwards and tho the insidious cast of his eye indicated that he was always lying in wait yet his strong sense and persuasive manner inclined men to believe he was always sincere as better reasons could hardly be given than he had ready on every occasion he was as little troubled with scruples as any man who thought it not proper entirely to throw off decency what moral virtues and what natural feelings he had were all under the influence of ambition and were accompanied by a happy lubricity of conscience which ran glibly over every obstacle  such is the portrait which historians have given us of this man and tho the coloring may be more heightened in some than in others yet the same turn of feature is found in all  this prelate being at the head of the popish party and aided by the duke of norfolks influence thought he had now an opportunity to strike a blow which might be fatal to the protestant cause the times favoring him he insinuated to the king that the measures he was now pursuing had placed him in a very precarious situation with regard to foreign powers  that the german protestants would in all probability be crushed  and that if this should be the case it was very likely from the temper and situation of men and things that his majesty would see a very formidable league excited against him by the popish princes  that it was prudent at least to guard against such an event  and that it might easily be done by enacting some laws in favor of the old religion which might show christendom that he had not set his face against the church but only against the supremacy of the pope  this language in a prudential light was more than plausible and it had its full effect on henry especially as it coincided with his own apprehensions for the enterprizing spirit of charles v then in league with the pope seemed to be carrying every thing with a full tide of success in germany and to have nothing so much in contemplation as to reestablish through europe the spiritual dominion of the pope  an alteration in the public faith was then a matter of easy decision the kings inclination alone was sufficient to enforce it the duke of norfolk therefore as had been agreed informed the house of the kings wish to show his regard to the old religion and as it would be agreeable to his majesty to have every body think as he did the duke presumed that nobody wished to think otherwise  the kings ideas were received with reverence and the whole house became immediately zealous papists and passed an act which had been framed by gardener in favor of some of the more peculiar doctrines of the roman church  transubstantiation  communion in one kind  vows of chastity  the celibacy of the clergy  private masses  and auricular confession this act which passed in the year      is known by the name of the act of the six articles and was guarded according to the supposed degrees of guilt by fines forfeitures imprisonment and death  the good archbishop never appeared in a more truly christian light than on this occasion in the midst of so general a defection for there were numbers in the house who had hitherto shown great forwardness in reformation he alone made a stand three days he maintained his ground and baffled the arguments of all opposers but argument was not their weapon and the archbishop saw himself obliged to sink under superior power henry ordered him to leave the house the primate refused it was gods cause he said and not mans and when he could do no more he boldly entered his protest  such an instance of fortitude is sufficient to wipe off many of those courtly stains which have fastened on his memory  as the primate himself was a married man it has been said he was particularly interested in this opposition and it is certain that as soon as the act passed he sent his wife who was a niece of osianders into germany but mr strype gives us good reason to believe that his chief objection to any of these articles was the cruelty of the penalties with which they were guarded so alien he thought to the spirit of christianity  it is amazing that the very extraordinary freedom which the archbishop took on this occasion did not entirely ruin him in the kings favor indeed all men expected to have seen him sent immediately to the tower but henrys regard for him was so far from being lessened that he ordered the duke of norfolk with the earl of essex and others to dine with him the next day at lambeth and comfort him as the king phrased it under his disappointment  my lord archbishop said essex you were born in a happy hour you can do nothing amiss were i to do half of what you have done my head must answer it  a prophetic speech as it afterward appeared  this singular visit at lambeth tho so well intended by the king was the source of great mortification to all the conversation after dinner falling on the late ministry and woolseys name being mentioned essex could not forbear drawing a parallel between the archbishop and the cardinal the cardinal said he through the violence of his temper in managing a a debate would often change his friends into enemies whereas the mildness of the archbishop often makes his enemies his friends the duke of norfolk adopted the remark and surely said he with a sarcastic sneer nobody knew the cardinal better than my lord essex who was once his menial essex answered with some warmth that he was not the only person in company who had served the cardinal at least who had shown an inclination to serve him for if fame spoke truth the great duke of norfolk himself had offered to be the cardinals admiral if ever he should attain the papacy the duke of norfolk firing at this started up and with a vehement oath cried out he lied essex preparing to resent the affront the archbishop got up and with the rest of the company interfering composed the quarrel at that time but the duke laid it up in one of those secret chambers of his memory where those affronts are registered which nothing but blood can expiate  the arguments which the archbishop had used in parliament against the act of the six articles had been represented to the king in so strong a light that he expressed a great desire to see them and the archbishop accordingly had them fairly copied out for his inspection the fate of the volume in which they were contained occasioned some perplexity  among the amusements of the english monarchs of those times that of bearbaiting on the river thames was in high esteem in this diversion henry happened to be engaged when the archbishops secretary took boat at lambeth charged with his masters book to westminster the waterman had orders to keep as far as possible from the tumult but whether led by curiosity to see the pastime or through some unavoidable accident he found himself presently in the midst of the crowd and by a mischance still greater the bear making directly to his boat climbed up the side and overset it the secretary was soon taken up but recovering from his surprise he found he had lost his book he hoped it might have sunk to the bottom but he discovered afterward that it had fallen into the hands of some ignorant persons who had conveyed it to a popish priest the priest conceiving it to be a satire on the six articles determined to carry it to the council the secretary in the mean time suspecting what might happen applied to lord essex as his masters friend he had scarce told his story when the priest appeared at the door of the council chamger with the book under his arm lord essex addressing him in an angry tone and telling him that the book belonged to a privycounsellor the priest delivered it up with many humble gesticulations and was glad to get off without farther question  sect ix the act of the six articles was a signal to the whole popish party they now plainly saw their power and had only to exert it properly the parliament and convocation were the scenes of action here the primate almost single opposed them a few of the bishops lent him aid but it was feeble they were either uninterested in the cause or men of no abilities in business one or two of them from whom he expected assistance deserted him but the severest loss he felt at this time was that of his great friend the earl of essex  the interest of that eminent statesman declined with that of the protestants and he paid at the block the penalty of his masters offenses the dissolution of monasteries had given general disgust the alms and hospitality of the monks indiscriminately administered had through a course of ages invited sloth and these channels of ready supply being now stopped the necessitous found it irksome to exchange a life of idleness for a life of industry a general discontent soon finds a mouth to express it clamor grew loud and the kings government uneasy something must necessarily be done  among all the arts of expediency laid up in the cabinets of princes the readiest is to sacrifice a minister the death of cromwell was represented to the king as the best mean of composing the people but tho prudential reasons may necessitate a prince to discard a minister yet guilt only and that nicely examined can authorize an act of blood the hand of a tyrant however generally throws aside the balance it is a nice machine and requires pains and temper to adjust it the sword is an instrument more decisive and of easier dispatch henrys was always stained with blood  often with innocent blood  but never with blood more innocent than that of essex  among the many friends of this great man several of whom had tasted largely of his bounty not a single person endeavored to avert his ruin but the primate he with generous friendship wrote to the king united himself with the falling minister and endeavored at the hazard of his own safety to inspire his royal master with ideas of justice but the fate of essex was decreed and so light a thing as a whisper from the still voice of justice could not avert it  history unites in marking the duke of norfolk and the bishop of winchester as the secret contrivers of this base affair  the primate and essex had ever maintained a uniform friendship for each other through every period of their power it was a friendship pure from jealousy on both sides amidst all the jarrings of court faction nothing ever disturbed it each knew the integrity of the others intentions and each supported the others schemes with an exertion of all his interest in some things perhaps the zeal of essex for his friend was apt to carry him too far and the primate had oftener than once occasion to repress it  a priest near scarborough sitting among his companions over his beer at the door of a country alehouse and somebody happening to mention the archbishop that man said the priest as great as he is now was once but an ostler and has no more learning than the goslings yonder on the green essex who had his spies in every quarter was informed of what the priest had said a messenger was immediately dispatched for him and he was lodged in the fleet  some months elapsed when the archbishop who was entirely ignorant of the affair received a petition from the poor priest full of penitence for his imprudence and of supplication for mercy  the primate having inquired into the business sent for him i hear said he you have accused me of many things and among others of my being a very ignorant man you have now an opportunity of setting your neighbors right in this matter and may examine me if you please  the priest in great confusion besought his grace to pardon him he never would offend in the same way again  well then says the archbishop since you will not examine me let me examine you  the priest was thunderstruck making many excuses and owning he was not much learned in bookmatters  the archbishop told him he should not then go very deep and asked him two or three of the plainest questions in the bible who was davids father and who was solomons  the priest confused at his own ignorance stood speechless  you see said the archbishop how your accusation of me rises against yourself you are an admirable judge of learning and learned men  well my friend i had no hand in bringing you here and have no desire to keep you get home and if you are an ignorant man learn at least to be an honest one  soon after the earl of essex came to the primate and with some warmth told him he might for the future fight his own battles  that he had intended to to have made the priest do penance at pauls cross but his graces misjudged lenity had prevented him  my good lord said the primate taking him by the hand be not offended i have examined the man myself and be assured from me he is neither worth your notice nor mine  notwithstanding however the loss of his great associate the archbishop did not despair an attempt was made in convocation to revive some popish ceremonies a sort of ritual was produced which consisted of ninety articles the archbishop unaided went through the whole and reasoned with such strength of argument as brought over many to his opinion whom he could not convince he silenced  the next field in which he appeared was the house of lords where he himself made the attack by bringing in a bill to mitigate the penalties of the six articles this was a bold attempt and drew on him the whole force of opposition the bishops of rochester and hereford who had promised to assist him gave way as the debate grew warm and begged the archbishop to follow their example it was in vain they told him to persist he could not benefit his cause but he might ruin himself the archbishop with that spirit which he always exerted where religion was concerned declared himself careless of any consequence  his perseverance had an effect which he durst not have hoped for the laity were entirely exempted from the penalties of the act and the clergy were in no danger till after the third conviction the primate obtained also that no offenses should be cognizable after they had lain dormant a year it is not improbable that he was indebted for this victory to the book which he had sent to the king the rigor of whose opinions it might in some degree have qualified  in another effort also the primate obtained an advantage he prevailed with the king to allow the use of a few prayers in the english tongue which was the first attempt of the kind that had been made  on the other hand he had the mortification to see the use of the bible taken away winchester brought the affair into convocation in the debate which ensued the translation was chiefly objected to let the people have their bible said winchester but let it be a correct one and let not error and heresy be spread by authority he proposed therefore to have the bible carefully examined and with this view to have it put into the hands of the bishops where he doubted not he had influence to suspend it as long as he pleased  the primate saw his policy and with all his weight opposed him he wished to preserve the present translation even with all its inaccuracies which he thought better than to run the risk of a new one but he could not prevail one point however he gained instead of putting the bible into the hands of the bishops he got it put into the hands of the two universities which he supposed would be less subject to popish influence  he was right in his conjecture for the universities were very speedy in their revision but the primate had the old battle to fight again tho a more correct bible was produced yet the same opposition was still made to its publication and new topics of argument were introduced the archbishop however had now encouraged a considerable party to second him and the affair was combated with great vigor but the opposition of the popish party became so formidable that the archbishop was again entirely deserted single however as he had done before he still bore up against his adversaries and persevered till by dint of perseverance he obtained a limited use of the bible tho it was never publicly allowed during the remainder of henrys reign  sect x while the primate was acting this great and noble part in parliament an unexpected event placed him in a very delicate and dangerous situation  at an early hour in the morning an unknown person of the name of lascelles desired a secret admittance to him and with much hesitation opened an affair which the archbishop would often say gave his spirits a greater agitation than he ever felt before or after  the affair was no less than the discovery of the queens incontinence  the primate with his usual caution weighed the information and the proof on which it rested and he had the more time for deliberation as the king was then on a progress if the information were justly founded it was both wrong and dangerous to conceal it  if unjustly it was equally so to divulge it the dilemma was difficult  the business was perplexed also by a circumstance of peculiar delicacy the queen was niece to the duke of norfolk who was at the head of the popish party and the good primate who had seen with what sinister arts that class of men had carried on their schemes was apprehendsive that such a story as this might have too much the air of retaliation and the malignity of party and if it should prove false would fix an imputation on his character which he had ever been careful to avoid his enemies he knew were always on the watch against him and might for ought he knew have taken this very method of doing him an injury  thus distracted by a view of the affair in every light he went at last to the lord chancellor and the earl of hertford whom the king had left with a commission of regency during his absence and to them he unbosomed his distress  after the first impression of terror was over with which the privacy of such an affair naturally struck every one who was connected with the tyrant the chancellor and lord hertford were both of opinion that as the affair rested on such undoubted evidence it was less hazardous to divulge than to conceal it this point being settled the more arduous one still remained of informing the king the primate thought it best that all three should join in the information and give it that weight which no single person could give the two lords on the other hand were of a different opinion as the intelligence they said had been given to the primate and they had only been consulted the information would come most naturally from him besides they remarked it was more respectful to keep a matter of so delicate a nature in a single hand and if so the primates ecclesiastical character and wellknown judgment made him the properest messenger of bad news as when he had given the wound he could pour in balm to heal it  in conclusion the meekness of the archbishop gave way and he took upon himself alone the task of carrying the unwelcome truth to the king  it was indeed an unwelcome truth the king at this time had so little conception of the queens dishonesty and loved her with such entire affection that he had lately given public thanks for the happiness he enjoyed with her  the method which the primate took was to draw up the whole affair on paper with all the evidence on which it rested and present it to the king in private  henry took the information as we may suppose he would his sury broke out in vehement execrations and threats against those who had been the contrivers of such villainy and yet even in his rage he seems to have spared the archbishop as a man who might be imposed on but could not intend deceit by degrees however as his royal sury subsided and he examined the evidence coolly it made a deep impression on him and passions of another kind began to rise in short the queen and her accomplices were tried condemned and executed a little before her death she confessed her guilt to the archbishop and the full voice of history bears testimony to the justice of her sentence  about the time in which the archbishop was concerned in this affair he was engaged in another almost equally invidious the visitation of allsoulscollege in oxford that society was in much disorder their dissentions gave great offense and the irregularity of their manners still greater they are taxed in the language of those times with their scandalous compotations commessations and ingurgitations the archbishop as visitor was called in by one of the contending parties and he found it no easy matter to compose their heats and restore good manners with his usual vigor he went through the disagreeable task and having mixed as much lenity as possible with his censures he reviewed their statutes and made such additions as he hoped would prevent any misbehaviour for the future  in the year      which was the year after these troublesome affairs happened the battle of solwaymoss where the scottish army received a total defeat many of their nobility being taken prisoners were sent to london and committed to the care of the most considerable persons about the court the earl of cassilis was sent to lambeth here he found himself in a school of philosophy and religion where every thing great and noble and liberal abounded cassilis himself had a turn for literature and soon became enamoured with this amiable society the gentleness and benevolence of the archbishop in particular attracted his esteem and brought him to think more favorably of the reformers to whose opinions he soon became a thorough convert scotland had not yet received the tenets of the reformation and the archbishop would often say that when it should please god to inlighten that country he hoped the intimacy which had subsisted between him and the earl of cassilis might not wholly be without effect and in fact it proved so for some years afterward when the reformed opinions got footing in scotland nobody contributed so much to establish them as that nobleman  sect xi tho it might be supposed that the queens death would have weakened the popish cause yet we do not find that it produced any such effect many remarked that after the first heat of the rupture with rome the king had been gradually returning toward it and that with regard to all the doctrines of popery he was at this time more zealous than he had ever been and they accounted for it very plausibly by observing that as his passions began to cool the religious fear took more possession of him  the popish party it is certain at this period assumed unusual spirits and thought they had influence enough to obtain any point  one morning the primate was surprised with a message from the king who lay off lambeth in his barge and wished immediately to speak with him as he came on board the king called out i can now inform you who is the greatest heretic in kent and ordering the barge to row gently up the river he seated the archbishop by him and produced a large book which he said contained an accusation of several of the kentish ministers against their diocesan  the archbishop who was not very present in the article of surprise gazed first at the king and then at the book and could not in some minutes collect an answer the king bad him not be distressed i consider the affair said he merely as a combination of your enemies and as such i shall treat it  commissioners were soon after appointed to examine the evidence against the primate and at the head of the board the king with his usual indelicacy placed the primate himself the archbishop was shocked at this designation and could barely be prevailed on to appear once at the opening of the commission it sufficiently showed however how the king stood affected and saved the archbishops advocates the trouble of any labored defense each of the accusers endeavored with what art he was able to withdraw himself from a business which was likely to bring him so ungrateful a return  the chief contriver of this whole affair was the bishop of winchester who with great assiduity had collected a variety of passages from sermons and other discourses in which it was supposed the archbishop had shown more regard to the new learning as protestantism was called and the professors of it than the laws then in force allowed  among other agents whom winchester employed he drew over by his insinuating arts two persons who were very nearly connected with the archbishop himself dr thorndon suffragan of dover and dr barber a civilian each of them had been promoted by the archbishop and held an office under him and both had been always treated by him on the footing of intimate friends barber even lived in his house and had a pension settled on him that he might be ready with his advice on every occasion when the proofs therefore of this consederacy were put into the primates hands we may suppose his astonishment on finding a letter from each of these persons containing a variety of matter against him which his familiarity and unreserved freedom with them had easily furnished  soon afterward when these two persons happened both to be with the archbishop at his house at beckesburne come your ways with me said he leading them into his study i must have your advice in a certain matter when he had carried them to a retired window in the room you twain he resumed be men in whom i have had much trust and you must now give me some council i have been shamefully abused by one or twain to whom i have showed all my secrets and the matter is so fallen out that they have not only disclosed my secrets but also have taken upon them to accuse me of heresy and are become witnesses against me i require you therefore to advise me how i shall behave myself to them you are both my friends what say you to the matter  whether they had any suspicion of the archbishops meaning does not appear as the question however was put they could not avoid pronouncing with great severity against such villainy the primate then drawing the letters from his bosom know you said he these papers my masters  you have condemned yourselves god make you both good men i never deserved this at your hands if such men as you are not to be trusted there is no fidelity to be found i fear my left hand will accuse my right having said this he added after a pause that they might rest assured he would take no steps to punish their baseness but he thought it fit to discharge them from his service  the king however treated the archbishops accusers with more severity and threw many of them into prison this alarming gardener he wrote a letter to the primate in the following abject style  gentle father i have not borne so tender a heart toward you as a true child ought to bear tho you never gave me occasion otherwise but rather by benefits provoked me to the contrary i ask mercy of you with as contrite a heart as ever david asked of god  i desire you to remember the prodigal child i am full sorry for my fault heartily confessing my rashness and indeliberate doings forgive me this fault and you shall never hereaster perceive but that at all times i shall be as obedient as ever was child to his natural father i am yours and shall be yours and that truly while i live good father i have given myself unto you heart body and service and now remember that i am your true servant  this letter tho it appears from winchesters future life to have been a mere artifice so wrought on the gentle nature of the primate that hearing the king was resolved to lay winchesters letters before the house of lords he went to him and at length prevailed on him not to give the bishop any further trouble but to let the matter drop  the event of this accusation checked the ardour of the archbishops enemies for some time but it revived again in about two years on the death of charles brandon duke of suffolk  with this nobleman the king had preserved through life a friendship of which it was not thought his heart was susceptible and on hearing of his death he pronounced a short eulogy on his memory which was beyond the most labored panegyric the news was brought to him in council god rest his soul said the king with much emotion he was an honest man i have known him long and never knew him speak a bad word behind the back of any man then turning round the board with a sarcastic air of which of you my lords added he can i say as much  the dukes amiable manners had long engaged the esteem of the archbishop whose virtues in return were equally admired by the duke a very sincere friendship subsisted between them and it was thought the persuasive arguments of the primate had drawn the duke to think favorably of the reformers whose friend and patron he was generally esteemed  tho the duke had ever been a cautious man and interfered little in public affairs yet considering his favor with the king the popish party thought his death of great advantage to their cause they conceived that it might both weaken the protestant interest and tend also to lessen the kings regard for the primate  elated with these hopes the bishop of winchester and his emissaries beset the king now yielding to age and infirmity and endeavored to awaken his religious fears in vain might wise laws struggle with heresies if the patrons of those heresies were above law of his majesty alone redress could be had he was gods vicegerent to rectify the abuses of the times and might be assured the sword was not put into his hands in vain he was accountable for the trust  from hints they proceeded to plainer language and at length in direct words informed the king that while the archbishop sat in council nothing effectual could be consulted about religion they prayed his majesty therefore to give leave for the primate to be sent to the tower and it would then be seen how ample a charge against him would appear  the king pondered and consented  that very evening as it grew dark henry sent for the archbishop to whitehall he was walking pensively in a long gallery when the archbishop entered my lord of canterbury said the king i have given permission to have you sent to the tower some lords of council have dealt with me to that purpose they have grievous things to lay to your charge which they dare not utter while you have free admission to the board  the archbishop expressed his readiness to have his conduct inquired into in whatever manner the king thought fit and offered to go with great alacrity to the tower till he had fully answered the accusations of his adversaries  the king interrupting him as his manner was with a burst of vociferation expressed his surprise at the primates simplicity but immediately softening his voice told him that it was much easier to keep him from the tower than to deliver him out of it you will be sent for said he in the morning by the council and dealt with haughtily if the lords talk of committing you desire you may first hear your accusers if they deny this appeal to me and take this ring which you may show them as a token  at eight the next morning the archbishop was accordingly called before the council and was kept some time standing at the door being admitted he punctually followed the kings directions and when the lords insisted on sending him to the tower he appealed to the king who had taken the affair he told them into his own hands as he said this he produced the ring which was a token very well known  every one present was confounded and the lord russel starting up cried out with an oath i told you my lords how it would be and that the king would never suffer him to be committed  when the affair was brought before the king he made a short business of it striding haughtily round the room and throwing an eye of indignation first on one and then on another i thought said he i had a discreet council but i see i am deceived how have ye handled here my lord of canterbury what made ye of him a slave shutting him out of the council chamber among serving men  i would have you to understand by the faith i owe to god laying his hand solemnly on his breast that if a prince can be beholden to a subject i am to my lord of canterbury whom i account as faithful a man toward his prince as ever was prelate in this realm and one to whom i am sundry ways beholden and therefore he that loves me will regard him  having said this he strode out and left the lords endeavoring which should apologize to the primate in the highest strain of compliment the next day the king sent several of them as was customary with him after such dissentions to dine with the archbishop at lambeth  there is something singular in this whole affair it is difficult to say whether henry was at first in earnest and afterward changed his resolution or whether he took this method to check the forwardness of the archbishops enemies  while this scene was acting in the council a part of the fame plan was preparing in parliament there sir john goswick in a studied harangue accused the archbishop of being an upholder of heretical opinions with which he had greatly infected the county of kent henry being informed of this motion called a gentleman in waiting and sent sir john this message tell that varlet goswick that if he do not presently reconcile himself to my lord of canterbury i will punish him for the example of others what knows he of my lords preaching in kent was not he at that time in bedfordshire  the message was very intelligible and had its full effect  sect xii but it was not only in matters of religion that every advantage was taken against the archbishop the most trivial cavils were often made he had enemies ready for any species of calumny and sir thomas seymour who had abilities to object to nothing else was able to object to the meanness of his housekeeping on this head he threw out insinuations to the king henry heard him with apparent indifference and carelessly answered ay seymour and does my lord of canterbury keep as little hospitality as you say in good faith i thought the contrary  the king said no more but took an early opportunity to send sir thomas on some frivolous message to lambeth about dinner time when he came there he was carried through the great hall where a bountiful table was spread tho only in its ordinary manner from thence he was conducted up fairs to the archbishop where he found a large company just sitting down to dinner among whom the archbishop in his usual hearty manner insisted that sir thomas should take a place  the next time the king saw him well said he seymour what cheer had you at lambeth for i suppose my lord would keep you to dine  the poor man confounded at the question and seeing plainly the kings meaning threw himself at his feet and begged his majesty to pardon the soul slander with which he had aspersed the archbishop he then frankly mentioned all he had seen and concluded with saying he believed nobody in the realm except his highness himself kept such a table  ah good man said the king all he has he spends in housekeeping and if he now keep such a table as you say it being neither term nor parliament he is meetly visited at those times i warrant you   but added the king assuming a severer tone i know the bottom of all these falsities you want to have a finger in church matters do you but you may set your heart at rest while i am king there shall be no such doings  these insinuations with regard to the archbishops great ceconomy seem in some degree to have been credited by sir william cecil who in a letter told the primate freely what was current at court  that he and all the bishops were immensely rich  and that they had nothing in view but raising princely fortunes for their families  the archbishops answer to cecil is so ingenuous and bears so strong a stamp of honesty that it is well worth transcribing  after my hearty commendations and thanks as well for your gentle letter as for the copy of the pacification and for your good remembrance of the two matters which i desired you not to forget the one concerning the bishop of cologns letters and the other concerning mr mowse for whom i give you my most hearty thanks  as for your admonition i take it most thankfully as i have ever been most glad to be admonished by all my friends accounting no man so foolish as he that will not bear friendly admonition for myself i fear not that saying of st paul which you quote against me half so much as i do stark beggary i took not so much care about my living when i was a scholar at cambridge as at this present and if a good auditor had my accounts he would find no great surplusage to grow rich on  as to the rest of the bishops they are all beggars except one man and i dare well say he is not very rich if i knew any bishop that were covetous i would surely admonish him  to be short i am not so doted as to set my mind upon things here which i can neither tarry long with nor carry away with me if time would have served i would have written longer but your servant making haste compels me to leave off beseeching almighty god to preserve the king and all his council and send him well from his progress  your own ever t cantuar   these invidious reports with regard to the avarice of the bishops are commonly ascribed to the avarice of the courtiers who were desirous of adding the revenues of the bishoprics to the spoils of the monasteries the wealth of the bishops therefore was the fashionable courttopic of that day and every patriot declaimed on the expediency of stripping them of their temporalities and settling pensions on them that they might not be incumbered with secular affairs  henry knew well the meaning of this language and alluded to it when he told sir thomas seymour he wanted to have a finger in church matters  but tho henry would not allow his courtiers to strip the clergy of their possessions he was very well inclined to do it himself his method was to oblige the bishops to make disadvantageous exchanges with crown lands in this way he stripped the fee of canterbury during archbishop cranraers time of   0l of annual rent and the archbishop would often hint that if he were less hospitable than his predecessors a reason might be given  during the short remainder of henrys reign the archbishop met with no farther disturbance of any kind his enemies being now convinced of the kings resolution to skreen him from all attacks indeed the protection which henry at all times afforded him in opposition to his own irritable and implacable temper the genius of his religion and the bias of bigotry makes one of those strange contradictions which we sometimes meet with but cannot account for in the characters of men  it is somewhat singular that henry on one of these late attacks observing the mildness of the primates temper the acrimony of his adversaries and the danger he must necessarily run when deprived of the protection of his prince gave him for his arms as if in the spirit of foresight three pelicans feeding their young with their own blood and added in an odd jumble of coarse metaphor that he was likely to be tasted if he stood to his tackling  the last act of this reign was an act of blood and gave the archbishop a noble opportunity of showing how well he had learned that great christian lesson of forgiving an enemy  almost without the shadow of justice henry had given directions to have the duke of norfolk attainted by an act of parliament the kings mandate stood in lieu of guilt and the bill passed the house with great ease  no man except the bishop of winchester had been so great an enemy to the archbishop as the duke of norfolk he had always thwarted the primates measures and oftener than once had practiced against his life how many would have seen with secret pleasure the workings of providence against so rancorous an enemy satisfied in having themselves no hand in his unjust fate but the archbishop saw the affair in another light he saw it with horror and although the king had in a particular manner interested himself in this business the primate opposed the bill with all his might and when his opposition was vain he left the house with indignation and retired to croydon  while the king was pushing on the attainder of the duke of norfolk with such unjust and cruel precipitancy he was himself hastening apace to the grave he had long been an object of disgust and terror his body was become a mass of fetid humors and his temper was so brutal that if he had not been diverted by a stratagem he would have put his queen to death only for differing from him on a point of theology  a queen too whose daily employment it was to fit for hours on her knees before him dressing the offensive ulcers of his legs his attendants approached him with trembling one or two of them ran the risk of losing their heads only for intimating their fears about his health it was prognosticating his death and amounted nearly to high treason  disease at length subdued this brutal spirit when he was now almost in the article of death sir anthony denny ventured to hint with great delicacy that his physicians thought his majestys life in some danger henry took the admonition patiently for he felt nature speaking a less ceremonious language within he was just able to order the archbishop to be called  when the primate came he found the king speechless extended on a couch his eyes glazed and motionless his attendants had ventured now to throw off all disguise and the real sentiments of the heart on this great occasion were visible on every enlightened countenance the archbishops sensations were very different his were the painful feelings which arise from pity mingled with a high sense of gratitude where there could be no real esteem and where in an hour of the greatest distress there was no possibility of being of service with an eye melting in tenderness he leaned over the dying king and sympathized with every pang henry did not yet seem entirely deprived of intellect the primate begged him to give some sign of his dying in the faith of christ henry made an effort to grasp his hand and expired  sect xiii the death of henry which happened in the year      opened a new scene on producing his will it appeared that sixteen of the leading men of the kingdom were appointed regents they were restrained by many limitations but under these a majority were allowed to govern the kingdom as they thought fit this happy clause overturned all the rest henry had composed the regents as equally as he could of both parties in religion and hoped that by keeping things during his sons minority in the same hesitating situation in which he had left them he might prevent their running into extremes but it happened otherwise a majority plainly inclined to the protestant cause either from conscience or interest and they thought themselves fully authorized by the precept of the will to govern the kingdom as they thought fit the earl of hertford the kings uncle was created duke of somerset and chosen protector the other regents immediately became ciphers  the archbishop tho placed at the head of the regency rarely interfered with state affairs and gave little interruption to the ambition of his compeers in ecclesiastical matters he took the lead and every thing that was done in this department during edwards reign may be considered as done by his authority  but it would interfere too much with the nature of such a work as this to enter into a minute detail of all the changes which were made in religion such a detail appears more properly in works appropriated to these inquiries see jewels apology burnets hist of the reform heylins eccles hist etc  here it is proposed only to illustrate the character of this excellent prelate and it will be enough to touch so far on the changes he made as to throw a proper light on his wisdom prudence learning moderation and sirmness  the first step he took regarded the settlement of the supremacy a point which he had exceedingly at heart as the foundation of every thing else he formally therefore petitioned the young king that as he had exercised the office of archbishop under his father he might be permitted to exercise it under him and he would perform no episcopal duty till his new license was made out  this example he proposed should be enforced on the clergy  thus authorized he proceeded to the affairs of religion but before any thing was done he thought it right to show the necessity of doing something and to this purpose a general visitation was made abuses of all kinds were inquired into  corrupt doctrines corrupt practices superstitious ceremonies the lives of the clergy and the manners of the laity the visitors had authority to proceed a step farther in flagrant cases a few censures were passed and a few injunctions given the idea was to restrain rather than to abolish the old system  among other things it was thought expedient to suspend preaching amidst the license of the times no species of it deserved more reproof than that which had gotten possession of the pulpit many of the monks had been secularized and bringing with them into their churches their old monastic ideas the popular divinity of those times was if possible more opposite to scripture and more offeasive to common sense than it had ever been in the darkest reign of popery in the room of preaching a book of homilies was published and ordered to be read in churches the use of scripture also was allowed and that the people might have an explanation of it at hand the commentary of erasmus was authorized  these changes had great efficacy moderate as they appeared and aiming rather to undermine the foundations of popery than to overturn them by any open assault  the minds of the people indeed were in a good degree prepared for them and it is said nothing contributed more to loosen their prejudices than a popular paper which was published about the close of the late reign entitled the supplication of the poor commons to the king it was levelled chiefly at the ignorance and immorality of the romish clergy and being written in a masterly manner and interspersed with a variety of lively anecdotes it was much read and tended greatly to give the people just ideas of the clerical office among other stories the following very curious one is related a certain courtchaplain who had great preferment observed as he was traveling a church upon a fair hill beset with groves and fields the green meadows lying beneath on the banks of a river garnished with willows poplars and alders he was mightily taken with the place and calling out to his servant robin said he this benefice stands pleasantly i would it were mine why sir said his servant it is yours and immediately named the parish  if your highness had so many swine in this realm as you have men would you commit the keeping of them to such swineherds as did not know their swinecots when they saw them  the dread in which the romish clergy were at that time thrown from what had been already done is strongly expressed in the following language these dumb dogs have learned to fawn upon them who bring them bread and to be wonderful frisky when they are cherished but if they be once bid to couch they draw the tail between their legs and get them strait to their kennel and then come who will they stir no more till they hear their fire pope cry out hey cut or long tail so afraid are they of stripes and lest they should be tied up so short that they cannot range abroad nor worry now and then a lamb  then follows a long account of their rapacity of which many instances are given among others we are told it was no rare thing to see poor people beg at easter to pay for the sacrament when they receive it nor is it less common to see men beg for dead bodies that they may pay the priests dues it is not long since in the city of london a dead body was brought to the church to be buried being so poor that it was almost quite naked but these charitable men who teach us that it is one of the works of mercy to bury the dead would not bury this dead corpse without their dues so they caused it to be carried into the street till the poor people who dwelled there begged so much as the dues came to  the apostrophe of these suppliants to the king was very noble and spirited if you suffer christs poor members to be thus oppressed expect the righteous judgment of god for your negligence be merciful therefore to yourself as well as to us endanger not your own soul by the suffering of us poor commons remember that your hoar hairs are a token that nature makes haste to absolve your life defer not then most dread sovereign the reformation of these enormities for the wound is even unto death whoredom is more esteemed than wedlock simony has lost its name usury is lawful gains what example of life do the people show this day which declares us more to be the people of god than jews and mahometans  the leaders of the popish party easily saw the tendency of the primates measures and gave them what opposition they were able the bishop of winchester never appeared in a more becoming light with equal firmness and plausibility he remonstrated the commencement of a minority he said was not a time to introduce novelties to alter the religion of a country was a serious business and required the utmost deliberation no act of legislature he observed had yet passed and it was great presumption to publish things under the kings name with which it was well known neither he nor the protector were at all acquainted but even if bare decency were consulted it was very offensive to all sober men to see the wisdom of ages cancelled in a few months  the paraphrase of erasmus he remarked was written at a time when the pen of that writer was very licentious it contained many points of doctrine which he presumed the protestants themselves would not willingly inculcate and he would maintain that it contradicted the homilies in many particulars as for the homilies tho he did not doubt their being well intended yet they were certainly very inaccurate compositions and ran into length on many curious points of doctrine which tended rather to mislead than to inform the people  for himself he said he was careless of all consequences which the freedom of his speech might draw upon him the last scene of his life was now on the stage and he only wished to conclude it properly  there was an energy and greatness in this language superior to any thing that had ever fallen from gardener and if that had been the last scene of his life we must have acknowledged the dignity of it is conclusion in his objections also there was more than a show of reasoning and the promoters of reformation had but an indifferent ground for a defense they answered with the plainness and simplicity of honest men which was the best defense they could make that they were assured their amendments were right on the whole and that if some things were objectionable these too should be amended as soon as possible  this was a better answer and more in the spirit of reformation than their replying as they afterward did to the arguments of winchester by throwing him into prison this violent measure may well be reckoned among the errors of those times the archbishop indeed does not appear to have had any hand in this affair it issued solely from the council and was intended probably to remove winchester from the parliament which was then about to be assembled in every light political or religious it was a harsh discordant measure and very unworthy of the liberal cause which it was intended to serve  sect xiv on the fourth of november      about nine months after henrys death a parliament was assembled and the leaders of the protestant cause hoped to make it the instrument of still more essential alterations than any they had yet made indeed the bias of the nation leaned more to this side such a change appeared in the opinions of men since the last parliament of henry that no one could imagine the two assemblies were composed of the same people in every debate the protestant took the lead and drew over a majority in that age of novelty when the general principles of men were unfixed it was an easy matter to persuade thoses who were incapable of rational inquiry the convocation animated by the archbishop showed the same spirit and digested business for the parliament the act of the fix articles was repealed communion in both kinds was allowed tradition was discredited lent was considered as a political institution the liturgy was ordered to be new modelled an easy catechism to be framed and the canon law to be reformed  these things however were not all done at this time but i mention them together as the principal acts of parliament and of convocation during this short reign  in framing the catechism and new modelling the liturgy and the canon law the archbishop had the chief hand the last indeed he had attempted in the late reign but the prevalence of the popish party obliged him to leave that useful work unfinished he now undertook it in earnest and not being satisfied with making it an accurate and judicious performance he endeavored to make it even elegant dr haddon was esteemed at that time the best latinist in england and the archbishop engaged him to revise the language of his performance several of haddons corrections may yet be seen in the original manuscript which is still extant in bennetcollege in cambridge mulierum a partu is altered into levatarum puerperarum and cuicunq hoc proerogativum est into cuicunq hoc peculiare jus tribuitur quod proerogativum vocant  but such was the fatality attending this useful work that it was prevented taking effect in edwards as it had been in henrys reign it was not sufficiently prepared to be brought forward before that kings immature death  the archbishop endeavored also to confine the office of confirmation as much as he could to adults he saw little use in administering it to children but when people were come to years of discretion and seriously desired to renew their baptismal vow he thought the solemnity of such an ordinance at that time might make a strong impression  some other changes he made of smaller import but still with that admirable caution and prudence which marked all his proceedings  his caution however did not pass wholly uncensured many of his friends conceived that he might have taken hastier steps the zeal of calvin in particular took offense that reformer wrote his sentiments very freely to the archbishop and wished him to push matters with a little more spirit he put him in mind of his age which could not long allow him to continue his useful labors and feared that on his death an opportunity would be lost which might never be recovered the archbishop answered his letter with great kindness  reminded him of the many difficulties he had still to oppose and endeavored to convince him of the great imprudence of less cautious measures  while the primate was thus abolishing the essentials of popery it may be supposed he did not suffer it is pageantry to pass unobserved  the frequency of processions was become a great abuse men began to think nothing was religion but what was an object of fight this shows how much they have to answer for who introduce needless ceremonies into the offices of any religious establishment the minds of the people at the time we are now describing fascinated with pomp and splendour saw with less reluctance the foundations of popery shaken than the ostentatious ceremonies abolished of carrying palms on palm sunday or ashes on ash wednesday  mr hume treating these alterations with levity attributes them to the morose humor of the reformers and insinuates that it is happy when superstition which is generally with him another word for religion takes this inoffensive turn  when mr hume rears the standard of infidelity and boldly combats the truths of religion he acts openly and honestly but when he scatters his careless insinuations as he traverses the paths of history we characterize him as a dark insidious enemy  during the debates on these subjects a very extraordinary phenomenon appeared in the house of lords  the archbishop of canterbury at the head of the popish peers and popish bishops contending eagerly against the whole force of the protestant interest the point in dispute was the propriety of granting a large parcel of collegiate and chantry lands to the kings use had it been intended to employ this grant in any useful work the archbishop would readily have given his vote for it but he knew well what direction it would take and he wished the lands rather to continue as they were hoping for better times than have them fall into the hands of rapacious courtiers he had the mortisication however to see his opponents prevail  while this bill was depending in the house the two universities which were clearly comprehended in the letter of it became very apprehensive and made powerful intercession at court to avert the danger whether the primate interested himself in their favor on this occasion does not appear it is rather probable that he did as we find him interesting himself for them on many other occasions  they were at that time little more than nurseries of sloth superstition and ignorance and not many degrees raised above the monkish institutions which had lately been suppressed many ingenious men and scholars of great reputetion were among them but they were yet so thinly scattered in the several colleges as to have little influence in forming the general character of the universities and they who wished well to these foundations easily saw this corruption must terminate in their ruin and desired to avert it the archbishop always thought himself much interested in the welfare of both the universities but of cambridge in particular and tho he does not appear to have had any legal power there yet such was his interest at court and such was the general dependence of the more eminent members of that society upon him that scarce any thing was done there either of a public or a private nature without consulting him it was his chief endeavor to encourage as much as possible a spirit of inquiry and to rouse the students from the slumber of their predecessors well knowing the libertas philosophandi was the great mean of detecting error and that true learning could never be at variance with true religion ascham and cheke two of the most elegant scholars of that age were chiefly relied on and consulted by the archbishop in this work  sect xv while the primate was acting this great and good part and on all occasions discovering the utmost mildness and candor the truth of history calls on us to acknowledge that on one unhappy occasion he appeared under a very different character that of a bigoted persecutor it is very true indeed that he went not voluntarily into this business but acted under a commission to inquire into heretical opinions  when the errors of the church of rome were scrutinized private judgment although the basis of all liberal inquiry gave birth as might naturally be supposed to a variety of strange enthusiastic opinions many of these were unquestionably absurd enough and some of them destructive of moral goodness as that the elect could not sin  that although the outward man might transgress the inward man remained immaculate  that the regenerate have a right to what they want and some others equally detestable  they were opinions however of a less offensive nature that drew upon them the archbishops severity  joan bocher and george paris were accused tho at different times one for denying the humanity of christ the other for denying his divinity they were both tried and condemned to the stake and the archbishop not only consented to these acts of blood but even persuaded the aversion of the young king into a compliance your majesty must distinguish said he informing his royal pupils conscience between common opinions and such as are the essential articles of faith these latter we must on no account suffer to be opposed  it is true these doctrines especially the latter in the opinion of the generality of christians are subversive of the fundamentals of christianity to deny the divinity of christ seems to oppose the general idea which the scriptures hold out of our redemption on the other hand many particular passages which describe the humanity of christ seem to favor the doctrine and some there are who hold it even in this enlightened age at worst therefore we must consider it as an erroneous opinion to call it heresy when attended with a good life is certainly a great breach of christian charity is it not then astonishing that a man of the archbishops candor could not give it a little more indulgence if any opinions can demand the secular arm it must be such only as lead to actions which injure the peace of society we are surprised also at seeing the archbishop so far depreciate his own cause as to suppose that one man incurred guilt by acting on the same principles which entitled another to applause and that he who in the opinion of one church was the greatest of schismatics himself should not even in common justice indulge in all the more speculative points of religion toleration to others nothing even plausible can be suggested in defense of the archbishop on this occasion except only that the spirit of popery was not yet wholly repressed  there are however among protestant writers at this day some who have undertaken his vindication but i spare their indiscretion let the horrid act be universally disclaimed to palliate is to participate with indignation let it be recorded as what above all other things has disgraced that religious liberty which our ancestors in most other respects so nobly purchased  from this disagreeable view of the archbishop let us endeavor to bring ourselves again in temper with him by viewing him as the friend and patron of the distressed the sussering professors of protestantism who were scattered in great numbers about the various countries of europe were always sure of an asylum with him his palace at lambeth might be called a seminary of learned men the greater part of whom persecution had driven from home here among other celebrated reformers martyr bucer aless phage sound sanctuary martyr bucer and phage were liberally pensioned by the archbishop till he could otherwise provide for them it was his wish to fix them in the two universities where he hoped their great knowledge and spirit of inquiry would forward his designs of restoring learning and he at length obtained professorships for them all bucer and phage were settled at cambridge were they only showed what might have been expected from them both dying within a few months after their arrival but at oxford martyr acted a very conspicuous part and contributed to introduce among the students there a very liberal mode of thinking  aless had been driven from scotland his native country for the novelty of his opinions the cause in which he suffered added to his abilities and learning so far recommended him to the university of leipsic to which he retired that he was chosen a professor there at this place he became acquainted with melancthon who having written a treatise on some part of the controversy between the papists and protestants was desirous of consulting the archbishop on a few points and engaged aless otherwise not averse to the employment to undertake a voyage into england for that purpose in the course of the conference the archbishop was so much taken with his simplicity and learning that he settled a pension on him and retained him in his family  the misfortunes of the times drew alasco also into england where the archbishop became an early patron to him and showed on this occasion at least the candor and liberality of his sentiments by permitting a person who held many opinions very different from his own to collect his brethren and such as chose to communicate with him into a church at the head of this little assembly alasco long presided exhibiting an eminent example of piety and decency of manners  among other learned foreigners john sleiden was under particular obligations to the archbishop sleiden was at that time engaged in writing the history of the reformation a work from which much was expected and which the archbishop by allowing him a pension and opportunities of study enabled him to prosecute with less difficulty than had attended the beginning of his labors  leland the first british antiquarian was also among the primates particular friends leland had a wonderful facility in learning languages and was esteemed the first linguist in europe the archbishop soon took notice of him and with his usual discernment recommended him to be the kings librarian his genius threw him on the study of antiquities and his opportunities on those of his own country the archbishop in the mean time by procuring preferment for him enabled him to make those inquiries to which his countrymen have been so much indebted  among others who were under obligations to the archbishops generosity was the amiable bishop latimer who not choosing to be reinstated in his old bishopric and having made but an indifferent provision for his future necessities spent a great part of his latter life with the archbishop at lambeth  besides this intimacy with learned men at home the archbishop held a constant correspondence with most of the learned men in europe  the great patron of erasmus had been archbishop warham than whom to give popery its due few churchmen of those times led a more apostolical life when cranmer succeeded warham erasmus was in the decline of age he found however during the short time he lived as beneficent a friend under the new archbishop as he had lost in the old one  the primate corresponded also with osiander melancthon and calvin his foreign correspondence indeed was so large that he appointed a person with a salary at canterbury whose chief employment it was to forward and receive his packets  among the most eminent of his correspondents was herman archbishop and elector of cologn this prelate had been early impressed with the principles of the reformation by melancthon and had used all his influence to introduce them in his electorate but he met with powerful opposition the pope and emperor combining against him the former in his spiritual the latter in his temporal capacity so potent a combination crushed him terms indeed were offered but he would hearken to no dishonorable compromise nothing he would say can happen to me unexpectedly i have long since fortisied my mind against every event instead of a splendid life therefore at variance with his opinions he chose a private station in which he enjoyed the pleasures of study the friendship of good men and the tranquillity of a good conscience  sect xvi in the year      the archbishop was engaged in a controversy of a very singular kind on the following occasion  the dissolution of monasteries having thrown the landed interest of the nation into new hands introduced also a new kind of culture which at first occasioned a scarcity mr hume speaking of this matter with great judgment remarks that no abuse in civil society is so great as not to be attended with a variety of beneficial consequences and in the beginnings of reformation the loss of these advantages is always felt very sensibly while the benefit resulting from the change is the slow effect of time and is seldom perceived by the bulk of a nation thus on the present occasion the bad effects of a new mode of culture were experienced before its advantages took place and the people expressing dissatisfaction in all parts in some flamed out into acts of violence among other insurrections one in devonshire was very formidable the insurgents felt the effects of famine but in an age of ignorance they could not trace the cause the discontented priests who swarmed about the country presently assigned one the famin was a judgment for the abolition of the holy catholic religion and till that was restored the people must not look either for seedtime or harvest  such language changed riot into enthusiasm the banner of the cross was reared and the insurgents marking themselves with the five wounds of christ called their march the pilgrimage of grace  their first attempt was on exeter which they surrounded with their tumultuary forces the town was reduced to extremity but still resisted encouraged chiefly by a brave old townsman who bringing all his provision into the street here cried he my fellowcitizens take what i have among you for myself i will sight with one arm and feed on the other rather than suffer these ruffians to enter  as the rebels were thus checked by the firmness of exeter they employed this time of inactivity in sending petitions and articles to the king in which they demanded the ceremonies of the popish worship to be restored  the new liturgy to be abolished  the use of the bible to be forbidden  and in short every thing to be undone that had already been done  general answers were given to these demands but the rebels continuing still unsatisfied lord russel was sent against them with a body of forces he fell on them as they lay before exeter and gave them a severe defeat  but tho their spirit was broken their prejudices continued the archbishop therefore engaged in the humane part of bringing them to reason hoping that their sufferings had by this time abated the ardour of their zeal  the articles of their petitions relating to religion which were fifteen in number the archbishop undertook to answer the first rough draught of this work which is of considerable length is still extant in the library of bennetcollege in cambridge and is published by mr strype in his appendix to the life of archbishop cranmer it contains a very extensive compass of learning and is written with great strength of argument but its principal recommenddation is its being so admirably adapted to the capacity of those to whom it was addressed nothing can show more judgment or knowledge of the manners of the lower people  i shall give the reader a few passages from this very masterly work as a specimen  the rebel articles begin with the phrase we will have  in the first place says the archbishop i dislike your beginning is it the fashion of subjects to say to their prince we will have would any of you that be householders be content that your servants should come upon you with harness on their backs and swords in their hands and say we will have  but leaving your rude and unhandsome manner of speech i will come to the point you say you will have all the holy decrees to be observed but i dare say very few or none of you understand what you ask do you know what the holy decrees be as holy as they may be called they be indeed so wicked and full of tyranny that the like were never devised i shall rehearse some of them that you may see how holy they be  one decree says that all the decrees of the bishop of rome ought to be kept as gods word another that whosoever receives not the decrees of the bishop of rome his sin shall never be forgiven a third that although the bishop of rome regard neither his own salvation nor any mans else but puts down with himself headlong innumerable people by heaps into hell yet may no mortal man presume to reprove him therefore i cannot think that you be so far from all godliness as to desire decrees which be so blasphemous to god and so far from all equity and reason for i dare say that the subtle papists when they moved you to stand in this article that all holy decrees should be observed never showed you these decrees sor if they had they knew right well you would never have consented to this article  but now let me show you what a miserable case you should bring yourselves into if the kings majesty should assent unto this first article for among these decrees one is that no priest shall be sued before a temporal judge for any manner of cause or crime but before his bishop only another is that a priest may sue a temporal man either before a temporal or a spiritual judge at his pleasure i cannot deny but these be good and beneficial decrees for the liberty of the clergy but i suppose none of you will think it an indifferent decree that a priest shall sue you where he list but if he had slain one of your sons or brothers you could have no remedy against him but only before the bishop what mean these papistical priests think you that stirred you up to ask such decrees to be observed but crastily to bring you under their subjection and that you yourselves ignorantly asking ye wist not what should put your heads under their girdles  surely if ye had known these decrees when ye consented to this article ye would have torn the article in pieces for by this article ye would have all the ancient laws of the realm to cease and those decrees come in their room or otherwise by your own article ye would condemn yourselves to be heretics  how ye be bewitched by these false papists why do ye suffer them to abuse you by their subtlety why do ye not send them to the king like errant traitors saying unto him most mighty prince we present here unto you heinous traitors against your majesty and great deceivers of us your true subjects we have erred and by ignorance have been seduced to ask we is it not what have pity on our ignorance and punish these abominable raitors  what was in your minds to ask such a thing as this and so presumptuously to fay we will have it i trust there be not in you so much malice and devilishness as the article contains but that you have been artfully suborned by wicked papists to ask you know not what  if you had asked that the word of god might be duly observed and kept in this realm all that be godly would have commended you but as you ask romish decrees to be observed there is no godly englishman that will consent to your article but clean contrary a great number of godly persons within this realm for the love of god be daily humble suitors to the kings majesty that he will weed out of his realm all popish decrees laws and canons and whatsoever else is contrary to gods word and is any of you so far from reason as to think he will hearken to you who say we will have romish laws and turn his ear from them who are humble suitors for gods word  from these few extracts which are taken from the archbishops answer to the first article the reader may judge in how admirable a way he answered the remaining fourteen the whole work indeed may be a model to those who wish to make themselves masters of that mode of reasoning which is adapted to the people  sect xvii the extensive correspondence abroad in which the archbishop was engaged and the many applications he received from all parts put him at this time about the year      on a scheme which he had greatly at heart  the union of all the protestant churches in europe  they were all united against the pretensions of the church of rome but in no other point were they perfectly harmonious their widest differences however regarded the sacraments divine decrees and church government on each of these heads they held their several opinions with obstinacy enough on all sides  of these dissentions the papists took the advantage let the protestants alone was the cry they will soon quarrel with the fame acrimony among themselves which they have already shown toward us and it will presently appear that there can be no criterion of religion nor peace to christendom but in the bosom of a mother church  such sarcastic reflections hurt the archbishop as he conceived they injured religion he earnestly wished therefore to remove this block of offense and to give the cause he revered that support which next to truth he thought union alone could give it how noble would be the coalition he would fay if all the members of protestantism should unite in one mode of church government and in one confession of faith  in the southern parts of france in holland and in germany the reformation flourished chiefly under calvin bullenger and melancthon to these eminent reformers the archbishop applied with much earnestness entreating them to join their endeavors with his in forwarding this great scheme and proposed england as a place where they might hold their consultations with the mod convenience and the most security the good archbishop wanted the experience of later times to convince him how great an impossibility he attempted he was not aware that when private judgment becomes the criterion it will show itself of course in different creeds in different modes of worship and in different forms of church government which latter will always take their complexion from the state  how little could be expected from this interview melancthons answer might early have convinced him that reformer in strong language applauded the primates intention and heartily wished it might succeed but added he the model you ought to go upon is certainly that confession of faith which we signed at ausburgh  however liberal that confession might be there was certainly no liberality in the imposition of it  calvin seems to have expected very little from this business he answers only in general terms he professes that he would cross ten seas with cheerfulness for the good of christendom or of the church of england alone but in the present case he pleads his inability and recommends the whole business to the hands of god  this reformer saw deeper into the affair than our good archbishop he not only saw the impracticability of it but probably thought with many other learned men that if the thing had even been practicable it was by no means advisable as different sects would naturally be a check on each other and might preserve the church of christ from those impurities which the despotism of the roman hierarchy had unquestionably introduced and which another despotic hierarchy might introduce again  during the course of this projected union a question arose of great importance and which indeed threw many difficulties in the very vestible of it the question was whether in drawing up a confession of faith definite or general terms should be adopted the primate with his usual candor pleaded for the greatest latitude let us leave the portal said he as wide as we can and exclude none whom it is in our power to comprehend he was opposed in this argument chiefly by melancthon who tho a mild and gentle reformer on most occasions wrote with too much animosity on this making up in zeal what he wanted in candor  here ended the projected union of the protestant churches the troublesome times which afterward broke out in england put an end to all farther thoughts of the design after the archbishop had labored in it full two years to no purpose  sect xviii but although the primates moderation failed of its effect abroad it had fuller scope among the sectaries at home  when the bible was first opened after men had so long been deprived of it they were satisfied with reading it simply and gathering from it a rule of life and manners overlooking questions of difficulty in the general comfort derived from its promises and troubling nobody with their particular opinions this is ever the golden age of religion but men soon begin to look higher the vulgar can read their bibles and learn their duty the learned must do something more they must unravel knotty points they must broach noveldoctrines which the people must be made to receive as points of importance they must contradict and oppose they must show themselves in short to be able champions of religion and fit to appear at the head of sectaries  much of this spirit had already gotten abroad in england and a variety of causes concurred in stirring it up besides the different tenets which began to appear among the english protestants themselves disgusted papists artfully threw in their subtleties and distinctions and a multitude of religionists from germany switzerland and holland led by their pastors brought over with them multifarious and contradictory creeds it was then as common for men to migrate for the fake of religion as it is now for the fake of trade in a word all this mass digesting together began to ferment  if sectaries united in leading principles and differing only in a few indifferent forms or speculative points would keep their opinions to themselves their differences as calvin seemed to think might serve the cause of religion instead of injuring it but the forwardness of teachers in imposing all their own whimsical dogmas on others instead of keeping to the great truths of religion is the grand mischief it is this which distracts the people who being thus accustomed to hear a different doctrine every day begin to think of religion itself which appears so variable an object with less reverence  much of this intemperate zeal had at this time possessed the teachers of religion and it became very evident that practical christianity had loft ground in proportion as the science of theology was more studied  to provide for the peace of the church in opposition to this growing evil the council appointed the archbishop to draw up a set of articles the affair was delicate the liberty of private judgment being the basis of the late secession from the church of rome every restraint upon it seemed an opposition to the leading principle of the reformation a restraint however on the clergy seemed to be no breach of liberty it was only what every church might justly impose nothing more therefore was intended on this occasion but to draw such a line as would keep pastors within the pale of their own congregations or at least prevent their disturbing the established church  among the various opinions which distracted men at this time besides the tenets of popery which were yet far from being silenced were those concerning justification faith good works free will and predestination  the doctrine of supererogation and the scandalous sale of indulgences had brought good works into such discredit that many well disposed teachers with a view to oppose this evil the more effectually laid the chief stress on faith the antinomian pastors refining on this denied the benefit of any works at all this again gave just offense to others who to rid themselves of this mischief ran into the other extreme and not content with showing the necessity of good works they inculcated their meritorious and sufficient efficacy  again on the topics of free will and predestination the same variety of opinions distracted the people some teachers left the will at perfect liberty others thought it more scriptural to allow it only free to sin while good works they conceived proceeded merely from the grace of god others again and in particular a sect styled the gospellers would admit no qualifying at all in the doctrine of predestination but resolved all into the absolute decrees of god  amidst this variety of doctrine the archbishop endeavored to draw up such a set of articles as would best provide for the peace of the church it was a nice affair and he thought it prudent on this occasion as he had done before on a similar one to use such moderation perhaps such welltimed ambiguity as might give as little offense as possible  such was the origin of that celebrated test of orthodoxy which is now known by the name of the    articles of the church of england those framed by the archbishop indeed consisted of    but in all succeeding settlements of the church what was now composed on this head was not only made the groundwork but was in many parts almost verbatim retained  in this work it is not known that the archbishop had any coadjutor it is improbable however that a man of his candor and modesty would engage in a work of this kind without many consultations with his friends and it is commonly supposed that ridley bishop of london was particularly useful to him ridley was a man of exemplary piety and learning and what was still more necessary in the present work a man of sound judgment and great moderation  the chief objection at this time of day against the articles seems to be their treating at all of matters of such mysterious import let us endeavor to settle as we please the doctrines of foreknowledge predestination and other points equally abstruse we shall find ourselves at the close of the argument only where we began as these deep questions however were the chief points debated at that time the archbishop was under a necessity of taking notice of them at this day it is less necessary and therefore articles accommodated to the present times would probably be formed on a different plan few will think the articles thus framed by archbishop cranmer in the infancy of the church are complete and perfect tho every candid person will see many difficulties that would follow an attempt to make them more so if such an attempt could be successfully prosecuted no doubt all good men would rejoice in it in the mean time they will admire the wisdom and moderation of that person who framed them as they are in the midst of so much prejudice confusion and contrariety of opinion  one of the most offensive articles to subscribers in general is the   th on predestination and election but its title is its most offensive part it is certainly to be wished that such doctrines had been left untouched as they seem to be matters only of private opinion but whatever were the archbishops real sentiments on this subject he seems to have been very hesitating and perhaps intentionally ambiguous in the imposition of them on others the severe doctrine of reprobation seems to be strongly disavowed under the pointed terms of a most dangerous downfall leading to desperation or unclean living and how it is possible to hold an absolute election without mixing with it the doctrine of reprobation is not easy to conceive yet still as if the article in the matter of election had gone too far it concludes with asserting that we must receive gods promises in such wise as they be generally set forth in holy scripture so that in fact the article fairly analyzed seems to assert nothing after all its circumlocution but that the doctrine of reprobation is very pernicious and that as to gods election and promises whatever may be said about them we must resolve all at last into a belief of what is generally said in scripture  but whatever imperfections the articles may really have they have been charged with many which they certainly have not of one very great instance of disingenuity i cannot forbear taking notice it is contained in a celebrated writer on english history whose acrimony on all occasions in which religion is concerned i have already remarked after throwing out many severe things against the spirit of the reformers at this time and giving his reader an idea of the articles which archbishop cranmer now composed care says he is taken to inculcate not only that no heathen however virtuous can escape an endless state of the most exquisite misery but also that any one who presumes to maintain that a pagan can possibly be saved is himself exposed to the penalty of eternal perdition humes hist   to vol iii p     is it edition   the article alluded to in this passage he tells us is the   th now the truth of the matter is that this article has nothing at all to do with the heathen world either here or hereafter it does not in any shape even hint at them the early reformers most probably supposed as all charitable christians do now that the heathen world were as much the objects of gods mercy as christians themselves and that christ who is called the lamb slain from the foundation of the world died for their sins as well as ours the article barely asserts that no religion can promise salvation to mankind except the christian which is so far from damning pagans that it virtually implies christ died for them as well as for us  sect xix nor was this good prelate so entirely engrossed by his cares for the general welfare of the church as not to pay a close attention to the particular affairs of his own province he made himself well acquainted with the characters of all the clergy in his district his visitations were not things of course but strict scrutinies into the state of ministers and their parishes in disposing of his benefices he endeavored as much as he could to suit the pastor to his flock after his death was found among his papers a list of several towns thus indorsed memorandum these towns to have learned ministers in these places it is probable he knew the people were more than commonly addicted to popery or that they had gotten among them some popish priests of more than ordinary subtlety who had misled them  he was very exact also in the residence of the clergy and granted dispensations with caution he had a strict eye also on their doctrine to some he recommended the homilies and to others proper topics for their discourses  he himself also preached often wherever he visited in his sermons to the people he was very plain and instructive insisting chiefly on the essentials of christianity in his sermons at court or on public occasions he would declaim with great freedom and spirit against the reigning vices of the times his idea however just seems to have been that the lower orders wanted principles more than practice and the higher practice more than principles  sir richard morrison a gentleman who had been much employed in embassies abroad both under henry the eighth and edward the sixth gives us this character of the archbishops sermons of which he was a frequent auditor the subjects of his sermons for the most part were from whence salvation is to be fetched and on whom the confidence of man ought to lean they insisted much on doctrines of faith and works and taught what the fruits of faith were and what place was to be given to works they instructed men in the duties they owed their neighbor and that every one was our neighbor to whom we might any way do good they declared what men ought to think of themselves after they had done all and lastly what promises christ has made and who they are to whom he will make them good thus he brought in the true preaching of the gospel altogether different from the ordinary way of preaching in those days which was to treat concerning saints  to tell legendary tales of them  and to report miracles wrought for the confirmation of transubstantiation and other popish corruptions and such a heat of conviction accompanied his sermons that the people departed from them with minds possessed of a great hatred of vice and burning with a desire of virtue  bishop burnet also who had seen the greatest part of a sermon which the archbishop had preached at court on a fast day in the year      tells us that it is a very plain impartial discourse without any show of learning or conceits of wit he severely expostulates in the name of god with his hearers for their ill lives their blasphemies adulteries mutual hatred oppression and contempt of the gospel and complains of the slackness of government in punishing these sins by which it became in some sort guilty of them  from this account of the archbishops preaching it seems that whatever speculative opinions he might hold no man could have a juster idea of the great truths of the gospel nor of those topics on which its ministers ought chiefly to insist  nor did his own diocese alone ingross his care his advice was generally taken in filling up vacant fees in his province he lived of course harmoniously with all his bishops and was seconded by them in all his schemes of reformation he recommended nothing more seriously to them than to examine candidates for holy orders with the greatest care and to follow the apostles advice in laying hands suddenly on no man  it was common at that time when any see became vacant for every courtier to be on the watch to procure some rich grant out of its temporalities the archbishop was as watchful on the other side and when any scheme of this kind was on foot he was generally successful in traversing it  he was commonly consulted also in the choice of irish bishops we have many of his recommendations still extant the foremost says he on an occasion of this kind of those i propose is mr whitebread of hadley whom i take for his good knowledge special honesty fervent zeal and polite wisdom to be most mete next to him mr richard turner who besides that he is witty and merry withal qualities not unbecoming the gravity of a clergyman if they be discretely used has nothing more at heart than jesus christ and his religion and in lively preaching of the word declares such diligence faithfulness and wisdom as for the same deserves much commendation there is also one mr whitacre a man both wise and well learned chaplain to the bishop of winchester very mete for that office if he might be persuaded to take it upon him  nor did the good primate confine his cares even to those of his own country he extended them to the reformers of all nations french dutch italians and spaniards who had fled to england on account of religion to him they all applied for that assistance which he readily afforded he was at great pains in forming them into different societies and in procuring churches and little establishments for them in which without any restraint they chose their own pastors and united in their own mode of worship  this kindness was afterward remembered and when england became a persecuted country contributed not a little to procure for its refugees in many places that generous treatment which it had once afforded  sect xx after a successful administration the protector somerset unhappily assuming too much consequence exposed himself to an envious party which had long been collecting against him it was formed under the machinations of the earl of warwick afterward duke of northumberland a man totally unprincipled guided only by his ambition and equally versed in the arts of attaching a party and supplanting a rival all the protectors friends one after another he drew from him by specious pretenses and when he made his first grand movement in the secession to ely house he had the pleasure to look round the assembly and see that scarce one man of consequence was absent except the archbishop of canterbury  him no arts of seduction could allure he knew northumberlands bad designs and somersets honest meanings each had ambition but while that of somerset was gratified with a few trivial trappings northumberlands dark schemes threatened ruin to the empire  nor was the primate merely neutral in this affair he wrote to the seditious chiefs at elyhouse with such a spirit as shook their resolutions and would have broken the confederacy had it been headed by a less daring leader than the duke of northumberland it appears from the primates letter that he was more intimately acquainted with those secret springs which governed their motions than they could have wished or supposed  but although the primates remonstrance probably checked northumberlands designs as his first maneuvers seem evidently marked with irresolution yet he gave way only to attack with greater vigor and in the end somerset tho allied to the crown shrouded by the affection of his prince the favor of the people and his own innocence was unable to grapple with the pernicious arts of this subtle rival and was brought to the scaffold for the foibles and inaccuracies of his life which were magnified into crimes  after the duke of somersets death the archbishop had no weight in public affairs northumberland was as little the patron of religion as he had hitherto been of public peace and tho he found it convenient to make protestantism his profession yet all men knew that neither it nor any species of religion had possession of his heart  the archbishop and he were never on terms often would cecil say your grace must temporize with this man or we shall do nothing as often would the primate answer he would endeavor to do his utmost but the integrity of his heart generally faltered in the attempt  it was a difficult matter indeed to keep terms with northumberland the archbishop had every reason to think him as much his own private enemy as the enemy of the public the ears of the young king were continually beset with the dukes insinuations and tho edward was not forward in listening to any stories against the primate yet enough was said to weaken all the counsels and defeat all the plans which he proposed  among the many mortifications which he met with from northumberland it went nearest his heart to see the little care that was taken in filling vacant fees and other great benefices of the church his own recommendations of proper persons had little weight and he was grieved to find all those low interests prevailing which would of course introduce great indifference among the ministers of religion it was the constant endeavor of northumberland to keep the king as little as possible acquainted with business of every kind and as much out of the way of those who were likely to give him information among all the old ministers none but cecil had access to the cabinet  cecil whose courtly arts carried him to the very limits of sincerity  perhaps rather beyond them with him the archbishop entrusted a list of such persons as he thought most proper to succeed to any vacancy and the wary minister by observing opportunities obtained preferment for many of them  the last affair of a public nature in which the archbishop was engaged during this short reign was the exclusion of the princess mary in favor of lady jane gray friend as he was to the reformation he opposed this violent measure with all his might and pleaded the oath he had taken in favor of the princess the whole power of northumberland had no weight with him the king himself who had been wrought into a thorough conviction of the utility of excluding his sister assailed him with every argument that tenderness and affection could suggest the primates constancy at length gave way and he consented to hear the matter explained by the judges of the realm the judges of the realm with great learning showed him that his late oath could not lawfully bind him the archbishop modestly professed his ignorance of law and took a new one while the friends of his memory wish they had any veil to throw over his conduct in this discreditable affair which became afterward indeed a source of the deepest affliction to himself  northumberlands great plan was now matured the king who had thus far been an instrument became from this time an encumbrance and was laid aside with as little ceremony as if he had been an actor in a drama thus at least run the suspicions of history  the kings death was a very sincere affliction to the archbishop not only as a public calamity but as a private loss the archbishop was his godfather and loved him with a parents affection and tho his high station would not allow him to take any part in the princes education yet cheke and all his other tutors thought themselves in some degree accountable to the archbishop and used to acquaint him with the progress of their royal pupil we have a letter from dr cox still preserved in which he tells the archbishop in the language of the times that the prince discovered great towardness and all honest qualities that he should be taken as a singular gift of god that he read cato vives and esop and that he conned very pleasantly  erasmuss character of him is rather curious erasmus seems to have known little more than that he was a very modest boy but as he was a king likewise the panegyrist thought it proper to cloth his sentiment for he had but one in great pomp and variety of expression senex juvenis convictu factus sum melior ac sobrietatem temperantiam verecundiam linguae moderationem modestiam pudicitiam integritatem quam juvenis a seen discere debuerat a juvene senex didici  sect xxi after the death of edward which happened in the summer of the year      we find the archbishop engaged in all the irresolute measures succeeding that period till the settlement of mary with the commencement of her reign his troubles began  when he observed the turn which affairs were likely to take one of the first things he did was to order his steward to pay every farthing that he owed saying in a short time perhaps we may not be able when the accounts and receipts were brought to him i thank god said he i am now mine own man and with gods help am able to answer all the world and all wordly adversities  he was first assaulted as is usual by calumny and invective a thousand stories were propagated which were founded commonly on some little known circumstance or occurrence and half the story being true gave a degree of credit to the other half which was false many of these reports he suffered to die away unnoticed leaving his life and actions to confute them but one which concerned the interests of religion he thought it proper to obviate in a public manner the affair was this  mass it seems had been said in the cathedral church of canterbury by some zealous priest immediately on the change of government and the report ran that it had been done by the archbishops order as indeed before any thing was legally altered it could not well be supposed otherwise many people believed it who were much hurt with it and the primate was surprised to find with what malicious expedition a story so wholly opposite to the character he had ever maintained could circulate not only among his enemies but among his friends  he determined therefore to stop it and immediately drew up and published a declaration in which he expressed his abhorrence of the mass as a species of idolatry  and professed his entire approbation of all the changes that had been made in the last reign this paper was considered by the advocates for reformation as an instance of true christian fortitude well becoming the first protestant ecclesiastic by worldly men it was looked on as a piece of indiscrete and intemperate zeal it was by his own indiscrete zeal that he brought on himself the first violence and persecution humess reign of mary chap i     it was however more than the temper of the government could bear the archbishop was called before the star chamber severely questioned and thrown into the tower the objected crime was treason but his late bold declaration had at least precipitated the measure the parliament made no difficulty in attainting him and indeed his compliance in the affair of lady jane was a very justifiable foundation for an attainder  this was a measure which was little expected by the archbishop and touched him nearer than any thing could have done if he had suffered for his doctrines he might have had the comfort of a good conscience but to suffer as an evildoer was a mortification he could not bear  it was true indeed that the queen had pardoned many who were more concerned in the late settlement of the crown in favor of lady jane than he had been few indeed who were at all obnoxious could be less so and his services to mary in the time of her father which were frequent and disinterested deserved surely a grateful remembrance but his remonstrances tho couched in the humblest and most penitent language had for some time no effect at length however he obtained his pardon most probably because it was more agreeable to the genius of the government that he should suffer for heresy than for treason on the former pretense he was still confined  he might however have avoided question either on one account or the other if he could have prevailed with himself to leave the kingdom as many churchmen had done even after his imprisonment he might probably have found the means of an escape some indeed imagined it was what his greatest enemies desired as the easiest means of getting the disposal of the fee of canterbury but from the beginning he never would think of flight and all the persuasions and tears of his friends were ineffectual had i been in any other station he would say except this in which providence has placed me i should certainly have fled i approve the flight of others if we are persecuted in one city we are authorized to fly to another but i am the only person in the kingdom who cannot do it with decency i have had the principal hand in all the changes of the last reign and i cannot without great impropriety avoid appearing in their defense  the gloomy temper of the government in the mean while became wholly apparent so much violence attended every proceeding in which religion was concerned that it was easy to foresee no measures either of charity or of decency would be observed the queen delighted in being called a virgin sent from heaven to revenge the cause of god under such a title nothing but bigotry superstition and all their dire effects could be expected  how well gardener who was her chief minister was qualified to correct the sternness of her temper may be conceived from an anecdote still preserved among the gross improprieties of those times his almoner going one day to the fleetprison then full of protestants with a basket of bread from the bishop forbad the keeper at his peril to give one morsel of it to any of the heretics if you do added he my lord will certainly do you some shrewd turn  rigorous however as mary was in the affairs of religion in state matters she was lenient enough no blood was shed but of those whose offenses placed them clearly beyond mercy  the duke of northumberland was the first victim than whom no man ever suffered more unlamented  the archbishop had the satisfaction to hear that his friend sir thomas palmer died in the protestant faith tho he had been persuaded with other stateprisoners to hear mass  palmer was one of the best bred men of the age in which he lived to his accomplishments both natural and acquired he had added the advantages of foreign travel which was rare in those days his youth had been spent with too much license and he had been greatly misled by the insidious arts of northumberland but in other respects he was well esteemed and in his latter life especially seems to have added the virtues of a christian to the accomplishments of a gentleman i have learned more said he as he stood on the scaffold in a dark corner of the tower than in traveling round europe then walking up to the ax stained with the blood of northumberland who had just suffered i thank god said he i am not afraid to die  sect xxii while this scene of blood was acting the archbishop continued in the tower still unmolested the lenity of the government toward him was matter of general surprise as the public commonly supposed he would have been the first victim but many things remained yet to be adjusted the great point however was to give a triumph to popery in a public disputation  in the year      a convocation met at st pauls by the queens order to settle the doctrine of the real presence by a fair and candid disquisition weston dean of westminster was chosen prolocutor a few articles were proposed for subscription and the disputation was adjourned to oxford where it was intended that the three bishops cranmer ridley and latimer should enter the lists with a select body of popish disputants  these fellow sufferers were all at that time confined together in a small apartment in the tower their straitened accommodations however were amply made up to them by the comfort of each others company they carried their bibles with them and on these they employed their prison hours fortifying their faith and extracting topics of consolation these are the scenes in which we are to look for the triumphs of religion where its great principles are firmly rooted in the heart human joys and human griefs and human fears are trivial things  the convocation had been adjourned to the end of the year      but the several members of it did not meet at oxford till the following april there also at the same time the three bishops were carried by the lord williams of them  from their treatment on this occasion it was easy to foresee what measures they were likely to expect they had hitherto been confined it is true in a very narrow compass but as the tower was then crowded with prisoners better accommodations could not well be allowed in other respects however they had received marks of attention what they wanted had been readily furnished and their own servants were suffered to attend them  but as soon as this new measure took place they experienced a different treatment the little baggage they had was stopped their servants were discharged they were conducted to oxford with ignominy and were thrown into the common jail  the time appointed for the grand disputation at length arrived delegates from both universities joined the members of convocation and the whole body to the number of thirtythree assembled at st marys church there being dressed in their academical robes they seated themselves in great state around the high altar and the archbishop was sent for he was brought into the church by the mayor and bailiffs under the guard of a company of billmen they who had known him in his better days saw him now greatly changed instead of that glow of health upon his cheek that brisk and active step which showed the vigor of his constitution he was now become through illusage and confinement a pale infeebled old man clad in a plain habit with a staff in his hand he came forward through an opening in the crowd paying the prolocutor and his assessors great respect they offered him a seat but he declined it  the prolocutor then addressed him on the happiness of religious unity and told him the intention of the present meeting was to draw him if possible again to the church these articles said he holding out a paper were agreed on by convocation which we hope you will have no objection to subscribe  the archbishop receiving the paper joined the prolocutor in a most ardent wish for christian unity when it could be obtained he said with a good conscience  having read the articles which contained the doctrine of the real presence drawn up according to the determination of the church of rome he shook his head and said he feared that paper would not afford a sufficient foundation for the religious unity which all so much desired he offered however if the paper were left in his hands to give a fuller answer to it by the next morning this was permitted at the same time it was agreed that each point of difference should afterward be the subject of a regular disputation  on the next day which was sunday the archbishop declared in writing his sense of the articles and the monday following was appointed to discuss the questions on which the two parties differed  i mean not however here to enter into a detail of this disputation which was carried into great length and at this day would be tedious uninteresting and uninstructive neither archbishop cranmer nor bishop ridley i think acted with so much propriety on this occasion as bishop latimer the papists it seems pushed them with the authority of the fathers some of whom talk of the sacrament of the lords supper in a language to speak slightly of it uncommonly figurative cranmer and ridley not caring to deny so respectable an authority seem to have been at a loss how to evade it while latimer with more christian simplicity rid himself of the difficulty at once i lay no stress on the fathers said he except when they lay a stress on scripture  at the close of the disputation the archbishop complained greatly of the shortness of the time allowed for discussing a subject of such importance and wished also that he might be allowed to oppose as well as to answer which was absolutely necessary he said in a fair discussion of a question but he was not heard on either of these points from which he observed it evidently appeared that nothing less was intended than a fair investigation of truth  but in whatever light the arguments of these protestant bishops may appear at this day their christian fortitude will ever be admired in their own times it was thought matter of great rejoicing and christian triumph soon after the disputation was over the three bishops received the following spirited letter from dr tailor in the name of all their suffering brethren  right reverend fathers in the lord i wish you to enjoy continually gods grace and peace through jesus christ and god be praised for this your most excellent promotion which ye are called unto at present that is that ye are counted worthy to be allowed among the number of christs records and witnesses england has had but a very few learned bishops that would stick to christ ad ignem once again i thank god heartily in christ for your most happy onset most valiant proceeding most constant suffering of all such infamies hissings clappings taunts open rebukes loss of living and liberty for the defense of gods cause truth and glory i cannot utter with pen how i rejoice in my heart for you three such captains in the foreward under christs cross in such a skirmish when not only one or two of our dear redeemers strong holds are besieged but all his chief castles ordained for our safeguard are traitorously impugned this your enterprise in the sight of all that be in heaven and of all gods people on earth is most pleasant to behold this is another sort of nobility than to be in the forefront in worldly warfares for gods sake pray for us for we fail not daily to pray for you we are stronger and stronger in the lord his name be praised and we doubt not but ye be so in christs own sweet school heaven is all and wholly of our side therefore gaudete in domino semper and iterum gaudete and exultate  your assured in christ rowland tailor   on the  0th of april      the archbishop was condemned from that time a more rigorous treatment than he had yet experienced took place it is said he was scarce allowed the necessaries of life tho it is probable such accounts may be exaggerated his wants however could not be well answered if we may judge from an anecdote still preserved which informs us that he received with great thankfulness a small supply of linen sent him privately by a friend in london  on the   th of november following a new parliament met which the protestants of those times supposed was made pliant by spanish gold but there is no occasion for the surmise parliaments in those days had little idea of opposing the inclinations of the court  by this parliament the popes legate was invited into england and on his arrival the nation was reconciled in form to the holy see the legate absolving all the perjuries scisms and heresies of which the parliament and the convocation had been guilty  after this religious affairs were modelled the latin service was restored the use of the scriptures abrogated and popish priests appeared in public with that consequence which the government allowed bishop ridley characterizing the times says papismus apud nos ubique in pleno suo antiquo robore regnat  among other instances of popish zeal the archbishop was informed that his book on the sacrament had been publicly burnt ah said he they have honored it more than it deserved i hear they burnt it with the new testament and indeed this was the fact for they burnt at the same time the late translation of the testament on the pretense that it was spurious  the convocation in the mean time petitioned for a revival of the sanguinary laws they had already been anticipated and several protestants had been put to death without any color of justice and when a member of the convocation with more candor than his brethren observed that the proceedings against these people could not be justified why then said the prolocutor tauntingly let their friends sue for redress  this parliament however put things on a different establishment and the favorers of persecution were now allowed legally to follow their inclinations  sect xxiii while the protestant sufferers were lingering in various prisons a very unseasonable dispute got footing among some of the warmest of them on the arduous subject of free will and predestination it was carried on with such animosity that confessions were drawn up on both sides and signed by numbers who were at that time even under sentence of death each party clamoured loud that their antagonists were likely to do more harm in the christian world than the papists themselves in as much as their opinions were as bad and their example much better nay to such a height of phrenzy did their contentions run that the keeper of the marshalsea was often obliged to separate them  during the course of this illtimed controversy the archbishop was applied to for his countenance by the predestinarians to whose tenets he was thought most inclined but the prudent primate discountenanced both parties as much as he could considering no doubt such controversies to be especially illjudged among dying men  nor were the endeavors of others wanting to calm the rage of this offensive zeal many of their more moderate brethren endeavored to set before them the impropriety of their behavior and one of them put the matter in a very strong light there should be no more bitterness said he in a christian controversy than in a love letter philpot afterward an eminent martyr wrote a very pathetic dissuasive to them on this subject exhorting them to meet each other with the kiss of charity  to reach out cheerfully the hand of peace  to take up their cross together and ascend mount calvary with hearts full of benevolence  i give a detail of this strange dispute both as a curious anecdote of human nature and as a very instructive lesson if a speculative opinion could fasten with so much violence and produce so much animosity in the minds of pious men suffering together in one common cause and even in the article as it were of death  how cautious ought they to be on polemical subjects who have perhaps less piety who live at their ease and are not tied by any of these strong obligations to forbearance  while the english protestants were thus suffering at home such of them as had the good fortune to escape abroad enjoyed more repose among the lutherans indeed they met with some unkind treatment their liberal tenets with regard to the lords supper were very disgusting to those reformers who still maintained the doctrine of transubstantiation the leaders however of the lutheran churches particularly melancthon who was a man of candor and moderation brought their hearers to a better temper and instructed the populace at wesel and francford where this inhospitable disposition chiefly appeared that although the english exiles might differ from them in a few points they were however embarked with them in the same common cause of religious liberty and ought certainly to be treated as brethren  at basil john fox designed and almost finished his acts and monuments of the church the industry of this man is astonishing he was principal corrector to one of the greatest printing houses in europe that of operin at basil but notwithstanding his daily employment he found leisure to carry on this vast work and what is still more tho he was not able to keep a servant to do his menial offices the whole was transcribed with his own hand from a work of this kind we are not led to expect any elegance yet they who have examined this writer with most accuracy have acknowledged that although his zeal may have led him into some exaggerated accounts where he relies only on hearsay yet in all matters where he appeals to authority or record he may be fully depended on  at strasburgh bishop jewel laid the plan of his excellent apology for the church of england tho he did not finish it till happier times  a work in which its many admirers found it hard to say whether candor and humanity or sense learning and a welltempered zeal for religion were more conspicuous  here too william turner physician to the protector somerset pubished a work entitled a dispensatory of spiritual physic it was levelled against the papists and was written with a sarcastic vein of humor such sallies of wit and ridicule tho rather below the dignity of suffering religion served however to divert the universal melancholy which reigned at that time turner published also another work of the same kind which he called the hunting of the romish fox  the celebrated scotch reformer john knox published also at this time an exhortation to the people of england suited to their calamitous state it abounds more with enthusiasm than manly sense knox had thus early put in his pretensions to a prophetic spirit which flowed afterward in more plentiful effusions from him  sect xxiv a full year had now elapsed since the archbishops disputation at oxford and condemnation for heresy during this interval the spirit of persecution with a fiery sword in one hand and a cross in the other was let loose in all its terrors the progress however of this violent reign marks only the almightys ordinary mode of providence when the christian religion was first preached the malice of its enemies immediately arose as if to try and prove it and seal its truth by the blood of its martyrs and now when religion was restored after so long an age of darkness the providence of god seemed to direct in the same manner that it should be purified and proved by persecution  among the numbers at this time who died for their religion were the bishops of london and worcester who were delivered over to the secular arm under a commission from pole the cardinallegate  as they were carried to the stake they passed under the window of the prison in which the archbishop was confined and looked up for a parting view the archbishop was engaged at that time in a conference with a spanish friar but hearing a tumult in the street he came to the window they were not yet out of sight he just lifted up his eyes and hands and sent after the venerable sufferers a fervent ejaculation for gods assistance in this last great trial  more ceremony however was thought necessary in the primates case than had been used in theirs poles authority was not sufficient a commission therefore was sent for to rome  in virtue of this commission the archbishop was convened before the bishop of gloucester to whom it was delegated on the   th of september      his books and opinions his marriage and invasion of the privileges of the sovereign pontiff were all summarily recapitulated and he was cited to appear at rome in eighty days and answer for himself as he did not appear in that time he was declared contumacious and a commission was dispatched to england to degrade and deliver him over to the secular arm  many of our historians exclaim loudly at the absurdity of declaring him contumacious for not appearing at rome when it was well known that during the whole time he was detained a prisoner at oxford and no doubt the thing bears the face of absurdity but it would be endless to censure and deride all the formalities of law which are pertinaciously retained in every country after the real use has expired  the ceremony of his degradation was performed by thirlby bishop of ely  thirlby in cranmers better days had been honored with his particular friendship and owed him many obligations besides those of greater value in the way of preferment there was nothing he was master of we are informed which was not at thirlbys command jewel plate instrument map horse or any thing else tho a present from the king if his friend once took a fancy to it the generous archbishop would immediately give it him and tho many times the doctor for civilitys sake would instantly refuse it yet cranmer would send it him the next day by a special message insomuch that it grew into a proverb that dr thirlbys commendation of any thing to my lord of canterbury was a plain winning or obtaining it  as this man therefore had long been so much attached to the archbishop it was thought proper by his new friends that he should give an extraordinary test of his zeal for this reason the ceremony of the degradation was committed to him he had undertaken however too hard a task the mild benevolence of the primate which shone forth with great dignity tho he stood dressed in all the mock pageantry of canvas robes struck the old apostate to the heart all the past came throbbing into his breast and a few repentant drops began to trickle down the furrows of his aged cheek the archbishop gently exhorted him not to suffer his private affections to overpower his public at length one by one the canvas trappings were taken off amidst the taunts and exultations of bonner bishop of london who was present at the ceremony the archbishop made some hesitation when they took his crozier out of his hands and appealed as others had done to the next general council  thus degraded he was attired in a plain friezegown the common habit of a yeoman at that time and had what was then called a townsmans cap put upon his head in this garb he was carried back to prison bonner crying after him he is now no longer my lord  he is now no longer my lord  full of that indignation which public wrongs not private inspired he wrote a letter from his prison to the queen in which he expostulated with her for sinking the dignity of the crown of england to such a degree as to have recourse to foreigners for justice on her own subjects he showed her with great force of reason the many inconveniences which arose from thus submitting to a foreign yoke and opened the designs of the clergy who had introduced he told her this slavery again with the sole view of establishing themselves in their ancient independent state he put her in mind also of the oath she had taken to her own kingdom and of the oath which she had taken to the pope and begged her to consider whether there was not some contradiction between them  he concluded with telling her that he thought it his duty to enter his protest against the destructive measures which her government was then pursuing  this letter was carried to the queen by the bailiffs of oxford she immediately put it into the hands of cardinal pole with whom she seems on all occasions to have left the disposal of her conscience pole in a letter dated from st jamess nov        answered it at full length his very elaborate discourse on this occasion makes the   th article of mr strypes appendix  from the time of cranmers degradation the behavior of the popish party toward him was totally changed every one who now approached him put on an air of civility and respect elegant entertainments were made for him he was invited frequently by the dean of christchurch to parties at bowls an exercise of which he had always been fond and no liberty or indulgence which he could desire was denied in the midst of these amusements he was given to understand that the queen was greatly disposed to save him but that she had often been heard to say she would either have cranmer a catholic or no cranmer at all  that in short they were authorized in assuring him that if he would only conform to the present changes in religion he might if he pleased assume his former dignity  or if he declined that he might enjoy a liberal pension in retirement  among all the instances of diabolical cruelty we scarce find a greater than this the whole rage of the popish party seemed to be centered against this upright man his soul they had damned his body they were determined to burn and to complete their triumph they wanted only to blast his reputation with this view these wicked arts were put in practice against him which succeeded alas too well cranmer who was sufficiently armed against the utmost rage and malice of his open enemies was drawn aside by the delusions of his false friends after the confinement of a full year within the melancholy walls of a gloomy prison this sudden return into social commerce dissipated the firm resolves of his soul a love of life which he had now well mastered began insensibly to grow upon him a paper was offered him importing his assent to the tenets of popery and in an evil hour his better resolutions giving way he signed the fatal snare  sect xxv cranmers recantation was received by the popish party with joy beyond expression it was immediately printed and published and their cruel work wanting now only its last finishing stroke a warrant was expedited for his execution as soon as possible while he himself was yet kept ignorant of their purpose  some writers say that the recantation was published unfairly and a modern attempt has been made to invalidate that recantation which the papists sent abroad see whistons enquiry into the evidence of archbishop cranmers recantation   but even on a supposition this had been the case as in some degree it probably might yet a very poor defense can be established on this ground cranmer certainly subscribed his assent to the tenets of popery in general terms and unless the zeal of his friends could rid his memory of that stain it is of little consequence to say he did not subscribe them in the detail a much better apology may be grounded on the weakness of human nature they who look into themselves must pity him and wish to throw over him the skirts of that tender veil with which the great friend of mankind once skreened the infirmities of the wellintentioned the spirit was willing but the flesh was weak  but no apology could vindicate him to himself in his own judgment he was fully convicted instead of that joy which gives serenity to the dying martyr his breast was a devoted prey to contrition and woe a rescued life afforded him no comfort he had never till now felt the power of his enemies stung with remorse and horror at what he had done he consumed his days and nights in anguish i have denied the faith i have pierced myself through with many sarrows were the melancholy notes which took possession of his mind and rang in his ears a constant alarm then would recur in a full tide of compunction the aggravating thoughts  that he who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing in the true faith should be among those who had deserted it  that he who had been so long the leader of others should now set them so dreadful an example  and that he who had always been looked up to with respect should at length be lost and abandoned among the herd of apostates  overwhelmed with grief and perplexity whichever way he turned his eyes he saw no ray of comfort left to persevere in his recantation was an insupportable thought to retract it was scarce possible his paper was abroad in the world and he himself was in the hands of men who could easily prevent his publishing or speaking any thing counter to it if they should suspect he had such an intention  he had yet received no intimation of his death tho it was now the  0th of march and by the purport of the warrant he was to be executed the next day  that evening dr cole one of the heads of the popish party came to him and from the insidious and ambiguous discourse of this person he had the first intimation tho yet no direct one of what his enemies intended  after cole had left him he spent the remaining part of the evening in drawing up a repentant speech together with a full confession of his apostasy resolving to take the best opportunity to speak or publish it which he supposed indeed the stake would first give him but beyond his expectation a better was afforded  it was intended that he should be carried immediately from prison to the stake where a sermon was to be preached but the morning of the appointed day being wet and stormy the ceremony was performed under cover  about nine oclock the lord williams of them attended by the magistrates of oxford received him at the prisongate and conveyed him to st marys church where he found a crowded audience waiting for him  he was conducted to an elevated place in public view opposite to the pulpit  he had scarce time to reflect a moment on the dreadful scene which he saw preparing for him when the vice chancellor and heads of houses with a numerous train of doctors and professors entered the church among them was dr cole who paying his respects to the vice chancellor ascended the pulpit  cole was a man of abilities and was considered according to the mode of those times as an elegant scholar his discourse indeed seems to have been an excellent piece of oratory  after a proper preface he showed the reasons why it was thought necessary to put the unhappy person before them to death notwithstanding his recantation on this head he dwelt largely and said full as much as so bad a cause could be supposed to bear then turning to his audience he very pathetically exhorted them to fear god and tremble taking occasion from the example before their eyes to remind them of the instability of all human things and of the great duty of holding fast their profession without wavering this venerable man said he once a peer a privycounsellor an archbishop and the second person in the realm renounced his faith and is now fallen below the lowest  he addressed himself last to the degraded primate himself he condoled with him in his present calamitous circumstances and exhorted him to support with fortitude his last worldly trial  cranmers behavior during this discourse cannot be better described than in the words of a person present who tho a papist seems to have been a very impartial spectator the letter from which most of the following account is taken was found among foxs mss and is taken notice of by strype   it is doleful says he to describe his behavior his sorrowful countenance his heavy cheer his face bedewed with tears sometimes lifting up his eyes to heaven in hope sometimes casting them down to the earth for shame to be brief he was an image of sorrow the dolor of his heart burst out continually at his eyes in gushes of tears yet he retained ever a quiet and grave behavior which increased the pity in mens hearts who unfeignedly loved him hoping it had been his repentance for his transgressions  the preacher having concluded his sermon turned round to the whole audience and with an air of great dignity desired all who were present to join with him in silent prayers for the unhappy man before them  a solemn stillness ensued every eye and every hand were instantly lifted up to heaven  some minutes having been spent in this affecting manner the degraded primate who had fallen also on his knees arose in all the dignity of sorrow and thus addressed his audience  i had myself intended to have desired your prayers my desires have been anticipated and i return you all that a dying man can give my sincerest thanks  to your prayers for me let me add my own  he then with great fervor of devotion broke out into this pathetic exclamation  o father son and holy ghost have mercy on me a miserable sinner i who have offended heaven and earth more grievously than tongue can express whither shall i fly for succor  on earth all refuge fails me toward heaven i am ashamed to lift my eyes  what shall i then do shall i despair  god forbid  o good god thou art merciful and refusest none who come unto thee for succor to thee therefore i fly before thee i humble myself  my sins are great have mercy upon me o blessed redeemer who assumed not a mortal shape for small offenses  who died not to atone for venial sins  accept a penitent heart tho stained with the foulest offenses have mercy upon me o god whose property is always to have mercy my sins are great but thy mercy is still greater  o lord for christs sake hear me  hear me most gracious god  while he thus prayed the people spontaneously caught the fervor and joined audibly with him the whole scene was highly solemn and affecting  having concluded his prayer he rose from his knees and taking a paper from his bosom continued his speech to this effect  it is now my brethren no time to dissemble i stand upon the verge of life  a vast eternity is before me  what my fears are or what my hopes it matters not here to unfold for one action of my life at least i am accountable to the world  my late shameful subscription to opinions which are wholly opposite to my real sentiments before this congregation i solemnly declare that the fear of death alone induced me to this ignominious action  that it has cost me many bitter tears  that in my heart i totally reject the pope and doctrines of the church of rome  and that   as he was continuing his speech the whole assembly was in an uproar lord williams gave the first impulse to the tumult crying aloud stop the audacious heretic on which several priests and friars rushing from different parts of the church with great eagerness seized him pulled him from his seat dragged him into the street and with much indecent precipitation hurried him to the stake which was already prepared executioners were on the spot who securing him with a chain piled the faggots in order round him  as he stood thus with all the horrid apparatus of death about him amidst taunts revilings and execrations he alone maintained a dispassionate behavior having now discharged his conscience his mind grew lighter and he seemed to feel even in these circumstances an inward satisfaction to which he had long been a stranger his countenance was not fixed as before in abject sorrow on the ground he looked round him with eyes full of sweetness and benignity as if at peace with all the world  a torch being put to the pile he was presently involved in a burst of smoke and crackling flame but on the side next the wind he was distinctly seen before the fire reached him to thrust his right hand into it and to hold it there with astonishing firmness crying out this hand has offended this hand has offended  when we see human nature struggling so nobly with such uncommon sufferings it is a pleasing reflection that through the assistance of god there is a firmness in the mind of man which will support him under trials in appearance beyond his strength  his sufferings were soon over the fire rising intensely around him and a thick smoke involving him it was supposed he was presently dead his patience in his torment says the author of the letter i have just quoted and his courage in dying if it had been in testimony of the truth as it was of falsehood i should worthily have commended and have matched it with the same of any father of ancient time surely his death grieved every one some pitied his body tormented by the fire others pitied his soul lost without redemption for ever his friends sorrowed for love his enemies for pity and strangers through humanity  the story of his hearts remaining unconsumed in the midst of the fire seems to be an instance of that credulous zeal which we have often seen lighted at the flames of dying martyrs  sect xxvi such was the end of thomas cranmer archbishop of canterbury in the   th year of his age after he had presided over the church of england above twenty years  in whatever point of light we view this extraordinary man he is equally the object of our admiration  his industry and attention were astonishing when we consider him as a scholar his learning was so profound and the treatises which he wrote were so numerous that we cannot conceive he had any time for business and yet when we consider the various scenes of active life in which he was engaged  in the council  in the convocation  in the parliament  in his diocese  and even in his own house where he had a constant resort of learned men or suitors we are surprised how he procured time for study  he never indeed could have gone through his daily employments had he not been the best oeconomist of his time  he rose commonly at five oclock and continued in his study till nine these early hours he would say were the only hours he could call his own after breakfast he generally spent the remainder of the morning either in public or private business his chapelhour was eleven and his dinnerhour twelve after dinner he spent an hour either in conversation with his friends in playing at chess or in what he liked better overlooking a chessboard he then retired again to his study till his chapelbell rang at five after prayers he generally walked till six which was in those times the hour of supper his evening meal was sparing often he eat nothing and when that was the case it was his usual custom as he sat down to table to draw on a pair of gloves which was as much as to say that his hands had nothing to do after supper he spent an hour in walking and another in his study retiring to his bedchamber about nine  this was his usual mode of living when he was most vacant but very often his afternoons as well as his mornings were engaged in business to this his chesshour after dinner was commonly first assigned and the remainder of the afternoon as the occasion required he generally however contrived if possible even in the busiest day to devote some proportion of his time to his books besides the morning and mr fox tells us he always accustomed himself to read and write in a standing posture esteeming constant sitting very pernicious to a studious man  his learning was chiefly confined to his profession he had applied himself in cambridge to the study of the greek and hebrew languages which tho esteemed at that time as the mark of heresy appeared to him the only sources of attaining a critical knowledge of the scriptures he had so accurately studied canon law that he was esteemed the best canonist in england and his reading in theology was so extensive and his collections from the fathers so very voluminous that there were few points in which he was not accurately informed and on which he could not give the opinions of the several ages of the church from the times of the apostles if i had not seen with my own eyes says peter martyr i could not easily have believed with what infinite pains and labor he had digested his great reading into particular chapters under the heads of councils canons decrees etc  his parts were solid rather than shining and his memory such that it might be called an index to the books he had read and the collections he had made  henry the eighth had such an opinion of him as a casuist that he would often say he could have no difficulty while cranmer was at his elbow and indeed we cannot better account for the constant regard which that capricious monarch showed him than by supposing it proceeded from the opinion the king had of the archbishops being so useful to him it was not an unusual thing for henry to send him a case of conscience at night and henrys conscience was very often troubled desiring an answer the next morning on such slender notice we are told the archbishop would often collect the opinions of twenty or thirty writers on the subject and within the limited time would send all the extracts together with his own conclusion on the whole  henry who was deeper in school divinity than in any other kind of learning would take great pleasure also in disputing with the archbishop and notwithstanding the roughness of his manners would often indulge that sort of familiarity which emboldened those about him to use freedom with him the archbishop at least was seldom under any difficulty on that head while the king on his part always paid much deference to the primates learning and abilities tho the primate was the only person to whom he did pay any deference and would sometimes do it at the expense of those who thought themselves on an equality with the most learned the bishop of winchester in particular the king would sometimes delight to mortify and to set him on the wrong side of a comparison with the archbishop  we have an instance preserved  the king once engaged the two prelates in a dispute on the authority of the apostolical canons in which he himself bore a part the archbishop sustained the negative as the dispute proceeded the king either sensible of the primates superiority or affecting to appear so cried out come come bishop winchester we must leave him we must leave him he is too old a truant for either of us  he was a sensible writer rather nervous than elegant his writings were entirely confined to the great controversy which then subsisted and contain the whole sum of the theological learning of those times  his library was filled with a very noble collection of books and was open to all men of letters i meet with authors here roger ascham would say which the two universities cannot furnish  at the archbishops death the greater part of his original mss were left at his palace of ford near canterbury where they fell into the hands of his enemies  in the days of elizabeth archbishop parker who had an intimation that many of them were still in being obtained an order from lord burleigh then secretary of state in the year      to search for them in all suspected places and recovered a great number of them they found their way afterward into some of the principal libraries of england but the greatest collection of them were deposited in bennetcollege in cambridge  sect xxvii but the light in which archbishop cranmer appears to most advantage is in that of a reformer conclucting the great work of a religious establishment for which he seems to have had all the necessary qualifications he was candid liberal and open to truth in a great degree many of his opinions he reconsidered and altered even in his advanced age nor was he ever ashamed of owning it which is in effect he thought being ashamed of owning that a man is wiser today than he was yesterday when his old tenets with regard to the lords supper were objected to him he replied with great simplicity i grant that formerly i believed otherwise than i do now and so i did until my lord of london dr ridley did confer with me and by sundry arguments and authorities of doctors draw me quite from my persuasion  to the opinions of others also he was very indulgent one fact indeed mentioned in his life the death of g paris is a glaring instance of the contrary something no doubt so good a man would have to say for himself if we could hear his plea in vindication of so barbarous and horrid a piece of bigotry but as the naked fact now stands we can only express our astonishment that a single action should so grossly run counter to every other action of his life  the uncommon caution of his temper likewise qualified him greatly as a reformer in his conversation he was remarkably guarded three words of his says lloyd could do more than three hours discourse of others in acting he always felt his ground as he proceeded and had the singular wisdom to forbear attempting things however desirable which could not be attained he rarely admitted any circumstances into his schemes which ought to have been left out and as rarely left out any which ought to have been admitted hence it was that he so happily accomplished the most difficult of all works that of loosening the prejudices of mankind hence it was also that the ground which he took was so firm as scarce to leave any part of the foundation he laid under the necessity of being strengthened  the sweetness of his manners also contributed not a little to the completion of his designs he was a man of a most amiable disposition his countenance was always enlightened with that cheerful smile that made every body approach him with pleasure it is indeed surprising how much he was beloved and how few enemies he made when we consider that his whole life was a constant opposition to the opinions and prejudices of the times whom he could not persuade he never disobliged a harsh measure he considered only as another name for an imprudent one when he could not go on smoothly he would retreat a few steps and take other ground till he perceived the obstruction was removed  the composure of his temper was another happy ingredient in his character as a reformer it was rarely on any occasion either raised or depressed his features were by no means an index to the times his most intimate friends could form no conjecture from his outward behavior which was always flowing with benignity whether he had met with any thing either in parliament or in council to disturb him  one can scarce on this occasion avoid a comparison between him and his successor archbishop laud both were good men  both were equally zealous for religion  and both were engaged in the work of reformation  i mean not to enter into the affair of introducing episcopacy in scotland nor to throw any favorable light on the ecclesiastical views of those times i am at present only considering the measures which the two archbishops took in forwarding their respective plans while cranmer pursued his with that caution and temper which we have just been examining laud in the violence of his integrity for he was certainly a wellmeaning man making allowances neither for men nor opinions was determined to carry all before him the consequence was that he did nothing which he attempted while cranmer did every thing and it is probable that if henry had chosen such an instrument as laud he would have miscarried in his point while charles with such a primate as cranmer would either have been successful in his schemes or at least have avoided the fatal consequences that ensued  but i speak of these things merely as a politician providence no doubt overruling the ways of men raises up on all occasions such instruments as are most proper to carry on its schemes sometimes by promoting and sometimes by defeating the purposes of mankind  sect xxviii nor was the good archbishop less formed for a private than a public station while we revere the virtues of the reformer we admire the minister of the gospel  his humility was truly apostolical he was averse to the sounding titles of the clergy and when these things among others were settled he would often say we might well do without them a familiar expression of his on an occasion of this kind was often afterward remembered he had signed himself in some public instrument as he was obliged indeed legally to do by the style of primate of all england at this the bishop of winchester took great offense intimating that there was no necessity for that innovation and throwing out a hint as if it were an encroachment on the kings supremacy god knows said the archbishop when he heard of the invidious things which winchester had said i value the title of primate no more than i do the paring of an apple the expression was afterward often quoted by those who were disinclined to all dignities in the church which they would call in contempt the parings of cranmers apples  the placability of his temper was equal to his humility no man ever possessed more christian charity the least sign of penitence in an enemy restored him immediately to favor and the archbishop was glad of an opportunity of showing the sincerity of his reconciliation this was so well known to be a part of his character that the archbishop of york having long in vain desired his concurrence in a business to which cranmer was averse well my lord said york if i cannot have my suit in one way i will in another i shall presently do your grace some shrewd turn and then i doubt not but i can manage so as to obtain my request  but the archbishops mildness and placability never appeared in so strong a light as when contrasted as they often were with the vehemence of henrys passions  a person of great rank at court who was the archbishops secret enemy and had oftener than once done him ill offices came to him one day to request his interest with the king the primate with great readiness undertook his cause do you know said the king suprized at his request for whom you are making suit are you acquainted with the mans disposilion toward you i always took him said the archbishop for my friend no replied the king he is your mortal enemy and so far am i from granting his rcquest that i command you when you see him next to call him knave the archbishop begged his majesty would not oblige him to use language so little becoming a christian bishop but henry vociferated again i command you i say to call him knave and tell him that i ordered you the primate however could not be persuaded by all his majestys eloquence to call the man knave and the king tho in great agitation at first was obliged at last to give up the matter with a smile  he was a very amiable master in his family and admirably preserved the difficult medium between indulgence and restraint he had according to the custom of the times a very numerous retinue among whom the most exact order was observed every week the steward of his household held a kind of court in the great hall of his palace in which all family affairs were settled servants wages were paid complaints were heard and faults examined delinquents were publicly rebuked and after the third admonition discharged  his hospitality and charities were great and noble equal to his station greater often than his abilities  a plentiful table was among the virtues of those days his was always bountifully covered in an upper room was spread his own where he seldom wanted company of the first distinction here a great many learned foreigners were daily entertained and partook of his bounty in his great hall a long table was plentifully covered every day for guests and strangers of a lower rank at the upper end of which were three smaller tables designed for his own officers and inferior gentlemen  the learned tremellius who had himself often been an eyewitness of the archbishops hospitality gives this character of it  archiepiscopi domus publicum erat doctis et piis omnibus hospitium quod ipse hospes mecoenas et pater talibus semper patere voluit quoad vixit aut potuit homo  nec minus   we have seen his character aspersed for want of hospitality see page  0   in part the aspersion might have arisen from an attempt he made with the assistance of the other bishops to regulate the tables of the clergy which had lately taken an expensive turn this expense was introduced by the regular clergy who could not lay aside the hospitable ideas of their monasteries tho a country benefice would by no means support them the regulations published on this occasion ordered that an archbishops table should not exceed six diverse kinds of flesh or as many of fish on fishdays  a bishops should not exceed five a deans four and none under that degree should exceed three in a second course an archbishop was allowed four dishes  a bishop three  all others two  as custards tarts fritters cheese apples and pears but if any inferior should entertain a superior either of the clergy or laity he might make provision according to the degree of his guest if any archbishop or other ecclesiastic entertained an ambassador his diet need not be limited  it was farther ordered that of the greater fish or fowl as haddoc pike tench cranes turkies swans there should only be one in a dish of less kinds as capons pheasants woodcocks but two of the still less fowls an archbishop might have three all under him only two  among other instances of the archbishops charity we have one recorded which was truly noble after the destruction of monasteries and before hospitals were erected the nation saw no species of greater misery than that of wounded and disbanded soldiers for the use of such miserable objects as were landed on the southern coasts of the island the archbishop fitted up his manorhouse of beckesburn in kent he formed it indeed into a complete hospital appointing a physician a surgeon nurses and every thing proper as well for food as physic nor did his charity stop here each man on his recovery was furnished with money to carry him home in proportion to the distance of his abode  to obviate all the cavils of the papists against archbishop cranmer would be to enter into the general argument against them his apostasy his marriage and his opinions are questions all of common controversy on the particular miscarriages of his life i have every where touched as they occurred and have by no means spared them when they appeared to deserve censure the general objection which seems to bear the heaviest upon him is founded on the pliancy of his temper saunders one of the bitterest of his enemies sarcastically calls him henricianus and his friends indeed find it no easy matter to wipe off these courtly stains without question many instances of great condescension in his character strike us but a blind submission to the will of princes was probably considered among the christian virtues of those days  on the other hand when we see him singly and frequently oppose the fury of an inflamed tyrant  when we see him make that noble stand against bigotry in the affair of the six articles  or when we see him the only person who durst inform a passionate and jealous prince of the infidelity of a favorite wife we cannot but allow there was great firmness in his character and must suppose that he drew a line in his own conscience to direct him in what matters he ought and in what matters he ought not to comply with his princes will  he left behind him a widow and children but as he always kept his family in obscurity for prudential reasons we know little about them they had been kindly provided for by henry the eighth who without any solicitation from the primate himself gave him a considerable grant from the abbey of welbeck in nottinghamshire which his family enjoyed after his decease king edward made some addition to his private fortune and his heirs were restored in blood by an act of parliament in the reign of elizabeth  the end
