an essay on musical expression  by charles avison organist in newcastle  with alterations and large additions  to which is added a letter to the author concerning the music of the ancients and some passages in classic writers relating to that subject  likewise mr avisons reply to the author of remarks on the essay on musical expression in a letter from mr avison to his friend in london  the third edition  london printed for lockyer davis in holborn printer to the royal society mdcclxxv  advertisement as there are several musical terms which will frequently occur in the course of this essay and which are not always sufficiently attended to it may therefore be necessary for the sake of those who are not particularly conversant in music to explain them according to their most general acceptance  and first the term melody may be defined the means or method of ranging single musical sounds in a regular progression either ascending or descending according to the established principles  harmony is the method of ranging two or more concording musical sounds or the agreeable union of them in several parts when sung or played together as therefore a continued succession of single musical sounds produces melody so does a continued combination of these produce harmony  modulation is the effect of single or concording musical sounds succeeding one another in an arbitrary but agreeable progression passing from one key to another and therefore does as well relate to combined as to single musical sounds  by the word key is meant a regular succession of any eight natural notes the lowest note being considered as the principal is therefore called the keynote all the other notes in that key being subordinate to it  cadences in music are the same as stops in speaking or writing being in like manner the proper terminations either of a part or of the whole of a composition  the term subject or fugue or air is in a musical sense what the word subject likewise implies in writing the term air in some cases includes the manner of handling or carrying on the subject  passages in music are also like sentences or paragraphs in writing this last term has sometimes been used to denote graces or extempore flourishings only but in this latter sense we shall never consider it the former definition being more strictly just according to its original acceptance and therefore more applicable to the intention of this essay  music is said to be in score when all the parts are distinctly wrote and set under each other so as the eye at one view may take in all the various contrivances of the composer  contents part i sect i on the force and effects of music page   sect ii on the analogies between music and painting    part ii on musical composition sect i on the too

concerning the music of the ancients     mr avisons reply to the author of remarks etc     an essay on musical expression part i sect i on the force and effects of music as the public inclination for music seems every day advancing it may not be amiss at this time to offer a few observations on that delightful art such observations i mean as may be chiefly applicable to the present times such as may tend to correct any errors that have arisen either in the composition or the practice of music  if we view this art in its foundations we shall find that by the constitution o man it is of mighty efficacy in working both on his imagination and his passions the force of harmony or melody alone is wonderful on the imagination a ful chord struck or a beautiful succession of single sounds produced is no less ravishing to the ear than just symmetry or exquisite colors to the eye  the capacity of receiving pleasure from these musical sounds is in fact a peculiar and internal sense but of a much more refined nature than the external senses for in the pleasures arising from our internal sense of harmony there is no prior uneasiness necessary in order to our tasting them in their full perfection neither is the enjoyment of them attended either with languor or disgust it is their peculiar and essential property to divest the soul of every unquiet passion to pour in upon the mind a silent and serene joy beyond the power of words to express and to fix the heart in a rational benevolent and happy tranquillity  but though this be the natural effect of melody or harmony on the imagination when simply considered yet when to these is added the force of musical expression the effect is greatly increased for then they assume the power of exciting all the most agreeable passions of the soul the force of sound in alarming the passions is prodigious thus the noise of thunder the shouts of war the uproar of an enraged ocean strike us with terror so again there are certain sounds natural to joy others to grief or despondency others to tenderness and love and by hearing these we naturally sympathize with those who either enjoy or suffer thus music either by imitating these various sounds in due subordination to the laws of air and harmony or by any other method of association bringing the objects of our passions before us especially when those objects are determined and made as it were visibly and intimately present to the imagination by the help of words does naturally raise a variety of passions in the human breast similar to the sounds which are expressed and thus by the musicians art we are often carried into the fury of a battle or a tempest we are by turns elated with joy or sunk in pleasing sorrow rouzed to courage or quelled by grateful terrors melted into pity tenderness and love or transported to the regions of bliss in an extacy of divine praise  but beyond this i think we may venture to assert that it is the peculiar quality of music to raise the sociable and happy passions and to subdue the contrary ones i know it has been generally believed and affirmed that its power extends alike to every affection of the mind but i would offer it to the consideration of the public whether this is not a general and fundamental error i would appeal to any man whether ever he found himself urged to acts of selfishness cruelty treachery revenge or malevolence by the power of musical sounds or if he ever found jealousy suspicion or ingratitude engendered in his breast either from harmony or discord i believe no instance of this nature can be alleged with truth it must be owned indeed that the force of music may urge the passions to an excess or it may fix them on false and improper objects and may thus be pernicious in its effects but still the passions which it raises though they may be misled or excessive are of the benevolent and social kind and in their intent at least are disinterested and noble lest the two passions abovementioned of terror and grief should be thought an exception to this rule it may not be improper to remark as to the first that the terror raised by musical expression is always of that grateful kind which arises from an impression of something terrible to the imagination but which is immediately dissipated by a subsequent conviction that the danger is entirely imaginary of the same kind is the terror raised in us when we stand near the edge of a precipice or in sight of a tempestuous ocean or are present at a tragical representation on the stage in all these cases as in that of musical expression the sense of our security mixes itself with the terrible impressions and melts them into a very sensible delight as to the second instance that of grief it will be sufficient to observe that as it always has something of the social kind for its foundation so it is often attended with a kind of sensation which may with truth be called pleasing   as i take this to be the truth of the case so it seems to me no difficult matter to assign a sufficient reason for it we have already seen that it is the natural effect of air or harmony to throw the mind into a pleasurable state and when it has obtained this state it will of course exert those powers and be susceptible of those passions which are the most natural and agreeable to it now these are altogether of the benevolent species inasmuch as we know that the contrary affections such as anger revenge jealousy and hatred are always attended with anxiety and pain whereas all the various modifications of love whether human or divine are but so many kinds of immediate happiness from this view of things therefore it necessarily follows that every species of musical sound must tend to dispel the malevolent passions because they are painful and nourish those which are benevolent because they are pleasing  the most general and striking instance of the power of music perhaps that we know of is that related of the arcadians by polybius in the fourth book of his history which as it expressly coincides with the subject in question i shall venture to give the reader entire  this judicious historian speaking of the cruelties exercised upon the cynaethians by the aetolians and the little compassion that their neighbors had shown them after having described the calamities of this people abhorred by all greece adds the following remarks as the arcadians are esteemed by the greeks not only for the gentleness of their manners their beneficence and humanity toward strangers but also for their piety to the gods it may not be amiss to examine in few words with regard to the ferocity of the cynaethians how it is possible being incontestable arcadians from their origin they are become so much distinguished by their cruelty and all manner of crimes from the other greeks of this time i believe it can only be imputed to their having been the first and sole people of all the arcadians who were estranged from the laudable institutions of their ancestors founded upon the natural wants of all those who inhabit arcadia  the study of music i mean that which is worthy the name has its utility everywhere but it is absolutely necessary among the arcadians for we must not adopt the sentiment of ephorus who in the beginning of his writings advances this proposition unworthy of him that music is introduced amongst men as a kind of enchantment only to deceive and mislead them neither should we imagine that it is without reason that the ancient people of crete and lacedaemon have preferred the use of soft music in war to that of the trumpet or that the arcadians in establishing their republic although in other respects extremely austere in their manner of living have shown to music so high a regard that they not only teach this art to their children but even compel their youth to a study of it to the age of thirty these facts are notoriously known it is also known that the arcadians are almost the only people among whom their youth in obedience to the laws habituate themselves from their infancy to sing hymns and paeans as is usual among them to the honor of the gods and heroes of their country they are likewise taught the airs of philoxenus and timotheus after which every year during the feasts of bacchus this youth are divided into two bands the one consisting of boys the other of their young men who to the music of flutes dance in their theaters with great emulation celebrating those games which take their names from each troop even in their assemblies and parties of pleasure the arcadians divert themselves less in conversation or relating of stories than in singing by turns and inviting each other reciprocally to this exercise it is no disgrace with them to own their ignorance of other arts but they cannot deny their ability in singing because at all events they are necessitated to acquire this talent nor in confessing their skill can they exempt themselves from giving proofs of it as that would be deemed amongst them a particular infamy besides this at the care and expense of the public their youth are trained in dancing and military exercises which they perform to the music of flutes and every year give proof of their abilities in the presence of their fellowcitizens  now it seems to me that the first legislators in forming such kind of establishments have not had any design of introducing luxury and effeminacy but that they have chiefly had in view the way of living among the arcadians which their manual and toilsome exercises rendered extremely laborious and severe and the austere manners of this people to which the coldness and severity of the air in almost every part of arcadia did greatly contribute  for it is natural to partake of the quality of this element thence it is that different people in proportion to the distance which separates them differ from each other not only in their exterior form and color but also in their customs and employments the legislators therefore willing to soften and temper this ferocity and ruggedness of the arcadians made all those regulations which i have here mentioned and instituted besides these various assemblies and sacrifices as well for the men as for the women and also dances for their children of both sexes in a word they contrived all kinds of expedients to soften and assuage by this culture of their manners the natural rudeness and barbarity of the arcadians  but the cynaethians who inhabit the most rude and savage parts of arcadia having neglected all those helps of which on that account they had so much the more occasion and being on the contrary subject to mutual divisions and contests they are at length become so fierce and barbarous that there is not a city in greece where such frequent and enormous crimes are committed as in that of cynaetha  an instance of the unhappy state of this people and of the aversion of all the arcadians to their form of government is the treatment that was shown to their deputies which they sent to the lacedaemonians after the horrible massacre in cynaetha in all the towns of arcadia which these deputies entered immediate notice was given by an herald that they should instantly depart but the inhabitants of mantinea after the departure of these envoys went so far as to purify themselves by expiatory sacrifices and to carry the victims round the city and its territories to purify both the one and the other  we have related all these things first that other cities may be prevented from censuring in general the customs of the arcadians or lest some of the people of arcadia themselves upon false prejudices that the study of music is permitted them only as a superficial amusement should be prevailed upon to neglect this part of their discipline in the second place to engage the cynaethians if the gods should permit to humanize and soften their tempers by an application to the liberal arts and especially to music for this is the only means by which they can ever be dispossessed of that ferocity which they have contracted see dissertation ou lon fait voir que les merveilleux eff attribuez a la music des anciens ne prouvent point quelle fut aussi parfaite que la notre par m burette memoires de literature tirez des registres de l academie royale des inscriptions and belles lettres tom septieme whence the above fragment of polybius is translated  in the fifth seventh and eleventh vols of the holland edition of this collection the reader will find several entertaining and curious tracts on the subject of music       still farther to confirm what is here advanced on the power of music in raising the social and nobler passions only i wi transcribe a passage from the celebrated baron de montesquieu  this learned and sensible writer animadverting on the severe institutions of the ancients in regard to manners having referred to several authorities among the greeks on this head particularly to the relation of polybius above quoted proceeds thus  in the greek republics the magistrates were extremely embarrassed they would not have the citizens apply themselves to trade to agriculture or to the arts and yet they would not have them idle they found therefore employment for them in gymnastic and military exercises and none else were allowed by their institution hence the greeks must be considered as a society of wrestlers and boxers now these exercises having a natural tendency to render people hardy and fierce there was a necessity for tempering them with others that might soften their manners for this purpose music which influences the mind by means of corporeal organs was extremely proper it is a kind of medium between the bodily exercises that render men fierce and hardy and speculative sciences that render them unsociable and sour it cannot be said that music inspired virtue for this would be inconceivable but it prevented the effects of a savage institution and enabled the soul to have such a share in the education as it could never have had without the assistance of harmony let us suppose among ourselves a society of men so passionately fond of hunting as to make it their sole employment these people would doubtless contract a kind of rusticity and fierceness but if they happened to receive a taste for music we should quickly perceive a sensible difference in their customs and manners in short the exercises used by the greeks excited only one kind of passions viz fierceness anger and cruelty but music excites them all it is able to inspire the soul with a sense of pity lenity tenderness and love our moral writers who declaim so vehemently against the stage sufficiently demonstrate the power of music over the soul  if the society abovementioned were to have no other music than that of drums and the sound of the trumpet would it not be more difficult to accomplish this end than by the more melting tones of softer harmony the ancients were therefore in the right when under particular circumstances they preferred one mode to another in regard to manners  but some will ask why should music be pitched upon preferable to any other entertainment it is because of all sensible pleasures there is none that less corrupts the soul spirit of laws vol i p        the fact the baron speaks of seems to confirm what is here said on the power of music for we see that music was applied by the greeks to awaken the nobler passions only such as pity lenity tenderness and love but should a state apply music to give a roughness of manners or inspire the contrary passions of hardheartedness anger and cruelty it would certainly miss its aim notwithstanding that the baron seems to suppose the contrary for he has not alleged any instance or any kind of proof in support of his supposition it is true as he observes in the second paragraph that the sound of drums or trumpets would have a different effect from the more melting tones of softer harmony y still the passions raised by these marti founds are of the social kind they man excite courage and contempt of death but never hatred or cruelty  sect ii on the analogies between mus and painting from this short theory we shou now proceed to offer a few observatio relating to composition  but as musical composition is know to very few besides the professors an composers of music themselves and a there are several resemblances or analogies between this art and that of painting which is an art much more obviou in its principles and therefore more generally known it may not be amiss t draw out some of the most striking o these analogies and by this means i some degree at least give the common reader an idea of musical composition  the chief analogies or resemblances that i have observed between these two noble arts are as follow    st they are both founded in geometry and have proportion for their subject and though the undulations of air which are the immediate cause of sound be of so subtle a nature as to escape our examination yet the vibrations of musical strings or chords from whence these undulations proceed are as capable of mensuration as any of those visible obects about which painting is conversant    dly as the excellence of a picture epends on three circumstances design olouring and expression so in music he perfection of composition arises from melody harmony and expression meody or air is the work of invention and therefore the foundation of the other wo and directly analagous to design in ainting harmony gives beauty and rength to the established melodies in the same manner as coloring adds life to a just design and in both cases the expression arises from a combination of the other two and is no more than a strong and proper application of them to the intended subject melody thus distinguished as the foundation of a musical composition and compared to design in painting has been thought by some a vague and indeterminate analogy because harmony rather than lody ought to be esteemed the highest excellence of every musical work yet though this be admitted it may still justly be said that melody is in realit the groundwork as it is the first principle which gages the composers attention  thus to strike out a musical subject and to carry i into various melodies may be compared to the  sketches or outlines in a picture this i conceive i what the painters call design and thence these lead principles may be called the foundation of every finishe piece in either of the arts  therefore wherever i speak of harmony in the course of this essay i do not consider it as the fi but most important circumstance which adorns an supports the whole performance       dly as the proper mixture of ligh and shade called by the italians chiar oscuro has a noble effect in painting and is indeed essential to the compositio of a good picture so the judicious mixture of concords and discords is equally essential to a musical composition as shades are necessary to relieve the eye which is soon tired and disgusted with a level glare of light so discords are necessary to relieve the ear which is otherwise immediately satiated with a continued and unvaried strain of harmony we may add for the sake of those who are in any degree acquainted with the theory of music that the preparations and resolutions of discords resemble the soft gradations from light to shade or from shade to light in painting    thly as in painting there are three various degrees of distances established viz the foreground the intermediate part and the offskip so in music there are three different parts strictly similar to these viz the bass or foreground the tenor or intermediate and the treble or offskip in consequence of this a musical composition without its bass is like a landscape without its foreground without its tenor it resembles a landscape deprived of its intermediate part without its treble it is analagous to a landscape deprived of its distance or offskip we know how imperfect a picture is when deprived of any of these parts and hence we may form a judgment of those who determine on the excellence of any musical composition without seeing or hearing it in all its parts and understanding their relation to each other    thly as in painting especially in the nobler branches of it and particularly in historypainting there is a principal figure which is most remarkable and conspicuous and to which all the other figures are referred and subordinate so in the greater kinds of musical composition there is a principal or leading subject or succession of notes which ought to prevail and be heard through the whole composition and to which both the air and harmony of the other parts ought to be in like manner referred and subordinate    thly so again as in painting a groupe of figures care is to be had that there be no deficiency in it but that a certain fullness or roundness be preserved such as titian beautifully compared to a bunch of grapes so in the nobler kinds of musical composition there are several inferior subjects which depend on the principal and here the several subjects as in painting the figures do are as it were to sustain and support each other and it is certain that if any one of these be taken away from a skillful composition there will be found a deficiency highly disagreeable to an experienced ear yet this does not hinder but there may be perfect composition in two three four or more parts in the same manner as a groupe may be perfect though consisting of a smaller or greater number of figures in both cases the painter or musician varies his disposition according to the number of parts or figures which he includes in his plan    thly as in viewing a picture you ought to be removed to a certain distance called the point of sight at which all its parts are seen in their just proportions so in a concert there is a certain distance at which the sounds are melted into each other and the various parts strike the ear in their proper strength and symmetry to stand close by a bassoon or doublebass when you hear a concert is just as if you should plant your eye close to the foreground when you view a picture or as if in surveying a spacious edifice you should place yourself at the foot of a pillar that supports it  lastly the various styles in painting  the grand  the terrible  the graceful  the tender  the passionate  the joyous  have all their respective analogies in music  and we may add in consequence of this that as the manner of handling differs in painting according as the subject varies so in music there are various instruments suited to the different kinds of musical compositions and particularly adapted to and expressive of its several varieties thus as the rough handling is proper for battles sieges and whatever is great or terrible and on the contrary the softer handling and more finished touches are expressive of love tenderness or beauty so in music the trumpet horn or kettledrum are most properly employed on the first of these subjects the lute or harp on the last there is a short story in the tatler no      which illustrates this analogy very prettily several eminent painters are there represented in picture as musicians with those instruments in their hands which most aptly represent their respective manner in painting  part ii on musical composition sect i on the too close attachment to air and neglect of harmony these observations being premised for the sake of those who are not particularly conversant in the theory of music let us now proceed to consider this art with regard to its composition  we have already observed that there are properly speaking but three circumstances on which the worth of any musical composition can depend these are melody harmony and expression when these three are united in their full excellence the composition is then perfect if any of these are wanting or imperfect the composition is proportionably defective the chief endeavor therefore of the skillful composer must be to unite all these various sources of beauty in every piece and never so far regard or idolize any one of them as to despise and omit the other two  several examples will hereafter be given of considerable masters who through an excessive fondness for one of these have sacrificed the rest and have thus fallen short of that perfection and variety which a correct ear demands  the first error we shall note is where the harmony and consequently the expression is neglected for the sake of air or rather an extravagant modulation  the present fashionable extreme of running all our music into one single part to the utter neglect of all true harmony is a defect much more essential than the neglect of modulation only inasmuch as harmony is the very cement of all musical composition  as in the work of harmony chiefly the various contrivances of a good composition are laid out and distinguished which with a full and perfect execution in all the parts produce those noble effects we often find in grand performances so we may consider the improvement of air as the business of invention and taste  but if we may judge from the general turn of our modern music i speak not of the english only this due regard as well to a natural succession of melodies as to their harmonious accompanyments seems generally neglected or forgotten hence that deluge of unbounded extravaganzi which the unskillful call invention and which are merely calculated to show an execution without either propriety or grace  in these vague and unmeaning pieces we often find the bewildered composer either struggling with the difficulties of an extraneous modulation or tiring the most consummate patience with a tedious repetition of some jejune thought imagining he can never do enough till he has run through every key that can be crowded into one movement till at length all his force being exhausted he drops into a dull close where his languid piece seems rather to expire and yield its last than conclude with a spirited and welltimed cadence  these kinds of compositions are greatly defective also in point of harmony and chiefly in the bass which is often impertinently airy or at best incapable of giving either spirit or fullness to the treble in both cases the composer not allotting to the bass the only part which it ought to bear in the whole construction viz the foundation of all the rest  a musical composition in this light may not unaptly be compared to the elevation of a building where it is easy to discern what are the proportions and ornaments suitable to each degree or ascent in the elevation and where the most common observer would laugh at seeing their order inverted and the heavy and plain tuscan crushing down the light and delicate ionic  thus they strive rather to surprise than please the hearer and as it is easier to discern what is excellent in the performance than composition of music so we may account why many have been more industrious to improve and distinguish themselves in the practice than the study of this science  to this silly vanity we may attribute that strange attachment to certain unmeaning compositions which many of our fluent performers have professed their chief ambition being to discover a swift rather than a judicious or graceful hand that performers of this taste have so much in their power is at once the misfortune and disgrace of music for whatever merit a composition may have in other respects yet if from a due regard to the construction of the harmony and fugues all the parts be put upon a level and by that means their supreme pride and pleasure of a tedious solo be not admitted it is with them a sufficient reason of condemning the whole  the generality of our musical virtuosi are too easily led by the opinions of such masters and where there is no real discernment prejudice and affectation will soon assume the place of reason thus through the inordinate vanity of a few leading performers a disproportionate fame has been the lot of some very indifferent composers while others with real merit have been almost totally unknown  it may be worth considering from whence this false taste has had its rise and   st it may perhaps be affirmed with truth that the false taste or rather the total want of taste in those who hear and who always assume to themselves the privilege of judging has often produced this low species of music for it must be owned that this kind of composition is apt above all others at first hearing to strike an unskillful ear and hence the masters have often sacrificed their art to the gross judgment of an indelicate audience  but   dly it has often had its rise from the composers bestowing his labor and attention on some trifling and unfruitful subject which can never allow of an easy and natural harmony to support it for however pleasing it may seem in its air yet if it is not capable of admitting also a pleasing accompanyment it were much better laid aside than carried into execution on this account it is that many fugues are unsufferably tedious their barren subjects affording no variety in themselves are therefore often repeated entire or transposed or turned topseyturvey insomuch that little else is heard throughout the whole piece i know it is a received opinion among the connoisseurs in music that the best subjects for fugues or airs are pretty much exhausted and perhaps their observation may be right nevertheless the skillful composer will so artfully vary and conduct them that they will seem not only natural but also new  this may be seen by certain particular favorite passages that are to be found in almost all the compositions of our greatest masters  i would not be understood to mean here those slavish imitations of whole movements together especially of many of corellis which show their composers so destitute of all invention or contrivance as not to strike out one thought or device that can justly be called original       dly another source and perhaps the most general is that low idea of composition wherein the subject or air is no sooner led off than it is immediately deserted for the sake of some strange unexpected flights which have neither connection with each other nor the least tendency to any design whatever this kind of random work is admirably calculated for those who compose without abilities or hear without discernment and therefore we need not wonder that so large a share of the music that has of late appeared should fall under this denomination  how different from the conduct of these superficial adventurers in music is that of the able and experienced composer who when he has exerted his fancy on any favorite subject will reserve his sketch till at his leisure and when his judgment is free he can again and again correct diminish or enlarge his plan so that the whole may appear though severly studied easy and natural as if it flowed from his first attempt  ut sibi quivis speret idem sudet multum frustraque laboret ausus idem tantum series juncturaque pollet  such fiction would i raise as all might hope to imitate with ease yet while they strive the same success to gain should find their labor and their hopes are vain such grace can order and connection give hor art poet ver   0 francis   many extempore thoughts thrown out in the fire and strength of imagination have stood this critical review and filled the happy author with uncommon transport it is then he gains fresh vigor and renews his toil to range and harmonize the various melodies of his piece corelli employed the greatest part of his life in revising and correcting his works which the many grand and beautiful contrivances in his harmony may sufficiently evince   it may be proper now to mention by way of example on this head the most noted composers who have erred in the extreme of an unnatural modulation leaving those of still inferior genius to that oblivion to which they are deservedly destined  of the first and lowest class are vivaldi tessarini alberti and loccatelli whose compositions being equally defective in various harmony and true invention are only a fit amusement for children nor indeed for these if ever they are intended to be led to a just taste in music  under the second class and rising above these last mentioned in dignity as they pay somewhat more of regard to the principles of harmony may be ranked several of our modern composers for the opera such are hasse porpora terradellas and lampugniani though i must take the liberty to say that besides their too little regard to the principles of true harmony they are often defective in one sense even with regard to air i mean by an endless repetition of their subject by wearing it to rags and tiring the hearers patience  of the third and highest class of composers who have run into this extreme of modulation are vinci bononcini astorgo and pergolese the frequent delicacy of whose airs is so striking that we almost forget the defect of harmony under which they often labor their faults are lost amidst their excellencies and the critic of taste is almost tempted to blame his own severity in censuring compositions in which he finds charms so powerful and commanding  however for the sake of truth it must be added that this taste even in its most pardonable degree ought to be discouraged because it seems naturally to lead to the ruin of a noble art we need only compare the present with past ages and we shall see a like catastrophe in the art of painting for as an ingenious writer very justly remarks while the masters in this fine art confined the pencil to the genuine forms of grace and greatness and only superadded to these the temperate embellishments of a chastised and modest coloring the art grew toward its perfection but no sooner was their attention turned from truth simplicity and design than their credit declined with their art and the experienced eye which contemplates the old pictures with admiration surveys the modern with indifference or contempt brownes essays on the characteristics p   0  painting was arrived at the summit of perfection when music was far behind and but slowly advancing though greatly encouraged and admired the works of palestina in that infantstate of music may be considered as the first lights of harmony while those of raphael his contemporary and fellowcitizen not only excelled the several eminent masters that went before him but to this day remain unequalled painting since that period has undergone various changes and is now far short of the preeminence which perhaps it once had above its sisterarts in regard to music that also from the time of palestina to the present has been subject to a series of alterations both in its style and method of composition but if we except the interruption it has found from a national bad taste in some parts of europe it seems upon the whole rather to have gradually improved   sect ii on the too close attachment to harmony and neglect of air having noted the reigning defect of the modern composers arising from their superficial use of modulation to the utter neglect of all true harmony the next thing that offers itself is the very reverse of this i mean the too severe attachment of the ancients by the ancients are meant those who lived from the time of palestina to the introduction of modern operas to harmony and the neglect of modulation the old masters in general discover a great depth of knowledge in the construction of their harmony their subjects are invented and carried on with wonderful art to which they often add a considerable energy and force of expression yet we must own that with regard to air or modulation they are often defective our old cathedral music is a sufficient proof of this here we generally find the more striking beauties of air or modulation give way to a dry rule of counterpoint many an elaborate piece by this means instead of being solemn becomes formal and while our thoughts by a natural and pleasing melody should be elevated to the proper objects of our devotion we are only struck with an idea of some artificial contrivances in the harmony  thus the old music was often contrived to discover the composers art as the modern is generally calculated to display the performers dexterity  the learned contrapuntist may exercise his talent in many wonderful contrivances as in fugues and canons of various subjects and parts etc but where the master is thus severely intent in showing his art he may indeed amuse the understanding and amaze the eye but can never touch the heart or delight the ear  i have often thought that the state of music at different times might very appositely be compared to the series of alterations in the art of building we cannot indeed with the same certainty and precision determine what may have been the perfection of music in its original state among the ancients yet the short analogy which follows may serve to evince that both these arts have varied according to the taste of particular ages  it is well known that in old greece and rome architecture was in its highest perfection and that after their several empires were overthrown these glorious monuments of their taste and genius were almost entirely destroyed to these succeeded a strange mixture of the antique and barbarous gusto which has since been distinguished by the name of gothic in these latter ages this art has gradually returned to its former state and the ancient relish of the grand the simple and convenient is revived  and thus we may distinguish the three great aeras of music  amongst the ancients the true simplicity of melody with perhaps some mixture of plain unperplexed harmony seems to have been that magic spell which so powerfully enchanted every hearer  at the revival of this art in the time of pope gregory a new system and new laws of harmony were invented and afterward enlarged by guido aretino but this served only to lead the plodding geniuses of those times and since their rigid followers to incumber the art with a confusion of parts which like the numerous and trifling ornaments in the gothic architecture was productive of no other pleasure than that of wondering at the patience and minuteness of the artist and which like that too by men of taste has long been exploded in the reign of queen elizabeth and james i the musicians were famous for composing lesons etc in forty parts see fasti oxon under the articles bird and bull   at present our taste is greatly more diversified more subjected to the genius and language of particular countries and less confined by those rigorous laws the least deviation from which was formerly thought an unpardonable offense as if those laws were intended to fix the boundaries of genius and prevent the advancement of science  but as we have said the art though still fluctuating has now gained much freedom and enlargement from these minute and severe laws and is returning nearer to its ancient simplicity the most eminent composers of late years have not shown any great fondness for a multiplicity of parts which rather destroy than assist the force and efficacy of music neither have they deprived the charms of melody of their peculiar province by stunning the ear with an harmony too intricate and multifarious and i believe upon a general survey of the particular genius of different masters we shall find that those who have the least of nature in their compositions have generally endeavored to supply the want of it by the severer application of art  yet i would by no means be thought to include all the old masters in this censure some of them have carried musical composition to that height of excellence that we need think it no disgrace to form our taste of counterpoint on the valuable plans they have left us numbers of these indeed have fallen and deservedly into oblivion such i mean who had only the cold assistance of art and were destitute of genius but there are others of this class who although the early period in which they wrote naturally exposed them to the defect here noted yet the force of their genius and the wonderful construction of their fugues and harmony has excited the admiration of all succeeding ages and here we shall find that the composers of this class will naturally fall into three different ranks in the same manner as those we have already ventured to characterize in the preceding section  among these palestina the first not only in point of time palestina lived at rome in the time of leo the tenth the period at which all arts revived  but of genius too deserves the high title of father of harmony and the style of our great old master tallis tallis was chapelmaster in henry the eighths time  evidently shows he had studied the works of this great composer who lived to see his own system of harmony take root and flourish in many parts of europe but more especially in italy where he was immediately succeeded by several eminent masters among whom perhaps allegri may be esteemed the chief whose compositions with those of palestina are still performed in the popes chapel and other choirs abroad in all these masters we see the same grand construction of parts and a parallel defect of modulation  after these we may rank carissimi stradella stradella is supposed to have been one of the first composers who introduced the recitative into vocal compositions purcel not long after him aimed at something like that species of music not then known in england but whether he had any connection with the italian is doubtful it is certain however this excellent master was possessed of all those qualities that are requisite to form a great composer and we may venture to say had the genius of purcel been assisted with such an intercourse as we have had since his time wih the best masters abroad he might have stood eminent perhaps among the greatest  in his airs there is a mixture of harmony and fancy that sets him far above the rest of his countrymen in fine what cowley and waller united may be esteemed among the poets such may purcel be thought among the musicians    and steffani authors of a much later date indeed and who lived also at different times yet their works though in general of the same character with those of palestina are not perhaps of so high a class in one respect nor so low in another i mean that although their character is that of excellence in harmony and defect in air yet they are not so excellent in the former nor so defective in the latter as the venerable palestina  from the time of these masters to the present there has been a succession of many excellent composers who seeing the defects of those who preceded them in the too great neglect of air have adorned the noblest harmonies by a suitable modulation yet still so far retaining the style of the more ancient compositions as to make the harmonic construction the leading character of their works while the circumstance of modulation remains only as a secondary quality such are the chaste and faultless corelli the bold and inventive scarlatti domenico scarlatti author of some excellent lessons for the harpsichord and son to the scarlatti here mentioned may justly be ranked among the great masters of this age the invention of his subjects or airs and the beautiful chain of modulation in all these pieces are peculiarly his own and though in many places the finest passages are greatly disguised with capricious divisions yet upon the whole they are original and masterly  the sublime caldara the graceful and spirited rameau we cannot form an adequate idea of the genius of this master from his concertos for the harpsichrd alone though excellent in their kind but from his  chiefly which as yet i believe are but little known in england  as in this species of composition the undertaking is great and extensive so the composers skill or inability will in proportion be distinguished  hence it is we are instantly charmed with the happy talent of rameau his choruses airs and duetts are finely adapted to the various subjects they are intended to express in the first he i noble and striking in the latter cheerful easy and flowing and when he would sooth most expressively tender besides among these are interspersed a variety of dances and other instrumental pieces which agreeably relieve the ear from too severe an attention to the vocal and therefore render these operas of rameau more complete and entertaining than many others of character that may excel them only in some particular circumstance     to these we may justly add our illustrious handel in whose manly style we often find the noblest harmonies and these enlivened with such a variety of modulation as could hardly have been expected from one who has supplied the town with musical entertainments of every kind for thirty years together the celebrated lulli of france and the old scarlatti at rome may be considered in the same light with handel they were both voluminous composers and were not always equally happy in commanding their genius yet upon the whole they have been of infinite service in the progress of music and if we take away from their numerous works all that is indifferent there will still enough remain that is excellent to give them a distinguished rank  it is pretty remarkable that the three masters here mentioned have perhaps enjoyed the highest local reputation having all been the reigning favorites among the people in the several countries where they resided and thence have been regarded as standing models of perfection to many succeeding composers  the italians seem particularly indebted to the variety and invention of scarlatti and france has produced a rameau equal if not superior to lulli the english as yet indeed have not been so successful but whether this may be owing to any inferiority in the original they have chose to imitate or to a want of genius in those that are his imitators in distinguishing perhaps not the most excellent of his works it is not necessary here to determine     these seem to be the principal authors worthy the attention of a musical enquirer who have regarded the harmonic system and the construction of fugues as the principal object of their care while at the same time they have regarded the circumstance of modulation so far as to deserve a very high degree of praise on this account though not the highest  sect iii on musical expression so far as it relates to the composer so much concerning the two branches of music air and harmony let us now consider the third circumstance which is expression this as has been already observed arises from a combination of the other two and is no other than a strong and proper application of them to the intended subject  from this definition it will plainly appear that air and harmony are never to be deserted for the sake of expression because expression is founded on them and if we should attempt any thing in defiance of these it would cease to be musical expression still less can the horrid dissonance of catcalls deserve this appellation though the expression or imitation be ever so strong and natural  and as dissonance and shocking sounds cannot be called musical expression so neither do i think can mere imitation of several other things be entitled to this name which however among the generality of mankind has often obtained it thus the gradual rising or falling of the notes in a long succession is often used to denote ascent or descent broken intervals to denote an interrupted motion a number of quick divisions to describe swiftness or flying sounds resembling laughter to describe laughter with a number of other contrivances of a parallel kind which it is needless here to mention now all these i should choose to style imitation rather than expression because it seems to me that their tendency is rather to fix the hearers attention on the similitude between the sounds and the things which they describe and thereby to excite a reflex act of the understanding than to affect the heart and raise the passions of the soul  here then we see a defect or impropriety similar to those which have been above observed to arise from a too particular attachment either to the modulation or harmony for as in the first case the master often attaches himself so strongly to the beauty of air or modulation as to neglect the harmony and in the second case pursues his harmony or fugues so as to destroy the beauty of modulation so in this third case for the sake of a forced and if i may so speak an unmeaning imitation he neglects both air and harmony on which alone true musical expression can be founded  this distinction seems more worthy our notice at present because some very eminent composers have attached themselves chiefly to the method here mentioned and seem to think they have exhausted all the depths of expression by a dextrous imitation of the meaning of a few particular words that occur in the hymns or songs which they set to music thus were one of these gentlemen to express the following words of milton  their songs divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven it is highly probable that upon the word divide he would run a division of half a dozen bars and on the subsequent part of the sentence he would not think he had done the poet justice or risen to that height of sublimity which he ought to express till he had climbed up to the very top of his instrument or at least as far as a human voice could follow him and this would pass with a great part of mankind for musical expression instead of that noble mixture of solemn airs and various harmony which indeed elevates our thoughts and gives that exquisite pleasure which none but true lovers of harmony can feel  were it necessary i might easily prove upon general principles that what i now advance concerning musical imitation is strictly just both because music as an imitative art has very confined powers and because when it is an ally to poetry which it ought always to be when it exerts its mimetic faculty it obtains its end by raising correspondent affections in the soul with those which ought to result from the genius of the poem but this has been already shown by a judicious writer vide three treatises of j h the second concerning poetry painting and music  with that precision and accuracy which distinguishes his writings to his excellent treatise i shall therefore refer my reader and content myself in this place with adding two or three practical observations by way of corollary to his theory    st as music passing to the mind through the organ of the ear can imitate only by vide page    in the above treatise sounds and motions it seems reasonable that when sounds only are the objects of imitation the composer ought to throw the mimetic part entirely amongst the accompanying instruments because it is probable that the imitation will be too powerful in the voice which ought to be engaged in expression alone or in other words in raising correspondent affections with the part i cannot bring a finer illustration of my meaning than from the old song in acis and galatea hash ye pretty warbling quire your thrilling strains awake my pains and kindle soft desire etc here the great composer has very judiciously employed the vocal part in the nobler office of expressing with pathos the plaintive turn of the words while the symphony and accompanyment very cheerfully imitate the singing of the warbling quire but had mr handel admitted this imitation of ound into the vocal part and made it imitate the thrilling strains of the birds by warbling divisions it is manifest the expression would have been much injured whereas according to his management of it the imitation greatly assists the expression  indeed in some cases expression will coincide with imitation and may then be admitted universally as in such chromatic strains as are mimetic of the grief and anguish of the human voice as to take mr hs own example the chorus of baals priests in deborah doleful tidings how ye wound  but to the imitation of sounds in the natural or inanimate world such as the noise of animals the roar of thunder ocean etc the murmur of streams  this i believe may be applied as a general rule    dly when music imitates motions the rythm and cast of the air will generally require that both the vocal and instrumental parts coincide in their imitation but then be it observed that the composer ought always to be more cautious and reserved when he applies this faculty of music to motion than when he applies it to sound and the reason is obvious the intervals in music are not so strictly similar to animate or inanimate motions as its tones are to animate or inanimate sounds notes ascending or descending by large intervals are not so like the stalking of a giant mr h has himself quoted a passage in acis and galatea  see what ample strides he takes as imitative of the walk of polypheme but i apprehend the majesty of that air rather affected him by an association of ideas than any great similarity in the imitation  an association of this kind seems to have struck the author of the parallele des italiens et des francois en ce qui regard la music pour la conformite says he de lair avec le sens des paroles je nay jamais rien entendu en matiere de symphonies de comparable a celle qui fut executee a rome a loratoire de s jerome de la charity le jour de la saint martin de lannee      sur ces deux mots mill saette mill fleches cetoit un air dont les notes etoient pointees a la maniere des gigues le caractere de cet air imprimoit si vivement dans lame lidee de fleche et la force de cette idee seduisoit tellement limagination que chaque violon paroissoit etre un arc and tous les archets autant de fleches decochees dont les points sembloient darder la symphonie de toutes parts on ne sauroit entendre rien de plus ingenieux and de plus heureusemeut exprime  we may learn from this how far musical imitation simply considered may amuse the fancy of many who are less susceptible of the more delicate and refined beauties of expression  the particular felicity of the frenchman in the musical performance here described seems to have depended on this similitude viz that every violin appeared as a bow and all the bows like so many arrows shot off the points of which seemed to dart the symphony through all its parts perhaps so far as imitation was necessary his observation might be just but were this an argument that the business of imitation was superior to every other in musical composition it would reduce the noblest species of it still lower than the extravaganzi of the instrumental performances which we have noted in the chapter on modulation    as a flow of even notes are to the murmuring of a stream here let me quote with pleasure the air which mr handel has adapted to those charming words of milton hide me from days garish eye while the be with honied thigh at her flowery work does sing and the waters murmuring with such concert as they keep entice the dewyfeatherd sleep and let some strange mysterious dream wave at his wings in airy stream of lively portraiture displayed softly on my eyelids laid then as i wake sweet music breathe above about and underneath sent by some spirit to mortals good or the unseen genius of the wood here the air and the symphony delightfully imitate the humming of the bees the murmuring of the waters and express the ideas of quiet and slumber but what above all demands this eulogium is the masterstroke of accompanying the voice with trebles and tenors only till he comes to these words then as i wake sweet music breathe where the bass begins with an effect that can be felt only and not expressed  i have chosen to give all my illustrations on this matter from the works of mr handel because no one has exercised this talent more universally and because these instances must also be most universally understood    and little jiggish slurrs are less like the nod of alexander with ravished ears the monarch hears assumes the god affects to nod and seems to shake the spheres in which air i am sorry to observe that the affectation of imitating this nod has reduced the music as much below the dignity of the words as alexanders nod was beneath that of homers jupiter  than certain shakes and trills are to the voice of the nightingale vide il penseroso sweet bird that shuns the noise of folly most musical most melancholy      dly as music can only imitate motions and sounds and the motions only imperfectly it will follow that musical imitation ought never to be employed in representing objects of which motion or sound are not the principal constituents thus to light or lightning we annex the property of celerity of motion yet it will not follow from thence that an extremely swift progression of notes will raise the idea of either one or the other because as we said the imitation must be in these cases very partial what shall we say to excuse this same great composer who in his oratorio of joshua condescended to amuse the vulgar part of his audience by letting them hear the sun stand still  again it is one property of frost to make persons shake and tremble yet a tremulous movement of semitones will never give the true idea of frost though perhaps they may of a trembling person    thly as the aim of music is to affect the passions in a pleasing manner and as it uses melody and harmony to obtain that end its imitation must never be employed on ungraceful motions or disagreeable sounds because in the one case it must injure the melody of the air and in the other the harmony of the accompanyment and in both cases must lose its intent of affecting the passions pleasingly    thly as imitation is only so far of use in music as when it aids the expression as it is only analogous to poetic imitation when poetry imitates through mere natural media hs treatises p  0  so it should only be employed in the same manner to make the sound echo to the sense in descriptive lyric and perhaps in the cooler parts of epic poetry is often a great beauty but should the tragic poet labor at showing this art in his most distressful speeches i suppose he would rather flatten than inspirit his drama in like manner the musical composer who catches at every particular to give but one instance how many composers has the single epithet wareling misled from the true road of expression like an ignis fatuus and bemired them in a pun epithet or metaphor that the part affords him to show his imitative power will never fail to hurt the true aim of his composition and will always prove the more deficient in proportion as his author is more pathetic or sublime  what then is the composer who would aim at true musical expression to perform i answer he is to blend such an happy mixture of air and harmony as will affect us most strongly with the passions or affections which the poet intends to raise and that on this account he is not principally to dwell on particular words in the way of imitation but to comprehend the poets general drift or intention and on this to form his airs and harmony either by imitation so far as imitation may be proper to this end or by any other means but this i must still add that if he attempts to raise the passions by imitation it must be such a temperate and chastised imitation as rather brings the object before the hearer than such a one as induces him to form a comparison between the object and the sound for in this last case his attention will be turned entirely on the composers art which must effectually check the passion the power of music is in this respect parallel to the power of eloquence if it works at all it must work in a secret and unsuspected manner in either case a pompous display of art will destroy its own intentions on which account one of the best general rules perhaps that can be given for musical expression is that which gives rise to the pathetic in every other art an unaffected strain of nature and simplicity whatever the state of music may have been among the ancient greeks etc or whether it was actually capable of producing those wonderful effects related of it we cannot absolutely determine seeing all the uses of their enharmonic scale are totally lost and of their musical characters which should have conveyed to us their art slender traces any where to be found from the structure of their instruments we cannot form any vast ideas of their powers calmets dissertation sur la music des anciens they seem to have been far inferior to those in use at present but which indeed being capable of as much execution as expression are only rendered more liable to be abused thus the too great compass of our modern instruments tempting as well the composer as performer to exceed the natural bounds of harmony may be one reason why some authors have so warmly espoused the cause of the ancient music and run down that of the modern sir william temples works  st vol fol p       i believe we may justly conclude that the force and beauties of the ancient music did not consist so much in artful compositions or in any superiority of execution in the performance as in the pure simplicity of its melody which being performed in unisons by their vast choruses of voices and instruments no wonder the most prodigious effects were produced bonet histoire de la music  since the time of guido aretino aretino lived in the eleventh century  the laws and principles of harmony have been considerably enlarged and by rendering this art more intricate and complex have deprived it of those plain though striking beauties which probably almost every hearer could distinguish and admire and i dont know whether this will not go some way toward determining the dispute concerning the superior excellency of ancient and modern music it is to be observed that the ancients when they speak of its mavelous effects generally consider it as an adjunct to poetry now an art in its progress to its own absolute perfection may arrive at some intermediate point which is its point of perfection considered as an art joined to another art but not to its own when taken separately if the ancients therefore carried melody to its highest perfection it is probable they pushed the musical art as far as it would go considered as an adjunct to poetry but harmony is the perfection of music as a single science hence then we may determine the specific difference between the ancient and modern compositions and consequently their excellency     there is no doubt but many rules may be deduced both from the compositions of the best masters and from experience in observing the effects which various sounds have upon the imagination and affections and i dont know whether the same propriety in regard to the part of expression in poetry may not as well be applied to musical expression since there are discordant and harmonious inflections of musical sounds when united and various modes or keys besides the various instruments themselves which like particular words or sentences in writing are very expressive of the different passions which are so powerfully excited by the numbers of poetry soft is the strain when zepbyr gently blows and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows but when loud surges lash the sounding shore the hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw the line too labors and the words move slow not so when swift camilla scours the plain flies over the unbending corn and skims along the main hear how timotheus varied lays surprise and bid alternate passions fall and rise while at each change the son of libyan jove now burns with glory and then melts with love now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow  persians and greeks like turns of nature found and the worlds victor stood subdued by sound the power of music all our hearts allow and what timotheus was is dryden now essay on criticism perhaps the powers of passion and verse were never so happily exerted for the purpose of music as in this ode and as happily has the genius of the composer alexanders feast set to music by g f handel been united with that of the poet     thus the sharp or flat key slow or lively movements the staccato the sostenute or smoothdrawn bow the striking diesis or quarter tone or less if performed by the voice or violin being an interval in the enharmonic scale of the ancients and amazingly powerful in rousing the passions  this interval is equally capable in judicious hands of exciting terror grief despondency or the contrary passions in their extremes and the very wide difference in this case is chiefly produced from their different accompanyments and the particular modulations in which they are employed    all the variety of intervals from a semitone to a tenth etc the various mixtures of harmonies the preparation of discords and their resolution into concords the sweet succession of melodies and several other circumstances besides these do all tend to give that variety of expression which elevates the soul to joy or courage melts it into tenderness or pity fixes it in a rational serenity or raises it to the raptures of devotion  when we consider the fullness of harmony and variety of air which may be included in the art of composing fugues we may pronounce this species of composition of all others the most noble and diffusive and which like historypainting does not only contain the chief excellencies of all the other species but is likewise capable of admitting many other beauties of a superior nature but here in the term fugue i do not include alone those confined compositions which proceed by regular answers according to the stated laws of modulation but chiefly such as admit of a variety of subjects particularly for voices and instruments united and which with their imitations reverses and other relative passages are conducted throughout the whole in subordination to their principal and as the lesser beauties or decorations in poetry are subservient to the fable of a tragedy or heroic poem so are these different though kindred airs in the same movement in like manner subservient to some one principal design and productive of all the grandeur beauty and propriety that can be expected from the most extensive plan in the whole range of musical composition  by a diversity of harmonies the chain and progression of melodies is also finely supported and thence a greater variety of expression will be found in the construction of full music in this case the composer has the advantage of throwing his tender and delicate passages into the solo or those of a bolder expression into the chorus and as there are oftentimes a kind of neutral airs if i may so call them which by the performers art may be made expressive of very different passions or as the same words by a change in their accent convey a different sense so this musical expression may be varied in such a manner that the same passage which has been heard alone if repeated may also be formed into chorus and e contra the chorus into solo in like manner may be disposed the forte and piano  we may also here remark that in ranging different movements in the same concerto or in other suites of different airs the confined order of keeping in the sequel of these to one or two keys at most produces but an irksome monotony of sounds for it is not sufficient that different movements are of different species their changes should also appear as well in their keys as in their air and the composer of taste will show his art in the arrangement of these different pieces as well as in his variety of modulation or other contrivances in the same piece such are the beautiful cantatas of battista pergolese printed at naples in the year      they are perhaps the most elegant performances in this species of composition that have yet appeared  the cantatas of giovanni bononcini published in london by subscription above thirty years ago are also very fine and may still be called modern though many performers who hear and see no farther than the most perishable part of a composition have given them up to an exploded taste nevertheless i shall venture to say that the airs of bononcini are natural and the accompanied recitative masterly and finely imagined in their progression to the tempogiusto or regular movement i dont know any method of accompanyment with the voice more delicate and affecting than this in which the italians especially the two great masters here noted are peculiarly happy  porporas cantatas deserve also a particular mention in this place the most agreeable changes in modulation from one movement to another may be found in many of these his masterpieces the adagios are generally indeed too much lengthened by which means they are rather tedious when repeated from the da capo and notwithstanding i have thought the subjects in them pleasing and have heard them very finely performed yet could i never be convinced that their author had learned the art of knowing when he had done enough     and as discords when judiciously managed give their succeeding concords a yet more pleasing harmony in like manner some happy contrivance in changing the key of separate movements whether from flat to sharp or vice versa will still in a higher degree afford relief and pleasure to the hearer many alterations of this kind may surely be affected without the least disagreeable surprise since we are not always delighted when the modulation follows as we naturally expect it nor always shocked when that expectation is disappointed  thus by contrivances of this nature we are charmed with an agreeable variety and which perhaps equally to the most striking air commands the admiration of many lovers of music who yet can no otherwise account for the preference they may give to a fine composition than purely from the pleasure it affords them in fine it is this masterly taste and method of ranging in beautiful order the distinguished parts of a composition which gives the highest delight to those who can enter into the real merits of this art  a circumstance the musical student would do well to consider before he engages in any trial of his talent that way but as example is of much greater force than any rule or precept whatever i would recommend to him a constant perusal of the best compositions in score where he will find all the information he can desire on this head the musical student being here supposed to have some previous knowledge in the rudiments of harmony it might not be amiss before he attempts the more finished parts to take a particular survey of rameaus principles of composition now translated into english for however prevailing a good ear may be found in the practice of composition yet the rules of this art as in all other arts are founded in nature and therefore must afford great assistance even to those who may think but slightly of them as the works of art without genius though masterly and studied in their construction are often defective of spirit and taste so are those of genius without art very far from perfection but when these are united when the powers of nature and the researches of art are fully exerted it is then only we may expect the noblest productions   after all that has been or can be said the energy and grace of musical expression is of too delicate a nature to be fixed by words it is a matter of taste rather than of reasoning and is therefore much better understood by example than by precept it is in the works of the great masters that we must look for the rules and full union of air harmony and expression would modern composers condescend to repair to these fountains of knowledge the public ear would neither be offended nor misled by those shallow and unconnected compositions which have of late so much abounded especially those insipid efforts that are daily made to set to music that flood of nonsense which is let in upon us since the commencement of our summer entertainments and which in the manner they are conducted cannot possibly prove of any advantage to music trifling essays in poetry must depress instead of raising the genius of the composer who vainly attempts instead of giving aid to sense musics noble prerogative to harmonize nonsense and make dullness pleasing  thus it fares with music as it fares with her sister poetry for it must be owned that the compositions last mentioned are generally upon a level with the words they are set to their fate too is generally the same these insect productions seldom outliving the season that gives them birth  it has been justly enough alleged tosi on the florid song p     with regard to the italian operas that there are also many improprieties in these which offend even the most common observer particularly that egregious absurdity of repeating and finishing many songs with the first part when it often happens after the passions of anger and revenge have been sufficiently expressed that reconcilement and love are the subjects of the second and therefore should conclude the performance but as if it were unnatural to leave the mind in this tranquil state the performer or actor must relapse into all that tempest and fury with which he began and leave his hearers in the midst of it  i have just hinted this unaccountable conduct of the italian composers by way of contrast to a conduct as remarkably ridiculous in our own i mean our manner of setting one single trifling air repeated to many verses and all of them perhaps expressive of very different sentiments or affections than which a greater absurdity cannot possibly be imagined in the construction of any musical composition whatsoever  what may farther be observed in the composition of these little airs is the general method of repeating the same thought in the ritornello which is heard in the song by this means the burden of the tune be it ever so common must incessantly jingle in the ear and produce nothing but some wretched alternations between the instrument and voice  on the contrary if the subject of the song was relieved by different passages in the instrumental part but of a similar air with the vocal this kind of variety might support the repetition of the whole with somewhat more spirit  among the many excellent ballads which our language affords i shall mention that of blackeyd susan wrote by mr gay and propose it as a specimen to show by what methods a composer might handle this genus of the lyric poem and which indeed is no other than to treat them as the italians have generally managed those little lovestories which are the subject of their serenatas  a kind of musical production extremely elegant and proper for this purpose therefore i would recommend to our vocal composers some such method of setting to music the best english songs and which in like manner will admit of various airs and duetts with their recitative or musical narratives properly interspersed to relieve and embellish the whole  thus one good ballad may supply a fruitful genius with a variety of incidents wherein he will have sufficient scope to display his imagination and to show a judgment and contrivance in adapting his several airs to the different subjects of the poetry by this means not only a genteel and consistent performance might be produced but also fewer good masters would lavish their musical thoughts on subjects so far beneath them nor on this account would there be any dearth of those agreeable and familiar airs which might properly be calculated for those entertainments where the public ear should be always consulted and of which i have so good an opinion that were this difference between a just or false taste but fairly submitted to its decision i should not dispute but the composition which was most natural and pleasing would bid fairest for the general approbation  yet so long as our composers prosecute their studies without the least knowledge of any works but such as are on a level with their own they must never expect to advance in the esteem of their judges for as the striking beauties in a fine composition elevate and enliven the fancy so is it depressed and vitiated by too great a familiarity with whatever is mean and trifling  he therefore that is blessed with happy talents for this art let him shun all the means of catching the common air which so strangely infects and possesses too many composers but unless he has the virtue of the be who   with taste so subtly true from poisonous herbs extracts the healing dew i fear he must banish himself from almost every place of public resort and fly perhaps to monasteries and cells where the genuine charms of harmony may often indeed be found for stores to grace his future productions  our church music is equally capable of improvements from the same sources of taste and knowledge we seem at present almost to have forgot that devotion is the original and proper end of it hence that illtimed levity of air in our modern anthems that foolish pride of execution in our voluntaries which disgusts every rational hearer and dissipates instead of heightening true devotion  if our organist is a lover of poetry without which we may dispute his love for music or indeed if he has any welldirected passions at all he cannot but feel some elevation of mind when he hears the psalm preceding his voluntary pronounced in an awful and pathetic strain it is then he must join his part and with some solemn air relieve with religious cheerfulness the calm and welldisposed heart yet if he feels not this divine energy in his own breast it will prove but a fruitless attempt to raise it in that of others nor can he hope to throw out those happy instantaneous thoughts which sometimes far exceed the bestconcerted compositions and which the enraptured performer would often gladly secure to his future use and pleasure did they not as fleetly escape as they arise he should also be extremely cautious of imitating common songs or airs in the subjects of this latter kind of performance otherwise he will but too much expose religion to contempt and ridicule  it may not derogate from our subject of churchmusic just to mention the present method of singing the common psalm tunes in the parochial service which are every where sung without the least regard to time or measure by drawling out every note to an unlimited length it is evident that both the common and proper tunes were originally intended to be sung in the allabreve time or the regular pointing of two three or four minims in a bar  a kind of movement which every ear with the least practice may easily attain nor when they are sung in parts should there be any more than three i e one treble tenor and bass as too complex an harmony would destroy their natural air and in this style our psalm tunes are capable of all the solemnity that can be required from such plain and unadorned harmony the pious and ingenious dr watts in his preface to his translation of the psalms very justly laments this miserable drawling out the psalm his remarks on this head so aptly coincide with the subject in question that i shall here transcribe them  it were to be wished that all congregations and private families would sing as they do in foreign protestantchurches without reading line by line  it were to be wished also that we might not dwell so long upon every single note and produce the syllables to such a tiresome extent with a constant uniformity of time which disgraces the music and puts the congregation quite out of breath whereas if the method of singing were but reformed to a greater speed of pronunciation we might often enjoy the pleasure of a longer psalm with less expense of time and breath and our psalmody would be more agreeable to that of the ancient churches more intelligible to others and more delightful to ourselves     whoever has heard the protestant congregations abroad sing in parts their psalms or hymns may recollect with some pleasure that part of their religious worship and their exceeding us so far in a performance of this kind is chiefly owing to the exact measure in which those tunes are sung and not to their harmony for the greatest part of our own which were composed soon after the reformation by those excellent masters we had at that time would doubtless be found as well in regard to their solemn air as harmony equal if not superior to any compositions of their kind and we may further observe that air is in a higher degree productive of both solemnity and cheerfulness than harmony for there is a dignity and grace in the former when invented by genius which a masterly harmony may indeed assist but can never produce  however trifling it may appear to consider this species of music i cannot but own that i have been uncommonly affected with hearing some thousands of voices hymning the deity in a style of harmony adapted to that awful occasion but sorry i am to observe that the chief performer in this kind of noble chorus is too often so fond of his own conceits that with his absurd graces and tedious and illconnected interludes he misleads or confounds his congregation instead of being the rational guide and director of the whole  it may be thought perhaps by thus depriving our organist of this public opportunity of showing his dexterity both in his voluntary and psalm tune that all performers indiscriminately might be capable of doing the duty here required but it will be found no such easy matter to strike out the true sublimity of style which is proper to be heard when the mind is in a devout state or when we would be greatly solemn to avoid the heavy and spiritless manner which instead of calmly relieving and lifting up the heart rather sinks it into a state of deprivation  we might soon arrive at a very different style and manner as well in our compositions as performance did we but study the works of the best chapelmasters abroad as caldara lotti gasparini and many others whose excellent compositions ought surely to be better known and rescued from the possession of those churlish virtuosi whose unsociable delight is to engross to themselves those performances which in justice to their authors as well as the world they ought freely to communicate the motetts of caldara are noble pathetic and finely adapted to the purposes here mentioned lotti and gasparini have also composed various pieces for the service of the church but as only the same of them has as yet reached me i can only suppose them of a character equal at least to their other compositions the perusal of which have often afforded me a very singular pleasure  there is a composition for the church which the connoisseurs acquainted with its beauties esteem as inimitable in its way namely the stabat matter etc of the baron dastorga this nobleman had many excellencies as a composer and chiefly a simplicity of harmony and an affecting style in many of his airs and duetts which undoubtedly he has thrown in some peculiar manner into the performance here mentioned  if ever i have the felicity of seeing this work i shall expect to find it more equally conducted than the stabat matter of pergolese for though it is the distinguished character of this latter composer to have succeeded in the complaining or sorrowful style yet i have often thought there was wanting in several movements of his stabat matter the just distinction which ought always to be observed between the tenderness or passion of a theatrical scene and the solemnity of devotion     we may clearly discern the effects of such a commerce as is here proposed with the works of the greatest masters the immortal works of corelli are in the hands of every one and accordingly we find that from him many of our best modern composers have generally deduced their elements of harmony yet there remains something more to be done by our present professors they ought to be as intimately conversant with those other great masters who since corellis time have added both taste and invention and by uniting these have still come nearer to the perfection of the generalharmonic composition  the numerous seminaries in italy seldom fail of producing a succession of good masters from these we might select such pieces as would greatly contribute to the real solemnity of the cathedral service while others again of a different kind might be compiled and fitted for concertos or other musical purposes so that there would never be wanting a variety of examples and subjects for the practice of all students in harmony whatever and by an assiduous application to a greater and more comprehensive style than we have hitherto attempted we should soon be able to acquire so true a taste as would lay a sure foundation for the forming our own masters the italians are allowed to excel all other nations in the arts of painting and music but the reason is more obvious in the former than latter for the recourse to the antique which italy afforded to painting must be the chief cause of its excellence in that art music could have no such external assistance the goths had rooted out all tracks of the ancient melody how then must we account for the superior genius which the italians have since that time discovered in regard to music not from the chimerical hypothesis of air climate food etc but from the public and national care which has ever attended it in that country so different from the treatment it meets with in england   if it should be asked who are the proper persons to begin a reform in our churchmusic it may be answered the organists of cathedrals who are or ought to be our maestri di capella and by whom under the influence and protection of their deans much might be done to the advancement of their choirs nor would they find any difficulty in accomplishing this useful design as there are many precedents to direct them both from dr aldridge and others who have introduced into their service the celebrated palestina and carissimi with great success and if this method when so little good music was to be had has been found to advance the dignity and reputation of our cathedral service how much more may be expected at this time from the number and variety of those excellent compositions that have since appeared and which may be easily procured and adapted to the purposes here mentioned  an improvement of this kind might be still more easily set on foot were there any history of the lives and works of the best composers together with an account of their several schools and the characteristic taste and manner of each  a subject though yet untouched of such extensive use that we may reasonably hope it will be the employment of some future writer  painting has long had an advantage of this kind but whether it has profited by such advantage may at present perhaps be disputed however i think if both these arts are not now in the state of perfection which one might wish it ought not to be attributed to the want of genii but to the want of proper encouragement from able and generous patrons which would excite them to more laudable pursuits many professors in both the sciences having alike employed their talents in the lowest branches of their art and turned their views rather to instant profit than to future fame in reflecting on the state of music in england i have often thought that it might not be altogether foreign to the design of some periodical memoir of literature to have an article sometimes giving an account and character of the best musical compositions  as a precedent i shall here take the liberty to consider a late performance in such a cursory manner as may perhaps be proper enough on the publication of other musical works hereafter   la music raisonee etc par mr le count st germain published by walsh pr   l   s this collection of airs in the opera style are most of them set for a soprano some few for the conteralto and accompanied with violins etc in four parts  in these pieces the author has shown a peculiar genius in the tender and complaining style but which require a performer like himself to do them justice this single species of musical expression seems to run through the whole collection for though he often aims to express different passions yet there is still wanting a sufficient variety to keep up the attention when more than one of these airs are performed at a time nevertheless when they are intermixed with other performances in the concert they have then in a particular manner a very pleasing effect    some general idea like this of our musical essays on their first appearance would not only incite a spirit of emulation among the composers and render their works more worthy the public notice but might also prove a more effectual restraint to the publishers not to be so careless and dilatory on their part for however inadvertent our composers may be in putting their works incorrect out of their hands their printers are seldom behind them in that point     thus and thus alone can we hope to reach any tolerable degree of excellence in the nobler kinds of musical composition the works of the greatest masters are the only schools where we may see and from whence we may draw perfection and here that i may do justice to what i think the most distinguished merit i shall mention as examples of true musical expression two great authors the one admirable in vocal the other in instrumental music  the first of these is benedetto marcello whose inimitable freedom depth and comprehensive style will ever remain the highest example to all composers for the church for the service of which he published at venice near thirty years ago the first fifty psalms set to music this work is contained in eight volumes in folio the first four were published in the year      and the whole came out complete two years after under the following title estro poetico armonico parafrasi sopra salmi pocsia di girolamo ascanio giustiniani musica di benedetto marcello patrizi veniti venezia      there are some pieces of instrumental music published in london and said to be composed by benedetto marcello a venetian nobleman but as these are very mean performances they cannot be supposed to come from the same great author  here he has far excelled all the moderns and given us the truest idea of that noble simplicity which probably was the grand characteristic of the ancient music in this extensive and laborious undertaking like the divine subject he works upon he is generally either grand beautiful or pathetic and so perfectly free from every thing that is low and common that the judicious hearer is charmed with an endless variety of new and pleasing modulation together with a design and expression so finely adapted that the sense and harmony do every where coincide in the last psalm which is the fiftyfirst in our version he seems to have collected all the powers of his vast genius that he might surpass the wonders he had done before  i do not mean to affirm that in this extensive work every recitative air or chorus is of equal excellence a continued elevation of this kind no author ever came up to nay if we consider that variety which in all arts is necessary to keep alive attention we may perhaps affirm with truth that inequality makes a part of the character of excellence that something ought to be thrown into shades in order to make the lights more striking and in this respect marcello is truly excellent if ever he seems to fall it is only to rise with more astonishing majesty and greatness  far the greatest part of what some call neglect is studied art when virgil seems to trifle in a line it is like a warningpiece which gives the sign to wake your fancy and prepare your sight to reach the noble height of some unusual flight roscom ess on translated verse   to this illustrious example in vocal i shall add another the greatest in instrumental music i mean the admirable geminiani whose elegance and spirit of composition ought to have been much more our pattern and from whom the public taste might have received the highest improvement had we thought proper to lay hold of those opportunities which his long residence in this kingdom has given us  the public is greatly indebted to this gentleman not only for his many excellent compositions but for having as yet parted with none that are not extremely correct and fine there is such a genteelness and delicacy in the turn of his musical phrase if i may so call it and such a natural connection in his expressive and sweet modulation throughout all his works which are every where supported with so perfect a harmony that we can never too often hear or too much admire them there are no impertinent digressions no tiresome unnecessary repetitions but from the beginning to the close of his movement all is natural and pleasing this it is properly to discourse in music when our attention is kept up from one passage to another so as the ear and the mind may be equally delighted  from an academy formed under such a genius what a supreme excellence of taste might be expected to show on what foundation this improvement in the musical science may be rested i will take the liberty to add the following remarks from two unquestionable authorities on this head  the first is from my lord shaftesbury in his letter concerning design  i can myself remember the time when in respect of music our reigning taste was in many degrees inferior to the french the long reign of luxury and pleasure under king charles the second and the foreign helps and studied advantages given to music in a following reign could not raise our genius the least in this respect but when the spirit of the nation was grown more free though engaged at that time in the fiercest war and with the most doubtful success we no sooner began to turn ourselves toward music and enquire what italy in particular produced than in an instant we outstripped our neighbors the french entered into a genius far beyond theirs and raised ourselves an ear and judgment not inferior to the best now in the world  and now to observe with what improper regard this art has since been treated we need only advert to the next remark from geminianis introduction to a good taste in music  when i came first to london which was thirtyfour years ago i found music in so thriving a state that i had all the reason imaginable to suppose the growth would be suitable to the excellency of the soil but i have lived to be most miserably disappointed for though it cannot be said that there was any want of encouragement that encouragement was ill bestowed the hand was more considered than the head the performance than the composition and hence it followed that instead of laboring to cultivate a taste which seemed to be all that was wanting the public was content to nourish insipidity  this great masters first arrival amongst us seems to have been much about that time which the noble author abovementioned has fixed for the most flourishing state of music and his sentiments herein i dare say will appear reasonable and fair to every impartial judge of the subject before us especially as he has done us the justice to assert that music by proper culture and encouragement may be brought to as great perfection in england as in any other nation     part iii on musical expression as it relates to the performer sect i on the expressive performance of music in general but as the nature and effects of musical expression do likewise relate to the performer and the different instruments which are employed in the practice of music so these in their turn may be also considered  for as musical expression in the composer is succeeding in the attempt to express some particular passion the word passion is here taken in the most extensive sense as it may be applied to every species of excellence in musical compositions which from the very design of the composer demands an energetic execution  so in the performer it is to do a composition justice by playing it in a taste and style so exactly corresponding with the intention of the composer as to preserve and illustrate all the beauties of his work  again as the composer is culpable who for the sake of some low and trifling imitation deserts the beauties of expression so that performer is still more culpable who is industrious to reduce a good instrument to the state of a bad one by endeavoring to make it subservient to a still more trifling mimickry  such are all imitations of flageolets horns bagpipes etc on the violin a kind of low device calculated merely to amaze and which even with the common ear cannot long prevail over the natural love of harmony the singing of a cuckoo and the cackling of a hen have in fact been often introduced into musical performances vivaldi in his seasons or concertos so called has imitated the barking of a dog besides many other strange contrivances attempting even to describe as well as imitate the various changes of the elements  if those composers who take such pleasure in their musical imitations of the noise of animals will show their ingenuity in that way i would advise them rather to follow the much more effectual method of introducing the creatures themselves and by way of example i shall give them the following story as it is related by mr bail in his critical dictionary under the article of lewis xi the abbot de baigne a man of great wit had invented many things relating to musical instruments and being in the service of the king was once commanded by him to procure him harmonious sounds from the cries of hogs imagining the thing was absolutely impossible the abbot was not in the least perplexed at such a command but asked the king money to perform it which was immediately delivered to him and he effected the most surprising and remarkable thing that was ever heard he got together a large quantity of hogs all of different ages and put them into a tent or pavillion covered with velvet before which tent there was a wooden table all painted and he made an organical instrument with a certain number of stops so contrived that when he hit upon those stops it answered to some spikes which pricking the hogs that stood behind in a due order made them cry in such a harmonious manner that the king and all his attendants were highly delighted with it     even the use of double stops on this instrument may in my opinion be considered as one of the abuses of it since in the hands of the greatest masters they only deaden the tone spoil the expression and obstruct the execution in a word they baffle the performers art and bring down one good instrument to the state of two indifferent ones  but surely it ought chiefly to be the composers care not to give the performer any opportunities whatever of disparaging his art and the more he avoids all such low buffoonry the more will this false taste be discouraged for whatever may be alleged against the depravity of our taste in the musical science it certainly can be fixed no where so properly as on the masters themselves since were they to persist with any spirit or resolution in the exercise of their genius in such compositions only as are worthy of them they would undoubtedly improve the public ear and acquire to themselves a reputation and character worth preserving there is one circumstance that might tend greatly to the repute and utility of music which is that the professors themselves would cultivate a sincere and friendly commerce with each other and cherish that benevolent temper which their daily employ one should think ought naturally to inspire in truth there is nothing enlarges the mind to every social and laudable purpose so much as this delightful intercourse with harmony they who  not this divine effect are strangers to its noblest ence for whatever pretensions they may otherwise have to a relish or knowledge of its laws without this criterion of the musical soul all other pretended signatures of genius we may look upon as counterfeit   let every composer whether for the church the theater or chamber thoroughly consider the nature and compass of the voices or instruments that are employed in his work and by that means he will the more easily avoid the common error of not sufficiently distinguishing what style or manner is proper for execution and what for expression  he should also minutely observe the different qualities of the instruments themselves for as vocal music requires one kind of expression and instrumental another so different instruments have also a different expression peculiar to them  thus the hautboy will best express the cantabile or singing style and may be used in all movements whatever under this denomination especially those movements which tend to the gay and cheerful  in compositions for the german flute is required the same method of proceeding by conjoint degrees or such other natural intervals as with the nature of its tone will best express the languishing or melancholy style with both these instruments the running into extreme keys the use of the staccato or distinct separation of notes and all irregular leaps or broken and uneven intervals must be avoided for which reason alone these instruments ought never to be employed in the repieno parts of concertos for violins but in such pieces only as are composed for them and these perhaps would be most agreeably introduced as principal instruments in some intervening movements in the concerto which might not only give a pleasing variety but show their different expression to the greatest advantage  in continued compositions particularly for the german flute our composers have been not a little unsuccessful but whether this failure may be imputed to the deficiency of the instrument or their attempting to exceed its natural expression may perhaps be worth the composers while to consider  the bassoon should also have those gradual movements which naturally glide in their divisions and have the easiest transitions from one key to another and may be admitted as a principal in the solo or rinforzo in the chorus but never in the latter without a sufficient number of other basses to qualify and support it see the sixth of geminianis concertos  where there is one movement composed expressly for the bassoon the agreeable effect of which may be sufficient to evince how much better this method is of introducing windinstruments than admitting them throughout the concerto   the trumpet and frenchhorn though equally limited in their scale yet have pieces of very different styles adapted to them the one perhaps to animate and inspire courage the other to enliven and cheer the spirits yet are not both to be alike discarded in the figurate descant or that part of composition where discords are concerned in this species of harmony i have known the frenchhorn introduced with amazing success but it requires a very able composer to manage it properly with such accompanyments either of these instruments when fully accompanied produce more wonderful effects than when heard alone because in all martial compositions their airs and expression are of so plain and unmixed a nature that their harmony is more easily comprehended and thence they strike the common ear with a greater degree of pleasure and admiration than any other instrument whatever  the organ and harpsichord though alike in so many respects that the same performer may equally show his skill and execution on both yet are their respective compositions and manner of performance widely different the former expressing the grand or solemn style the latter those lively or trickling movements which thrill in the ear  now where any of the above instruments overruled in concert whether in the chorus or solo or are appointed to play such airs or movements as they cannot easily express we may then conclude that the composer has unfortunately set out upon a wrong principle which capital error will destroy every good effect that might have been found in his work had he duly considered the distinct limits and properties of each instrument  in classing the different instruments in concert we may consider them as the various stops which complete a good organ and as the skillful artist so contrives that when the full organ is heard no mixtures or furnitures etc shall predominate but that the diapasons with their octaves principals and flutes  may unite and fill the whole so we may rank the violins with their basses and doublebasses as the diapasons and principals of the concert for in fact they may be said to contain the very strength and spirit of all harmony and have in them not only the expression of all the other instruments but contain a prodigious variety of many other noble properties peculiar to themselves of which all the rest are utterly destitute it is their remarkable distinction that no concert can be formed without them as they unite and agree as well with every instrument as with each other and return every advantage they receive and as the finest instrumental music may be considered as an imitation of the vocal so do these instruments with their expressive tone and the minutest changes they are capable of in the progression of melody show their nearest approaches to the perfection of the human voice  let the lover of music call to mind the delightful effects they afford when joined with the organ to a chorus of good voices particularly in churches where the expansion is large and ample to soften every rough and grating sound and unite the variety of voices and other instruments that complete this grand and solemn performance he will even in this ideal enjoyment of music with pleasure own and prefer their harmonious expression  in fine it is in those productions only which include the violin and its species where an extensive genius may rove at large through all the various kinds of musical expression and may give the best performers though not in capricious and extravagant flights every desirable opportunity of showing their skill  as a remarkable instance of the power of expression in a performance on this instrument i cannot omit the mention of three masters within my own knowledge knerler with great execution and a fine tone but unsusceptible of the powers of expression always disappointed the expecting ear carbonel with but a common portion of those qualities so requisite to enforce an expression by a natural and instant feeling of the tender strokes in a fine composition never failed to give all the pleasure that could be expected from them but if we would hear these various qualities united in their full perfection we must repair to the admired giardini the brilliancy and fullness of his tone the sweetness spirit and variety of his expression his amazing rapidity of execution and exuberance of fancy joined with the most perfect ease and gracefulness in the performance concur to set him at the head of his since the appearance of this great performer the signiors pla passarini and chabran have also excited the admiration of the town yet  all it is but too general an observation and i cannot help repeating it that even the greatest performers when left to themselves cannot resist the vanity of amazing the multitude  for this reason the judicious hearer will always prefer their accompanyment in vocal performances where every kind of unmeaning execution must give way to a more natural harmony and their happier talents are employed in assisting the voice through  the various beauties of true musical expression   profession  thus the judicious performer by this exertion of his fort or masterstyle may possibly give a pleasing tenderness or spirit even to an indifferent composition while on the other hand a neglect or ignorance of the use of this art however expert in other respects the performer may be will disguise if not entirely destroy those distinguished beauties which alone can raise the dignity and perfection of music  i dare say the reader will anticipate the similar case i am about to mention in regard to reading as it will naturally occur to him on this head how commanding the power of expression may be found from a different manner of reading the same author especially in poetry where a just and spirited emphasis is so highly essential to point out those interesting strokes which are more peculiarly designed to delight the imagination and affect the heart but how infinitely short of this design is the bestwrote poem whether we hear it rehearsed with wild and vehement accents or repeated in a cold and lifeless monotone in either of these cases our disgust or weariness of attention will be found in proportion to the beauties of the author so abused and just thus it fares with an injudicious performance of a fine musical composition  the different species of music for the church the theater or the chamber are or should be distinguished by their peculiar expression it may easily be perceived that it is not the time or measure so much as manner and expression which stamps the real character of the piece a wellwrought allegro or any other quick movement for the church cannot with propriety be adapted to theatrical purposes nor can the adagio of this latter kind strictly speaking be introduced into the former i have known several experiments of this nature attempted but never with success for the same pieces which may justly enough be thought very solemn in the theater to an experienced ear will be found too light and trivial when they are performed in the church and this i may venture to assert would be the case though we had never heard them but in some anthem or other divine performance and were therefore not subject to the prejudice which their being heard in an opera might occasion by the ancients airs were sung in three different manners for the theater the style was lively and various for the chamber delicate and finished for the church moving and grave this difference to very many moderns is quite unknown see tosi on the florid song p       it is also by this efficacy of musical expression that a good ear does ascertain the various terms which are generally made use of to direct the performer for instance the words andante presto allegro etc are differently applied in the different kinds of music abovementioned for the same terms which denote lively and gay in the opera or concert style may be understood in the practice of churchmusic as cheerful and serene or if the reader pleases less lively and gay wherefore the allegro etc in this kind of composition should always be performed somewhat slower than is usual in concertos or operas  by this observation we may learn that these words do not always convey what they import in their strict sense but are to be considered as relative terms and if they cannot fully answer the composers intention of communicating to every performer the nature of each particular style yet are they more proper than any other for that purpose however the composer will always be subject to a necessity of leaving great latitude to the performer who nevertheless may be greatly assisted therein by his perception of the powers of expression  in vocal music he can never fail because if the different passions which the poet intends to raise are justly distinguished and expressed by the composers art the sensible performer will feel this happy union of both the arts and thence join his own to perfect the whole  with regard to the instrumental kind the style and air of the movement must chiefly determine the exact time and menner in which it ought to be performed and unless we strictly attend to this distinction the most excellent compositions may be greatly injured especially when the composer is not present either to lead or give the air of his piece  i might conclude this head with an observation or two on the several graces or ornaments of expression but as these are already enumerated and sufficiently explained in the rules of geminiani i need only refer to that work however we may here remark that were these elements of playing in taste with their distinct characters and explanations become the general standard as well for the performance of masters as for the instruction of their pupils the former i believe would not only find them capable of heightening the very best compositions but the latter would also with greater facility arrive at perfection but instead of this the generality of our masters following each their own method have preferred a more loose and florid manner of gracing by which the finest harmonies are too often destroyed and in their explanation of these graces by so many different marks and crowds of little notes impossible to be expressed have rather perplexed the learner who finding the same art so variously taught has therefore been often discouraged in the progress of his study  and as we have distinguished this master as a pattern of excellence in his compositions so we must allow him to have been equally excellent in his performance for in this respect he was also peculiarly happy in his various expression as well of the tender the serene the solemn as of the joyous and rapid and with a ready and proper execution always entered into a true feeling of the spirit or softness suitable to each of these styles and notwithstanding the uncertain duration of this talent a circumstance common to every performer he will ever live in those rules above referred to and in his art of playing on the violin in which useful work he has communicated to the musical world as much of his superior taste and method of execution as could possibly be expected from such an undertaking  sect ii on the expressive performances of music in parts having said so much with regard to the expressive performance of music in general i shall now conclude with a few hints which may be of service in the performance of full music especially of such concertos as have pretty near an equal share of air and expression in all their parts  the first material circumstance which ought to be considered in the performance of this kind of composition is the number and quality of those instruments that may produce the best effect  and   st i would propose exclusive of the four principal parts which must be always complete that the chorus of other instruments should not exceed the number following viz six primo and four secondo repienos four repieno basses and two double basses and a harpsichord a lesser number of instruments near the same proportion will also have a proper effect and may answer the composers intention but more would probably destroy the just contrast which should always be kept up between the chorus and solo for in this case the effect of two or three single instruments would be lost and overpowered by the succession of too grand a chorus and to double the primo and secondo concertino or violoncello in the solo would be an impropriety in the conduct of our musical economy too obvious to require any thing to be said on that head it may be objected perhaps that the number of basses in the above calculation would be found too powerful for the violins but as the latter instruments are in their tone so clear sprightly and piercing and as they rather gain more force by this addition they will always be heard however if it were possible there should never be wanting a double bass especially in a performance of full concertos as they cannot be heard to any advantage without that noble foundation of their harmony  as to windinstruments these are all so different in their tone and in their progressions through the various keys from those of the stringed kind besides the irremediable disagreement of their rising in their pitch while the others are probably falling that they should neither be continued too long in use nor employed but in such pieces as are expressly adapted to them so that in the general work of concertos for violins etc they are almost always improper unless we admit of the bassoon which if performed by an expert hand in a soft and ready tone and only in those passages that are natural to it may then be of singular use and add fullness to the harmony  did every performer know the fort of his instrument and where its best expression lay there to exert it most i should have but little pretense for my present attempt in the ensuing directions    dly in the four principal parts there ought to be four performers of almost equal mastery as well in regard to time as execution for however easy it may seem to acquire the former yet nothing more shows a master than a steady performance throughout the whole movement and therefore chiefly necessary in the leading parts but this rule is generally neglected by placing one of the worst hands to the tenor which though a part of little execution yet requires so much meaning and expression that the performer should not only give a fine tone the peculiar quality of that instrument but by swelling and singing of the notes and entering into the spirit of the composer know without destroying the air where to fill the harmony and by boldly pointing the subject keep it up with the greatest energy as when we find a just and happy subserviency in all the under parts of a composition we conclude the composer to be a man of experience and good sense so also those only are the performers or discernment and good taste who can feel and with delight express those beauties undistinguished by the common ear  it is their part also to discern how little it avails to attempt any service in the performance where these attendants to the principal part are either superfluous in themselves or inharmonious in their effect and where they destroy instead of aiding the mastersubject or other appointed airs in the piece       dly the same rule will serve for all the other instruments except the harpsichord and as this is only to be used in the chorus the performer will have little else to regard but the striking just chords keeping the time and being careful that no jangling sound or scattering of the notes be continued after the pause or cadence during this interval of rest he should also attend with the utmost exactness the leading off again the remaining part of the movement that when all the parts are thus instantly struck his own may be found to pervade and fill the whole and if there are any rests succeeding the pause his attention to the leading instrument will direct him when these are to commence the same care is necessary at the return of each double strain when there are no intermediate notes to introduce the repeat in fine a profound silence must be always observed wherever the composer has intended a general respite or pause in his work i am the more particular in giving this caution to performers on the harpsichord as they are the most liable to transgress in this way because their instrument lying so commodious to their fingers is ever tempting them to run like wildfire over the keys and thus perpetually interrupt the performance as compositions of this nature are not calculated for the sake of any one instrument but to give a grand effect by uniting many each performer ought therefore to consider his particular province and so far only to exert himself as may be consistent with the harmony and expression in his part nor let any lover of music be concerned if there is but little for him to execute since he will thence have some leisure for the pleasure of hearing for this reason the under parts in good compositions are more eligible to the performer who would rather enjoy the whole than be distinguished alone  the use of the acciaccatura for an explanation f the acciaccatura see geminianis introduction to a good taste of music printed at the head of his second collection of scots songs  or sweeping of the chords and the dropping or sprinkling notes are indeed some of the peculiar beauties of this instrument but these graceful touches are only reserved for a masterly application in the accompanyment of a fine voice or single instrument and therefore besides the difficulty of acquiring a competent skill in them they are not required in the performance of full music  under this article i shall beg leave to offer an observation on the harpsichord concerto a species of composition but of late invention and which if properly studied will admit of considerable improvements hitherto we seem to have mistaken the property of this instrument by not considering what it can or cannot express hence it is perhaps that our composers have run all their concertos into little else than tedious divisions and the subject or groundwork of these being introduced and repeated by a chorus of violins produce always a bad effect whereas the violin parts should be but few and contrived rather as accompanyments than symphonies by which means they may assist greatly in striking out some kind of expression wherein the harpsichord see rameaus concertos for the harpsichord published by mr walsh is remarkably deficient performers on the harpsichord in concertos for that instrument ought to take notice that staccato divisions on one note should be played with different fingers wherever it can be done with convenience and not with one finger only because in this case it is impossible to move the wrist which the quick repetition of one note with one finger would require with freedom enough to give these kind of passages their proper force   the same method perhaps may be equally proper in concertos for the organ which being frequently employed in other compositions and at present so generally approved it may not be amiss to consider it farther for however capable this instrument may be found to fill or soften all the rest it will nevertheless overpower and destroy them if the performer is not extremely cautious and tender in the use of it i would therefore propose that the accompanyments in the thoroughbass should never be struck in chords with the right hand as upon the harpsichord but in all the full parts the leading subject should be singly touched and the performer proceed through the rest of the movement with the left hand only for this reason no person whatever should attempt this instrument in concertos not expressly made for it but from the score and then if he has judgment and discretion sufficient he may enforce an expression and assist every part throughout the whole chorus yet i cannot dismiss this article without once again observing that the difficulties of rendering the organ of that use in full concert which many expect from it are so various and intricate that we can never be too careful of the performers abilities who if thoroughly skillful will so manage his instrument that it may always be heard but seldom distinguished    thly as in all concertos overtures etc where the repieno parts are more immediately necessary the composer ought to pursue some design in filling each chorus and relieving them with passages either proper to be heard alone or so contrived as to give a good effect to the repeated chorus so in performing these different passages a different manner must be observed thus when the solo is contrived for the sake of some peculiar expression it should then be performed in a manner suitable to the genius or character of the piece but always plain or however with such graces only as may heighten the expression without varying the time and which therefore require other qualities besides an execution to do them justice for this elegance of taste in the performance of the solo consists not in those agile motions or shiftings of the hand which strike with surprise the common ear but in the tender and delicate touches which to such indeed are least perceptible but to a fine ear productive of the highest delight let not the performer then by an illjudged execution misapply this opportunity of showing his skill in these remarkable places for though it is not the advantage of instrumental compositions to be heightened in their expression by the help of words yet there is generally or ought to be some idea of sense or passion besides that of mere sound conveyed to the hearer la poesia e la musica glintendenti ben sanno son due arti gemelle e tra loro si analoghe che a pensare e favellar sanamente non vi dovrebbe esser poesia senza musica ne musica senza poesia g c becelli  on that account he should avoid all extravagant decorations since every attempt of this kind must utterly destroy whatever passion the composer may have designed to express and last of all let him consider that a more than usual attention is expected to his principal part when all the rest yield it this preference of being distinguished and heard alone it is supposed by many that a real good taste cannot possibly be acquired by any rules of art it being a peculiar gift of nature indulged only to those who have naturally a good ear and as most flatter themselves they have this perfection hence it happens that he who sings or plays thinks of nothing so much as to make continually some favorite passages or graces believing that by this means he shall be thought to be a good performer not perceiving that playing in good taste does not consist of frequent passages but in expressing with strength and delicacy the intention of the composer introduction to a good taste in music by geminiani   these are the performers who execute all pieces with such a tasteless uniformity of manner that they seem not to distinguish either what is good or indifferent or even what is execrable       thly in the chorus whether full in all the parts or leading by fugues the violini di concertino principal parts should be pointed with spirit to each repieno these also should be instantly struck without suffering the first note to slip by which means they always lose their designed effect an omission which many careless performers are guilty of either through miscounting of rests or depending upon others and thus render the whole performance ragged and unmeaning    thly when concertos are performed with three or four instruments only it may not be amiss to play the solo parts mezzo piano and to know more accurately where to find them the first and last note of every chorus should be distinguished thus  and to prevent all mistakes of pointing the forte at a wrong place that also ought to have the same mark by this means the performer will be directed to give the first note of every chorus and forte its proper emphasis and not suffer the latter to hand upon the ear which is extremely disagreeable  above all to heighten this variety in the performance it is essential to mark the change of styles that may often be found in the same movement and chiefly the sostenute and staccato for in these are contained the greatest powers of expression on the violin  sounds continued or succeeding each other without interruption must be gently swelled and decreased and this without drawling or languor all cut sounds should be moderately struck yet clear and distinct that every shrill and sudden jerk with the bow may be entirely avoided  though few performers can feel the nice distinctions that lie between the beauties and errors in each of these styles yet many are sensible of their very opposite effects and this circumstance alone will greatly assist those who would play either with tenderness or spirit    thly as discords in music are like shades in painting so is the piano like the fainter parts or figures in a picture both which do greatly assist in constituting and supporting an agreeable variety but as in the case of music so much depends upon the taste and accuracy of the performer it is particularly necessary that a strict regard be had to the piano and forte for these in the hands of a skillful composer are generally so disposed as to afford a most pleasing relief and when justly executed give great beauty and spirit to a composition yet how often do they pass unobserved or if at all expressed in so careless and negligent a manner as to produce little if any sensible difference to the hearer it is a common practice with those lukewarm performers who imagine that diminishing the number of instruments will answer the same end as softening the whole to quit their part when they should rather be all attention how to manage it with the utmost delicacy transporting as it were like the swellorgan the lessening sounds to a vast distance and thence returning with redoubled strength and fullness to the forte and as this delightful effect can only be found from a performance of many instruments together we ought never to omit such opportunities of carrying this noble contrast to its highest perfection    thly when the inner parts are intended as accompanyments only great care should be had to touch them in such a manner that they may never predominate but be always subservient to the principal performer who also should observe the same method whenever his part becomes an accompanyment which generally happens in wellwrought fugues and other full pieces where the subject and air are almost equally distributed when the attention of every performer is thus employed by listening to the other parts without which he cannot do justice to his own it is then we may expect to hear the proper effect of the whole    thly in every part throughout the full chorus all manner of graces or diminution of intervals or transposition of eight notes higher must be avoided which some indiscreet performers are but too apt to make use of merely from a desire of being distinguished and that the audience may admire their execution but these gentlemen ought to consider that by such liberties they do not only disappoint the expecting ear of a just performance of some favorite part but often introduce and occasion disallowances in the harmony from the same ruling passion we sometimes hear performers the moment a piece is ended run over their instrument forgetting that order like silence under arms in the military discipline should also be observed in the discipline of music  lastly to point out in all the parts of full music their various subjects or fugues i have ventured to introduce a new musical character namely this mostra  or index but as the particular use i would apply it to may possibly be thought by some a groundless innovation it will therefore be necessary to say something in its defense and explanation see six concertos published by johnson where the use of this mark is applied as this character is easily made by the pen it may with very little trouble be added to the proper places either in manuscript or other printed concertos that require it   in all compositions for instruments in parts which are published in separate books and seldom perused in score most performers are frequently at a loss to know the composers design hence proceed many discordant ricercate extempore flourishings  where only the full unmixed harmony should be heard another consequence has been that for want of some such character as the mostra abovementioned the very best contrivances in a good composition have often passed undistinguished and neglected to remedy this defect it seems necessary to point out in each part every leading and responsive fugue for which purpose some particular mark should be placed over the first note of every accidental subject as well as principal the former being rather more necessary to be thus distinguished as every person capable of performing in concert must know the principal subject wherever it occurs and therefore will of course give that its proper expression  but the accidental subjects are on account of their variety much more difficult to be ascertained sometimes indeed they are a part or accompanyment of the principal and then may be styled a second or third subject as they are generally repeated or at least so retouched in the progress of the fugue as to render them easily known but yet there are oftentimes other subjects very different from the principal and which being seldom or never repeated are therefore still more necessary to be marked for having always some peculiar relation to the other parts it is absolutely necessary that they should be justly expressed and this can only be done by a simple plain yet energetic execution for wherever a subject is proposed it can never with propriety admit of any variation expression alone being sufficient to give us every thing that can be desired from harmony  thus by a due observance of some such character as the mostra the performer will be greatly assisted to comprehend all the harmony and contrivances of the composer and obtain an advantage and pleasure almost equal to that of playing from the score though we may partly conjecture at the excellence of the air and expression of particular passages in a composition without a complete performance in all the parts yet of the harmony and relation these may bear to each other we cannot form a peremptory judgment and more especially as we are often deceived in our opinions of full music from those faint and imperfect trials to which for want of proper hands they are frequently exposed where these are deficient whether in number or abilities i know not a more effectual test than a good harpsichord and performance from the score where the eye will assist the ear through all the defects of this instrument and give a better idea of the composers design than any unsuccessful attempt in concert  for this reason were the printers of music to publish the best concertos and sonatas in score as are those of corelli perhaps this very expedient though it may seem hazardous at first would contribute more to a general good taste and knowledge of music than any yet thought of and the success that may reasonably be expected from so useful an undertaking will in the longrun amply reward them for all their trouble and expense  i have heard the first publisher of corellis works in score very frankly acknowledge that the profits received from the sale of these books were greater than could have been expected and as the public has had almost twenty years trial of the advantages that have accrued from such an intimate acquaintance with this classical composer it cannot i think be doubted but a like good effect might also attend a publication in score of geminianis concertos and of other compositions in parts which may have deservedly gained a reputation     by what has been said it appears that this mark will be of similar use in music to that of capitals italicks and other orthographical illustrations in writing and therefore perhaps may make the chance which a musical author has for success more nearly equal to that of a literary one for it is certain that the former at present lies under so many additional disadvantages that whatever serves to lessen or remove any of them should be thought an invention of no trivial utility  for instance how often does the fate of a concerto depend on the random execution of a set of performers who have never previously considered the work examined the connection of its parts or studied the intention of the whole  was a dramatic author in such a situation as that the success of his play depended on a single recital and that too by persons thus unprepared i fancy he would scarce choose to run the risk though he had even mr garrick for one of his rehearsers yet what the poet never did nor ever will venture the harmonist is of necessity compelled to and that also frequently when he has not yet acquired a character to prejudice the audience in his favor or is in any situation to prevent their first censure from being determinate and final  a letter to the author concerning the music of the ancients sir the music of the ancients and of the moderns has been often and fully discussed by the learned and i have only a slender and superficial knowledge of the theory either of the former or of the latter what is it then that i can offer you upon this subject in truth nothing better than a few straggling passages of classic authors relating to music and a few slight remarks added to them  horace sermon i iii   says of tigellius  si collibuisset ab ovo usque ad mala citaret io bacche modo summa voce modo hac resonat chordis quae quatuor ima i e he sang sometimes in the note of the upper string sometimes in that of the lowest string of the tetrachord  the tetrachord here is to be considered not as a particular instrument but as four strings bearing a certain musical proportion to each other of which in the diatonic scale the second was a semitone the third a tone and the last a tone and a fourth to the first as the natural notes b c d e the first and fourth in all tetrachords were fixed and immovable  and one of them was called  summa the highest the other  ima the lowest the highest was that chord which gave the deepest or gravest sound the lowest that which gave the acutest sound and therefore what we call ascending they called descending thus for example if you compare the open strings of a violin to the tetrachord though their proportions are not the same the string which sounds g would have been with them the highest and that which sounds e would have been the lowest  as in their tetrachord their lowest was a fourth to their highest the sense of horace is that tigellius sang the air io bacche and then would sing it over again what we call a fourth higher vox summa is the bass and vox ima the treble  apply this to the music of the spheres the old planetary system may be considered as an heptachord an instrument with seven strings answering to the seven notes in music the diameter of the orbit of each planet is the string saturn who is the remotest and has the longest chord and gives the deepest sound is the musical  or highest and he is so described by pliny and so called by nicomachus but in settling this celestial harmony the ancients are by no means agreed which indeed is no wonder for sense is uniform and nonsense admits of endless variations  the concords of the ancients were the fourth fifth and eighth the third major or minor they held to be a discord and in concert they seem to have only admitted the eighth  the ancient diatonic system was a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a answering to the natural notes of the harpsichord with two semitones and five tones in an octave  of this system our amila or alamire was the  the middle or center  their seven modes or tones in the diatonic system seem to have been reducible in reality to one mode taken higher or lower or to have been six transpositions of one natural original and fundamental mode which you may call the mode of a and consequently as c natural is a minor third to amila so all these modes must have had a minor third  dacier and sanadon have published elaborate and useful commentaries upon horace for which they deserve commendation but if it may be permitted to say the plain truth they too often made free with the property of others and were compillagers poachers and smugglers in the republic of literature as reputation is usually the only reward which the learned obtain for their labors it is the more fit that it should be impartially bestowed if this rule were observed some who ride in fames chariot would be obliged to trudge on foot or to get up behind it sanadon and cerceau in their observations on horace carm v   sonante mixtum tibiis carmen lyra hac dorium illis barbarum affirm that the modus dorius answered exactly to our amila with a minor third and the modus phrygius to our amila with a major third but surely this is a musical error and a dream from the ivory gate two modes with the same tonic note the one neither acuter nor graver than the other make no part of the old system of modes  suppose the strings of an harpsichord are too low exactly by a whole tone strike the keys a b c d e f g alamire a and you will have the sounds of g a b  c d e  f g  the nominal keys and the intervals will remain the musical powers and sounds will be changed  or else if the harpsichord is in tune in the this reminds me to ask you a question whether there be in music any rule and standard for a true pitch usual pitch strike g a b  c d e  f g and call them a b c d e f g a  this seems to be the mystery of the ancient modes they are all to be considered as a b c d e f g a  or in other words they are all first a note second a tone third a semitone fourth a tone fifth a tone sixth a semitone seventh a tone eighth a tone  or they are a note a second a minor third a fourth a fifth a minor sixth a minor seventh an eighth  but when the mode is changed the sounds are altered lower or higher acuter or graver  in the names of the seven modes and in the flats sharps and naturals which will correspond to them when they are reduced to our modern musical system the writers and commentators on ancient music are not agreed but still the system upon the whole the proportions and the intervals are the same  now suppose two instruments of the ancients sounding together and playing the same air one in one mode and one in another they must have sounded all along either seconds or thirds or fourths or fifths or sixths or sevenths but if the ancients would admit none of these not even fifths in concert which the learned i think take to have been the case there remains nothing besides unisons and octaves simple or double for their concerts  seneca thus describes a concert or chorus non vides quam multorum vocibus chorus constet unus tamen ex omnibus sonus redditur aliqua illic acuta est aliqua gravis aliqua media accedunt viris feminae interponuntur tibiae singulorum illic latent voces omnium apparent epist    and aelian on timaeus and the writer de mundo and in general all who have treated of this subject represent  and  harmony and symphony as consisting in the mixture and union of sounds which are  and  acute and grave  in a double octave or fifteen notes the vox media is the middle note the vox acuta is an eighth above it in our way of counting and the vox gravis an eighth below it and so in this chorus all seem to have gone together in unisons and octaves  from ptolemy and his commentator wallis it may be collected how according to their system the seven modes answer to our notes and also how they stood related to each other not according to the vicinity of notes and as b is next to a but as one mode produced another at the intervals of fourths or of fifths which seem to have been the passages by which the ancients made transitions from mode to mode  so likewise in our modern system and in the major tone the key of c natural requires none but natural notes go to the fifth of c and enter into the key of g and you must add one sharp go to the fifth of g and enter into the key of d and you must add another sharp and so on or if you proceed by fourths go to the fourth of c and enter into f and you must add one flat go to the fourth of f and enter into b flat and you must add another flat etc the same is to be done in the minor tone  the keys may be considered as related to each other more or less according as their transposition makes more or less alteration in the system if you go from a key with a major third to the sixth of that key with a minor third no alteration is made in the descending flats sharps or naturals they seem therefore to be as near of kin as a major and a minor tone can be  i shall here mention some of the advantages which the modern diatonic system seems to have above the ancient    by dividing every tone into semi tones we have a great variety of transposed keys or modes or tones    by making use of the major and minor third we have two real and distinct tones a major and a minor which may be said to divide music as nature seems to have intended into the male and the female the first has strength the second has softness and sweetness belongs to them both    our minor tone is improved by borrowing from its major tone a major sixth and seventh to help its progress to the eighth thus a with a minor third takes the sharp f and the sharp g from a with a major third when it ascends to its octave and quits them when it descends    by the aid of semitones we can mix the chromatic with the diatonic music  the introducing a succession of semitones has on proper occasions a beautiful effect as in handels incomparable ombra chara in his radamistus an opera abounding with the happiest union and mixture of art and invention  the division of semitones into major and minor and the quarter notes which belong to the enharmonic system are no inconsiderable part of theoretical music the harpsichord takes no notice of them not being divided for that purpose but though in this and in some other respects it be defective it has the advantage of being a very practicable and a most agreeable instrument and of accommodating itself well enough to the change of keys and to all keys that are not overloaded with flats or sharps especially when the defects are so judiciously distributed by the tuner as not to offend the ear grossly in any place which seems to be the best temperature of the musical circle  i forgot to say a word or two concerning the origin and generation of the diatonic system  the old tetrachord was b c d e add another to it of the same kind and with the same proportions e f g a join them b c d e f g a add an octave at the bottom a b c d e f g a  as the first tetrachord had a minor second that second becomes a minor third when a is added below  what i have said upon this subject is i hope intelligible at least some of the modern writers upon ancient music are deficient in point of perspicuity and seldom give the attentive reader instruction without giving him the headache along with it  the modern musical language or character as expressed by our notation is perhaps of all languages the most true and exact and liable to the fewest defects obscurities and ambiguities and if the time of grave adagio largo etc could be equally ascertained nothing would be wanting to make it complete but that is a point which you have taken into consideration p  0  etc and to you i leave it  the tunes which were played to odes like those of horace must have been plain and simple because of the speedy return of the same stanza and because of the quantity of the syllables which was not to be violated or at least not greatly by the music the modern musicians who have attempted to set such latin or greek odes to music have often too much neglected this rule of suiting the tune to the meter and have made long syllables short and short syllables long and run divisions upon single ones and repeated some of the words  in modern vocal music we regard not this law but perpetually sacrifice the quantity to the modulation which yet surely is a fault but the fault is partly if not principally in our language a language harsh and unmusical and full of consonants and of syllables long by position thus in the alexis of dr pepusch a very fine cantata you have charming  sounds  that  sweetly  languish etc   these syllables according to the laws of prosody are all long except the sixth in the music you have a demiquaver to the first syllable a demiquaver to the second a quaver to the third etc and the singer is obliged to shorten long syllables as well as he can  to judge of our language in this respect you may compare an english heroic verse with a supernumerary foot to a greek iambic  arms and the man i sing who urged by stubborn fate  here are the same number of feet of syllables and of vowels or diphthongs in each but more than twice the number of consonants in the english verse  the tunes of anacreontic songs must have been still more simple than those of odes  of noble race was shinkin   the hymns which consist of a pretty long strophe antistrophe and epodus such as those of pindar gave more scope to the musician and seem to have been susceptible of better melody and more variety and perhaps those odes and hymns and choruses where the meter is latent and less pleasing to our ears when we repeat them had more artful tunes adapted to them than the sapphic and alcaic odes which to us sound more agreeably  if we had the old musical notes which were set to any particular ode or hymn that is extant i should not despair of finding out the length of each note for the quantity of the syllables would probably be a tolerable guide and i would consent to truck the works of signior alberti for the tune that was set to pindars     for as to vivaldi give me leave to say that with all his caprices and puerilities he has a mixture of good things and could do well when he had a mind to it  as the chorus of greek tragedies and the dithyrambic odes were often transcendently sublime and soared far above the regions of common sense up to those of fustian and galimatias if the imagination of the musician was as red hot as that of the poet there were perhaps old musical extravaganzas not inferior to those of any modern  there is one ode in horace carm iii    which runs in the measure of two short and two long miserarum est neque amori dare ludum neque dulci etc this falls into triple time and a sort of saraband might be made to it with two quavers followed by two crotchets in each bar the air was undoubtedly of that kind  the music then of the ancients seems in general to have been more simple than ours and perhaps it would not have the same effect upon us as it had upon them if we could retrieve it we should probably find in it something to commend and something to censure for many reasons it may be supposed to have been superior beyond all measure to the execrable music of the modern greeks the turks persians and chinese which yet is charming in their ears and in their fond opinion would affect even things inanimate with magic numbers and persuasive sound thus it is with music bad seems good till you get acquainted with better  yet one considerable advantage which arose even from the simplicity of the ancient tunes and which greatly set off their concert of vocal and instrumental music was that the singer could be understood and that the words had their effect as well as the music and then the charms of elegant and pathetic poesy aided and set off by the voice person manner and accent of the singer and by the sound of instruments might affect the hearer very strongly we must add to this the harmonious and unrivalled sweetness of the as the latin tongue surpasses ours in sweetness so the greek surpasses the latin when i had taught my little boy his greek nouns and verbs says tanaquil faber he told me one day a thing that surprised me for he had it not from me methinks said he the sound of the greek tongue is much more agreeable than that of the latin you are in the right said i for in it you hear neither strat nor crat nor quit nor brant nor trant nor mit nor put nor git etc which are the common sounds of latin terminations by this i perceived that the boy had a good ear which i took as a presage that his taste and his judgment would one day be good having often observed that this is one of the earliest and best marks of a childs capacity greek language virgil georg ii     cui non certaverit ulla aut tantum fluere aut totidem durare per annos but in modern performances of this kind if you are not acquainted with the song it is often entirely lost to you nor can you always hear it distinctly even when you know it by heart or have it before you to read  as to instrumental music the fashion seems to be to precipitate in all lively and brisk movements this indeed shows a hand but the music often suffers by it and a man may play as well as talk so fast that none can understand him i have heard such performers who had what is called execution lead off the fugues at such a rate that one half of their companions were thrown out and obliged to jump in again as well as they could from time to time yet the violino principale chose rather to put up with a thousand dissonances than to abate of his speed a sure proof that if his hand was the hand of apollo his ears were the ears of midas and that he felt no part of the music but his own  the surprising powers of music as related by several of the ancients may justly pass for exaggerations when horace tells us that a wolf fled from him who met him in the woods as he was chanting the praises of the fair lalage we conclude either that it is a poetical fib or that he sang so ill as to frighten the savage  but surely music deserves the sober compliment paid to it by the same poet when he calls it the assuager of cares  minuentur atrae carmine curae   it atque eam musicen natura ipsa videtur ad tolerandos facilius labores velut muneri

horse an ass a hind some cows some little birds and a cock and hens which were in the court below the window where we stood the cat paid no regard to the music and to judge by his physiognomy he would

time to time the dog sat him down upon his bum like a monkey fixing his eyes steadfastly on the musician and continued a long time in the same posture with the air and attitude of a connoisseur the ass took no notice at all of us munching his thistles very demurely the hind set up her large broad ears and seemed extremely attentive the cows gave us a look and then marched off the little birds in

strings else barely to hold a lyre showed no very free use of the left hand and it appears from ptolemy ii    that they used bothhands at once in playing upon the lyre and that the fingers of the left

father you must know that he compares the soul which animates the human body and acts in every part of it to the wind which fills the organ  isaac vossius has also some remarks upon the ancient organ in his book de poematum cantu which he wrote with a view to extol the music of the ancients and to depress that of all the moderns except his favorites the chinese in this treatise as in most of his works there are some learned ingenious and useful observations mixed with others that are fantastical and extravagant  as the organs of the ancients had many pipes and keys so their lyres or harps had many strings as fifteen twenty some say thirty and more if their lyre is represented in old monuments as having only four or five or seven strings that seems to have been done as vossius observes partly to represent the lyre as it was originally and in its state of infancy  one would think that an ancient musician who was well acquainted with concords and discords who had an instrument of many strings or many keys to play upon and two hands and ten fingers to make use of would try experiments and would fall into something like counterpoint and composition in parts in speculation nothing seems more probable and it seemed more than probable to our skilful musician dr pepusch when i once conversed with him upon the subject but in fact it does not appear that the ancients had this kind of composition or rather it appears that they had it not and it is certain that a man shall overlook discoveries which stand at his elbow and in a manner obtrude themselves upon him  superest de

better grace and instead of being always occupied in composing songs and tunes and in adapting sounds and words to each other to study moral modulations and the art of keeping our actions consonant to

aratus etc there are some learned observations on the ancient music by chilmead and a few fragments of ancient tunes to some greek odes and hymns reduced to our modern notation  it came into my mind that i had perused them long ago and upon looking now into the book i find two remarks of the editor agreeing with my own notions one that the time of the musical notes answered to the quantity of the syllables the other that the music of the ancients was very plain and unadorned  probabilior eorum est opinio qui dicunt toni seu vocis prolationem syllabae quantitatem semper sequi etc  antiquae

from mr avison to his friend in london if any man either from malice or for ostentation of his own knowledge or for ignorance do either huggermugger or openly calumniate that which either he understands not or then maliciously wresteth to his own sense he as augustus said by one who had spoken evil of him shall find that i have a tongue also and that me remorsurum petit morleys introduction to music first published in m dccliii  a reply etc sir i thank you for the expedition with which you transmitted to me the remarks on my essay i have in return sent you a short defense of myself against this virulent though i flatter myself not formidable antagonist  if after looking over these papers you should think that they may serve to rectify the judgments of such persons as this writer may probably have misled i desire you would send them to the press  i must confess from the advertisement of my remarker i apprehended some undue severity and notwithstanding he called himself a gentleman i had prepared myself for the worst my expectation has indeed been fully answered instead of the gentleman the critic the candid musician his pamphlet has discovered him to be a vain disappointed snarling doctor this were other reasons wanting may i think safely be concluded from the pains he takes to make his readers understand that d stands for doctor see his catalogue of ancient english musicians rem p    of the science  he begins i think with a pretty highflown compliment upon the style of my essay and says that it is writ in a language not unworthy of our best prosewriters nay he adds also that the person who drew up the preface to my concertos must be capable of giving sensible thoughts on other branches of music the writer of the remarks is supposed to have alluded to the late mr avisons ingenious friend dr brown author of the essays on ld shaftsburys characteristics  the foregoing letter concerning the music of the ancients was written by the learned dr jortin  but why all this panegyric only to introduce this very candid insinuation that i am but the nominal author of both one and the other  to reply to the man himself or to offer to clear myself of this ridiculous charge i think very much beneath me but i will observe to you that when i had determined to publish some thoughts on the subject of music by way of preface to my last concertos i found my first design of writing directions to performers only grew so much upon my hands that i could not resist the temptation however unequal to the task or extending them also to the practice of composition having thus attempted a province of writing which was new to me i thought i could not engage in it with too much caution and therefore had recourse to my learned friends by whose advice i was induced to separate that part which related to the performance of full music and to publish the whole together afterward under the title of an essay on musical expression and am proud to embrace this opportunity of acknowledging the generous countenance which those gentlemen of integrity and genius showed it so far our critic has wisely conjectured it was the work of a junto  but to speak of the essay itself the plan it was formed upon was of a singular kind it had nothing to do with the theoretic principles and the mere mechanism of the science its aim was widely different intended indeed as a critical but yet as a liberal examen of this pleasing art according to rules not drawn from the formal schools of systematical professors but from the school of nature and good sense  you will easily perceive that to the execution of such a plan nothing was necessary but a good ear and a taste cultivated by frequent hearing of music it was only writing on harmony as many men who never handled a pencil have written upon coloring and as many who never penned a stanza have written upon meter the abbe du bos whom the remarker has deigned to quote on a matter that required some taste in music was unfortunately of this species of writers hear his character from voltaires siecle de louis xiv tous les artistes lisent avec fruit ses reflections sur la poesy la peinture et la music il ne savoit pourtant pas la music il navoit jamais pu fair de verse et navoit pas un tableau mais il avoit beaucoup lu vu entendu and reflechi  and yet in every age writers of this class may be found whose works are held in as high esteem as if they had been composed by the most able practical professors  to give an instance or two if our critic will pardon the learning of it there is not nor perhaps ever was a single verse extant from the pen of longinus and yet his critical taste is as universally allowed as that of horace himself though aristotle may justly be styled the father of criticism and true judgment in poetry yet he certainly did not excel in greatness or beauty of imagination and had but a small share of the poetical spirit  if then the genius of this sort of criticism is universally such that having taste not practice for its object it is directed to improve the manner not teach the mechanism of any science i see no reason why a critical enquirer into the merits of my essay should think it his business first to examine the merits of my musical compositions admitting those compositions to be as bad as our doctor would make them i am then but in the case of those writers whom mr pope somewhere mentions rules for good verse they first with pains recite then show us what is bad by what they write   but mr pope has said in another place let such teach others who themselves excel and censure freely who have written well   this our sage remarker looked upon as an universal axiom that would serve his purpose excellently and accordingly planted it in his title page supposing that the poet thought none had a right to criticize but such as were acknowledged to be good writers whereas he meant by it only that criticism from an allowed artist came with additional force and luster and so undoubtedly it does yet to do my author justice he presently runs from his text himself for in the very  th page he is of opinion that a person would be best qualified to write upon this subject who had not only not written well but who had not written at all provided only that this person was a man of fortune like his friend sir humphrey dash if you ask the reason he will tell you that to be sure sir humphreys large estate would give a sanction and perhaps command a deference to his opinion a very gentlemanly reflection truly  but why must this rich sir humphrey be the only licensed critic and why must a professor though even of the bighest rank not be admitted no he will reply by no means because in some respect or other the world will think him interested in it and will very easily be persuaded that whatever degree of esteem his works or abilities may stand in their opinion yet that in his own they are placed much higher  thus it is evident that his sole objection lay against the author of the essay and not the essay itself and had i not set my name to it it is more than probable the public would not have been favored with his curious remarks and for this reason chiefly he has been instigated to level all his spleen against my character as a composer nor has he thought it sufficient to vilify the work he has given me but he must rob me of that which he could not hope to vilify an unparalleled favor indeed and no doubt personally intended there is a malevolence among some professors of the harmonic art from which no distance of time or country can secure even the most deserving in their own profession their contemporaries they treat as rivals to their interest and the works and characters of those that are gone before they consider as obstructions to their fame  we cannot otherwise account for that wilful ignorance or affectation in some masters who have been weak or rather envious enough to propagate a ridiculous notion that corelli was indebted to another composer for the setting of his basses can any thing be imagined so absurd as this supposition for the nature and method of musical composition is well known to be such that whoever this extraordinary coadjutor of corelli may have been these shallow defamers might have spread their falsities much more consistently had they attributed the construction of the whole to this wondrous unknown     i think i have already reduced my antagonists method of proceeding to its first principles viz to personal pique and resentment and have shown that had he succeeded in his malevolent attempt  had he proved my compositions as execrable as some that have echoed through university theaters had he done even this it would scarce have affected the character of my essay  i will now endeavor to show that the compositions themselves are not quite so blameable as this musical drawcansir would make them  his first critique and i think his masterpiece contains many circumstantial but false and virulent remarks on the first allegro of these concertos to which he supposes i would give the name of fugue be it just what he pleases to call it i shall not defend what the public is already in possession of the public being the most proper judge i shall only here observe that our critic has wilfully or ignorantly confounded the terms fugue and imitation which latter is by no means subject to the same laws with the former  there are many irregular subjects which may often be introduced into musical compositions and when any of these are imitated or reversed a good ear will ascertain their proper answers beyond any rules whatever for the principles of harmony which particularly direct the method of answering a complete and regular subject would carry the answers of many others of a subordinate kind into an extraneous modulation therefore such subjects ought only to be imitated and the distances in this case are no otherwise to be considered than as they may best agree with the mode or key in which they are employed or that which is next to follow neither is it necessary that their intervals should be confined to any stated progression or order in their melody  had i observed the method of answering the accidental subjects in this allegro as laid down by our critic in his remarks they must have produced most shocking effects which though this mechanic in music would perhaps have approved yet better judges might in reality have imagined i had known no other art than that of the spruzzarino see remarks p     before i leave this part of my subject i shall quote two authorities the first of which i make no doubt our critic will acknowledge as authentic since it comes from the same noble author whose treatise on harmony he has himself in his postscript so particularly recommended to my perusal  the second i shall venture to produce without the advantage of so considerable a sanction though in the opinion of unprejudiced men one of those happy spirits whose parts and application will be esteemed in afterages an honor not only to his country but to the present era of that art the progress of which he has so nobly assisted  lord abercorn in his treatise on harmony after several judicious remarks on the use of solmisation in assisting the young composer how to ascertain the proper answers to any regular fugue has the following reflections on the species of composition which is called imitation  there are many other kinds of composition which are often called fugues though they are properly no more than imitations of fugues for their several parts dont strictly proceed by the same species of intervals it would be endless to enumerate all the varieties of these imitations which have been invented by the curious wherefore we shall only take notice of two sorts of them the first of which is simply called imitation and the other is called fuga in nomine  a simple imitation appears to the eye like a fugue its parts seeming to proceed in the same manner if we only consider the lines and spaces on which they are written in these the answer may be made to follow the guide in any interval as of a  d  d  th  th  th  th etc but as in all these cases the several parts do not strictly proceed by the same intervals the semitones being placed differently in one part from what they are in another they are not properly to be called fugues but imitations only lord abercorns treatise on harmony p        the other authority i shall bring from mr rameaus principles of composition on the subject of design imitation etc in music  design in music is in general the subject of all that the composer proposes for a skilful composer is to propose to himself a movement a key or mode a melody and an harmony agreeable to the subject he would treat but this term is to be more particularly adapted to a certain melody which he would have predominant in the continuance of a piece either for making it suitable and agreeable to the sense of the words or for fancy or taste and in that case it is distinguished in design in imitation and in fugue  imitation has no particular merit that deserves our attention it consisting only by repeating at pleasure and in any of the parts a certain continuance of melody without any other regularity  fugue as well as imitation consists in a certain continuance of melody which may be repeated at pleasure and in any of the parts but with more circumspection according to the following rules  if in imitation we may repeat the melody of one or more bars and even the air entirely in one or in all the parts and upon whatever chords we think proper on the contrary in fugues the melody must alternatively be heard in the two principal parts which are the treble and the bass unless instead of the treble we choose another part and if the piece contains many parts it will be more perfect when the fugue is heard alternatively in each part again the chords that must be therein used do not depend upon our choice rameaus principles of composition p         thus much may be sufficient to show that all our critics depth of learning on the subject of musical composition must be of ancient date only since the greatest of the moderns both in practice and theory have rendered quite obsolete many of those rigid laws which only fetter the genius of those who would truly embellish their art  by depriving the composer of the liberty of changing or diversifying his subject his piece with frequent repetitions of the very same thought would be extremely languid and tedious whereas if he relieves his first subject with others and these are relative to their principal in point of air and with regard to their imitations are chiefly conducted by the rules of modulation an allegro of this kind will have infinitely more spirit and variety than either the lifeless counterpoint or unmeaning reverse of throwing the air into one part only what the composer has chiefly to observe in this conduct betwixt the extremes is a special regard to the choosing those subjects only which may naturally be connected as well in their modulation as harmony and are capable of preserving a similar air or discourse if the critic will admit to the conclusion of his piece  this method of introducing the accidental subjects in a musical composition may be handled like the like undercharacters in a dramatic performance which though the poet intends not that they should ever eclipse his hero or principal he will nevertheless make natural and striking and it often happens that though they are necessary to the support of his fable they do but just appear and no more is heard of them  it is frequent with the best composers of churchmusic to introduce a new subject at every change of the words an attempt of this nature in the instrumental way has given our critic much offense which i suppose he has considered as too bold an innovation upon the good old laws of harmony or did he think it an incroachment on the privilege of vocal music and that no other should presume to aim at sense or the expression of any affection of the mind  in his reflections on the method of introducing the tenor he makes a strange pother about music in four parts when in fact there is no such thing the discords it is true will admit of four parts but as the ear cannot rest on these alone therefore in every composition they must have their preparations and resolutions by concords which on that account will have the greatest share in the construction of the harmony otherwise it cannot be called music hence then as it is impossible to find any concord that can admit of more than three different notes so strictly speaking there can be but three parts in any musical composition since whatever number may be added to these they are no more than either unisons or octaves to their principals  i shall here take occasion to observe by way of information to my critic that notwithstanding a piece of music is composed in four parts yet it does not follow that every chord or every accented part of the harmony should therefore have four notes or even three in many cases this kind of fullness is not always required because it often happens that the tenor or any other part being either an octave or unison with the bass or with each other will produce a more pleasing effect than when otherwise accompanied  on this score however our critic has arraigned the taste of marcello as forming his choruses upon the unisons of the solo or principal parts and thence prefers on all occasions the harmonical compositions of four parts not reflecting on those reasons which the sensible composer may assign for exerting his genius in either of these methods and which marcello very happily has distinguished in the prodigious variety of movements that are in the work of his psalms but this purblind critic though he owns his intimacy with them all could only see those which he thought he might abuse and abuse merely because they were contrary to his grovelling taste  what offers next is the wonderful stress he has laid on some trifling disallowances  a mean kind of critique on the art of music as these are errors which may escape the most painful corrections and may be found in the works of the most accurate composers i had almost said it is more than probable our critic may find them in his own unfinished things one knows not what to call their generations so equivocal   it were therefore impossible to retaliate his friendly advice by any minute survey of such unmeaning attempts in composition perhaps too it might prove an unnecessary task having already sufficiently described them in the chapter on modulation from which he has transcribed an entire paragraph with such sensibility of resentment as makes me suspect he was conscious of somewhat he could not bear see essay p    and remarks p      in return for this mortification it seems as if he had vowed revenge and had determined not to allow me even the very first principles of thorough bass but in the fury of his charge he has disarmed himself for he either does not know or at least is unwilling to acknowledge that there are many liberties allowable in musical composition as well as in other arts and especially in many cases that two or more perfect chords of the same kind may not only be dispensed with for the sake of some remarkable air or expression in any one part but that they may even be produced to give a very pleasing effect from many parts together  the method of initiating pupils in music into a thorough knowledge of the rules of accompanyment and the various preparations and resolutions of discords is necessary to explain what is proper to be done in this branch of art yet it is not sufficient to show him all that may be done nature is still superior to art and as the first principles of all science were primarily deduced from nature and have been brought by slow degrees to their present perfection so we may naturally conclude these improvements may yet be carried higher  in music there are express laws relating to modulation as well as to harmony yet if all composers indiscriminately were confined to these laws we should soon see an end of all taste spirit and variety in their compositions and i dont know whether by this means we should not be deprived of one of the strongest efforts of genius viz that of nobly overleaping the too narrow bounds of human art some beauties yet no precepts can declare for there is a happiness as well as care music resembles poetry in each are nameless graces which no methods teach and which a masterhand alone can reach if where the rules not far enough extend since rules were made but to promote their end some lucky license answers to the full the intent proposed that license is a rule essay on criticism   to evince the truth of this if it were necessary i could point out instances to our critic in the works of many eminent composers though not perhaps in the meagre productions of those veterans a list of whom he has given us in his remarks who it seems were such a set of desperados in their way that they sooner would have  spurned against the image of a saint than have taken two perfect chords of one kind together  but to return to my a b c critic  to do him all possible honor we must allow him to know which are false accompanyments in music as bunyan or quarles may have understood what was false grammar in writing and in that case it is but justice to own he has pointed out some faults but such as his singular goodnature would not suffer him to perceive might be faults of the engraver or such as might easily escape the notice of the composer  to instance one of this kind will be sufficient in his first example he has discovered a tritone in the tenor and loudly exclaimed against the enormity of such a blunder whereas had truth in reality been his aim he might have naturally supposed that the engraver had only omitted a sharp the placing of which would have removed all his mighty cause of clamor against the falseness of that relation pains reading study are their just pretense and all they want is spirit taste and sense commas and points they set exactly right and twere a sin to rob them of their mite epistle to dr arbuthnot   but is it not obvious to every one how little conversant soever in the composition of music that among such a multiplicity of business which is necessary in the construction of harmony some things may be overseen some little characters omitted though of signal consequence in the work in spite of every endeavor to prevent such mistakes but those who are only moved with the implacable spirit of ill nature will always either find or invent topics to gratify their malevolent tempers  of this happy class we may rank our masked annotator whose determined censures are but too glaringly the ebullitions of a mortified and splenetic humor thomas morley from whom our critic has drawn his musical learning and produced in his remarks that collection of the old english composers whose names he suspects to have ever come to my knowledge this venerable author himself was not exempt from this tax of censure or calumny rather for writing an useful book and presuming to distinguish himself among his brethren here are his very words  but seeing in these latter days and doting age of the world there is nothing more subject to calumny and backbiting then that which is most true and right and that as there be many who will enter into the reading my book for their instruction so i doubt not but diverse also will read it not so much for any pleasure or profit they look for in it as to find something whereat to repine or take occasion of backbiting such men i warn that if in friendship they will either publicly or privately make me acquainted with any thing in the book which either they like not or understand not i will not only be content to give them a reason and if i cannot to turn to their opinion but also think my self highly beholding to them preface to morleys introduction to music    but to proceed with his remarks  in the above first example the two instances of a ninth being prepared in the eighth is a false charge because he supposes the last and passing note in the bass to give that preparation whereas it is prepared in the accented note of the division which is a fifth and therefore an allowable preparation this he might easily have perceived had he reduced that division in the bass to its fundamental or accented harmony  the false resolution which he has deigned to correct is this the discord improperly resolved is in the last bar between the bass and the alto where b is tied as a ninth to a but instead of resolving it into the eighth according to the rule it rises to the third directly contrary to it  how easy to have made it otherwise i need not prove  however the directs show it very clearly  show what  that our doctor is not quite so wise as he thought himself for this very direct would occasion two eighths between the alto and the second violin  a fault which on all occasions he is very highly offended with besides i must here acquaint him that the resolution of the ninth into the third and third minor especially is by no means against the rule because it is agreeable to the ear and furthermore lord abercorn says the ninth is resolved in a third a sixth or an eighth from every one of the concords it is prepared in etc and if the example from his favorite doctor crofts will not convince him i doubt he must erase the doctors name from the list of his chaste english worthies for i could direct my critic in the anthems of this author to many examples of a like kind with the two here annexed  as to the errors of two perfect chords of the same kind i will confess to him that i am so hardened a sinner on certain occasions against his john trott laws that i have more than once intentionally offended and if he cannot perceive the reason it will scarce be worth while to inform him  it may not be amiss to offer the following remark on the whole of this example  the modulation in a flat key it is well known is very different from that in the sharp key the former being the same whether you ascend or descend whereas if you ascend in the latter the sixth must be sharp though it is flat in descending hence the false fifth and even the tritone cannot always be avoided it is therefore to this imperfection in the scale of music you must impute the c sharp in the tenor and the omission of not figuring that sharp in the bass  and this is the cause of our critics assigning to the above example the worst singing he ever heard nevertheless these false relations are allowable in quick movements and may be found in the very best compositions but in slow movements where they can neither be accented nor even made passing notes they are extremely disagreeable and it seems indeed as if our critic had treated this dissonant tritone in a very solemn way having no doubt tried and retried it upon his harpsichord till dwelling on the discord might sufficiently raise his spleen for the business he had undertaken no   to this first example in notes is added another bass to show the accented harmony in that part by which it evidently appears that the last note in the division or supposed bass has no sort of accompanyment in any of the parts and therefore cannot possibly be included in the general harmony how then can this unaccented unaccompanied and swiftpassing note be supposed to prepare the discord  then judge ye candid composers whether this caviling critic might not blush at so unfair a charge did he not wear a mask to hide his shame  the two perfect fifths in the tenor are obviated by removing one note and the tritone by adding a sharp  for the other example which shows the ninth resolved in a third see croftss anthems vol i p    ps vi and    bar     example the second contains a very curious remark on the passion intended to be there expressed  it is seemingly like the whimpering and whining of a boy who dreads a flogging and goes unwillingly to school etc  but he has done me an honor in this place which he did not intend for as i have always thought that the passions might be very powerfully expressed as well by instrumental music as by vocal therefore in my little attempts that way i have generally aimed at some peculiar expression but it seems our critic has had correction so much in his head that he could not conceive how the plaintive style could be otherwise described or perhaps he formed his judgment of this passage from his own manual execution of it and then indeed i will not dispute with him but it might whine and whimper just in the manner he describes it  the close of his paragraph on this head may be quoted as a sample of his prodigious sagacity in making discoveries i shall only add that if the passages had been less delicate the imitations more just and the harmony in the tutti more perfect and complete it would have been infinitely better music  or in other words if every part had been good the whole had been better  a most notable conclusion no   contains the whipping piece but is here omitted being only a matter of taste between the critic and his author and perhaps too it might rather seem cruel to produce the rod again however gracefully it may be brandished rem p      example the third where the ninth is prepared in the eighth i acknowledge is so far an oversight as strictly speaking it offends against an established rule and therefore i should have thought myself obliged to him for his remark had he corrected with candor if that had been the case he might have supposed this rule was dispensed with for the sake of the subject which is heard in the two principal parts and to which that passage in the second violin wherein is contained the disallowance is only an accompanyment and there intended not to overpower the effect of the fugue and also to preserve a similar air or movement with the upper part however as these and many other liberties are frequently taken by the greatest composers i shall produce only one from that deservedly admired song ombra cara in mr handels opera of rhadamistus this you may remember is a very slow movement whereas in the instance which our critic has noted the movement is rapid and consequently any disagreeable effect that might otherwise be found from the disallowance is here lost in the flight of its progress no   the minum g in the last bar is f in the concertos which no doubt is the same also in our critics manuscript this circumstance trifling as it is may serve to convince him that printers may commit errors in a large work as well as in a small one  in the third bar of the second example the ninth is prepared in the eighth which is the accented note  the third of these examples where the ninth is prepared in the eighth is taken from a full anthem of doctor croftss vol i p  0 ps vi and   st bar  no     st ex    d ex  ombra cara di mia sposa deh riposa lieta as   d ex  neither thy displeasure pleasure neither chasten me in thy dis       the fourth example contains a criticism as strange as he has represented the fault to be his question is  pray in what part is the discord i doubt not but your answer will be where the binding is  and where else can it be placed and thus he proceeds  why then are the figures   and   put there for they manifestly make the upper parts discords but then why are they not resolved if the bass be a discord the second makes it so and the seventh most certainly is a false accompanyment  to all this i answer that the   and   are placed there because the bass stands still for when the parts are driving each other and the bass keeps its note the accompanyments on that account must often be extraneous and where the tastosolo or striking of one key is not directed the holding note should be always completely figured and thence the   and   may frequently be found together in this case every discord out of the common rule of figuratedescant may be considered as a kind of appoggiatura or leaning note where the discord is often strongly expressed and the succeeding concord but just dropped upon the ear but this is an innovation against the venerable fathers of harmony and brought in by the italians i am not therefore surprised that our orthodox critic has exclaimed so violently against it  but there is another circumstance attending this example which our critic was not aware of and with all his amazement at the strangeness of this passage he has shown if possible more folly than ill nature if he does not know that the work of melody may also be exerted and most happily too in the basses of musical composition i will refer him to the operas of rameau where he will find these appoggiaturas and a certain melody in the bass peculiar as yet indeed to this composer giving the finest effects that can possibly be imagined  as to his remark on the thinness of the tenor in this example he may recollect what i have said in my directions to performers at the head of these concertos where it is expressly mentioned with the reasons there assigned why the tenor is intended throughout the whole of that work as an auxiliary rather than as a separate part no   first example shows the appoggiatura in the bass being the cause of our critics amazement and blundering in this place  the second shows the harmony independent of the appoggiatura and in the third the two principal parts are inverted which proves the harmony to be just  you will observe that in the second and third examples there is added a new tenor the reason is this the melody of this passage in the bass being in a great measure taken away a fuller harmony is substituted as there is no particular air which it may overpower whereas in the first example the tenor is unison with the bass to enforce the expression of the appoggiatura or melody in that part  no     st ex    d ex    d ex        in the fifth example he has manifestly overlooked a superior design which at all events he would sacrifice to a slavish regard of very minute disallowances and as he has particularly challenged in this place my audacious attempts both as a composer and critic he must pardon me if therefore i dispute his own pretensions in this case his allegation is this  suppose the question were put to a young practitioner in thoroughbass what are the proper consequents of g sharp in the bass with a seventh figured to it would not his answer be the g sharp is a plain indication that a should be the following note and the seventh which is f natural will expect to find its resolution in e natural  to this i need only observe that as the question is put to a learner so the answer is such as a learner only could give but if he had put the same question to a master he would have shown him that these resolutions may be varied many ways and that otherwise it would be a vain attempt in the composer to produce variety in his work seeing every novice might beforehand suggest when any particular chord was struck what next was to follow  in this example our remarker has roundly asserted that the allegro preceding the adagio no   is concluded with a full cadence in d with its sharp third in order no doubt to show the bad effect of the succeeding modulation into a flat key but this is not fact the allegro being closed in the fifth of the key and therefore an imperfect cadence which like the colon in writing leaves the ear in expectation of something to follow and with regard to a musical composition the modulation in that case may deviate with greater freedom from the common rule no   the imperfect cadence which forms the close of the allegro is here annexed to show that our critic misinformed his friend when he said this allegro was concluded by a full cadence  no   and   convey nothing so it was thought needless to produce them here again  thus by the appearance of these maimed examples in notes designed no doubt by such scraps to catch the eye and exclude the ear our notable projector imagined he had fairly submitted his reasonable critique to the judgment of the public but may not eve too imagine in our turn that as the principles of composition are obvious but to few he trusted the multitude would not see into his flimsy objections i have therefore thought it worth while not only to clear myself of the injustice he would have done me had it been in his power but also to show the imposition he would lay on the art of music itself by exposing his narrow and unexperienced notions in composition     the remaining examples   and   make an excellent close to his critical remarks for whatever errors they are intended to show no person unacquainted with the movement from whence they are taken can form any just notion about them if they are designed as specimens of the composers contrivance the critic has indeed acted consistently to the last because if in these and his other examples he had produced the several pieces entire to which they belong this ingenuous method might not so well have answered his determined purpose of censure perhaps he was aware of this for notwithstanding he has assured his friend that he had not scored all the concertos we are not sworn to believe him nor can i otherwise infer from the nature of his remarks but that his sole intention was a seeking of errors i shall therefore leave him with this frank confession which i have borrowed from epictetus which he may also call an affectation of learning if he pleases that if he were as intimate with the faults of these concertos as i am he would find a great many more  thus i have gone regularly through all the objections which this doughty antagonist has been pleased to raise against these concertos but i fancy i shall be easily excused from taking the same pains with his coarse and wordy comment on the essay itself in which like a true polemic he has laid down but one rule or principle of writing namely to oppose at all events whatever i had advanced and to pervert every plain passage which even so perverted he had not talents to confute  to give one instance  the heat of his rage seems to be kindled at the affront which he would insinuate i have put upon the english composers and to draw their severest resentment upon me he has also as falsely insinuated that i have equally injured the great original which they have imitated  then he produces the following passage  the italians seem particularly indebted to the variety and invention of scarlatti and france has produced a rameau equal if not superior to lully the english as yet indeed have not been so successful but whether this may be owing to any inferiority in the original they have chose to imitate or to a want of genius in those that are his imitators in distinguishing perhaps not the most excellent of his works it is not necessary here to determine see essay p      this he calls a saucy insinuation but saucy to whom if to his doctorship only i am entirely unconcerned about it but if to mr handel i would be the first to condemn it and erase it from my essay this however i believe none but our critic will suspect though every one will easily perceive his reason for quoting and perverting it viz to take off the odium from such meagre composers as himself and to throw it all upon the character of mr handel  i could wish to know whence this unnatural conjunction comes and what mr handel has done that he deserves to be treated with that air of familiarity which our author puts on when he calls him his see the remarks p    brother  poor doctor i know not what tables of affinity or consanguinity can prove you even his cousingerman is mr handel an englishman is his very name english was his education english was he not first educated in the italian school did he not compose and direct the italian operas here many years it is true he has since deigned to strengthen the delicacy of the italian air so as to bear the rougher accent of our language but to call him on that account brother to such composers as our doctor i am persuaded is an appellation that he would reject with the contempt it deserves  with respect to my countrymen i thought i had shown a very high regard to their genius and abilities when i endeavored to prove that by an unprejudiced intercourse with the world in general and by a right application of their own natural good sense the english might undoubtedly receive and improve those advantages which other nations had experienced from a like conduct and without which no distinct people of themselves and no professors in any art whatever can expect to excel  nevertheless our sanguine critic has treated this impartiality as relinquishing the merits of my own countrymen nor will he be satisfied with any thing less than a plenary acknowledgement that they are not only superior to all other nations in their musical abilities but in all former times have deserved the same preeminence  such a position must surely seem false and highly absurd to all judges who esteem it a virtue to be national but not to be bigoted  but it is the indelible stamp of mean and trifling spirits to envy and depreciate the talents of those whom they vainly strive to rival  to this we may justly impute the false odium which some have endeavored to throw on this nation as an encourager of foreign artists  can any thing redound more to its real glory does not this generous regard to merit of whatever country spread the name and genius of the english to the most distant climes and render them an honor to human nature  with regard to music had we been left to ourselves without the least intercourse with other nations it is hard to say what might have been the reigning taste if we may judge from the high claims of those professors who contemptuously reject all foreign improvements i am afraid we should have had no great cause to boast of any superior excellence  yet perhaps i may be mistaken had this been the case it is not improbable but as the names of handel bononcini geminiani etc had then never been heard of our doctor would have reigned at present supreme over our musical kingdom and proved his hereditary right by a lineal descent from his great forefather doctor bull the following extract from the fasti oxon will i apprehend entertain the reader as at once giving him a character of this famous doctor and an idea of the taste of that sort of music which our remarker so highly applauds john bull that prodigy of a man see remarks on the essay p    who had practiced the faculty of music for    years was then admitted bachelor of music  this person who had a most prodigious hand on the organ and was famous throughout the religious world for his church music the words of some of which are extant had been trained up under an excellent master named blithman organist of queen elizabeths chapel who died much lamented in      this blithman perceiving that he had a natural geny to the faculty spared neither time nor labor to advance it to the utmost so that in short time he being more than master of it which he showed by his most admirable compositions played and sung in many churches beyond the seas as well as at home he took occasion to go incognito into france and germany at length hearing of a famous musician belonging to a certain cathedral at st omers as i have heard he applied himself as a novice to him to learn something of his faculty and to see and admire his works this musician after some discourse had passed between them conducted bull to a vestry or music school joining to the cathedral and showed to him a lesson or song of forty parts and then made a vaunting challenge to any person in the world to add one more part to them supposing it to be so complete and full that it was impossible for any mortal to correct or add to it bull thereupon desiring the use of ink and ruled paper such as we call musical paper prayed the musician to lock him up in the said school for   or   hours which being done not without great disdain by the musician bull in that time or less added forty more parts to the said lesson or song the musician thereupon being called in he viewed it tried it and retried it at length he burst out into a great ectasy and swore by the great god that he that added those forty parts must either be the devil or dr bull etc  but which of these eminent personages had the greatest share in this wonderful performance we are not able to determine seeing it has perished in the wreck of time from which not even all its fourscore parts could defend it nevertheless the fame of these great musical deeds has lived in the records of parnassus and no doubt but our critic by his vicinity to that happy mansion has already in view the distant eminence of being enrolled among those chiefs who have done such wonders   having placed our doctor on his throne in this ideal kingdom i very respectfully take my leave of him  but in a sentence or two more i will beg leave to deliver my sentiments of mr handel which i am sure will contradict nothing i have said in my essay and i flatter myself will be assented to by the rational part of our musical judges  mr handel is in music what his own dryden was in poetry nervous exalted and harmonious but voluminous and consequently not always correct their abilities equal to every thing their execution frequently inferior born with genius capable of soaring the boldest flights they have sometimes to suit the vitiated taste of the age they lived in descended to the lowest yet as both their excellencies are infinitely more numerous than their deficiencies so both their characters will devolve to latest posterity not as models of perfection yet glorious examples of those amazing powers that actuate the human soul  i am sir your most humble servant charles avison newcastle        postscript i shall here give the remark of a friend  you have spoken of aristotle p     as of one who did not hold an eminent rank amongst the sons of apollo but played a sort of second repieno in that concert i am somewhat afraid lest you should offend certain academics who upon this occasion may let fly at you a syllogism in barbara or bocardo and attack you with authorities i would therefore advise you to add that cicero and quintilian represent aristotle as one of the most ingenious elegant and polite writers which affords a favorable presumption that his verses cannot be bad and yet on the other hand who more eloquent than cicero whose verses are certainly of the family of the mediocres it is also to be observed that this philosopher exercised his talents in the poetic way composed a scholium or hymn some distichs etc and is commended as a good poet by julius scaliger daniel heinsius and rapin the first of these critics went so far as to affirm that he was in no respect inferior to pindar but for their partial determination of scaliger when he went to the elysian fields  the lyrics all against him rose  and pindar pulled him by the nose   let us then rather be favorable than severe in our judgment upon this great genius and leave his poetical  ambiguous till they be decided by your antagonist when he shall find himself able and willing to settle this counterpoint and to discuss the pro and the con    you may thus read in p      though aristotle may justly be styled  father of criticism and true judgment in poetry and though he was himself a composer of verses yet he holds not the same rank amongst the poets as amongst the critics  finis books printed for lockyer davis   maxims and moral reflections by the duke de la rochefoucault a new edition revised and improved price   s m
