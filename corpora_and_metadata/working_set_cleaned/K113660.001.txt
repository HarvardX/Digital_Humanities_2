the vicar of wakefield a tale supposed to be written by himself  sperate miseri cavete faelices vol i  salisbury printed by b collins for f newbery in paternoster row london mdcclxvi  advertisement there are an hundred faults in this thing and an hundred things might be said to prove them beauties but it is needless a book may be amusing with numerous errors or it may be very dull without a single absurdity the hero of this piece unites in himself the three greatest characters upon earth he is a priest an husbandman and the father of a family he is drawn as ready to teach and ready to obey as simple in affluence and majestic in adversity in this age of opulence and refinement whom can such a character please such as are fond of high life will turn with disdain from the simplicity of his country fireside such as mistake ribaldry for humor will find no wit in his harmless conversation and such as have been taught to deride religion will laugh at one whose chief stores of comfort are drawn from futurity  oliver goldsmith  chap i the description of the family of wakefield in which a kindred likeness prevails as well of minds as of persons  i was ever of opinion that the honest man who married and brought up a large family did more service than he who continued single and only talked of population from this motive i had scarce taken orders a year before i began to think seriously of matrimony chose my wife as she did her wedding gown not for a fine glossy surface but such qualities as would wear well to do her justice she was a goodnatured notable woman and as for breeding there were few country ladies who at that time could show more she could read any english book without much spelling and for pickling preserving and cookery none could excel her she prided herself much also upon being an excellent contriver in housekeeping yet i could never find that we grew richer with all her contrivances  however we loved each other tenderly and our fondness increased with age there was in fact nothing that could make us angry with the world or each other we had an elegant house situated in a fine country and a good neighborhood the year was spent in moral or rural amusements in visiting our rich neighbors or relieving such as were poor we had no revolutions to fear nor fatigues to undergo all our adventures were by the fireside and all our migrations from the blue bed to the brown  as we lived near the road we often had the traveller or stranger come to taste our gooseberry wine for which we had great reputation and i profess with the veracity of an historian that i never knew one of them find fault with it our cousins too even to the fortieth remove all remembered their affinity without any help from the heralds office and came very frequently to see us some of them did us no great honor by these claims of kindred for literally speaking we had the blind the maimed and the halt amongst the number however my wife always insisted that as they were the same flesh and blood with us they should sit with us at the same table so that if we had not very rich we generally had very happy friends about us for this remark will hold good through life that the poorer the guest the better pleased he ever is with being treated and as some men gaze with admiration at the colors of a tulip and others are smitten with the wing of a butterfly so i was by nature an admirer of happy human faces however when any one of our relations was found to be a person of very bad character a troublesome guest or one we desired to get rid of upon his leaving my house for the first time i ever took care to lend him a riding coat or a pair of boots or sometimes an horse of small value and i always had the satisfaction of finding he never came back to return them by this the house was cleared of such as we did not like but never was the family of wakefield known to turn the traveller or the poor dependant out of doors  thus we lived several years in a state of much happiness not but that we sometimes had those little rubs which providence sends to enhance the value of its other favors my orchard was often robbed by schoolboys and my wifes custards plundered by the cats or the children the squire would sometimes fall asleep in the most pathetic parts of my sermon or his lady return my wifes civilities at church with a mutilated curtesy but we soon got over the uneasiness caused by such accidents and usually in three or four days we began to wonder how they vexed us  my children the offspring of temperance as they were educated without softness so they were at once well formed and healthy my sons hardy and active my daughters dutiful and blooming when i stood in the midst of the little circle which promised to be the supports of my declining age i could not avoid repeating the famous story of count abensberg who in henry iis progress through germany when other courtiers came with their treasures brought his thirtytwo children and presented them to his sovereign as the most valuable offering he had to bestow in this manner though i had but six i considered them as a very valuable present made to my country and consequently looked upon it as my debtor our eldest son was named george after his uncle who left us ten thousand pounds our second child a girl i intended to call after her aunt grissel but my wife who during her pregnancy had been reading romances insisted upon her being called olivia in less than another year we had a daughter again and now i was determined that grissel should be her name but a rich relation taking a fancy to stand godmother the girl was by her directions called sophia so that we had two romantic names in the family but i solemnly protest i had no hand in it moses was our next and after an interval of twelve years we had two sons more  it would be fruitless to deny my exultation when i saw my little ones about me but the vanity and the satisfaction of my wife were even greater than mine when our visitors would usually say well upon my word mrs primrose you have the finest children in the whole country  ay neighbor she would answer they are as heaven made them handsome enough if they be good enough for handsome is that handsome does and then she would bid the girls hold up their heads who to conceal nothing were certainly very handsome mere outside is so very trifling a circumstance with me that i should scarce have remembered to mention it had it not been a general topic of conversation in the country olivia now about eighteen had that luxuriancy of beauty with which painters generally draw hebe open sprightly and commanding sophias features were not so striking at first but often did more certain execution for they were soft modest and alluring the one vanquished by a single blow the other by efforts successfully repeated  the temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn of her features at least it was so with my daughters olivia wished for many lovers sophia to secure one olivia was often affected from too great a desire to please sophia even represt excellence from her fears to offend the one entertained me with her vivacity when i was gay the other with her sense when i was serious but these qualities were never carried to excess in either and i have often seen them exchange characters for a whole day together a suit of mourning has transformed my coquet into a prude and a new set of ribbands given her younger sister more than natural vivacity my eldest son george was bred at oxford as i intended him for one of the learned professions my second boy moses whom i designed for business received a sort of a miscellaneous education at home but it would be needless to attempt describing the particular characters of young people that had seen but very little of the world in short a family likeness prevailed through all and properly speaking they had but one character that of being all equally generous credulous simple and inoffensive  chap ii family misfortunes the loss of fortune only serves to increase the pride of the worthy  the temporal concerns of our family were chiefly committed to my wifes management as to the spiritual i took them entirely under my own direction the profits of my living which amounted to but thirtyfive pounds a year i gave to the orphans and widows of the clergy of our diocese for having a sufficient fortune of my own i was careless of temporalities and felt a secret pleasure in doing my duty without reward i also set a resolution of keeping no curate and of being acquainted with every man in the parish exhorting the married men to temperance and the bachelors to matrimony so that in a few years it was a common saying that there were three strange wants at wakefield a parson wanting pride young men wanting wives and alehouses wanting customers  matrimony was always one of my favorite topics and i wrote several sermons to prove its utility and happiness but there was a peculiar tenet which i made a point of supporting for i maintained with whiston that it was unlawful for a priest of the church of england after the death of his first wife to take a second or to express it in one word i valued myself upon being a strict monogamist  i was early innitiated into this important dispute on which so many laborious volumes have been written i published some tracts upon the subject myself which as they never sold i have the consolation of thinking are read only by the happy few some of my friends called this my weak side but alas they had not like me made it the subject of long contemplation the more i reflected upon it the more important it appeared i even went a step beyond whiston in displaying my principles as he had engraven upon his wifes tomb that she was the only wife of william whiston so i wrote a similar epitaph for my wife though still living in which i extolled her prudence economy and obedience till death and having got it copied fair with an elegant frame it was placed over the chimneypiece where it answered several very useful purposes it admonished my wife of her duty to me and my fidelity to her it inspired her with a passion for fame and constantly put her in mind of her end  it was thus perhaps from hearing marriage so often recommended that my eldest son just upon leaving college fixed his affections upon the daughter of a neighboring clergyman who was a dignitary in the church and in circumstances to give her a large fortune but fortune was her smallest accomplishment miss arabella wilmot was allowed by all except my two daughters to be completely pretty her youth health and innocence were still heightened by a complexion so transparent and such an happy sensibility of look that even age could not gaze with indifference as mr wilmot knew that i could make a very handsome settlement on my son he was not averse to the match so both families lived together in all that harmony which generally precedes an expected alliance being convinced by experience that the days of courtship are the most happy of our lives i was willing enough to lengthen the period and the various amusements which the young couple every day shared in each others company seemed to increase their passion we were generally awaked in the morning by music and on fine days rode a hunting the hours between breakfast and dinner the ladies devoted to dress and study they usually read a page and then gazed at themselves in the glass which even philosophers might own often presented the page of greatest beauty at dinner my wife took the lead for as she always insisted upon carving every thing herself it being her mothers way she gave us upon these occasions the history of every dish when we had dined to prevent the ladies leaving us i generally ordered the table to be removed and sometimes with the music masters assistance the girls would give us a very agreeable concert walking out drinking tea country dances and forfeits shortened the rest of the day without the assistance of cards as i hated all manner of gaming except backgammon at which my old friend and i sometimes took a twopenny hit nor can i here pass over an ominous circumstance that happened the last time we played together i only wanted to fling a quatre and yet i threw deuce ace five times running  some months were elapsed in this manner till at last it was thought convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young couple who seemed earnestly to desire it during the preparations for the wedding i need not describe the busy importance of my wife nor the sly looks of my daughters in fact my attention was fixed on another object the completing a tract which i intended shortly to publish in defense of monogamy as i looked upon this as a masterpiece both for argument and style i could not in the pride of my heart avoid showing it to my old friend mr wilmot as i made no doubt of receiving his approbation but too late i discovered that he was most violently attached to the contrary opinion and with good reason for he was at that time actually courting a fourth wife this as may be expected produced a dispute attended with some acrimony which threatened to interrupt our intended alliance but on the day before that appointed for the ceremony we agreed to discuss the subject at large  it was managed with proper spirit on both sides he asserted that i was heterodox i retorted the charge he replied and i rejoined in the mean time while the controversy was hottest i was called out by one of my relations who with a face of concern advised me to give up the dispute and allow the old gentleman to be a  if he could at least till my sons wedding was over how cried i relinquish the cause of truth and let him be an husband already driven to the very verge of absurdity you might as well advise me to give up my fortune as my argument that fortune returned my friend i am now sorry to inform you is almost nothing your merchant in town in whose hands your money was lodged has gone off to avoid a statute of bankruptcy and it is thought has not left a shilling in the pound i was unwilling to shock you or the family with the account till after the wedding but now it may serve to moderate your warmth in the argument for i suppose your own prudence will enforce the necessity of dissembling at least till your son has the young ladys fortune secure  well reurned i if what you tell me be true and if i am to be a beggar it shall never make me a rascal or induce me to disavow my principles i will go this moment and inform the company of my circumstaces and as for the argument i even here retract my former concessions in the old gentlemans favor nor will i allow him now to be an husband either dejure de facto or in any sense of the expression  it would be endless to describe the different sensations of both families when i divulged the news of my misfortunes but what others felt was slight to what the young lovers appeared to endure mr wilmot who seemed before sufficiently inclined to break off the match was by this blow soon determined one virtue he had in perfection which was prudence too often the only virtue that is left us unimpaired at seventytwo  chap iii a migration the fortunate circumstances of our lives are generally found at last to be of our own procuring  the only hope of our family now was that the report of our misfortunes might be malicious or premature but a letter from my agent in town soon came with a confirmation of every particular the loss of fortune to myself alone would have been trifling the only uneasiness i felt was for my family who were to be humble without such an education as could render them callous to contempt  near a fortnight passed away before i attempted to restrain their affliction for premature consolation is but the remembrancer of sorrow during this interval my thoughts were employed on some future means of supporting them and at last a small cure of fifteen pounds a year was offered me in a distant neighborhood where i could still enjoy my principles without molestation with this proposal i joyfully closed having determined to increase my salary by managing a little farm  having taken this resolution my next care was to get together the wrecks of my fortune and all debts collected and paid out of fourteen thousand pounds we had now but four hundred remaining my chief attention therefore was next to bring down the pride of my family to their circumstances for i well knew that aspiring beggary is wretchedness itself you cannot be ignorant my children cried i that no prudence of ours could have prevented our late misfortune but prudence may do much in disappointing its effects we are now poor my fondlings and wisdom bids us conform to our humble situation let us then without repining give up those splendours with which numbers are wretched and seek in humbler circumstances that peace with which all may be happy the poor live pleasantly without our help and we are not so imperfectly formed as to be incapable of living without theirs no my children let us from this moment give up all pretensions to gentility we have still enough left for happiness if we are wise and let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune  as my eldest son was bred a scholar i determined to send him to town where his abilities might contribute to our support and his own the separation of friends and families is perhaps one of the most distressful circumstances attendant on penury the day soon arrived on which we were to disperse for the first time my son after taking leave of his mother and the rest who mingled their tears with their kisses came to ask a blessing from me this i gave him from my heart and which added to five guineas was all the patrimony i had now to bestow you are going my boy cried i to london on foot in the manner hooker your great ancestor traveled there before you take from me the same horse that was given him by the good bishop jewel this staff and take this book too it will be your comfort on the way these two lines in it are worth a million i have been young and now am old yet never saw i the righteous man forsaken or his seed begging their bread let this be your consolation as you travel on go my boy whatever be thy fortune let me see thee once a year still keep a good heart and farewell as he was possessed of integrity and honor i was under no apprehensions from throwing him naked into the amphitheatre of life for i knew he would act a good part whether he rose or fell  his departure only prepared the way for our own which arrived a few days afterward the leaving a neighborhood in which we had enjoyed so many hours of tranquillity was not without a tear which scarce fortitude itself could suppress besides a journey of seventy miles to a family that had hitherto never been above ten from home filled us with apprehension and the cries of the poor who followed us for some miles contributed to increase it the first days journey brought us in safety within thirty miles of our future retreat and we put up for the night at an obscure inn in a village by the way when we were shown a room i desired the landlord in my usual way to let us have his company with which he complied as what he drank would increase the bill next morning he knew however the whole neighborhood to which i was removing particularly squire thornhill who was to be my landlord and who lived within a few miles of the place this gentleman he described as one who desired to know little more of the world than the pleasures it afforded being particularly remarkable for his attachment to the fair sex he observed that no virtue was able to resist his arts and assiduity and that scarce a farmers daughter within ten miles round but what had found him successful and faithless though this account gave me some pain it had a very a different effect upon my daughters whose features seemed to brighten with the expectation of an approaching triumph nor was my wife less pleased and confident of their allurements and virtue while our thoughts were thus employed the hostess entered the room to inform her husband that the strange gentleman who had been two days in the house wanted money and could not satisfy them for his reckoning want money replied the host that must be impossible for it was no later than yesterday he paid three guineas to our beadle to spare an old broken soldier that was to be whipped through the town for dogstealing the hostess however still persisting in her first assertion he was preparing to leave the room swearing that he would be satisfied one way or another when i begged the landlord would introduce me to a stranger of so much charity as he described with this he complied showing in a gentleman who seemed to be about thirty dressed in clothes that once were laced his person was well formed though his face was marked with the lines of thinking he had something short and dry in his address and seemed not to understand ceremony or to despise it upon the landlords leaving the room i could not avoid expressing my concern to the stranger at seeing a gentleman in such circumstances and offered him my purse to satisfy the present demand i take it with all my heart sir replied he and am glad that a late oversight in giving what money i had about me has shown me that there is still some benevolence left among us i must however previously entreat being informed of the name and residence of my benefactor in order to remit it as soon as possible in this i satisfied him fully not only mentioning my name and late misfortunes but the place to which i was going to remove this cried he happens still more luckily than i hoped for as i am going the same way myself having been detained here two days by the floods which i hope by tomorrow will be found passable i testified the pleasure i should have in his company and my wife and daughters joining in entreaty he was prevailed upon to stay supper the strangers conversation which was at once pleassing and instructive induced me to wish for a continuance of it but it was now high time to retire and take refreshment against the fatigues of the following day  the next morning we all set forward together my family on horseback while mr burchell our new companion walked along the footpath by the roadside observing with a smile that as we were ill mounted he would be too generous to attempt leaving us behind as the floods were not yet subsided we were obliged to hire a guide who trotted on before mr burchell and i bringing up the rear we lightened the fatigues of the road with philosophical disputes which he seemed perfectly to understand but what surprised me most was that though he was a moneyborrower he defended his opinions with as much obstinacy as if he had been my patron he now and then also informed me to whom the different seats belonged that lay in our view as we traveled the road that cried he pointing to a very magnificent house which stood at some distance belongs to mr thornhill a young gentleman who enjoys a large fortune though entirely dependant on the will of his uncle sir willam thornhill a gentleman who content with a little himself permits his nephew to enjoy the rest and chiefly resides in town what cried i is my young landlord then the nephew of a man whose virtues generosity and singularities are so universally known i have heard sir william thornhill represented as one of the most generous yet whimsical men in the kingdom a man of consummate benevolence  something perhaps too much so replied mr burchell at least he carried benevolence to an excess when young for his passions were then strong and as they all were upon the side of virtue they led it up to a romantic extreme he early began to aim at the qualifications of the soldier and scholar was soon distinguished in the army and had some reputation among men of learning adulation ever follows the ambitious for such alone receive most pleasure from flattery he was surrounded with crowds who showed him only one side of their character so that he began to lose a regard for private interest in universal sympathy he loved all mankind for fortune prevented him from knowing that there were rascals physicians tell us of a disorder in which the whole body is so exquisitely sensible that the slightest touch gives pain what some have thus suffered in their persons this gentleman felt in his mind the slightest distress whether real or fictitious touched him to the quick and his soul labored under a sickly sensibility of the miseries of others thus disposed to relieve it will be easily conjectured he found numbers disposed to solicit his profusions began to impair his fortune but not his goodnature that indeed was seen to increase as the other seemed to decay he grew improvident as he grew poor and though he talked like a man of sense his actions were those of a fool still however being surrounded with importunity and no longer able to satisfy every request that was made him instead of money he gave promises they were all he had to bestow and he had not resolution enough to give any man pain by a denial by this means he drew round him crowds of dependants whom he was sure to disappoint yet wished to relieve these hung upon him for a time and left him with merited reproaches and contempt but in proportion as he became contemptible to others he became despicable to himself his mind had leaned upon their adulation and that support taken away he could find no pleasure in the applause of his heart which he had never learnt to reverence itself the world now began to wear a different aspect the flattery of his friends began to dwindle into simple approbation that soon took the more friendly form of advice and advice when rejected ever begets reproaches he now found that such friends as benefits had gathered round him were by no means the most estimable it was now found that a mans own heart must be ever given to gain that of another i now found that  but i forget what i was going to observe in short sir he resolved to respect himself and laid down a plan of restoring his shattered fortune for this purpose in his own whimsical manner he traveled through europe on foot and before he attained the age of thirty his circumstances were more affluent than ever at present therefore his bounties are more rational and moderate than before but still he preserves the character of an humourist and finds most pleasure in eccentric virtues  my attention was so much taken up by mr burchells account that i scarce looked forward as we went along till we were alarmed by the cries of my family when turning i perceived my youngest daughter in the midst of a rapid stream thrown from her horse and struggling with the torrent she had sunk twice nor was it in my power to disengage myself in time to bring her relief my sensations were even too violent to permit my attempting her rescue she would have certainly perished had not my companion percieving her danger instantly plunged in to her relief and with some difficulty brought her in safety to the opposite shore by taking the current a little farther up the rest of the family got safely over where we had an opportunity of joining our acknowledgments to here is her gratitude may be more readily imagined than described she thanked her deliverer more with looks than words and continued to lean upon his arm as if still willing to receive assistance my wife also hoped one day to have the pleasure of returning his kindness at her own house thus after we were all refreshed at the next inn and had dined together as he was going to a different part of the country he took leave and we pursued our journey my wife observing as we went that she liked mr burchell extremely and protesting that if he had birth and fortune to entitle him to match into such a family as ours she knew no man she would sooner fix upon i could not but smile to hear her talk in this strain one almost at the verge of beggary thus to assume language of the most insulting affluence might excite the ridicule of ill nature but i was never much displeased with those innocent delusions that tend to make us more happy  chap iv a proof that even the humblest fortune may grant happiness and delight which depend not on circumstance but constitution  the place of our new retreat was in a little neighborhood consisting of farmers who tilled their own grounds and were equal strangers to opulence and poverty as they had almost all the conveniences of life within themselves they seldom visited towns or cities in search of superfluity remote from the polite they still retained a primaeval simplicity of manners and frugal by long habit scarce knew that temperance was a virtue they wrought with cheerfulness on days of labor but observed festivals as intervals of idleness and pleasure they kept up the christmas carol sent true loveknots on valentine morning eat pancakes on shrovetide showed their wit on the first of april and religiously cracked nuts on michaelmas eve being apprized of our approach the whole neighborhood came out to meet their minister dressed in their finest clothes and preceded by a pipe and tabor also a feast was provided for our reception at which we sat cheerfully down and what the conversation wanted in wit we made up in laughter  our little habitation was situated at the foot of a sloping hill sheltered with a beautiful underwood behind and a prattling river before on one side a meadow on the other a green my farm consisted of about twenty acres of excellent land having given an hundred pound for my predecessors good will nothing could exceed the neatness of my little enclosures the elms and hedge rows appearing with inexpressible beauty my house consisted of but one story and was covered with thatch which gave it an air of great snugness the walls on the inside were nicely whitewashed and my daughters undertook to adorn them with pictures of their own designing though the same room served us for parlour and kitchen that only made it the warmer besides as it was kept with the utmost neatness the dishes plates and coppers being well scoured and all disposed in bright rows on the shelves the eye was agreeably relieved and did not seem to want rich furniture there were three other apartments one for my wife and me another for our two daughters within our own and the third with two beds for the rest of my children  the little republic to which i gave laws was regulated in the following manner by sunrise we all assembled in our common appartment the fire being previously kindled by the servant after we had saluted each other with proper ceremony for i always thought fit to keep up some mechanical forms of good breeding without which freedom ever destroys friendship we all bent in gratitude to that being who gave us another day this duty being performed my son and i went to pursue our usual industry abroad while my wife and daughters employed themselves in providing breakfast which was always ready at a certain time i allowed half an hour for this meal and an hour for dinner which time was taken up in innocent mirth between my wife and daughters and in philosophical arguments between my son and me  as we rose with the sun so we never pursued our labors after it was gone down but returned home to the expecting family where smiling looks a neat hearth and pleasant fire were prepared for our reception nor were we without other guests sometimes farmer flamborough our talkative neighbor and often the blind piper would pay us a visit and taste our gooseberry wine for the making of which we had lost neither the receipt nor the reputation these harmless people had several ways of being good company while one played the pipes another would sing some soothing ballad johnny armstrongs last goodnight or the cruelty of barbara allen the night was concluded in the manner we began the morning my youngest boys being appointed to read the lessons of the day and he that read loudest distinctest and best was to have an halfpenny on sunday to put in the poors box  when sunday came it was indeed a day of finery which all my sumptuary edicts could not restrain how well so ever i fancied my lectures against pride had conquered the vanity of my daughters yet i still found them secretly attached to all their former finery they still loved laces ribbands bugles and catgut my wife herself retained a passion for her crimson paduasoy because i formerly happened to say it became her  the first sunday in particular their behavior served to mortify me i had desired my girls the preceding night to be dressed early the next day for i always loved to be at church a good while before the rest of the congregation they punctually obeyed my directions but when we were to assemble in the morning at breakfast down came my wife and daughters dressed out in all their former splendor their hair plaistered up with pomatum their faces patched to taste their trains bundled up into an heap behind and rustling at every motion i could not help smiling at their vanity particularly that of my wife from whom i expected more discretion in this exigence therefore my only resource was to order my son with an important air to call our coach the girls were amazed at the command but i repeated it with more solemnity than before  surely my dear you jest cried my wife we can walk it perfectly well we want no coach to carry us now you mistake child returned i we do want a coach for if we walk to church in this trim the very children in the parish will hoot after us for a show  indeed replied my wife i always imagined that my charles was fond of seeing his children neat and handsome about him  you may be as neat as you please interrupted i and i shall love you the better for it but all this is not neatness but frippery these rufflings and pinkings and patchings will only make us hated by all the wives of all our neighbors no my children continued i more gravely those gowns may be altered into something of a plainer cut for finery is very unbecoming in us who want the means of decency i dont know whether such flouncing and shredding is becoming even in the rich if we consider upon a moderate calculation that the nakedness of the indigent world may be clothed from the trimmings of the vain  this remonstrance had the proper effect they went with great composure that very instant to change their dress and the next day i had the satisfaction of finding my daughters at their own request employed in cutting up their trains into sunday waistcoats for dick and bill the two little ones and what was still more satisfactory the gowns seemed improved by being thus curtailed  chap v a new and great acquaintance introduced what we place most hopes upon generally proves most fatal  at a small distance from the house my predecessor had made a seat overshaded by an hedge of hawthorn and honeysuckle here when the weather was fine and our labor soon finished we usually all sat together to enjoy an extensive landschape in the calm of the evening here too we drank tea which now was become an occasional banquet and as we had it but seldom it diffused a new joy the preparations for it being made with no small share of bustle and ceremony on these occasions our two little ones always read for us and they were regularly served after we had done sometimes to give a variety to our amusements the girls sung to the guitar and while they thus formed a little concert my wife and i would stroll down the sloping field that was embellished with blue bells and centaury talk of our children with rapture and enjoy the breeze that wafted both health and harmony  in this manner we began to find that every situation in life might bring its own peculiar pleasures every morning waked us to a repetition of toil but the evening repaid it with vacant hilarity  it was about the beginning of autumn on a holiday for i kept such as intervals of relaxation from labor that i had drawn out my family to our usual place of amusement and our young musicians began their usual concert as we were thus engaged we saw a stag bound nimbly by within about twenty paces of where we were sitting and by its panting it seemed pressed by the hunters we had not much time to reflect upon the poor animals distress when we perceived the dogs and horsemen come sweeping along at some distance behind and making the very path it had taken i was instantly for returning in with my family but either curiosity or surprise or some more hidden motive held my wife and daughters to their seats the huntsman who rode foremost past us with great swiftness followed by four or five persons more who seemed in equal haste at last a young gentleman of a more genteel appearance than the rest came forward and for a while regarding us instead of pursuing the chase stopped short and giving his horse to a servant who attended approached us with a careless superior air he seemed to want no introduction but was going to salute my daughters as one certain of a kind reception but they had early learnt the lesson of looking presumption out of countenance upon which he let us know that his name was thornhill and that he was owner of the estate that lay for some extent round us he again therefore offered to salute the female part of the family and such was the power of fortune and fine clothes that he found no second repulse as his address though confident was easy we soon became more familiar and perceiving musical instruments lying near he begged to be favored with a song as i did not approve of such disproportioned acquaintances i winked upon my daughters in order to prevent their compliance but my hint was counteracted by one from their mother so that with a cheerful air they gave us a favorite song of drydens mr thornhill seemed highly delighted with their performance and choice and then took up the guitar himself he played but very indifferently however my eldest daughter repaid his former applause with interest and assured him that his tones were louder than even those of her master at this compliment he bowed which she returned with a curtesy he praised her taste and she commended his understanding an age could not have made them better acquainted while the fond mother too equally happy insisted upon her landlords stepping in and tasting a glass of her gooseberry the whole family seemed earnest to please him my girls attempted to entertain him with topics they thought most modern while moses on the contrary gave him a question or two from the ancients for which he had the satisfaction of being laughed at for he always ascribed to his wit that laughter which was lavished at his simplicity my little ones were no less busy and fondly stuck close to the stranger all my endeavors could scarce keep their dirty fingers from handling and tarnishing the lace on his clothes and lifting up the flaps of his pocket holes to see what was there at the approach of evening he took leave but not till he had requested permission to renew his visit which as he was our landlord we most readily agreed to  as soon as he was gone my wife called a council on the conduct of the day she was of opinion that it was a most fortunate hit for that she had known even stranger things at last brought to bear she hoped again to see the day in which we might hold up our heads with the best of them and concluded she protested she could see no reason why the two miss wrinklers should marry great fortunes and her children get none as this last argument was directed to me i protested i could see no reason for it neither nor why one got the ten thousand pound prize in the lottery and another sat down with a blank but those added i who either aim at husbands greater than themselves or at the ten thousand pound prize have been fools for their ridiculous claims whether successful or not i protest charles cried my wife this is the way you always damp my girls and me when we are in spirits tell me sophy my dear what do you think of our new visitor dont you think he seemed to be goodnatured  immensely so indeed mamma replied she i think he has a great deal to say upon every thing and is never at a loss and the more trifling the subject the more he has to say and what is more i protest he is very handsome  yes cried olivia he is well enough for a man but for my part i dont much like him he is so extremely impudent and familiar but on the guitar he is shocking these two last speeches i interpreted by contraries i found by this that sophia internally despised as much as olivia secretly admired him  whatever may be your opinions of him my children cried i to confess a truth he has not prepossest me in his favor disproportioned friendships ever terminate in disgust and i thought notwithstanding all his ease that he seemed perfectly sensible of the distance between us let us keep to companions of our own rank there is no character among men more contemptible than that of a fortunehunter and i can see no reason why fortunehunting women should not be contemptible too thus at best it will be contempt if his views are honorable but if they are otherwise i should shudder but to think of that for though i have no apprehensions from the conduct of my children i think there are some from his character  i would have proceeded but for the interruption of a servant from the squire who with his compliments sent us a side of venison and a promise to dine with us some days after this welltimed present pleaded more powerfully in his favor than any thing i had to say could obviate i therefore continued silent satisfied with just having pointed out danger and leaving it to their own discretion to avoid it that virtue which requires to be ever guarded is scarce worth the sentinel  chap vi the happiness of a country fireside  as we carried on the former dispute with some degree of warmth in order to accommodate matters it was universally concluded upon that we should have a part of the venison for supper and the girls undertook the task with alacrity i am sorry cried i that we have no neighbor or stranger to take a part in this good cheer feasts of this kind acquire a double relish from hospitality  bless me cried my wife here comes our good friend mr burchell that saved our sophia and that run you down fairly in the argument  confute me in argument child cried i you mistake there my dear i believe there are but few that can do that i never dispute your abilities at making a goosepye and i beg you will leave argument to me  as i spoke poor mr burchell entered the house and was welcomed by the family who shook him heartily by the hand while little dick officiously reached him a chair  i was pleased with the poor mans friendship for two reasons because i knew that he wanted mine and i knew him to be friendly as far as he was able he was known in our neighborhood by the character of the poor gentleman that would do no good when he was young though he was not yet above thirty he would at intervals talk with great good sense but in general he was fondest of the company of children whom he used to call harmless little men he was famous i found for singing them ballads and telling them stories and seldom went without something in his pockets for them a piece of gingerbread or a halfpenny whistle he generally came into our neighborhood once a year and lived upon the neighbors hospitality he sat down to supper among us and my wife was not sparing of her gooseberry wine the tale went round he sung us old songs and gave the children the story of the buck of beverland with the history of patient grissel the adventures of catskin next entertained them and then fair rosamonds bower our cock which always crew at eleven now told us it was time for repose but an unforeseen difficulty started about lodging the stranger all our beds were already taken up and it was too late to send him to the next alehouse in this dilemma little dick offered him his part of the bed if his brother moses would let him lie with him and i cried bill will give mr burchell my part if my sisters will take me to theirs  well done my good children cried i hospitality is one of the first christian duties the beast retires to its shelter and the bird flies to its nest but helpless man can only find refuge from his fellow creature the greatest stranger in this world was he that came to save it he never had an house as if willing to see what hospitality was left remaining amongst us deborah my dear cried i to my wife give those boys a lump of sugar each and let dicks be the largest because he spoke first  in the morning early i called out my whole family to help at saving an aftergrowth of hay and our guest offering his assistance he was accepted among the number our labors went on lightly we turned the swath to the wind i went foremost and the rest followed in due succession i could not avoid however observing the assiduity of mr burchell in assisting my daughter sophia in her part of the task when he had finished his own he would join in here is and enter into a close conversation but i had too good an opinion of sophias understanding and was too well convinced of her ambition to be under any uneasiness from a man of broken fortune when we were finished for the day mr burchell was invited as on the night before but he refused as he was to lie that night at a neighbors to whose child he was carrying a whistle when gone our conversation at supper turned upon our late unfortunate guest what a strong instance said i is that poor man of the miseries attending a youth of levity and extravagance he by no means wants sense which only serves to aggravate his former folly poor forlorn creature where are now the revellers the flatterers that he could once inspire and command gone perhaps to attend the bagnio pander grown rich by his extravagance they once praised him and now they applaud the pander their former raptures at his wit are now converted into sarcasms at his folly he is poor and perhaps deserves poverty for he has neither the ambition to be independent nor the skill to be useful prompted perhaps by some secret reasons i delivered this observation with too much acrimony which my sophia gently reproved whatsoever his former conduct may be pappa his circumstances should exempt him from censure now his present indigence is a sufficient punishment for former folly and i have heard my pappa himself say that we should never strike our unnecessary blow at a victim over whom providence already holds the scourge of its resentment  you are right sophy cried my son moses and one of the ancients finely represents so malicious a conduct by the attempts of a rustic to flay marsyas whose skin the fable tells us had been wholly stripped off by another besides i dont know if this poor mans situation be so bad as my father would represent it we are not to judge of the feelings of others by what we might feel if in their place however dark the habitation of the mole to our eyes yet the animal itself finds the apartment sufficiently lightsome and to confess a truth this mans mind seems fitted to his station for i never heard any one more sprightly than he was today when he conversed with you  this was said without the least design however it excited a blush which she strove to cover by an affected laugh assuring him that she scarce took any notice of what he said to her but that she believed he might once have been a very fine gentleman the readiness with which she undertook to vindicate herself and her blushing were symptoms i did not internally approve but i represt my suspicions  as we expected our landlord the next day my wife went to make the venison pasty moses sat reading while i taught the little ones my daughters seemed equally busy with the rest and i observed them for a good while cooking something over the fire i at first supposed they were assisting their mother but little dick informed me in a whisper that they were making a wash for the face washes of all kinds i had a natural antipathy to for i knew that instead of mending the complexion they spoiled it i therefore approached my chair by sly degrees to the fire and grasping the poker as if it wanted mending seemingly by accident overturned the whole composition and it was too late to begin another  chap vii a town wit described the dullest fellows may learn to be comical for a night or two  when the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our young landlord it may be easily supposed what provisions were exhausted to make an appearance it may also be conjectured that my wife and daughters expanded their gayest plumage upon this occasion mr thornhill came with a couple of friends his chaplain and feeder the servants who were numerous he politely ordered to the next alehouse but my wife in the triumph of her heart insisted on entertaining them all for which by the bye the family was pinched for three weeks after as mr burchell had hinted to us the day before that he was making some proposals of marriage to miss wilmot my son georges former mistress this a good deal damped the heartiness of his reception but accident in some measure relieved our embarrasment for one of the company happening to mention her name mr thornhill observed with an oath that he never knew any thing more absurd than calling such a fright a beauty for strike me ugly continued he if i should not find as much pleasure in choosing my mistress by the information of a lamp under the clock at st dunstans at this he laughed and so did we  the jests of the rich are ever successful olivia too could not avoid whispering loud enough to be heard that he had an infinite fund of humor  after dinner i began with my usual toast the church for this i was thanked by the chaplain as he said the church was the only mistress of his affections  come tell us honestly frank said the squire with his usual archness suppose the church your present mistress dressed in lawn sleeves on one hand and miss sophia with no lawn about her on the other which would you be for for both to be sure cried the chaplain  right frank cried the squire for may this glass suffocate me but a fine girl is worth all the priestcraft in the nation for what are tithes and tricks but an imposition all a confounded imposture and i can prove it  i wish you would cried my son moses and i think continued he that i should be able to combat in the opposition  very well sir cried the squire who immediately smoaked him and winking on the rest of the company to prepare us for the sport if you are for a cool argument upon that subject i am ready to accept the challenge and first whether are you for managing it analogically or dialogically i am for managing it rationally cried moses quite happy at being permited to dispute good again cried the squire and firstly of the first i hope you will not deny that whatever is is if you dont grant me that i can go no further  why returned moses i think i may grant that and make the best of it  i hope too returned the other you will grant that a part is less than the whole i grant that too cried moses it is but just and reasonable  i hope cried the squire you will not deny that the two angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones  nothing can be plainer returned the other and looked round with his usual importance  very well cried the squire speaking very quick the premises being thus settled i proceed to observe that the concatanation of self existences proceeding in a reciprocal duplicate ratio naturally produce a problematical dialogism which in some measure proves that the essence of spirituality may be referred to the second predicable  hold hold cried the other i deny that do you think i can thus tamely submit to such heterodox doctrines  what replied the squire as if in a passion not submit answer me one plain question do you think aristotle right when he says that relatives are related undoubtedly replied the other  if so then cried the squire answer me directly to what i propose whether do you judge the analytical investigation of the first part of my enthymem deficient secundum quoad or quoad minus and give me your reasons too give me your reasons i say directly  i protest cried moses i dont rightly comprehend the force of your reasoning but if it be reduced to one simple proposition i fancy it may then have an answer  o sir cried the squire i am your most humble servant i find you want me to furnish you with argument and intellects both no sir there i protest you are too hard for me this effectually raised the laugh against poor moses who sat the only dismal figure in a groupe of merry faces nor did he offer a single syllable more during the whole entertainment  but though all this gave me no pleasure it had a very different effect upon olivia who mistook this humor which was a mere act of the memory for real wit she thought him therefore a very fine gentleman and such as consider what powerful ingredients a good figure fine clothes and fortune are in that character will easily forgive her mr thornhill notwithstanding his real ignorance talked with ease and could expatiate upon the common topics of conversation with fluency it is not surprising then that such talents should win the affections of a girl who by education was taught to value an appearance in herself and consequently to set a value upon it when found in another  upon his departure we again entered into a debate upon the merits of our young landlord as he directed his looks and conversation to olivia it was no longer doubted but that she was the object that induced him to be our visitor nor did she seem to be much displeased at the innocent raillery of her brother and sister upon this occasion even deborah herself seemed to share the glory of the day and exulted in her daughters victory as if it were her own and now my dear cried she to me i will fairly own that it was i that instructed my girls to encourage our landlords addresses i had always some ambition and you now see that i was right for who knows how this may end ay who knows that indeed answered i with a groan for my part i dont much like it and i could have been better pleased with one that was poor and honest than this fine gentleman with his fortune and infidelity for depend on it if he be what i suspect him no freethinker shall ever have a child of mine  sure father cried moses you are too severe in this for heaven will never arraign him for what he thinks but for what he does every man has a thousand vicious thoughts which arise without his power to suppress thinking freely of religion may be involuntary with this gentleman so that allowing his sentiments to be wrong yet as he is purely passive in their reception he is no more to be blamed for their incursions than the governor of a city without walls for the shelter he is obliged to afford an invading enemy  true my son cried i but if the governor invites the enemy there he is justly culpable and such is always the case with those who embrace error the vice does not lie in assenting to the proofs they see but in being blind to many of the proofs that offer like corrupt judges on a bench they determine right on that part of the evidence they hear but they will not hear all the evidence thus my son though our erroneous opinions be involuntary when formed yet as we have been wilfully corrupt or very negligent in forming them we deserve punishment for our vice or contempt for our folly  my wife now kept up the conversation though not the argument she observed that several very prudent men of our acquaintance were freethinkers and made very good husbands and she knew some sensible girls that had skill enough to make converts of their spouses and who knows my dear continued she what olivia may be able to do the girl has a great deal to say upon every subject and to my knowledge is very well skilled in controversy  why my dear what controversy can she have read cried i it does not occur to my memory that i ever put such books into her hands you certainly overrate her merit indeed pappa replied olivia she does not i have read a great deal of controversy i have read the disputes between thwackum and square the controversy between robinson crusoe and friday the savage and i am now employed in reading the controversy in religious courtship  very well cried i that is a good girl i find you are perfectly qualified for making converts and so go help your mother to make the gooseberrypye  chap viii an amor which promises little good fortune yet may be productive of much  the next morning we were again visited by mr burchell though i began for certain reasons to be displeased with the frequency of his return but i could not refuse him my company and fireside it is true his labor more than requited his entertainment sor he wrought among us with vigor and either in the meadow or at the hayrick put himself foremost besides he had always something amusing to say that lessened our toil and was at once so out of the way and yet so sensible that i loved laughed at and pitied him my only dislike arose from an attachment he discovered to my daughter he would in a jesting manner call her his little mistress and when he bought each of the girls a set of ribbands hers was the finest i knew not how but he every day seemed to become more amiable his wit to improve and his simplicity to assume the superior airs of wisdom  our family dined in the field and we sat or rather reclined round a temperate repast our cloth spread upon the hay while mr burchell seemed to give cheerfulness to the feast to heighten our satisfaction two blackbirds answered each other from opposite hedges the familiar redbreast came and pecked the crumbs from our hands and every sound seemed but the echo of tranquillity i never sit thus says sophia but i think of the two lovers so sweetly described by mr gay who were struck dead in each others arms under a barley mow there is something so pathetic in the description that i have read it an hundred times with new rapture  in my opinion cried my son the finest strokes in that description are much below those in the acis and galatea of ovid the roman poet understands the use of contrast better and upon that figure artfully managed all strength in the pathetic depends  it is remarkable cried mr burchell that both the poets you mention have equally contributed to introduce a false taste into their respective countries by loading all their lines with epithet men of little genius found them most easily imitated in their defects and english poetry like that in the latter empire of rome is nothing at present but a combination of luxuriant images without plot or connection a string of epithets that improve the sound without carrying on the sense but perhaps madam while i thus reprehend others you will think it just that i should give them an opportunity to retaliate and indeed i have made this remark only to have an opportunity of introducing to the company a ballad which whatever be its other defects is i think at least free from those i have mentioned a ballad  turn gentle hermit of the dale  and guide my lonely way  to where yon taper cheers the vale  with hospitable ray  for here forlorn and lost i tread  with fainting steps and slow  where wilds immeasurably spread  seem lengthening as i go  forbear my son the hermit cries  to tempt the dangerous gloom  for yonder phantom only flies  to lure thee to thy doom  here to the houseless child of want  my door is open still  and though my portion is but scant  i give it with good will  then turn tonight and freely share  whatever my cell bestows  my rushy couch and frugal fare  my blessing and repose  no flocks that range the valley free  to slaughter i condemn  taught by that power that pities me  i learn to pity them  but from the mountains grassy side  a guiltless feast i bring  a scrip with herbs and fruits supplied  and water from the spring  then pilgrim turn thy cares forego  for earthborn cares are wrong  man wants but little here below  nor wants that little long soft as the dew from heaven descends his gentle accents fell the grateful stranger lowly bends and follows to the cell far sheltered in a glade obscure the modest mansion lay a refuge to the neighboring poor and strangers led astray no stores beneath its humble thatch required a masters care the door just opening with a latch received the harmless pair and now when worldly crowds retire to revels or to rest the hermit trimmed his little fire and cheered his pensive guest and spread his vegetable store and gayly pressed and smiled and skilled in legendary lore the lingering hours beguiled around in sympathetic mirth its tricks the kitten tries the cricket chirrups in the hearth the crackling faggot flies but nothing could a charm impart to sooth the strangers woe for grief was heavy at his heart and tears began to flow his rising cares the hermit spied with answering care oppressed  and whence unhappy youth he cried  the sorrows of thy breast  from better habitations spurned  reluctant do thou rove  or grieve for friendship unreturnd  or unregarded love  alas the joys that fortune brings  are trifling and decay  and those who prize the paltry things  more trifling still than they  and what is friendship but a name  a charm that lulls to sleep  a shade that follows wealth or fame  but leaves the wretch to weep  and love is still an emptier sound  the haughty fair ones jest  on earth unseen or only found  to warm the turtles nest  for shame fond youth thy sorrows hush  and spurn the sex he said but while he spoke a rising blush the bashful guest betrayed he sees unnumberd beauties rise expanding to the view like clouds that deck the morning ikies as bright as transient too her looks her lips her panting breast alternate spread alarms the lovely stranger stands confessed a maid in all her charms  and ah forgive a stranger rude  a wretch forlorn she cried  whose feet unhallowed thus intrude  where heaven and you reside  but let a maid thy pity share  whom love has taught to stray  who seeks for rest but finds despair  companion of her way  my father lived beside the tyne  a wealthy lord was he  and all his wealth was marked as mine  he had but only me  to win me from his tender arms  unnumberd suitors came  who praised me for imputed charms  and felt or feigned a flame  each morn the gay phantastic crowd  with richest proffers strove  among the rest young edwin bowed  but never talked of love  in humble simplest habit clad  no wealth nor power had he  a constant heart was all he had  but that was all to me  the blossom opening to the day  the dews of heaven refined  could naught of purity display  to emulate his mind  the dew the blossom on the tree  with charms inconstant shine  their charms were his but woe to me  their constancy was mine  for still i tried each fickle art  importunate and vain  and while his passion touched my heart  i triumphed in his pain  till quite dejected with my scorn  he left me to my pride  and sought a solitude forlorn  in secret where he died  but mine the sorrow mine the fault  and well my life shall pay  i will seek the solitude he sought  and stretch me where he lay  and there forlorn despairing hid  i will lay me down and die  twas so for me that edwin did  and so for him will i  thou shall not thus the hermit cried and clasped her to his breast the wondering fair one turned to chide twas edwins self that pressed  turn angelina ever dear  my charmer turn to see  thy own thy longlost edwin here  restored to love and thee  thus let me hold thee to my heart  and every care resign  and shall we never never part  o thou  my all that is mine  no never from this hour to part  well live and love so true  the sigh that rends thy constant heart  shall break thy edwins too   while this ballad was reading sophia seemed to mix an air of tenderness with her approbation but our tranquillity was soon disturbed by the report of a gun just by us and immediately after a man was seen bursting through the hedge to take up the game he had killed this sportsman was the squires chaplain who had shot one of the blackbirds that so agreeably entertained us so loud a report and so near startled my daughters and i could perceive that sophia in the fright had thrown herself into mr burchells arms for protection the gentleman came up and asked pardon for having disturbed us affirming that he was ignorant of our being so near he therefore sat down by my youngest daughter and sportsman like offered her what he had killed that morning she was going to refuse but a private look from her mother soon induced her to correct the mistake and accept his present though with some reluctance my wife as usual discovered her pride in a whisper observing that sophy had made a conquest of the chaplain as well as her sister had of the squire i suspected however with more probability that her affections were placed upon a different object the chaplains errand was to inform us that mr thornhill had provided music and refreshments and intended that night giving the young ladies a ball by moonlight on the grassplot before our door nor can i deny continued he but i have an interest in being first to deliver this message as i expect for my reward to be honored with miss sophys hand as a partner to this my girl replied that she should have no objection if she could do it with honor but here continued she is a gentleman looking at mr burchell who has been my companion in the task for the day and it is fit he should share in its amusements mr burchell returned her a compliment for her intentions but resigned her up to the chaplain adding that he was to go that night five miles being invited to an harvest supper his refusal appeared to me a little extraordinary nor could i conceive how so sensible a girl as my youngest could thus prefer a middle aged man of broken fortune to a sprightly young fellow of twentytwo but as men are most capable of distinguishing merit in women so the ladies often form the truest judgments upon us the two sexes seem placed as spies upon each other and are furnished with different abilities adapted for mutual inspection  chap ix two ladies of great distinction introduced superior finery ever seems to confer superior breeding  mr burchell had scarce taken leave and sophia consented to dance with the chaplain when my little ones came running out to tell us that the squire was come with a crowd of company upon our return we found our landlord with a couple of under gentlemen and two young ladies richly dressed whom he introduced as women of very great distinction and fashion from town we happened not to have chairs enough for the whole company but mr thornhill immediately proposed that every gentleman should sit in a ladys lap this i positively objected to notwithstanding a look of disapprobation from my wife moses was therefore dispatched to borrow a couple of chairs and as we were in want of ladies also to make up a set at country dances the two gentlemen went with him in quest of a couple of partners chairs and partners were soon provided the gentlemen returned with my neighbor flamboroughs rosy daughters flaunting with red topknots but there was an unlucky circumstance which was not adverted to though the miss flamboroughs were reckoned the very best dancers in the parish and understood the jig and the roundabout to perfection yet they were totally unacquainted with country dances this at first discomposed us however after a little shoving and dragging they began to go merrily on our music consisted of two fiddles with a pipe and tabor the moon shone bright mr thornhill and my eldest daughter led up the ball to the great delight of the spectators for the neighbors hearing what was going forward came flocking about us my girl moved with so much grace and vivacity that my wife could not avoid discovering the pride of her heart by assuring me that though the little chit did it so cleverly all the steps were stolen from herself the ladies of the town strove hard to be equally easy but without success they swam sprawled languished and frisked but all would not do the gazers indeed owned that it was fine but neighbor flamborough observed that miss livys feet seemed as pat to the music as its echo after the dance had continued about an hour the two ladies who were apprehensive of catching cold moved to break up the ball one of them i thought expressed her sentiments upon this occasion in a very coarse manner when she observed that by the living jingo she was all of a muck of sweat upon our return to the house we found a very elegant cold supper which mr thornhill had ordered to be brought with him the conversation at this time was more reserved than before the two ladies threw my girls quite into the shade for they would talk of nothing but high life and high lived company with other fashionable topics such as pictures taste shakespeare and the musical glasses it is true they once or twice mortified us sensibly by slipping out an oath but that appeared to me as the surest symptom of their distinction though i am since informed swearing is now perfectly unfashionable their finery however threw a veil over any grossness in their conversation my daughters seemed to regard their superior accomplishments with envy and what appeared amiss was ascribed to tiptop quality breeding but the condescension of the ladies was still superior to their other accomplishments one of them observed that had miss olivia seen a little more of the world it would greatly improve her to which the other added that a single winter in town would make her little sophia quite another thing my wife warmly assented to both adding that there was nothing she more ardently wished than to give her girls a single winters polishing to this i could not help replying that their breeding was already superior to their fortune and that greater refinement would only serve to make their poverty ridiculous and give them a taste for pleasures they had no right to possess  and what pleasures cried mr thornhill do they not deserve who have so much in their power to bestow as for my part continued he my fortune is pretty large love liberty and pleasure are my maxims but curse me if a settlement of half my estate could give my charming olivia pleasure it should be hers and the only favor i would ask in return would be to add myself to the benefit i was not such a stranger to the world as to be ignorant that this was the fashionable cant to disguise the insolence of the basest proposal but i made an effort to suppress my resentment sir cried i the family which you now condescend to favor with your company has been bred with as nice a sense of honor as you any attempts to injure that may be attended with very dangerous consequences honor sir is our only possession at present and of that last treasure we must be particularly careful  i was soon sorry for the warmth with which i had spoken this when the young gentleman grasping my hand swore he commended my spirit though he disapproved my suspicions as to your present hint continued he i protest nothing was farther from my heart than such a thought no by all that is tempting the virtue that will stand a regular siege was never to my taste for all my amors are carried by a coup de main  the two ladies who affected to be ignorant of the rest seemed highly displeased with this last stroke of freedom and began a very discreet and serious dialogue upon virtue in this my wife the chaplain and i soon joined and the squire himself was at last brought to confess a sense of sorrow for his former excesses we talked of the pleasures of temperance and the sunshine in the mind unpolluted with guilt i was well pleased that my little ones were kept up beyond the usual time to be edified by such good conversation mr thornhill even went beyond me and demanded if i had any objection to giving prayers i joyfully embraced the proposal and in this manner the night was passed in a most comfortable way till at last the company began to think of returning the ladies seemed very unwilling to part from my daughters for whom they had conceived a particular affection and joined in a request to have the pleasure of their company home the squire seconded the proposal and my wife added her entreaties the girls too looked upon me as if they wished to go in this perplexity i made two or three excuses which my daughters as readily removed so that at last i was obliged to give a peremptory refusal for which we had nothing but sullen looks and short answers the whole day ensuing  chap x the family endeavors to cope with their betters the miseries of the poor when they attempt to appear above their circumstances  i now began to find that all my long and painful lectures upon temperance simplicity and contentment were entirely disregarded the distinctions lately paid us by our betters awaked that pride which i had laid asleep but not removed our windows now again as formerly were filled with washes for the neck and face the sun was dreaded as an enemy to the skin without doors and the fire as a spoiler of the complexion within my wife observed that rising too early would hurt her daughters eyes that working after dinner would redden their noses and convinced me that the hands never looked so white as when they did nothing instead therefore of finishing georges shirts we now had them new modelling their old gauzes or flourishing upon catgut the poor miss flamboroughs their former gay companions were cast off as mean acquaintance and the whole conversation ran upon high life and high lived company with pictures taste shakespeare and the musical glasses  but we could have borne all this had not a fortunetelling gypsey come to raise us into perfect sublimity the tawny sybil no sooner appeared than my girls came running to me for a shilling a piece to cross her hand with silver to say the truth i was tired of being always wise and could not help gratifying their request because i loved to see them happy i gave each of them a shilling though for the honor of the family it must be observed that they never went without money themselves as my wife always generously let them have a guinea each to keep in their pockets but with strict injunctions never to change it after they had been closetted up with the fortune tellers for some time i knew by their looks upon their returning that they had been promised something great  well my girls how have you sped tell me livy has the fortune tellers given thee a pennyworth  i protest pappa says the girl with a serious face i believe she deals with some body that is not right for she positively declared that i am to be married to a great squire in less than a twelvemonth  well now sophy my child said i and what sort of a husband are you to have sir replied she i am to have a lord soon after my sister has been married to the squire  how cried i is that all you are to have for your two shillings only a lord and a squire for two shillings you fools i could have promised you a prince and a nabob for half the money  this curiosity of theirs however was attended with very serious effects we now began to think ourselves designed by the stars for something exalted and already anticipated our future grandeur  it has been a thousand times observed and i must observe it once more that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view are more pleasing than those crowned with fruition in the first case we cook the dish to our own appetite in the latter nature cooks it for us it is impossible to repeat the train of agreeable reveries we called up for our entertainment we looked upon our fortunes as once more rising and as the whole parish asserted that the squire was in love with my daughter she was actually so with him for they persuaded her into passion in this agreeable interval my wife had the most lucky dreams in the world which she took care to tell us every morning with great solemnity and exactness it was one night a coffin and cross bones the sign of an approaching wedding at another time she imagined her daughters pockets filled with farthings a certain sign of their being one day stuffed with gold the girls had their omens too they felt strange kisses on their lips they saw rings in the candle purses bounced from the fire and true loveknots lurked at the bottom of every teacup  toward the end of the week we received a card from the town ladies in which with their compliments they hoped to see all our family at church the sunday following all saturday morning i could perceive in consequence of this my wife and daughters in close conference together and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot to be sincere i had strong suspicions that some absurd proposal was preparing for appearing with splendour the next day in the evening they began their operations in a very regular manner and my wife undertook to conduct the siege after tea when i seemed in spirits she began thus  i fancy charles my dear we shall have a great deal of good company at our church tomorrow  perhaps we may my dear returned i though you need be under no uneasiness about that you shall have a sermon whether there be or not  that is what i expect returned she but i think my dear we ought to appear there as decently as possible for who knows what may happen your precautions replied i are highly commendable a decent behavior and appearance in church is what charms me we should be devout and humble cheerful and serene  yes cried she i know that but i mean we should go there in as proper a manner as possible not altogether like the scrubs about us you are quite right my dear returned i and i was going to make the very same proposal the proper manner of going is to go there as early as possible to have time for meditation before the service begins  phoo charles interrupted she all that is very true but not what i would be at i mean we should go there genteelly you know the church is two miles off and i protest i dont like to see my daughters trudging up to their pew all blowzed and red with walking and looking for all the world as if they had been winners at a smock race now my dear my proposal is this there are our two plow horses the colt that has been in our family these nine years and his companion blackberry that have scarce done an earthly thing for this month past and are both grown fat and lazy why should not they do something as well as we and let me tell you when moses has trimmed them a little they will not be so contemptible  to this proposal i objected that walking would be twenty times more genteel than such a paltry conveyance as blackberry was walleyed and the colt wanted a tail that they had never been broke to the rein but had an hundred vicious tricks and that we had but one saddle and pillion in the whole house all these objections however were overruled so that i was obliged to comply the next morning i perceived them not a little busy in collecting such materials as might be necessary for the expedition but as i found it would be a business of much time i walked on to the church before and they promised speedily to follow i waited near an hour in the reading desk for their arrival but not finding them come as expected i was obliged to begin and went through the service not without some uneasiness at finding them absent this was increased when all was finished and no appearance of the family i therefore walked back by the horseway which was five miles round though the footway was but two and when got about half way home perceived the procession marching slowly forward toward the church my son my wife and the two little ones exalted upon one horse and my two daughters upon the other i demanded the cause of their delay but i soon found by their looks they had met with a thousand misfortunes on the road the horses had at first refused to move from the door till mr burchell was kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred yards with his cudgel next the straps of my wifes pillion broke down and they were obliged to stop to repair them before they could proceed after that one of the horses took it into his head to stand still and neither blows nor entreaties could prevail with him to proceed it was just recovering from this dismal situation that i found them but perceiving every thing safe i own their present mortification did not much displease me as it might give me many opportunities of future triumph and teach my daughters more humility  chap xi the family still resolve to hold up their heads  michaelmas eve happening on the next day we were invited to burn nuts and play tricks at neighbor flamboroughs our late mortifications had humbled us a little or it is probable we might have rejected such an invitation with contempt however we suffered ourselves to be happy our honest neighbors goose and dumplings were fine and the lambswool even in the opinion of my wife who was a connoiseur was thought excellent it is true his manner of telling stories was not quite so well they were very long and very dull and all about himself and we had laughed at them ten times before however we were kind enough to laugh at them once more  mr burchell who was of the party was always fond of seeing some innocent amusement going forward and set the boys and girls to blind mans buff my wife too was persuaded to join in the diversion and it gave me pleasure to think she was not yet too old in the mean time my neighbor and i looked on laughed at every feat and praised our own dexterity when we were young hot cockles succeeded next questions and commands followed that and last of all they sat down to hunt the slipper as every person may not be acquainted with this primaeval pastime it may be necessary to observe that the company at this play plant themselves in a ring upon the ground all except one who stands in the middle whose business it is to catch a shoe which the company shove about under their hams from one to another something like a weavers shuttle as it is impossible in this case for the lady who is up to face all the company at once the great beauty of the play lies in hitting her a thump with the heel of the shoe on that side least capable of making a defense it was in this manner that my eldest daughter was hemmed in and thumped about all blowzed in spirits and bawling for fair play fair play with a voice that might deafen a ballad singer when confusion on confusion who should enter the room but our two great acquaintances from town lady blarney and miss carolina wilelmina amelia skeggs description would but beggar therefore it is unnecessary to describe this new mortification death to be seen by ladies of such high breeding in such vulgar attitudes nothing better could ensue from such a vulgar play of mr flamboroughs proposing we seemed stuck to the ground for some time as if actually petrified with amazement  the two ladies had been at our house to see us and finding us from home came after us hither as they were uneasy to know what accident could have kept us from church the day before olivia undertook to be our prolocutor and delivered the whole in a summary way only saying we were thrown from our horses at which account the ladies were greatly concerned but being told the family received no hurt they were extremely glad but being informed that we were almost killed by the fright they were vastly sorry but hearing that we had a very good night they were extremely glad again nothing could exceed their complaisance to my daughters their professions the last evening were warm but now they were ardent they protested a desire of having a more lasting acquaintance lady blarney was particularly attached to olivia miss carolina wilelmina amelia skeggs i love to give the whole name took a greater fancy to her sister they supported the conversation between themselves while my daughters sat silent admiring their exalted breeding but as every reader however beggarly himself is fond of highlived dialogues with anecdotes of lords ladies and knights of the garter i must beg leave to give him the concluding part of the present conversation  all that i know of the matter cried miss skeggs is this that it may be true or it may not be true but this i can assure your ladyship that the whole rout was in amaze his lordship turned all manner of colors my lady fell into a swoon but sir tomkyn drawing his sword swore he was here is to the last drop of his blood  well replied our peeress this i can say that the duchess never told me a syllable of the matter and i believe her grace would keep nothing a secret from me but this you may depend upon as fact that the next morning my lord duke cried out three times to his valet de chamber jernigan jernigan jernigan bring me my garters  but previously i should have mentioned the very impolite behavior of mr burchell who during this discourse sat with his face turned to the fire and at the conclusion of every sentence would cry out fudge an expression which displeased us all and in some measure damped the rising spirit of the conversation  besides my dear skeggs continued our peeress there is nothing of this in the copy of verses that dr burdock made upon the occasion  i am surprised at that cried miss skeggs for he seldom leaves any thing out as he writes only for his own amusement but can your ladyship favor me with a sight of them  my dear creature replied our peeress do you think i carry such things about me though they are very fine to be sure and i think myself something of a judge at least i know what pleases myself indeed i was ever an admirer of all doctor burdocks little pieces for except what he does and our dear countess at hanoversquare there is nothing comes out but the most lowest stuff in nature not a bit of high life among them  your ladyship should except says the other your own things in the ladys magazine i hope you will say there is nothing low lived there but i suppose we are to have no more from that quarter  why my dear says the lady you know my reader and companion has left me to be married to captain roach and as my poor eyes will not suffer me to write myself i have been for some time looking out for another a proper person is no easy matter to find and to be sure thirty pounds a year is a small stipend for a wellbred girl of character that can read write and behave in company as for the chits about town there is no bearing them about one  that i know cried miss skeggs by experience for of the three companions i had this last half year one of them refused to do plainwork an hour in the day another thought twentyfive guineas a year too small a salary and i was obliged to send away the third because i suspected an intrigue with the chaplain virtue my dear lady blarney virtue is worth any price but where is that to be found  my wife had been for a long time all attention to this discourse but was particularly struck with the latter part of it thirty pounds and twentyfive guineas a year made fiftysix pounds five shillings english money all which was in a manner going abegging and might easily be secured in the family she for a moment studied my looks for approbation and to own a truth i was of opinion that two such places would fit our two daughters exactly besides if the squire had any real affection for my eldest daughter this would be the way to make her every way qualified for her fortune my wife therefore was resolved that we should not be deprived of such advantages for want of assurance and undertook to harangue for the family i hope cried she your ladyships will pardon my present presumption it is true we have no right to pretend to such favors but yet it is natural for me to wish putting my children forward in the world and i will be bold to say my two girls have had a pretty good education and capacity at least the country cannot show better they can read write and cast accounts they understand their needle breadstitch cross and change and all manner of plainwork they can pink point and frill and know something of music they can do up small clothes work upon catgut my eldest can cut paper and my youngest has a very pretty manner of telling fortunes upon the cards  when she had delivered this pretty piece of eloquence the two ladies looked at each other a few minutes in silence with an air of doubt and importance at last miss carolina wilelmina amelia skeggs condescended to observe that the young ladies from the opinion she could form of them from so slight an acquaintance seemed very fit for such employments but a thing of this kind madam cried she addressing my spouse requires a thorough examination into characters and a more perfect knowledge of each other not madam continued she that i in the least suspect the young ladies virtue prudence and discretion but there is a form in these things madam there is a form  my wife approved her suspicions very much observing that she was very apt to be suspicious herself but referred her to all the neighbors for a character but this our peeress declined as unnecessary alleging that her cousin thornhills recommendation would be sufficient and upon this we rested our petition  chap xii fortune seems resolved to humble the family of wakefield mortifications are often more painful than real calamities  when we were returned home the night was dedicated to schemes of future conquest deborah exerted much sagacity in conjecturing which of the two girls was likely to have the best place and most opportunities of seeing good company the only obstacle to our preferment was in obtaining the squires recommendation but he had already shown us too many instances of his friendship to doubt of it now even in bed my wife kept up the usual theme well faith my dear charles between ourselves i think we have made an excellent days work of it  pretty well cried i not knowing what to say  what only pretty well returned she i think it is very well suppose the girls should come to make acquaintances of taste in town and this i am assured of that london is the only place in the world for all manner of husbands besides my dear stranger things happen every day and as ladies of quality are so taken with my daughters what will not men of quality be enter nous i protest i like my lady blarney vastly so very obliging however miss carolina wilelmina amelia skeggs has my warm heart but yet when they came to talk of places in town you saw at once how i nailed them tell me my dear dont you think i did for my children there  ay returned i not knowing well what to think of the matter heaven grant they may be both the better for it this day three months this was one of those observations i usually made to impress my wife with an opinion of my sagacity for if the girls succeeded then it was a pious wish fulfilled but if any thing unfortunate ensued then it might be looked upon as a prophecy all this conversation however was only preparatory to another scheme and indeed i dreaded as much this was nothing less than that as we were now to hold up our heads a little higher in the world it would be proper to sell the colt which was grown old at a neighboring fair and buy us an horse that would carry single or double upon an occasion and make a pretty appearance at church or upon a visit this at first i opposed stoutly but it was as stoutly defended however as i weakened my antagonist gained strength till at last it was resolved to part with him  as the fair happened on the following day i had intentions of going myself but my wife persuaded me that i had got a cold and nothing could prevail upon her to permit me from home no my dear said she our son moses is a discreet boy and can buy and sell to very good advantage you know all our great bargains are of his purchasing he always stands out and higgles and actually tires them till he gets a bargain  as i had some opinion of my sons prudence i was willing enough to entrust him with this commission and the next morning i perceived his sisters mighty busy in fitting out moses for the fair trimming his hair brushing his buckles and cocking his hat with pins the business of the toilet being over we had at last the satisfaction of seeing him mounted upon the colt with a deal box before him to bring home groceries in he had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder and lightning which though grown too short was much too good to be thrown away his waistcoat was of gosling green and his sisters had tied his hair with a broad black ribband we all followed him several paces from the door bawling after him good luck good luck till we could see him no longer  he was scarce gone when mr thornhills butler came to congratulate us upon our good fortune saying that he overheard his young master mention our names with great commendations  good fortune seemed resolved not to come alone another footman from the same family followed with a card for my daughters importing that the two ladies had received such a pleasing account from mr thornhill of us all that after a few previous enquiries more they hoped to be perfectly satisfied ay cried my wife i now see it is no easy matter to get into the families of the great but when one once gets in then as moses says they may go sleep to this piece of humor for she intended it for wit my daughters assented with a loud laugh of pleasure in short such was her satisfaction at this message that she actually put her hand to her pocket and gave the messenger sevenpence halfpenny  this was to be our visitingday the next that came was mr burchell who had been at the fair he brought my little ones a pennyworth of gingerbread each which my wife undertook to keep for them and give them by letters at a time he brought my daughters also a couple of boxes in which they might keep wafers snuff patches or even money when they got it my wife was usually fond of a weesel skin purse as being the most lucky but this by the bye we had still a regard for mr burchell though his late rude behavior was in some measure displeasing nor could we now avoid communicating our happiness to him and asking his advice although we seldom followed advice we were all ready enough to ask it when he read the note from the two ladies he shook his head and observed that an affair of this sort demanded the utmost circumspection  this air of diffidence highly displeased my wife i never doubted sir cried she your readiness to be against my daughters and me you have more circumspection than is wanted however i fancy when we come to ask advice we will apply to persons who seem to have made use of it themselves  whatever my own conduct may have been madam replied he is not the present question though as i have made no use of advice myself i should in conscience give it to those that will  as i was apprehensive this answer might draw on a repartee making up by abuse what it wanted in wit i changed the subject by seeming to wonder what could keep our son so long at the fair as it was now almost nightfall  never mind our son cried my wife depend upon it he knows what he is about i will warrant well never see him sell his hen of a rainy day i have seen him buy such bargains as would amaze one i will tell you a good story about that that will make you split your sides with laughing  but as i live yonder comes moses without an horse and the box at his back  as she spoke moses came slowly on foot and sweating under the deal box which he had strapt round his shoulders  welcome welcome moses well my boy what have you brought us from the fair  i have brought you myself cried moses with a sly look and resting the box on the dresser  ay moses cried my wife that we know but where is the horse i have sold him cried moses for three pounds five shillings and twopence  well done my good boy returned she i knew you would touch them off between ourselves three pounds five shillings and twopence is no bad days work come let us have it then  i have brought back no money cried moses again i have laid it all out in a bargain and here it is pulling out a bundle from his breast here they are a groce of green spectacles with silver rims and shagreen cases  a groce of green spectacles repeated my wife in a faint voice and you have parted with the colt and brought us back nothing but a groce of green paltry spectacles  dear mother cried the boy why will not you listen to reason i had them a dead bargain or i should not have bought them the silver rims alone will sell for double the money  a fig for the silver rims cried my wife in a passion i dare swear they will not sell for above half the money at the rate of broken silver five shillings an ounce  you need be under no uneasiness cried i about selling the rims for i perceive they are only copper varnished over  what cried my wife not silver the rims not silver no cried i no more silver than your saucepan  and so returned she we have parted with the colt and have only got a groce of green spectacles with copper rims and shagreen cases a murrain take such trumpery the blockhead has been imposed upon and should have known his company better  there my dear cried i you are wrong he should not have known them at all  marry hang the idiot returned she again to bring me such stuff if i had them i would throw them in the fire there again you are wrong my dear cried i for though they be copper we will keep them by us as copper spectacles you know are better than nothing  by this time the unfortunate moses was undeceived he now saw that he had indeed been imposed upon by a prowling sharper who observing his figure had marked him for an easy prey i therefore asked the circumstances of his deception he sold the horse it seems and walked the fair in search of another a reverend looking man brought him to a tent under a pretense of having one to sell here continued moses we met another man very well dressed who desired to borrow twenty pounds upon these saying that he wanted money and would dispose of them for a third of the value the first gentleman who pretended to be my friend whispered me to buy them and cautioned me not to let so good an offer pass i sent for mr flamborough and they talked him up as finely as they did me and so at last we were persuaded to buy the two groce between us  chap xiii mr burchell is found to be an enemy for he has the confidence to give disagreeable advice  our family had now made several attempts to be fine but some unforeseen disaster demolished each as soon as projected i endeavored to take the advantage of every disappointment to improve their good sense in proportion as they were frustrated in ambition you see my children cried i how little is to be got by attempts to impose upon the world in coping with our betters such as are poor and will associate with none but the rich are hated by those they avoid and despised by these they follow unequal combinations are always disadvantageous to the weaker side the rich having the pleasure and the poor the inconveniences that result from them but come dick my boy and repeat the fable that you were reading today for the good of the company  once upon a time cried the child a giant and a dwarf were friends and kept together they made a bargain that they would never forsake each other but go seek adventures the first battle they fought was with two saracens and the dwarf who was very courageous dealt one of the champions a most angry blow it did the saracen but very little injury who lifting up his sword fairly struck off the poor dwarfs arm he was now in a woeful plight but the giant coming to his assistance in a short time left the two saracens dead on the plain and the dwarf cut off the dead mans head out of spite they then traveled on to another adventure this was against three bloodyminded satyrs who were carrying away a damsel in distress the dwarf was not quite so fierce now as before but for all that struck the first blow which was returned by another that knocked out his eye but the giant was soon up with them and had they not fled would certainly have killed them every one they were all very joyful for this victory and the damsel who was relieved fell in love with the giant and married him they now traveled far and farther than i can tell till they met with a company of robbers the giant for the first time was foremost now but the dwarf was not far behind the battle was stout and long wherever the giant came all fell before him but the dwarf had like to have been killed more than once at last the victory declared for the two adventurers but the dwarf lost his leg the dwarf was now without an arm a leg and an eye while the giant who was without a single wound cried out to him come on my little hero this is glorious sport let us get one victory more and then we shall have honor for ever no cries the dwarf who was by this time grown wiser no i declare off i will fight no more for i find in every battle that you get all the honor and rewards but all the blows fall upon me  i was going to moralize this fable when our attention was called off to a warm dispute between my wife and mr burchell upon my daughters intended expedition to town my wife very strenuously insisted upon the advantages that would result from it mr burchell on the contrary dissuaded her with great ardor and i stood neuter his present dissuasions seemed but the second part of those which were received with so ill a grace in the morning the dispute grew high while poor deborah instead of reasoning stronger talked louder and at last was obliged to take shelter from a defeat in clamor the conclusion of her harangue however was highly displeasing to us all she knew she said of some who had their own secret reasons for what they advised but for her part she wished such to stay away from her house for the future  madam cried burchell with looks of great composure which tended to inflame her the more as for secret reasons you are right i have secret reasons which i forbear to mention because you are not able to answer those of which i make no secret but i find my visits here are become troublesome i will take my leave therefore now and perhaps come once more to take a final farewell when i am quitting the country thus saying he took up his hat nor could the attempts of sophia whose looks seemed to upbraid his precipitancy prevent his going  when gone we all regarded each other for some minutes with confusion my wife who knew herself to be the cause strove to hide her concern with a forced smile and an air of assurance which i was willing to reprove how woman cried i to her is it thus we treat strangers is it thus we return their kindness be assured my dear that these were the harshest words and to me the most unpleasing that ever escaped your lips  why would he provoke me then replied she but i know the motives of his advice perfectly well he would prevent my girls from going to town that he may have the pleasure of my youngest daughters company here at home but whatever happens she shall choose better company than such lowlived fellows as he  lowlived my dear do you call him cried i it is very possible we may mistake this mans character for he seems upon some occasions the most finished gentleman i ever knew  tell me sophia my girl has he ever given you any secret instances of his attachment  his conversation with me sir replied my daughter has ever been sensible modest and pleasing as to aught else no never once indeed i remember to have heard him say he never knew a woman who could find merit in a man that seemed poor such my dear cried i is the common cant of all the unfortunate or idle but i hope you have been taught to judge properly of such men and that it would be even madness to expect happiness from one who has been so very bad an oeconomist of his own your mother and i have now better prospects for you the next winter which you will probably spend in town will give you opportunities of making a more prudent choice  what sophias reflections were upon this occasion i cannot pretend to determine but i was not displeased at the bottom that we were rid of a guest from whom i had much to fear our breach of hospitality went to my conscience a little but i quickly silenced that monitor by two or three specious reasons which served to satisfy and reconcile me to myself the pain which conscience gives the man who has already done wrong is soon got over conscience is a coward and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent it seldom has justice enough to punish by accusing  chap xiv fresh mortifications or a demonstration that seeming calamities may be real blessings  the journey of my daughters to town was now resolved upon mr thornhill having kindly promised to inspect their conduct himself and inform us by letter of their behavior but it was thought indispensably necessary that their appearance should equal the greatness of their expectations which could not be done without some expense we debated therefore in full council what were the easiest methods of raising money or more properly speaking what we could most conveniently sell the deliberation was soon finished it was found that our remaining horse was utterly useless for the plow without his companion and equally unfit for the road as wanting an eye it was therefore determined that we should dispose of him for the purposes abovementioned at the neighboring fair and to prevent imposition that i should go with him myself though this was one of the first mercantile transactions of my life yet i had no doubt about acquitting myself with reputation the opinion a man forms of his own prudence is measured by that of the company he keeps and as mine was mostly in the family way i had conceived no unfavourable sentiments of my worldly wisdom my wife however next morning at parting after i had got some paces from the door called me back to advise me in a whisper to have all my eyes about me  i had in the usual forms when i came to the fair put my horse through all his paces but for some time had no bidders at last a chapman approached and after he had for a good while examined the horse round finding him blind of one eye would have nothing to say to him a second came up but observing he had a spavin declared he would not take him for the driving home a third perceived he had a windgall and would bid no money a fourth knew by his eye that he had the botts a fifth more impertinent than all the rest wondered what a plague i could do to the fair with a blind spavined galled hack that was only fit to be cut up for a dog kennel by this time i began to have a most hearty contempt for the poor animal myself and was almost ashamed at the approach of every new customer for though i did not entirely believe all the fellows told me yet i reflected that the number of witnesses was a strong presumption they were right and st gregory upon good works professes himself to be of the same opinion  i was in this mortifying situation when a brother clergyman an old acquaintance who had also business to the fair came up and shaking me by the hand proposed adjourning to a publichouse and taking a glass of whatever we could get i readily closed with the offer and entering an alehouse we were shown into a little back room where there was only a venerable old man who sat wholly intent over a large book which he was reading i never in my life saw a figure that prepossed me more favorably his locks of silver gray venerably shaded his temples and his green old age seemed to be the result of health and benevolence however his presence did not interrupt our conversation my friend and i discoursed on the various turns of fortune we had met the whistonean controversy my last pamphlet the archdeacons reply and the hard measure that was dealt me but our attention was in a short time taken off by the appearance of a youth who entering the room respectfully said something softly to the old stranger make no apoligies my child said the old man to do good is a duty we owe to all our fellow creatures take this i wish it were more but five pounds will relieve your distress and you are welcome the modest youth shed tears of gratitude and yet his gratitude was scarce equal to mine i could have hugged the good old man in my arms his benevolence pleased me so he continued to read and we resumed our conversation until my companion after some time recollecting that he had business to transact in the fair promised to be soon back adding that he always desired to have as much of dr primroses company as possible the old gentleman hearing my name mentioned seemed to look at me with attention and when my friend was gone most respectfully demanded if i was any way related to the great primrose that courageous monogamist who had been the bulwark of the church never did my heart feel sincerer rapture than at that moment sir cried i the applause of so good a man as i am sure you are adds to that happiness in my breast which your benevolence has already excited you behold before you sir that doctor primrose the monogamist whom you have been pleased to call great you here see that unfortunate divine who has so long and it would ill become me to say successfully fought against the deuterogamy of the age sir cried the stranger struck with awe i fear i have been too familiar but you will forgive my curiosity sir i beg pardon sir cried i grasping his hand you are so far from displeasing me by your familiarity that i must beg you will accept my friendship as you already have all my esteem  then with gratitude i accept the offer cried he squeezing me by the hand thou glorious pillar of unshaken orthodoxy and do i behold  i here interrupted what he was going to say for though as an author i could digest no small share of flattery yet now my modesty would permit no more however no lovers in romance ever cemented a more instantaneous friendship we talked upon several subjects at first i thought he seemed rather devout than learned and began to think he despised all human doctrines as dross yet this no way lessened him in my esteem for i had for some time begun privately to harbor such an opinion myself i therefore took occasion to observe that the world in general began to be blamebly indifferent as to doctrinal matters and followed human speculations too much  ay sir replied he as if he had reserved all his learning to that moment ay sir the world is in its dotage and yet the cosmogony or creation of the world has puzzled philosophers of all ages what a medly of opinions have they not broached upon the creation of the world sanconiathon manetho berosus and ocellus lucanus have all attempted it in vain the latter has these words anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan which imply that all things have neither beginning nor end manetho also who lived about the time of nebuchadonasser asser being a syriac word usually applied as a surname to the kings of that country as teglat phaelasser nabonasser he i say formed a conjecture equally absurd for as we usually say ek to biblion kubernetes which implies that books will never teach the world so he attempted to investigate  but sir i ask pardon i am straying from the question  that he actually was nor could i for my life see how the creation of the world had any thing to do with the business i was talking of but it was sufficient to show me that he was a man of letters and i now reverenced him the more i was resolved therefore to bring him to the touchstone but he was too mild and too gentle to contend for victory whenever i made any observation that looked like a challenge to controversy he would smile shake his head and say nothing by which i understood he could say much if he thought proper the subject therefore insensibly changed from the business of antiquity to that which brought us both to the fair mine i told him was to sell an horse and very luckily indeed his was to buy one for one of his tenants my horse was soon produced and in fine we struck a bargain nothing now remained but to pay me and he accordingly pulled out a thirty pound note and bid me change it not being in a capacity of complying with his demand he ordered the landlady to call up his footman who made his appearance in a very genteel livery here abraham cried he go and get gold for this you will do it at neighbor jacksons or any where while the fellow was gone he entertained me with a pathetic harangue on the great scarcity of silver which i undertook to improve by deploring also the great scarcity of gold and by the time abraham returned we had both agreed that money was never so hard to be come at as now abraham returned to inform us that he had been over the whole fair and could not get change though he had offered half a crown for doing it this was a very great disappointment to us all but the old gentleman having paused a little asked me if i knew one solomon flamborough in my part of the country upon replying that he was my next door neighbor if that be the case then returned he i believe we shall deal you shall have a draught upon him payable at sight and let me tell you he is as warm a man as any within five miles round him honest solomon and i have been acquainted for many years together i remember i always beat him at three jumps but he could hop upon one leg farther than i a draught upon my neighbor was to me the same as money for i was sufficiently convinced of his ability the draught was signed and put into my hands and mr jenkinson the old gentleman his man abraham and my horse old blackberry trotted off very well pleased with each other  being now left to reflection i began to recollect that i had done wrong in taking a draught from a stranger and so prudently resolved upon having back my horse and following the purchaser but this was now too late i therefore made directly homewards resolving to get the draught changed into money at my friends as fast as possible i found my honest neighbor smoking his pipe at his own door and informing him that i had a small bill upon him he read it twice over you can read the name i suppose cried i ephraim jenkinson yes returned he the name is written plain enough and i know the gentleman too the greatest rascal under the canopy of heaven this is the very same rogue who sold us the spectacles was he not a venerable looking man with gray hair and no flaps to his pocketholes and did he not talk a long string of learning about greek and cosmogony and the world to this i replied with a groan aye continued he he has but that one piece of learning in the world and he always talks it away whenever he finds a scholar in company but i know the rogue and will catch him yet  though i was already sufficiently mortified my greatest struggle was to come in facing my wife and daughters no truant was ever more afraid of returning to school there to behold the masters sweet visage than i was of going home i was determined however to anticipate their fury by first falling into a passion myself  but alas upon entering i found the family no way disposed for battle my wife and girls were all in tears mr thornhill having been there that day to inform them that their journey to town was entirely over the two ladies having heard reports of us from some malicious person about us were that day set out for london he could neither discover the tendency nor the author of these but whatever they might be or whoever might have broached them he continued to assure our family of his friendship and protection i found therefore that they bore my disappointment with great resignation as it was eclipsed in the greatness of their own but what perplexed us most was to think who could be so base as to asperse the character of a family so harmless as ours too humble to excite envy and too inoffensive to create disgust  chap xv all mr burchells villainy at once detected the folly of being overwise  that evening and a part of the following day was employed in fruitless attempts to discover our enemies scarce a family in the neighborhood but incurred our suspicions and each of us had reasons for our opinion best known to ourselves as we were in this perplexity one of our little boys who had been playing abroad brought in a lettercase which he found on the green it was quickly known to belong to mr burchell with whom it had been seen and upon examination contained some hints upon different subjects but what particularly engaged our attention was a sealed note superscribed the copy of a letter to be sent to the two ladies at thornhillcastle it instantly occurred that he was the base informer and we deliberated whether the note should not be broke open i was against it but sophia who said she was sure that of all men he would be the last to be guilty of so much baseness insisted upon its being read in this she was seconded by the rest of the family and at their joint solicitation i read as follows ladies  the bearer will sufficiently satisfy you as to the person from whom this comes one at least the friend of innocence and ready to prevent its being seduced i am informed for a truth that you have some intentions of bringing two young ladies to town whom i have some knowledge of under the character of companions as i would neither have simplicity imposed upon nor virtue contaminated i must offer it as my opinion that the impropriety of such a step will be attended with dangerous consequences it has never been my way to treat the infamous or the lewd with severity nor should i now have taken this method of explaining myself or reproving folly did it not aim at guilt take therefore the admonition of a friend and seriously reflect on the consequences of introducing infamy and vice into retreats where peace and innocence have hitherto resided    our doubts were now at an end there seemed indeed something applicable to both sides in this letter and its censures might as well be referred to those to whom it was written as to us but the malicious meaning was obvious and we went no farther my wife had scarce patience to hear me to the end but railed at the writer with unrestrained resentment olivia was equally severe and sophia seemed perfectly amazed at his baseness as for my part it appeared to me one of the vilest instances of unprovoked ingratitude i had met with nor could i account for it in any other manner than by imputing it to his desire of detaining my youngest daughter in the country to have the more frequent opportunities of an interview in this manner we all sat ruminating upon schemes of vengeance when our other little boy came running in to tell us that mr burchell was approaching at the other end of the field it is easier to conceive than describe the complicated sensations which are felt from the pain of a recent injury and the pleasure of approaching revenge though our intentions were only to upbraid him with his ingratitude yet it was resolved to do it in a manner that would be perfectly cutting for this purpose we agreed to meet him with our usual smiles to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary kindness to amuse him a little but then in the midst of the flattering calm to burst upon him like an earthquake and overwhelm him with the sense of his own baseness this being resolved upon my wife undertook to manage the business herself as she really had some talents for such an undertaking we saw him approach he entered drew a chair and sat down  a fine day mr burchell  a very fine day doctor though i fancy we shall have some rain by the shooting of my corns  the shooting of your horns cried my wife in a loud fit of laughter and then asked pardon for being fond of a joke  dear madam replied he i pardon you with all my heart for i protest i should not have thought it a joke till you told me  perhaps not sir cried my wife winking at us and yet i dare say you can tell us how many jokes go to an ounce  i fancy madam returned burchell you have been reading a jest book this morning that ounce of jokes is so very good a conceit and yet madam i had rather see half an ounce of understanding  i believe you might cried my wife still smiling at us though the laugh was against her and yet i have seen some men pretend to understanding that have very little  and no doubt replied her antagonist you have known ladies set up for wit that had none  i quickly began to find that my wife was likely to gain but little at this business so i resolved to treat him in a style of more severity myself both wit and understanding cried i are trifles without integrity it is that which gives value to every character the ignorant peasant without fault is greater than the philosopher with many for what is genius or courage without an heart an honest man is the noblest work of god  i always held that favorite maxim of pope returned mr burchell as very unworthy a man of genius and a base desertion of his own superiority as the reputation of books is raised not by their freedom from defect but the greatness of their beauties so should that of men be prized not for their exemption from fault but the size of those virtues they are possessed of the scholar may want prudence the statesman may have pride and the champion ferocity but shall we prefer to these men the low mechanic who laboriously plods on through life without censure or applause we might as well prefer the tame correct paintings of the flemish school to the erroneous but sublime animations of the roman pencil  sir replied i your present observation is just when there are shining virtues and minute defects but when it appears that great vices are opposed in the same mind to as extraordinary virtues such a character deserves contempt  perhaps cried he there may be some such monsters as you describe of great vices joined to great virtues yet in my progress through life i never yet found one instance of their existence on the contrary i have ever perceived that where the mind was capacious the affections were good and indeed providence seems kindly our friend in this particular thus to debilitate the understanding where the heart is corrupt and diminish the power where there is the will to do mischief this rule seems to extend even to other animals the little vermin race are ever treacherous cruel and cowardly whilst those endowed with strength and power are generous brave and gentle  these observations sound well returned i and yet it would be easy this moment to point out a man and i fixed my eye steadfastly upon him whose head and heart form a most detestable contrast ay sir continued i raising my voice and i am glad to have this opportunity of detecting him in the midst of his fancied securiry do you know this sir this pocketbook  yes sir returned he with a face of impenetrable assurance that pocketbook is mine and i am glad you have found it  and do you know cried i this letter nay never falter man but look me full in the face i say do you know this letter  that letter returned he yes it was i that wrote that letter  and how could you said i so basely so ungratefully presume to write this letter  and how came you replied he with looks of unparallelled effrontery so basely to presume to break open this letter dont you know now i could hang you all for this all that i have to do is to swear at the next justices that you have been guilty of breaking open the lock of my pocketbook and so hang you all up at his door this piece of unexpected insolence raised me to such a pitch that i could scare govern my passion ungrateful wretch begone and no longer pollute my dwelling with thy baseness begone and never let me see thee again go from my doors and the only punishment i wish thee is an allarmed conscience which will be a sufficient tormentor so saying i threw him his pocketbook which he took up with a smile and shutting the clasps with the utmost composure left us quite astonished at the serenity of his assurance my wife was particularly enraged that nothing could make him angry or make him seem ashamed of his villainies my dear cried i willing to calm those passions that had been raised too high among us we are not to be surprised that bad men want shame they only blush at being detected in doing good but glory in their vices  guilt and shame says the allegory were at first companions and in the beginning of their journey inseparably kept together but their union was soon found to be disagreeable and inconvenient to both guilt gave shame frequent uneasiness and shame often betrayed the secret conspiracies of guilt after long disagreement therefore they at length consented to part for ever guilt boldly walked forward alone to overtake fate that went before in the shape of an executioner but shame being naturally timorous returned back to keep company with virtue which in the beginning of their journey they had left behind thus my children after men have traveled through a few stages in vice they no longer continue to have shame at doing evil and shame attends only upon their virtues  chap xvi the family use art which is opposed with still greater  whatever might have been sophias sensations the rest of the family was easily consoled for mr burchells absence by the company of our landlord whose visits now became more frequent and longer though he had been disappointed in procuring my daughters the amusements of the town as he designed he took every opportunity of supplying them with those little recreations which our retirement would admit of he usually came in the morning and while my son and i followed our occupations abroad he sat with the family at home and amused them by describing the town with every part of which he was particularly acquainted he could repeat all the observations that were retailed in the atmosphere of the play houses and had all the good things of the high wits by rote long before they made way into the jestbooks the intervals between coversation were employed in teaching my daughters piquet or sometimes in setting my two little ones to box to make them sharp as he called it but the hopes of having him for a soninlaw in some measure blinded us to all his defects it must be owned that my wife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him or to speak it more tenderly used every art to magnify the merit of her daughter if the cakes at tea eat short and crisp they were made by olivia if the gooseberry wine was well knit the gooseberries were of her gathering it was her fingers gave the pickles their peculiar green and in the composition of a pudding her judgment was infallible then the poor woman would sometimes tell the squire that she thought him and olivia extremely like each other and would bid both stand up to see which was tallest these instances of cunning which she thought impenetrable yet which every body saw through were very pleasing to our benefactor who gave every day some new proofs of his passion which though they had not arisen to proposals of marriage yet we thought fell but little short of it and his slowness was attributed sometimes to native bashfulness and sometimes to his fear of offending a rich uncle an occurrence however which happened soon after put it beyond a doubt that he designed to become one of the family my wife even regarded it as an absolute promise  my wife and daughters happening to return a visit to neighbor flamboroughs found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by a limner who traveled the country and did them for fifteen shillings a head as this family and ours had long a sort of rivalry in point of taste our spirit took the alarm at this stolen march upon us and notwithstanding all i could say and i said much it was resolved that we should have our pictures done too having therefore engaged the limner for what could i do our next deliberation was to show the superiority of our taste in the attitudes as for our neighbors family there were seven of them and they were drawn with seven oranges a thing quite out of taste no variety in life no composition in the world we desired to have something done in a brighter style and after many debates at length came to an unanimous resolution to be drawn together in one large historical family piece this would be cheaper since one frame would serve for all and it would be infinitely more genteel for all families of any taste were now drawn in the same manner as we did not immediately recollect an historical subject to hit us we were contented each with being drawn as independent historical figures my wife desired to be represented as venus with a stomacher richly set with diamonds and her two little ones as cupids by her side while i in my gown and band was to present her with my books on the bangorean controversy olivia would be drawn as an amazon sitting upon a bank of flowers dressed in a green joseph laced with gold and a whip in her hand sophia was to be a shepherdess with as many sheep as the painter could spare and moses was to be dressed out with an hat and white feather our taste so much pleased the squire that he insisted on being put in as one of the family in the character of alexander the great at olivias feet this was considered by us all as an indication of his desire to be introduced into the family in reality nor could we refuse his request the painter was therefore set to work and as he wrought with assiduity and expedition in less than four days the whole was completed the piece was large and it must be owned he did not spare his colors for which my wife gave him great encomiums we were all perfectly satisfied with his performance but an unfortunate circumstance had not occurred till the picture was finished which now struck us with dismay it was so very large that we had no place in the house to fix it how we all came to disregard so material a point is inconceivable but certain it is we were this time all greatly overseen instead therefore of gratifying our vanity as we hoped there it leaned in a most mortifying manner against the kitchen wall where the canvas was stretched and painted much too large to be got through any of the doors and the jest of all our neighbors one compared it to robinson crusoes longboat too large to be removed another thought it more resembled a reel in a bottle some wondered how it should be got out and still more were amazed how it ever got in  but though it excited the ridicule of some it effectually raised more illnatured suggestions in many the squires portrait being found united with ours was an honor too great to escape envy malicious whispers began to circulate at our expense and our tranquillity continually to be disturbed by persons who came as friends to tell us what was said of us by enemies these reports we always resented with becoming spirit but scandal ever improves by opposition we again therefore entered into a consultation upon obviating the malice of our enemies and at last came to a resolution which had too much cunning to give me entire satisfaction it was this as our principal object was to discover the honor of mr thornhills addresses my wife undertook to sound him by pretending to ask his advice in the choice of an husband for her eldest daughter if this was not found sufficient to induce him to a declaration it was then fixed upon to terrify him with a rival which it was thought would compel him though never so refractory to this last step however i would by no means give my consent till olivia gave me the most solemn assurances that she would marry the person provided to rival him upon this occasion if mr thornhill did not prevent it by taking her himself such was the scheme laid which though i did not strenuously oppose i did not entirely approve  the next time therefore that mr thornhill came to see us my girls took care to be out of the way in order to give their mamma an opportunity of putting her scheme in execution but they only retired to the next room from whence they could overhear the whole conversation which my wife artfully introduced by observing that one of the miss flamboroughs was like to have a very good match of it in mr spanker to this the squire assenting she proceeded to remark that they who had warm fortunes were always sure of getting good husbands but heaven help continued she the girls that have none what signifies beauty mr thornhill or what signifies all the virtue and all the qualifications in the world in this age of selfinterest it is not what is she but what has she is all the cry  madam returned he i highly approve the justice as well as the novelty of your remarks and if i were a king it should be otherwise it would then indeed be fine times with the girls without fortunes our two young ladies should be the first for whom i would provide  ah sir returned my wife you are pleased to be facetious but i wish i were a queen and then i know where they should look for an husband but now that you have put it into my head seriously mr thornhill cannot you recommend me a proper husband for my eldest girl she is now nineteen years old well grown and well educated and in my humble opinion does not want for parts  madam replied he if i were to choose i would find out a person possessed of every accomplishment that can make an angel happy one with prudence fortune taste and sincerity such madam would be in my opinion the proper husband ay sir said she but do you know of any such person  no madam returned he it is impossible to know any person that deserves to be her husband she is too great a treasure for one mans possession she is a goddess upon my soul i speak what i think she is an angel  ah mr thornhill you only flatter my poor girl but we have been thinking of marrying her to one of your tenants whose mother is lately dead and who wants a manager you know whom i mean farmer williams a warm man mr thornhill able to give her good bread ay and who has several times made her proposals which was actually the case but sir concluded she i should be glad to have your approbation of our choice  how madam replied he my approbation my approbation of such a choice never what sacrifice so much beauty and sense and goodness to a creature insensible of the blessing excuse me i can never approve of such a piece of injustice and i have my reasons  indeed sir cried deborah if you have your reasons that is another affair but i should be glad to know those reasons  excuse me madam returned he they lie too deep for discovery laying his hand upon his bosom they remain buried rivetted here  after he was gone upon general consultation we could not tell what to make of these fine sentiments olivia considered them as instances of the most exalted passion but i was not quite so sanguine it seemed to me pretty plain that they had more of love than matrimony in them yet whatever they might portend it was resolved to prosecute the scheme of farmer williams who since my daughters first appearance in the country had paid her his addresses  chap xvii scarce any virtue found to resist the power of long and pleasing temptation  as i only studied my childs real happiness the assiduity of mr williams pleased me as he was in easy circumstances prudent and sincere it required but very little encouragement to revive his former passion so that in an evening or two after he and mr thornhill met at our house and surveyed each other for some time with looks of anger but williams owed his landlord no rent and little regarded his indignation olivia on her side acted the coquet to perfection if that might be called acting which was her real character pretending to lavish all her tenderness on her new lover mr thornhill appeared quite dejected at this preference and with a pensive air took leave though i own it puzzled me to find him so much in pain as he appeared to be when he had it in his power so easily to remove the cause by declaring an honorable passion but whatever uneasiness he seemed to endure it could easily be perceived that olivias anguish was still greater after any of these interviews between her lovers of which there were several she usually retired to solitude and there indulged her grief it was in such a situation i found her one evening after she had been for some time supporting a fictitious gayety  you now see my child said i that your confidence in mr thornhills passion was all a dream he permits the rivalry of another every way his inferior though he knows it lies in his power to secure you by a candid declaration himself  yes pappa returned she but he has his reasons for this delay i know he has the sincerity of his looks and words convince me of his real esteem a short time i hope will discover the generosity of his sentiments and convince you that my opinion of him has been more just than yours  olivia my darling returned i every scheme that has been hitherto pursued to compel him to a declaration has been proposed and planned by yourself nor can you in the least say that i have constrained you but you must not suppose my dear that i will be ever instrumental in suffering his honest rival to be the dupe of your illplaced passion whatever time you require to bring your fancied admirer to an explanation shall be granted but at the expiration of that term if he is still regardless i must absolutely insist that honest mr williams shall be rewarded for his fidelity the character which i have hitherto supported in life demands this from me and my tenderness as a parent shall never influence my integrity as a man name then your day let it be as distant as you think proper and in the mean time take care to let mr thornhill know the exact time on which i design delivering you up to another if he really loves you his own good sense will readily suggest that there is but one method alone to prevent his losing you for ever  this proposal which she could not avoid considering as perfectly just was readily agreed to she again renewed her most positive promise of marrying mr williams in case of the others insensibility and at the next opportunity in mr thornhills presence that day month was fixed upon for her nuptials with his rival  such vigorous proceedings seemed to redouble mr thornhills anxiety but what olivia really felt gave me some uneasiness in this struggle between prudence and passion her vivacity quite forsook her and every opportunity of solitude was sought and spent in tears one week passed away but her lover made no efforts to restrain her nuptials the succeeding week he was still assiduous but not more open on the third he discontinued his visits entirely and instead of my daughter testifying any impatience as i expected she seemed to retain a pensive tranquillity which i looked upon as resignation for my own part i was now sincerely pleased with thinking that my child was going to be secured in a continuance of competence and peace and frequently applauded her resolution it was within about four days of her intended nuptials that my little family at night were gathered round a charming fire telling stories of the past and laying schemes for the future busied in forming a thousand projects and laughing at whatever folly came uppermost well moses cried i we shall soon my boy have a wedding in the family what is your opinion of matters and things in general  my opinion father is that all things go on very well and i was just now thinking that when sister livy is married to farmer williams we shall then have the loan of his cyderpress and brewing tubs for nothing  that we shall moses cried i and he will sing us death and the lady to raise our spirits into the bargain  he has taught that song to our dick cried moses and i think he goes through it very prettily  does he so cried i then let us have it where is little dick let him up with it boldly  my brother dick cried bill my youngest is just gone out with sister livy but mr williams has taught me two songs and i will sing them for you pappa which song do you choose the dying swan or the elegy on the death of a mad dog the elegy child by all means said i i never heard that yet and deborah my life grief you know is dry let us have a bottle of the best gooseberry wine to keep up our spirits i have wept so much at all sorts of elegies of late that without an enlivening glass i am sure this will overcome me and sophy love take your guitar and thrum in with the boy a little  an elegy on the death of a mad dog good people all of every sort give ear unto my song and if you find it wondrous short it cannot hold you long in isling town there was a man of whom the world might say that still a godly race he ran whenever he went to pray a kind and gentle heart he had to comfort friends and foes the naked every day he clad when he put on his clothes and in that town a dog was found as many dogs there be both mungrel puppy whelp and hound and curs of low degree this dog and man at first were friends but when a pique began the dog to gain his private ends went mad and bit the man around from all the neighboring streets the wondering neighbors ran and swore the dog had lost his wits to bite so good a man the wound it seemed both sore and sad to every christian eye and while they swore the dog was mad they swore the man would die but soon a wonder came to light that showed the rogues they lied the man recovered of the bite the dog it was that died a very good boy bill upon my word and an elegy that may truly be called tragical come my children here is bills health and may he one day be a bishop  with all my heart cried my wife and if he but preaches as well as he sings i make no doubt of him the most of his family by the mothers side could sing a good song it was a common saying in our country that the family of the blenkinsops could never look strait before them nor the hugginses blow out a candle that there were none of the grograms but could sing a song or of the marjorams but could tell a story  however that be cried i the most vulgar ballad of them all generally pleases me better than the fine modern odes and things that petrify us in a single stanza productions that we at once detest and praise put the glass to your brother moses the great fault of these elegists is that they are in despair for griefs that give the sensible part of mankind very little pain a lady loses her lapdog and so the silly poet runs home to versify the disaster  that may be the mode cried moses in sublimer compositions but the ranelagh songs that come down to us are perfectly familiar and all cast in the same mold colin meets dolly and they hold a dialogue together he gives her a fairing to put in her hair and she presents him with a nosegay and then they go together to church where they give good advice to young nymphs and swains to get married as fast as they can  and very good advice too cried i and i am told there is not a place in the world where advice can be given with so much propriety as there for as it persuades us to marry it also furnishes us with a wife and surely that must be an excellent market my boy where we are told what we want and supplied with it when wanting  yes sir returned moses and i know but of two such markets for wives in europe ranelagh in england and fontarabia in spain the spanish markept is open once a year but our english wives are saleable every night  you are right my boy cried his mother old england is the only place in the world for husbands to get wives  and for wives to manage their husbands interrupted i it is a proverb abroad that if a bridge were built across the sea all the ladies of the continent would come over to take pattern from ours for there are no such wives in europe as our own  but let us have one bottle more deborah my life and moses give us a good song what thanks do we not owe to heaven for thus bestowing tranquillity health and competence i think myself happier now than the greatest monarch upon earth he has no such fireside nor such pleasant faces about it yes deborah my dear we are now growing old but the evening of our life is likely to be happy we are descended from ancestors that knew no stain and we shall leave a good and virtuous race of children behind us while we live they will be our support and our pleasure here and when we die they will transmit our honor untainted to posterity come my son we wait for your song let us have a chorus but where is my darling olivia that little cherubs voice is always sweetest in the concert  just as i spoke dick came running in o pappa pappa she is gone from us she is gone from us my sister livy is gone from us for ever  gone child  yes she is gone off with two gentlemen in a post chaise and one of them kissed her and said he would die for her and she cried very much and was for coming back but he persuaded her again and she went into the chaise and said o what will my poor pappa do when he knows i am undone  now then cried i my children go and be miserable for we shall never enjoy one hour more and o may heavens everlasting fury light upon him and his thus to rob me of my child and sure it will for taking back my sweet innocent that i was leading up to heaven such sincerity as my child was possessed of but all our earthly happiness is now over go my children go and be miserable and infamous for my heart is broken within me  father cried my son is this your fortitude  fortitude child yes he shall see i have fortitude bring me my pistols i will pursue the traitor while he is on earth i will pursue him old as i am he shall find i can sting him yet the villain the perfidious villain  i had by this time reached down my pistols when my poor wife whose passions were not so strong as mine caught me in her arms my dearest dearest husband cried she the bible is the only weapon that is fit for your old hands now open that my love and read our anguish into patience for she has vilely deceived  her sorrow represt the rest in silence  indeed sir resumed my son after a pause your rage is too violent and unbecoming you should be my mothers comforter and you increase her pain it ill suited you and your reverend character thus to curse your greatest enemy you should not have cursed the wretch villain as he is  i did not curse him child did i  indeed sir you did you cursed him twice  then may heaven forgive me and him if i did and now my son i see it was more than human benevolence that first taught us to bless our enemies blessed be his holy name for all the good he has given and for that he has taken away but it is not it is not a small distress that can wring tears from these old eyes that have not wept for so many years my child  to undo my darling may confusion seize heaven forgive me what am i about to say you may remember my love how good she was and how charming till this vile moment all her care was to make us happy had she but died but she is gone the honor of our family contaminated and i must look out for happiness in other worlds than here but my child you saw them go off perhaps he forced her away if he forced her she may yet be innocent  ah no sir cried the child he only kissed her and called her his angel and she wept very much and leaned upon his arm and they drove off very fast  she is an ungrateful creature cried my wife who could scarce speak for weeping to use us thus she never had the least constraint put upon her affections the vile strumpet has basely deserted her parents without any provocation thus to bring your gray hairs to the grave and i must shortly follow  in this manner that night the first of our real misfortunes was spent in the bitterness of complaint and ill supported sallies of enthusiasm i determined however to find out our betrayer wherever he was and reproach his baseness the next morning we missed our wretched child at breakfast where she used to give life and cheerfulness to us all my wife as before attempted to ease her heart by reproaches never cried she shall that vilest stain of our family again darken those harmless doors i will never call her daughter more no let the strumpet live with her vile seducer she may bring us to shame but she shall never more deceive us  wife said i do not talk thus hardly my detestation of her guilt is as great as yours but ever shall this house and this heart be open to a poor returning repentant sinner the sooner she returns from her transgression the more welcome shall she be to me for the first time the very best may err art may persuade and novelty spread out its charm the first fault is the child of simplicity but every other the offspring of guilt yes the wretched creature shall be welcome to this heart and this house though stained with ten thousand vices i will again hearken to the music of her voice again will i hang fondly on her bosom if i find but repentance there my son bring hither my bible and my staff i will pusue her wherever she is and though i cannot save her from shame i may prevent the continuance of iniquity  chap xviii the pursuit of a father to reclaim a lost child to virtue  though the child could not describe the gentlemans person who handed his sister into the postchaise yet my suspicions fell entirely upon our young landlord whose character for such intrigues was but too well known i therefore directed my steps toward thornhillcastle resolving to upbraid him and if possible to bring back my daughter but before i had reached his seat i was met by one of my parishioners who said he saw a young lady resembling my daughter in a postchaise with a gentleman whom by the description i could only guess to be mr burchell and that they drove very fast this information however did by no means satisfy me i therefore went to the young squires and though it was yet early insisted upon seeing him immediately he soon appeared with the most open familiar air and seemed perfectly amazed at my daughters elopement protesting upon his honor that he was quite a stranger to it i now therefore condemned my former suspicions and could turn them only on mr burchell who i recollected had of late several private conferences with her but the appearance of another witness left me no room to doubt of his villainy who averred that he and my daughter were actually gone toward the wells about thirty miles off where there was a great deal of company hearing this i resolved to pursue them there i walked along with earnestness and enquired of several by the way but received no accounts till entering the town i was met by a person on horseback whom i remembered to have seen at the squires and he assured me that if i followed them to the races which were but thirty miles farther i might depend upon overtaking them for he had seen them dance there the night before and the whole assembly seemed charmed with my daughters performance early the next day i walked forward to the races and about four in the afternoon i came upon the course the company made a very brilliant appearance all earnestly employed in one pursuit that of pleasure how different from mine that of reclaiming a lost child to virtue i thought i perceived mr burchell at some distance from me but as if he dreaded an interview upon my approaching him he mixed among a crowd and i saw him no more i now reflected that it would be to no purpose to continue my pursuit farther and resolved to return home to an innocent family who wanted my assistance but the agitations of my mind and the fatigues i had undergone threw me into a fever the symptoms of which i perceived before i came off the course this was another unexpected stroke as i was more than seventy miles distant from home however i retired to a little alehouse by the roadside and in this place the usual retreat of indigence and frugality i laid me down patiently to wait the issue of my disorder i languished here for near three weeks but at last my constitution prevailed though i was unprovided with money to defray the expenses of my entertainment it is possible the anxiety from this last circumstance alone might have brought on a relapse had i not been supplied by a traveller who stopped to take a cursory refreshment this person was no other than the philanthropic bookseller in st pauls churchyard who has written so many little books for children he called himself their friend but he was the friend of all mankind he was no sooner alighted but he was in haste to be gone for he was ever on business of the utmost importance and was at that time actually compiling materials for the history of one mr thomas trip i immediately recollected this goodnatured mans red pimpled face for he had published for me against the deuterogamists of the age and from him i borrowed a few pieces to be paid at my return leaving the inn therefore as i was yet but weak i resolved to return home by easy journies of ten miles a day my health and usual tranquillity were almost restored and i now condemned that pride which had made me refractory to the hand of correction man little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them as in ascending the heights of ambition which look bright from below every step we rise shows us some new prospect of hidden disappointment so in our descent to the vale of wretchedness which from the summits of pleasure appears dark and gloomy the busy mind still attentive to its own amusement finds something to flatter and surprise it still as we descend the objects appear to brighten unexpected prospects amuse and the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation  i now proceeded forwards and had walked about two hours when i perceived what appeared at a distance like the wagon which i was resolved to overtake but when i came up with it found it to be a strolling companys cart that was carrying their scenes and other theatrical furniture to the next village where they were to exhibit the cart was attended only by the person who drove it and one of the company as the rest of the players were to follow the ensuing day good company upon the road says the proverb is always the shortest cut i therefore entered into conversation with the poor player and as i once had some theatrical powers myself i disserted on such topics with my usual freedom but as i was pretty much unacquainted with the present state of the stage i demanded who were the present theatrical writers in vogue who the drydens and otways of the day  i fancy sir cried the player few of our modern dramatists would think themselves much honored by being compared to the writers you mention dryden and rows manner sir are quite out of fashion our taste has gone back a whole century fletcher ben johnson and all the plays of shakespeare are the only things that go down  how cried i is it possible the present age can be pleased with that antiquated dialect that obsolete humor those overcharged characters which abound in the works you mention  sir returned my companion the public think nothing about dialect or humor or character for that is none of their business they only go to be amused and find themselves happy when they can enjoy a pantomime under the sanction of johnsons or shakespeares name  so then i suppose cried i that our modern dramatists are rather imitators of shakespeare than of nature  to say the truth returned my companion i dont know that they imitate any thing at all nor indeed does the public require it of them it is not the composition of the piece but the number of starts and attitudes that may be introduced into it that elicits applause i have known a piece with not one jest in the whole shrugged into popularity and another saved by the poets throwing in a fit of the gripes no sir the works of congreve and farquhar have too much wit in them for the present taste our modern dialogue is much more natural  by this time the equipage of the strolling company was arrived at the village which it seems had been apprised of our approach and was come out to gaze at us for my companion observed that strollers always have more spectators without doors than within i did not consider the impropriety of my being in such company till i saw a mob gathered about me i therefore took shelter as fast as possible in the first alehouse that offered and being shown into the common room was accosted by a very welldrest gentleman who demanded whether i was the real chaplain of the company or whether it was only to be my masquerade character in the play upon informing him of the truth and that i did not belong to the company he was condescending enough to desire me and the player to partake in a bowl of punch over which he discussed modern politics with great earnestness and seeming interest i set him down in my own mind for nothing less than a parliament man at least but was almost confirmed in my conjectures when upon my asking what there was in the house for supper he insisted that the player and i should sup with him at his house with which request after some entreaties i was prevailed on to comply  chap xix the description of a person discontented with the present government and apprehensive of the loss of our liberties  the house where we were to be entertained lying at a small distance from the village our inviter observed that as the coach was not ready he would conduct us on foot and we soon arrived at one of the most magnificent mansions i had seen in the country the apartment into which we were shown was perfectly elegant and modern he went to give orders for supper while the player with a wink observed that we were perfectly in luck our entertainer soon returned an elegant supper was brought in two or three ladies in an easy deshabille were introduced and the conversation began with some sprightliness politics however was the subject on which our entertainer chiefly expatiated for he asserted that liberty was at once his boast and his terror after the cloth was removed he asked me if i had seen the last monitor to which replying in the negative what nor the auditor i suppose cried he neither sir returned i that is strange very strange replied my entertainer now i read all the politics that come out the daily the public the ledger the chronicle the london evening the whitehall evening the seventeen magazines and the two reviews and though they hate each other i love them all liberty sir liberty is the britons boast and by all my coal mines in cornwall i reverence its guardians then it is to be hoped cried i you reverence the king yes returned my entertainer when he does what we would have him but if he goes on as he has done of late i will never trouble myself more with his matters i say nothing i think only i could have directed some things better i dont think there has been a sufficient number of advisers he should advise with every person willing to give him advice and then we should have things done in another manner  i wish cried i that such intruding advisers were fixed in the pillory it should be the duty of honest men to assist the weaker side of our constitution that sacred power that has for some years been every day declining and losing its due share of influence in the state but these ignorants still continue the cry of liberty and if they have any weight basely throw it into the subsiding scale  how cried one of the ladies do i live to see one so base so sordid as to be an enemy to liberty and a defender of tyrants liberty that sacred gift of heaven that glorious privilege of britons  can it be possible cried our entertainer that there should be any found at present advocates for slavery any who are for meanly giving up the privileges of britons can any sir be so abject  no sir replied i i am for liberty that attribute of gods glorious liberty that theme of modern declamation i would have all men kings i would be a king myself we have all naturally an equal right to the throne we are all originally equal this is my opinion and was once the opinion of a set of honest men who were called levellers they tried to erect themselves into a community where all should be equally free but alas it would never answer for there were some among them stronger and some more cunning than others and these became masters of the rest for as sure as your groom rides your horses because he is a cunninger animal than they so surely will the animal that is cunninger or stronger than he sit upon his shoulders in turn since then it is entailed upon humanity to submit and some are born to command and others to obey the question is as there must be tyrants whether it is better to have them in the same house with us or in the same village or still farther off in the metropolis now sir for my own part as i naturally hate the face of a tyrant the farther off he is removed from me the better pleased am i the generality of mankind also are of my way of thinking and have unanimously created one king whose election at once diminishes the number of tyrants and puts tyranny at the greatest distance from the greatest number of people now those who were tyrants themselves before the election of one tyrant are naturally averse to a power raised over them and whose weight must ever lean heaviest on the subordinate orders it is the interest of the great therefore to diminish kingly power as much as possible because whatever they take from it is naturally restored to themselves and all they have to do in a state is to undermine the single tyrant by which they resume their primaeval authority now a state may be so constitutionally circumstanced its laws may be so disposed and its men of opulence so minded as all to conspire to carry on this business of undermining monarchy if the circumstances of the state be such for instance as to favor the accumulation of wealth and make the opulent still more rich this will increase their strength and their ambition but an accumulation of wealth must necessarily be the consequence in a state when more riches flow in from external commerce than arise from internal industry for external commerce can only be managed to advantage by the rich and they have also at the same time all the emoluments arising from internal industry so that the rich in such a state have two sources of wealth whereas the poor have but one thus wealth in all commercial states is found to accumulate and such have hitherto in time become aristocratical besides this the very laws of a country may contribute to the accumulation of wealth as when those natural ties that bind the rich and poor together are broken and it is ordained that the rich shall only marry among each other or when the learned are held unqualified to serve their country as counselors merely from a defect of opulence and wealth is thus made the object of a wise mans ambition by these means i say and such means as these riches will accumulate the possessor of accumulated wealth when furnished with the necessaries and pleasures of life can employ the superfluity of fortune only in purchasing power that is differently speaking in making dependants in purchasing the liberty of the needy or the venal of men who are willing to bear the mortification of contiguous tyranny for bread thus each very opulent man generally gathers round him a circle of the poorest of the people and the polity abounding in accumulated wealth may be compared to a cartesian system each orb with a vortex of its own those however who are willing to move in a great mans vortex are only such as must be slaves the rabble of mankind whose souls and whose education are adapted to servitude and who know nothing of liberty except the name but there must still be a large number of the people without the sphere of the opulent mans influence namely that order of men which subsists between the very rich and the very rabble those men who are possessed of too large fortunes to submit to the neighboring man in power and yet are too poor to set up for tyranny themselves in this middle order of mankind are generally to be found all the arts wisdom and virtues of society this order alone is known to be the true preserver of freedom and may be called the people now it may happen that this middle order of mankind may lose all its influence in a state and its voice be in a manner drowned in that of the rabble for if the fortune sufficient for qualifying a person at present to give his voice in state affairs be ten times less than was judged sufficient upon forming the constitution it is evident that greater numbers of the rabble will thus be introduced into the political system and they ever moving in the vortex of the great will follow where greatness shall direct in such a state therefore all that the middle order has left is to preserve the prerogative and privileges of the one principal tyrant with the most sacred circumspection for he divides the power of the rich and calls off the great from falling with tenfold weight on the middle order placed beneath them the middle order may be compared to a town of which the opulent are forming the siege and which the tyrant is hastening to relieve while the besiegers are in dread of the external enemy it is but natural to offer the townsmen the most specious terms to flatter them with sounds and amuse them with privileges but if they once defeat the tyrant the walls of the town will be but a small defense to its inhabitants what they may then expect may be seen by turning our eyes to holland genoa or venice where the laws govern the poor and the rich govern the law i am then for and would die for monarchy sacred monarchy for if there be any thing sacred amongst men it must be the anointed sovereign of his people and every diminution of his power in war or in peace is an infringemet upon the real liberties of the subject the sounds of liberty patriotism and britons have already done much it is to be hoped that the true sons of freedom will prevent their ever doing more i have known many of those bold champions for liberty in my time yet do i not remember one that was not in his heart and in his family a tyrant  my warmth i found had lengthened this harangue beyond the rules of good breeding but the impatience of my entertainer who often strove to interrupt it could be restrained no longer what cried he then i have been all this while entertaining a jesuit in parsons clothes but by all the coal mines of cornwall out he shall pack if my name be wilkinson i now found i had gone too far and asked pardon for the warmth with which i had spoken pardon returned he in a fury i think such principles demand ten thousand pardons what give up liberty property and as the gazetteer says lie down to be faddled with wooden shoes sir i insist upon your marching out of this house immediately to prevent worse consequences sir i insist upon it i was going to repeat my remonstrances but just then we heard a footmans rap at the door and the two ladies cried out as sure as death there is our master and mistress come home it seems my entertainer was all this while only the butler who in his masters absence had a mind to cut a figure and be for a while the gentleman himself and to say the truth he talked politics as well as most country gentlemen do but nothing could now exceed my confusion upon seeing the gentleman with his lady enter nor was their surprise at finding such company and good cheer less than ours gentlemen cried the real master of the house to me and my companion i am your most humble servant but i protest this is so unexpected a favor that i almost sink under the obligation however unexpected our company might be to him his i am sure was still more so to us and i was struck dumb with the apprehensions of my own absurdity when whom should i next see enter the room but my dear miss arabella wilmot who was formerly designed to be married to my son george but whose match was broken off as already related as soon as she saw me she flew to my arms with the utmost joy my dear sir cried she to what happy accident is it that we owe so unexpected a visit i am sure my uncle and aunt will be in raptures when they find they have the good dr primrose for their guest upon hearing my name the old gentleman and lady very politely stepped up and welcomed me with most cordial hospitality nor could they forbear smiling upon being informed of the nature of my present visit but the unfortunate butler whom they at first seemed disposed to turn away was at my intercession forgiven  mr arnold and his lady to whom the house belonged now insisted upon having the pleasure of my stay for some days and as their niece my charming pupil whose mind in some measure had been formed under my own instructions joined in their entreaties i complied that night i was shown to a magnificent chamber and the next morning early miss wilmot desired to walk with me in the garden which was decorated in the modern manner after some time spent in pointing out the beauties of the place she enquired with seeming unconcern when last i had heard from my son george alas madam cried i he has now been near three years absent without ever writing to his friends or me where he is i know not perhaps i shall never see him or happiness more no my dear madam we shall never more see such pleasing hours as were once spent by our fireside at wakefield my little family are now dispersing very fast and poverty has brought not only want but infamy upon us the goodnatured girl let fall a tear at this account but as i saw her possessed of too much sensibility i forbore a more minute detail of our sufferings it was however some consolation to me to find that time had made no alteration in her affections and that she had rejected several matches that had been made her since our leaving her part of the country she led me round all the extensive improvements of the place pointing to the several walks and arbours and at the same time catching from every object a hint for some new question relative to my son in this manner we spent the forenoon till the bell summoned us in to dinner where we found the manager of the strolling company who was come to dispose of tickets for the fair penitent which was to be acted that evening the part of horatio by a young gentleman who had never appeared on any stage before he seemed to be very warm in the praises of the new performer and averred that he never saw any who bid so fair for excellence acting he observed was not learned in a day but this gentleman continued he seems born to tread the stage his voice his figure and attitudes are all admirable we caught him up accidentally in our journey down this account in some measure excited our curiosity and at the entreaty of the ladies i was prevailed upon to accompany them to the playhouse which was no other than a barn as the company with which i went was incontestably the chief of the place we were received with the greatest respect and placed in the front seat of the theater where we sat for some time with no small impatience to see horatio make his appearance the new performer advanced at last and i found it was my unfortunate son he was going to begin when turning his eyes upon the audience he perceived us and stood at once speechless and immovable the actors behind the scene who ascribed this pause to his natural timidity attempted to encourage him but instead of going on he burst into a flood of tears and retired off the stage i dont know what were the sensations i felt for they succeeded with too much rapidity for description but i was soon awaked from this disagreeable reverie by miss wilmot who pale and with a trembling voice desired me to conduct her back to her uncles when got home mr arnold who was as yet a stranger to our extraordinary behavior being informed that the new performer was my son sent his coach and an invitation for him and as he persisted in his refusal to appear again upon the stage the players put another in his place and we soon had him with us mr arnold gave him the kindest reception and i received him with my usual transport for i could never counterfeit false resentment miss wilmots reception was mixed with seeming neglect and yet i could perceive she acted a studied part the tumult in her mind seemed not yet abated she said twenty giddy things that looked like joy and then laughed loud at her own want of meaning at intervals she would take a sly peep at the glass as if happy in the consciousness of unresisting beauty and often would ask questions without giving any manner of attention to the answers  end of vol i
