a short history of drugs etc  likewise china and lacquered ware the produce of the east indies  published for the sole direction of the commanders and officers in that service  who are allowed privatetrade homeward bound to which will be added the last market price showing the clear value to the owner after the kings duties and charges are deducted therefrom  london printed for h adams lincolns end  mdcclxxix  preface this book is as concise as possible taking care that a sufficient knowledge with attention to it may be obtained to make it useful at or before purchasing any article in india  it is hoped that by giving a proper state of the market price with the kings duties and companys charges deducted therefrom the remainder being the neat value which the proprietor can expect for his goods as will be seen they will be enabled no to purchase without some probable advantage is likely to be got by it and also prevent them from giving twice the value of some articles from an ignorant notion that they will sell so high at the candle and afterward find the mistake of so small a balance due to them from the company  for instance refined borax sold last sale for the pompous price of l    0 0 per cwt  kings duty         company   disc   per cent        remained only for the proprietor      0 l    0 0  n b several other articles are under the same circumstances  the reasons for leaving the blank spaces under the printed are to be filled up just before sailing for as the markets are so fluctuating sometimes an article is in very little demand and perhaps in a week or a month after it may advance  0 or  0 per cent also the contrary may happen that if this book was made up two or three months before sailing an article might drop considerably and then he takes too high a price to india  his calculations will be  first the market price  second the kings duties  third the companys viz   per cent custom  third the companys viz   ditto warehouse room  third the companys viz   ditto discount  companys charges in all    per cent according to the price at the candle  also the additional    per cent on staple articles  fourth the clear value after the above charges are deducted  all goods brought to this marker ought to be the best of the kind that can be got for the midling and bad are charged with the same kings duties as the best a cwt is     pounds averdupoise   a short history of drugs etc alloes cicotrina commonly called succotrina is the inspissated juice of a plant of that name the best grows in the island of succotre which if dry and when broke in the middle appears of a dark green glassey substance and when reduced to powder is of a fine yellow saffron color  if any dirt stones or other rubbish is in the package which very often happens to the very best the value is uncertain therefore what you buy let it be fine and clear and if it be not so sort it in the country taking it out of the skins and freeing it from stones dirt and rubbish for which if you import it you must pay the duty which is very high and the buyers will calculate the loss in skins etc at double the real disadvantage it will sell to much greater advantage in chests or casks from one to two hundred weight than in large ones which will be above the reach of midling buyers  please to grease the inside of the package to prevent its sticking to it  alloes hepactia or epatica is of the same species with the cicotrina but instead of being of a dark green and almost transparent when shivered into thin pieces is of the color of the liver of an animal and it frequently happens that there is a mixture of cicotrina in the epatic as well as a mixture of epatic in the cicotrina which ought to be separated in the country stones dirt etc should be equally guarded against in this article as in the cicotrina and the buyer should guard against its being wet very good epatic alloes having been brought home from india almost liquid which the buyers were obliged to keep till it became dry and fit to be broke into small pieces and capable of being reduced to powder  gum ammoniacum is a concrete gummy substance in small drops or tears it is of a nauseous bitter taste but when dissolved in any liquid but spirits or rubbed in a mortar with water resembles milk it must be free from dross stones etc and if brown will not though it may be as good as when it is almost white fetch half the price  gum assafaetida is a concrete gummy substance of a strong faetid smell resembling onions or rather shallots in small drops or tears but when packt forms a massy lump observe that when first broke it appears quite white within and changes soon after to a red or purple color the brown dingy or dirty is of little value it is often mixed with stones some sorts are moist with tears which if clean is very good  gum benjamin or benzoin is a concrete rosinous gum of a sweet aromatic taste it is generally brought here in large masses according to the shape of the package therefore before you buy break well into it and see that it is full of white marble drops if that sort is not to be had the next best is the light brown sort which breaks smooth and is free from dross and almost transparent the drossy sort is of little value and the kings duty is as high upon that as the very finest  bezoar the true east india sort are smooth blackshining stones about the size of small hazelnuts found in the stomach of certain animals in the east indies said to be something resembling the goat kind when it is broke appears of a shining dark green or olive color and composed of coats or shells one above another so closely connected as to form a solid stone some prefer the sort that goes by the name of porcupine bezoar but as it has been found of little or no efficacy in medicine is but seldom used the lapis contrayerva being used in its stead  borax is a white christaline salt made from tincal in several parts of india the best generally comes from china in large transparent lumps if brown discolored or mealy reduces the value considerably the more it resembles white sugar candy the better  camboge or cambogium is a solid concrete juice the best is of a deep yellow or orange color breaks shining and free from dross if dull red or crusty reduces the value choose that which is in small cakes or rolls which sells best here  camphire or camphor unrefined is a solid volatile concrete gum extracted from a shrub growing in several parts of the east indies the best sort that will do for this market must be quite white clean and in small transparent grains about the size of coarse sand run together for if it is white transparent and in large lumps and of a firm substance without grains it may be charged with the refined duty  the best package to bring it home is ironbound casks and well pressed in and if the casks were lined with turenague it would prevent its getting into the wood and evaporating it being of an exceeding subtle volatile nature  camphire refined is a sublimation of the unrefined and formed into loaves or cakes but the difference of the duties and charges and the easy method of refining the rough camphor here will prevent its being brought to advantage  cassia lignea is the bark of the bastard cinnamon tree there are several sorts but the best brought home lately was from china which was small long round sticks nearly of the color and flavor of real cinnamon and is used in its stead it cannot be too thin for if the bark is thick though it be equally strong and pungent on the palate it will only do for distilling and therefore not near so valuable  the second sort of cassia lignea is generally got at batavia and ben oclen and is of two sorts one a very small twig about a foot long of a stronger pungent flavor than cinnamon and sold from l   to l 0 per cwt the other sort is in thick long sticks and nearly as pungent but the shape and color makes it not so valuable and only sells from l  to l  per cwt  the way to discover the true cinnamon sort is to chew it when if it is musilaginous or slimy in the mouth it is not near so valuable though it is often stronger than real cinnamon but will foul the cinnamon water made from it there is also cassia lignea that is of a very bright color and good shape which has little or no smell or taste the breaking a handful of sticks will ascertain the quality almost as well as tasting for where there is a fine smell there is always a strong taste  the third sort got at the coast and bengal having very little taste and shape like unto cinnamon but is slat woody and shaffy will scarce fell for the duty and charges the kings duty is l    s   d per cwt equally on the worst as the best and the companys and discount    and half per cent on the price it sells for  cassia buds appears to be the fruit or berries of the cassia tree and resembles in some degree a clove but is smaller of a fine rich cinnamon flavor when fresh they have been but very lately introduced into europe and chiefly brought from china choose them fresh and found free from stalks and dirt  cardamon seeds those produced on the coast of malabar are the best which are contained in a threesquare pod or husk rather larger than a large pea very little judgment is required in choosing them provided they are fresh sound well filled husks and of a palish color and of a very grateful smell resembling camphor care should be taken to pack them in strong sound chests for the least damp will turn the husk not only moldy but musty and greatly reduce its value  coculus india a round blackisk berry generally brought from bombay observe they are sound dry and clean they are extremely light being quite hollow  cubebs is a kind of pepper with this difference that it has a tail or stalk to each berry and is much more aromatic than pepper resembling jamaica pepper called by the common people allspice it is generally bought on the malabar coast and should be dry sound and clean  dragons blood a red rosinous gum sometimes brought in oval lumps about the size of a chestnut or a pullets egg and sometimes in a large mass composed of small grains or tears and if good appears of a deep shining red color and when reduced to powder changes into elegant bright crimson if you meet with any different from the above account as mixed with dross dirt or worse color must not give much for it there being dragons blood from less than l 0 to l 0 per cwt that in tears is the safest to buy if it breaks as clear as glass and is when powdered of a fine crimson red which is the only excellence it being used much more in japaniary than in physic  galbanum is a soft tenacious yellowish gum of a warm bitterish taste the best sort is in masses and when broke or cut appears composed of white small dry tears or drops choose as above for if you meet with it mixed with dirt sticks bits of cane or other rubbish it will reduce the value the more aromatic it smells the better that which is fine has tears in it like other east india gums  gum arabic prefer the large red lumps for the pale yellow does not sell well observe that it be clean and kept from wet or dampness the best packages is strong ironbound casks there is sometimes a fine transparent sort almost white which will sell very well  lac called shellack is thought to be a preparation from sticklack and formed into thin flakes or shells appears of a clear transparent deep yellow or red color if specky drossy black or of a liver color or any ways dull and cloudy and not transparent it will be of little value at this market  lack called sticklack is supposed to be a kind of rosinous wax collected by insects and deposited by them on round small sticks in such form as is commonly imported the best for sale here is composed of a very deep red gum intermixed with cells formed by the insects in which the color is contained and when put into water gives a red tincture which is the sort most in esteem for dying red morocco leather  choose the deep red which is here called black and the fewer sticks the better if when chewed it does not make your spittle of a fine red or crimson color it is not the right sort and not half so valuable  seedlack appears to be the little lumps or seeds that fall from the sticklack or some other artificial preparation  the consumption is very trifling in europe choose as large red clean seeds as possible there is a sort of a very bright yellow and very transparent resembling amber which is used in varnish or lacquer and will if clean bear an high price  lack called cake or lumplack is the fine deep aqueous gum separated from sticks and formed into masses the more it resembles sticklack the better and ought to be free from sticks dirt etc  mother of pearl shells rough ought to be at least eight or nine inches broad and have a shining silver color on the inside and the outside free from blotches or scabs otherwise they are of little value  long pepper is the fruit of a certain plant of the pepper kind growing in the east indies it differs very little from the other except in shape from whence it takes its name being of a long round form of about an inch about the size of a goose quill and composed of a great number of seeds set close together about the size of a small pins head it must be sound clean and dry and of a dark ash color there sometimes comes a shorter and smaller which is not near so valuable and the duties are alike on both kinds if any salt water gets to it there is no such thing as drying it and will soon become wormy and rotten  musk appears to be a substance like greasy clotted blood contained in a hairy small bag or pod resembling the cod of an animal weighing about an ounce and supposed to be found on a certain animal in china choose thinskinned pods that have not been cut open for the smell of the musk is so powerful that pieces of liver or any thing else may be mixed with it and sometimes lead shot to make it heavy it cannot be too dry and if the cods have been cut open the palp or grain ought to be of a dark reddish brown color  myrrh is a concrete gummy rosinous juice of various colors and sizes the produce of persia of a fine aromatic smell and bitter aromatic taste the best that has been brought home for ten years past was in solid lumps from the size of a nutmeg to that of a pigeons egg of a palish yellow color and when broke appeared in the inside of a whitish mealy substance though where it breaks of a deep orangecolour and of a firmer texture and shining it is much more preferable  there is also a brown sort which appears of the same mealy substance and sells near as well  the second sort has the same color taste and smell but the inside appears more glassy and solid and generally in less lumps  the third sort is in brown red dirty small and frequently mixed with ordinary inferior gum which by being mixed with it will contract the smell and flavor of the true gum the very best is sometimes mixed with pieces that are very drossy and light and often with very small gum and dust which though ever so genuine will not sell for near the price that the large will  olibanum is a rosinous gum mostly brought from turkey and sometimes from the east indies in small round drops or tears of a pale yellowish color and very rarely transparent being in general hardly pellucid as it is a species of frankincense it has an aromatic smell but rather a disagreeable acrid astringent taste and when chewed will be of a milky color if it is run into a mass with but few tears in it and mixed with dirt or rubbish it will not do for this market  opoponax a concrete gummy rosinous juice the produce of persia the best brought home by the way of the east indies is in reddish or orangecoloured drops or tears and when broke the inside appears of a pale yellow intermixed with white specks it has a very fragrant smell something like sellery roots and a pleasant bitter acrid taste it is sometimes very light and kecksey mixed with small bits of canes and sticks but that always sells low in proportion to the quantity of gum  rhubarb the root of a plant growing in china of our english dock kind but considerably larger the natives cut the root into round pieces about three or four inches long and dry it for sale which is well known in europe by the name of round rhubarb and sometimes they cut it down the middle of the root and afterward into four or five inch long pieces which drys the better and when fit for sale appears flat for these four or five years past the flat kind has sold l   per cent better than the round of the same goodness  observe what you buy has the rough discolored outside coat pared off which it attracts in drying and that it is quite dry and not the least dampness or greeness left in it the outside to be of a pale yellow and the inside of a pale red nutmeg color and it cannot smell too fresh and must be free from worm holes to avoid being cheated break several pieces through the middle it being frequently of a very good color on the outside but quite green and often black and almost rotten in the middle  sago is generally thought to be the pith of a tree and manufactured into small round grains and brought from china or other parts of india though the mallaca is the principal market and the best sago what is most preferable here is of a red bloom color and dissolves very easily in warm or hot water and makes a very fine jelly that which boils red is always preferred that which is brown is not near so good and it ought also to be free from dust care should be taken of the package which is best in oak casks the least damp will render it musty and good for nothing  sal ammoniac is a manufactured salt said to be prepared from camels or other animals urine or dung in the hot climates about persia and arabia the sort generally brought here is in large round unequal cakes or conical loaves in some degree resembling a sugar loaf about six or eight pounds weight each very little judgment is required in choosing it the taste ought to be sharp and penetrating its color white and clear sometimes soot or sticks is in it but the less the better  tincal or unrefined borax in the manner we have it brought home appears to be a natural salt produced in the province of bengal being mixed with sand and earth the best is in large pieces of the size of a haselnut and sometimes though very seldom larger and of a clear and almost transparent color when broke resembling alum though seldom so clear but generally mixed with dirt sand etc  another sort has been imported about the size of a grain of wheat of a yellowish color resembling brown sugar candy when broke into small pieces which was very good but the worst is what is mixed with sand dirt and other rubbish they have a wrong notion in madrass and bengal to mix it with oil and buttermilk when tight casks would bring it home better and save the expense of paying duty on water etc which in the refining must be all evaporated as refined borax must be dry enough to be reduced to a fine powder  turmerick a root growing in china and bengal brought home in pieces about an inch long of a warm aromatic taste much resembling ginger the china sort sells the best being about the thickness of a mans little finger smooth yellow surface and fine pale red or rather orangecolour and the more rosinous the better when broke the bengal sort is not yellow on the outside as the china sort is but when broke is almost of as good a color but very often breaks black which renders it of less value turmerick is also very subject to be wormeaten which will greatly reduce its value and the least wet or damp will spoil it for use on which account tight casks is far preferable to bags in which it is too often imported  drugs not much in demand or the produce of other parts as well as india ambergrease is a bituminous substance almost as solid as fullersearth chiefly found floating on the sea or on shores it is a fine perfume of a greyish or ash color which is the best and of great value the black or dirty is ordinary and if it is adulterated with rosin etc a red hot knitting needle or wire will discover it as true ambergrease will not melt by heat it chiefly comes from north america  balm or balsam of gilead is generally supposed to be the produce of arabia and sometimes has been imported from the east indies the true has a surprising odoriferous fragrant smell a pungent but very agreeable bitter astringent taste and of a turbid thickish consistence of a yellowish color but so little has come these many years that a stranger must be very cautious how he buys it as every species of turpentine will mix with it  cantharides are flies as large as bees of a very fine green and gold color and are chiefly imported from spain and italy though there are some in india but the length of the voyage prevents their being brought to advantage though if packed in chests lined with tutenague as tea is and very fresh when brought might answer  cassia muniar is a bulbous root of the zedoary kind but more resembling in shape turmerick it breaks of a fine orangecolour of a fragrant smell and aromatic taste  cassia fistula is a long blackish pod or fruit an inch diameter and from one to two feet long containing a sweetish pulp which is the only valuable part of it and comes very fresh from the west india islands if the east india sort were better the pulp would dry up in the voyage  china root there are two sorts the east and west india the east india is hard knotty and rosinous of a very pale red color but of very little use  cinnabar or vermillion the only sort to be brought from the east indies is the native cinnabar which by being strongly impregnated with quicksilver is very heavy and generally comes in small lumps seldom so large as a pea it is of a bright shining color and when powdered of a fine red which is its principal quality it being chiefly used in painting  civet a soft unctious substance generally of a dusky white or rather brown color supposed to be found in a pod or bag growing on the lower part of the belly of the civet cat it is a perfume of a strong and rather disagreeable smell in substance but the perfumers know how to render it very grateful by using it in very small quantities  cologuintida is a dried fruit as large as an apple and very like one that has been pared it comes from turkey is very light and extremely bitter and full of seeds which though bitterer than the pulp are of no value  coral the best is got in italy or turkey and large quantities of the fine sort yearly carried to india it grows at the bottom of the sea and is both white and red the red is the most valuable is as solid as stone and will bear a fine polish the larger the more valuable the small sort is used in medicine  diagredium or scamony is the inspissated juice of a plant reduced to a consistence not unlike spanish juice of a brownish color and of a purgative quality and chiefly comes from turkey but so much adulteratep that the oldest druggists can scarcely ascertain its real qualities  folium india or malabathrum is the leaf of a plant or tree resembling the leaf of a bay tree but much larger and differs from that and most other leaves by having three stems or strong fibers running from the stalk to the top of the leaf  costus dulcis is an aromatic firm root resembling spikenard in smell but of little use  juneus odoratus or sweet cane is a small aromatic reed of a straw color but little in use  gallingals are generally brought home in short knotty pieces about an inch and half long about the size of turmerick of a pale red color bitter taste and aromatic smell  green or preserved ginger the root boiled when just taken out of the ground with water and sugar to such a consistence and time that the syrup enters into the pores of the ginger and will preserve the flavor for several years the best comes in small lumps of a pale yellow and almost transparent the ordinary appears dark and brown and when broke has small strings or fibers  the barbados sort sells for more than double the price that india does which is owing to the root being taken out of the ground before it is full grown and has contracted the stringy quality  west india ginger when dry being full of strings and fibers and the syrup made with white sugar and often sells at   s   d to   s per pound when india seldom sells higher than   s and often much lower  goa stones a factitious preparation of mineral substances mixed with perfume in a round or oval shape and gilt it is where the gilding is rubbed off brownish but the inside is of a straw color it is of very little demand  gum animi or copal gum elimi come very cheap from america but if any fine gum animi can be procured in india it will sell for a great price it should be of a fine pale yellow and as transparent as glass and must dissolve in spirits of wine and is not much harder than rosin and resembles transparent amber so much that cane heads have been made of it and sold for amber  gum sagapenum gum sarcocolla gum tragacanth come cheap from turkey but if any sagapenum can be procured in india it will fetch a good price it in some measure resembles assafaetida but is in less tears and smells like garlic instead of onions which assasaetida does  lapis tutiae the sublimate part collected by means of sticks on the uppermost part of furnaces when a certain metal in the east indies is fluxed by which means it receives a tubelated form and generally appears of a mouse color it is of little use and made in england the copper works and therefore not worth importing  lignum aloes or aloes wood what is brought to europe is in little hard ponderous pieces or chips when burnt or reduced to powder has a bitterish aromatic taste and fragrant smell but little in use but a small quantity of the true would fetch a high price a ton would overdo the market  mastick white mastick red brought from turkey lump mastick has been brought from india but sold for a poor price it ought to be in tears of the size of a small pea and as transparent as amber but a paler color  mirabolanes are a dried fruit resembling a plumb there were formerly five sorts but never in any demand though they are said to be used as efficacious in madness there are very few in london and a small quantity of fresh for there have been some a hundred years old might sell well  oil of cinnamon very nice judgment is required to distinguish the genuine from the cassia or adulterated sort the true will sink in water and so it will if loaded with loaf sugar the more it resembles cinnamon the better and if true will be very hot upon the tongue  oil of nutmegs oil of cloves oil of mace should all resemble the spices from whence they are drawn the oil of cloves and nutmegs which we import from holland are liquid but the oil of mace is in square cakes and resembles the substance of butter only rather firmer and perhaps none of them are true as all those spices are so powerful as to bear a great mixture  opium the concrete juice of the poppy it chiefly comes from turkey where they prepare it much better than what comes from india which is much softer and fouler than the turkey which sometimes come dry enough to break like spanish liquorish though the east india climate even without the help of fire might evaporate the moisture  seed or ragged pearl is found in the pearl fish of an uneven shape seldom so large as a small pea and the only sort in use  senna leaves come cheap from turkey and much brighter and cleaner than any that have been brought from india which generally are foul and full of stalks and of a darker color and not near so fresh  spikenard is a small root from which issue several very small fibers resembling a bunch or brush about an inch long and very light in weight of a darkish brown color it has an aromatic but rather disagreeable smell be careful that it is free from dust or earth  storax calamita or storax in tears is a fine odoriferous gum sometimes in small drops or tears and often brought home in masses with sawdust sand etc it generally comes from turkey or italy the fine greatly resembles fine gum benjamin but is generally moisiter  tamarinds the long pod or fruit of the tamarind tree which grows in pods as large as ripe beans it is taken out of the shell and preserved in sugar the less of which the better provided there is enough to keep the pulp moist the west india is red there is red brown and black brought from ihe east indies but the black is the most valuable and the more pulp and sewer stones the better they are of a very fine acid more pleasant than the juice of lemons and make much wholesomer punch  japan earth improperly so called as by experiments it appears to be the juice of some vegetable fruit boiled to a hard consistence like spanish juice in hard lumps which ought to break of a brown shining color and of an astringent taste it was formerly when bohea tea was more esteemed than green used in dying green tea and other leaves of a bohea color two or three tons would sell very well but more would render it of little value the consumption being small  wormseed is a small chaffy seed of a light yellow color of a fragrant smell and a sine bitter taste and in all probability the seed of wormwood what we have had from india was so small dusty chaffy and full of stalks that it did not sell for a third of the price of that imported from turkey  yeleow saunders a pale yellowish wood of a pleasant smell bitterish aromatic taste which leaves an agreeable kind of pungency it is generally brought in large thick logs and care should be taken that it is quite sound and solid there is a sort of white saunders which perhaps is nothing more than the yellow with the sap on it and should be avoided as rosewood notwithstanding its being of a dark color is in some measure white on the outside but that part will produce no oli  oil of rhodium or rosewood though never imported from india might be extracted from the chips of large pieces which are made into tea chests etc and the small branches of the tree in the same manner as the oil of cinnamon etc are the wood would not answer importing but the oil may as the chemists and perfumers sell it at    s an ounce  zedoary root there are two sorts brought from india the yellow and the white both of them generally cut into small pieces of different shapes though it appears by the shape of them that the root is originally round or oval and only cut for the convenience of drying them better the yellow has the appearance of large turmerick but a more agreeable aromatic taste the white is more rosinous on the inside and of a pale dusky white color and more valuable observe that it is sound and free from worms or rottenness and the larger and heavier if dry the better  various articles arrack is a fine cane spirit supposed to be distilled from rice formerly of great esteem in england but the high duties has lessened the demand so that fifty or sixty leagers are sufficient for a years consumption what you intend for sale must be full proof clean and have no bad smell  arrangoes are made from the rough cornelian stone or something of that kind and formed into different shapes and bored through the middle in india the chief demand for them here are to send to africa where they are much used on strings as ornaments  the roundbarrel shape from two to three inches long which they cut their best stones into which were very clear pale and variably stroked with deeper colors the polish good and pretty free from flaws  the second sort from one to two but not of so good a quality nor so well cut and polished  the third sort were the refuse stones about half an inch to one inch long very irregular flawed and very dull color  the fourth sort are round beads of different sizes and qualities as the above but at present not much in demand  cinnamon as the dutch have monopolized this article as well as nutmegs mace and cloves it is hazardous for any one to buy of them in india the real genuine sorts several have attempted but they never turned to advantage  leopard skins tanned or dressed in the hair   nutmegs canded or preserved in syrup   pepper   rice   sapan wood a well known wood brought home in logs about the size of a mans thigh observe that it is sound and a deep red within  succades or mixed sweetmeats

each regard must be had that no dross is mixed with it  mother of pearl fish and counters   canes called walkingcanes three particulars ought to be well taken notice of to form a proper judgment in purchasing first to be sound and heavy not light and kicksey  second taper shape and if clouded the more valuable  third length of the joint all under    inches long in the joint are now of very little value from    to    may sell for l  or l  per  00 according to quality from    to    for l  or l  from    and upwards are most in demand and generally sell well the kings duty is only    s   d per  000 not a halfpenny per cane  canes called rattans have been brought so plentifully into europe lately that you must be very careful what you buy to turn to advantage in the first place they ought to be well glazed full four yards long not smaller than a mans little finger of a pale yellow color and quite sound  in the second place which ought to be well considered the company sells them for you by weight of   0lb to a draft for  000 and the kings officers charges you    s   d for every  000 in tale so your greatest care ought to be that every  000 weigh at least   0lb for sometimes they have been brought not above two yards long and also so small that  000 have been weighed to a drast consequently the proprietor has been charged and paid    s instead of    s   d which always will happen by small or short rattans  canes called dragonsbloods are a dwarf small walking cane the best ought to be taper and supple and the middle joint about thirtysix inches long and the top and bottom about eight or ten inches more the best color is a dark brown short light spungy and damaged will sell for very little  canes called japans or wangees are full of knots something resembling our cabbage stalks the best are quite round taper and the knots at regular distances a little pliable and tough and for size from the thickness of the little finger to the thumb  carmenia wool or
