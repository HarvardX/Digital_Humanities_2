an essay upon loans or an argument proving that substantial funds settled by parliament with the encouragement of interests and the advances of prompt payment usually allowed will bring in loans of money to the exchequer in spite of all the conspiracies of parties to the contrary while a just honorable and punctual performance on the part of the government supports the credit of the nation  by the author of the essay upon credit  london printed and sold by the booksellers mdccx  advertisement lately published by the same author an essay upon public credit being an enquiry how the public credit comes to depend upon the change of the ministry or the dissolution of parliaments and whether it does fo or no  with an argument proving that the public credit may be upheld and maintained in this nation and perhaps brought to a greater height than it ever yet arrived ae though all the changes or dissolutions already made pretended to and now discoursed of should come to pass in the world sold by the booksellers  an essay upon loans having treated in brief upon the difficult subject of credit and that if the town is not a deceiver with some success it seems necessary to speak a word or two upon the great object upon which that credit operates viz loans of money upon the public demands  the author an enemy to long prefaces presents his thoughts to the world upon this head without any other apology than this that he thinks it a service at this time to remove the mistakes which some make and others improve to our disadvantage while they think it is to the disadvantage of some body else while they aim at an object they would hurt they wound themselves and in prosecuting private or partyprejudices injure weaken and assault the public good which every man has a property in and therefore is in duty bound to defend  a discourse upon credit is naturally an introduction to a discourse upon loan credit without loan is a beautiful flower fair to the eye fragrant to the smell ornamental to the plot of ground it grows in but yielding neither fruit nor seed neither profit to the possessor of it by making due advantage of its produce or benefit to posterity by propagation of its species on the other hand loans without credit are like the laboring plowman upon a barren soil who works cultivates sweats and toils but to no purpose all the fruit of his labor ends in sterility and abortion  loans are the consequences of credit and the evidence of that particular quality which in the preceding discourse of credit i laid down as its foundation i mean general probity punctual just and honorable management  to explain things as i go though this needs but little by loans i am now to be understood to mean lending money to the present government the thing will extend to private affairs and i might take up a great deal of your time in speaking of the effects of credit in trade such as delivering goods by tradesmen to one another papercredit in affairs of cash pledging pawning and all the articles of security for money practiced in general commerce but these things are not to the present purpose  the author of this confines his discourse to the government borrowing money of the subject whether upon securities established by parliament equivalent in value delivered public faith general credit or otherwise  the nature of these securities the reason the usefulness and the foundation they stand on are no part of the present subject they are reserved by the author to a head by themselves if leisure and the public service make it proper to present you a discourse upon funds  the present war which with a small interval of an unsettled and impolitick peace is now in its   d year has been remarkable in several circumstances above all the wars that ever this nation has been engaged in since the romans possessed it  it has been the longest in it is duration the fiercest and most expensive in blood the most famous in successes and unheard of victories it has been carried on against the most powerful enemies it has produced the most firm and the greatest confederacy and it has in view the most glorious conclusion   together with these things it has this also peculiar to it that it has been carried on at an expense which has surmounted not all that ever went before it only but all that it could be imagined was possible for any nation of our dimensions in the world to support  not the fr king only has been deceived in the efforts made by this nation in the process of the war which as penetrating as he is he never thought possible but is is most certain had the wisest and best calculator in the island been told what the undertaking would have called for he would have determined it to be forty millions sterling beyond what the nation was able to do and that without selling the very nation it could not be done  as the view of the expense would have made us wisely have avoided the war and either not have begun it or long since ended it upon the best terms we could obtain from the enemy so had the enemy believed england capable of supporting the war at such a prodigy of expense he would never have begun it which the king of france himself has been heard in terms very plain to acknowledge  when upon the revolution the parliment fell most willingly into the war as a thing the enemy by espousing king jamess interest made absolutely necessary the first brach of our expense was carried on in the common road of levying taxes and the money required for every years expense was raised and paid within the year  the nation was rich trade prodigiously great papercredit run high and the goldsmiths in lombard street etc commanded immense sums anticipations were indeed in practice they had been so of old and borrowing clauses were added to the bills of aid but these lasted but a few months the money came in of course and they were paid off in their turn land tax polls additional duties of customs excises and the like were the ways and means by which these things were done the year generally supported its own demands all the loans were supposed to be temporary and to end with the collection  as the war every year grew heavier upon us and the expense increased new ways and means were necessary to supply the growing demand till all the taxes that could be raised by the ordinary way were found little enough to bring the annual expense about  this put the commissioners of the treasury upon listening to new taxes and entertaining all the projects for raising money that the working heads of the age could supply them with  these backed with parliamentary authority were too unadvisedly supposed to raise such certain sums as the public occasions then called for and borrowing clauses were added to them limitting the said sums which passed as a giving the treasury credit upon the acts of parliament for such sums as they were granted for but the collections falling infinitely short of the sums proposed left the public in arrear to the lenders and from hence came the great load of deficiencies which the nation feels the weight of to this hour  as the sums given fell short so the war called every year for still greater sums which added to the deficiencies of the old taxes grew so heavy that our mannagers found it was in vain to struggle with the difficulty any longer upon the foot of annual taxes and that it was next to impossible to raise every year what the public occasions called for  this lead them of course to a new method to supply the great demands of the war  viz by establishing annual receipts of limited or perpetual interests for such sums as might be borrowed upon the credit of the nation the principal to sink in the hands of the public these were called funds  to encourage the people to lend upon these funds premioes for advancing the money large interests and other advantages were annexed such as    per cent per annum upon annuities with survivourship chance of prizes by way of lottery   per cent upon exchequer bills and the like  here together with the innumerable tallies which upon the deficiency of former taxes as aforesaid went about the town upon discount and the great obstruction of running cash by calling in the old coin was the first rise given to the art and mystery of stockjobbing a practice whether good or evil in its consequences to the public affairs is not to the present purpose to enquire  by this method has the greatest part of our yearly taxes since that time been raised the parliament establishing funds for payment of interest and the people advanving money by way of loan on those interests  it may not be improper here for some people to reflect that in the advantages granted by the government upon these loans and the great discounts upon tallies on the deficient aids mentioned above were founded the great stocks of money banks and powerful credit with which some people are grown to such a height especially in their own opinion as to talk of influencing the public affairs and as it were menacing the government with apprehensions of their lending or not lending as they are or are not pleased with the management of or managers in the public economy and this is the subject i am a little to speak to  loans to the government by the gradations aforesaid having been found essentially necessary the first steps to that new method were found fatally incumbering the high premios given the great advantages proposed and the large interests paid to the lender the government appeared like a distressed debtor who was every day squeezed to death by the exorbitant greediness of the lender the citizens began to decline trade and turn userers foreign commerce attended with the hazards of war had infinite discouragements and the people in general drew home their effects to embrace the advantage of lending their money to the government then grew up the bank whose second subscription being founded upon a parliamentary security for making good the deficient tallies was formed by receiving in those tallies at par which cost the subscribers but    to    per cent by which the greatest estates were raised in the least time and the most of them that has been known in any age or in any part of the world  this i say turned the whole city into a corporation of usury and they appeared not as a bank but rather one general society of bankers all men that could draw any money out of their trades run with it to exchangealley to buy stocks and tallies subscribe to banks or companies or to the exchequer with it to put into loans and lend it upon the advantageous funds settled by parliament  it is meet to mention these things for the sake of the people who have gotten such great estates by the government to let them know from whence the advantages they have made did proceed and also for some other reasons which will appear in the sequel of this discourse  the government to preserve to themselves the advantage of these loans and yet to avoid being imposed upon and oppressed by those exorbitant interests and encouragements about the year school entered into measures to secure the loan of money and yet lower the advantages given to the lenders  the first was done by the parliament apylying themselves to restore credit by a vote to make good all deficiencies and erecting a punctual just and fair management of the payments by which every several engagement being honorably complied with the credit of the public affairs revived and the exorbitances the former years were exposed to wore off of course  this tedious recapitulation of things will appear less trouble to the reader when he sees the use i shall make of it  here may be seen several things which if well considered tend to the lowering the high and extravagant imaginations of some people with respect to loans credit borrowing and lending of money to the government such as these i large interest advantages premios for advance of money and the like will bring in loans in spite of parties in spite of deficiencies in spite of all the conspiracies in the world to the contrary while a just honorable and punctual performance on the part of the government does but maintain the credit of the nation ii as the affairs of the government have made loans necessary and they can not go on without borrowing so the stream of trade and cash is so universally turned into public funds the whole ntiaon feels so much of gains so much by and depends so much upon the public credit that they can no more do without the funds than the funds can do without the loan iii these borrowings and lendings are become so much a trade so many families have their employment from and get so great estates by the negotiating these things that it is impossible for any particular set of men to put a stop to it or to get any such power into their hands as to give the government just grounds of apprehension that this or that party of men can put a cheque to the public affairs be they whigs tories city court banks company or what they please to call themselves   i shall not tie my self to speak to these apart the liberty of this tract will not admit of it but in a summary way you will find the fact demonstrated and the consequence evident  men in trade more especially than the rest of mankind are bound by their interest gain is the end of commerce where that gain visibly attends the adventurer as no hazard can discourage so no other obligation can prevent the application impiger extremos currit mercator ad indos  to pretend after this that parties shall govern mankind against their gain is to philosophize wisely upon what may be and what would be politic to bring to pass but what no man can say was ever put in practice to any perfection or can be so by the common principles that govern mankind in the world  there have been combinations in trade and people have seemed to act counter to their present interests nay have gone on in apparent loss in pursuance of such combinations but they have always been made in order to secure a return of greater gain and therefore the laws made against such combinations are not made to prevent peoples going on to their loss but to prevent the end of that appearing loss viz the ingrossment or monopolizing of trade to come at some advantage over others and thereby make an exorbitant gain  but it was never yet heard that the zeal of any party got the better so much of their interest as to put a general stop to the current and natural stream of their interest that a people should reject the fair and just advantages which have raised so many estates and are the due supplies to the breaches made by the war upon general commerce to talk that we will not lend money to the government while the parliament settles funds allows interests gives premios and advantages is to say nature will cease men of money will abstain from being men loving to get money that tradesmen should cease to seek gain and userers to love large interests that men that have gained money should leave off desiring to get more and that zeal to a party should prevail over zeal to their families that men should forfeit their interest for their humor and serve their politics at the price of their interest  let those that promise themselves these things enquire among the merchants and see if parties govern any thing in trade if there is either whig or tory in a good bargain churchman or dissenter in a good freight high church or low church in a good adventure if a shopkeeper sees a good pennyworth a scrivener a good mortgage a moneyed man a good purchase do they ever ask what party he is of that parts with it nay rather in spite of party aversions do we not buy sell lend borrow enter into companies partnerships and the closest engagements with oen another nay marry with one another without any questions of the matter  let us come to the general body of people as fate has unhappily divided us where are the men supposing a party conspiracy against the government in this matter of loan where are the men who would hold together and refuse making seven per cent of their money to preserve the engagement where the men who would stay their hands and lose the probability of gaining a thousand pounds a year by a lottery no no it is not to be done the stream of desire after gain runs too strong in mankind to bring any thing of that kind to perfection in this age the thing is so impracticable in its nature that it seems a token of great ignorance in the humor of the age to suggest it and a man would be tempted to think those people that do suggest it do not themselves believe what they say about it  in the matter of loan it next comes in our way to enquire how does the cash of the nation which is the thing we are upon stand divided and how is the government in hazard of any combination of this kind if it be possible to make this enquiry without any party by ass and so as to give offense to neither side it shall be done i do not say who is in or who out who has the management who had it or who would have it let that stand as it does or may but how do the parties stand with respect to one another supposing any one party would endeavor to stagnate the general circulation of credit in prejudice of the other as for the purpose  suppose a whig administration and all the high church men and their appendices in hopes to reduce them to exigences in the management should conspire together to run down the public credit and lend no money on any of the funds vice versa suppose a reverse and the whigs in general should do the same thing let us enquire are either of these parties sso rich in cash so powerful in lending that all the loans must depend upon their money or are either of these parties so inconsiderable in this case that their support shall signify nothing without the concurrence of the other if the last were true that weak party could make no manner of figure in this government or be significant enough for the sovereign without visible distraction to engage with to descend to particulars  the notion is general at least among themselves that the gross of the cash is with the whigs and the review speaks of it as a thing capable of some demonstrations though with his good liking it may be said he may be mistaken some have gone a length beyond the author of the review and will have it that the money lies in the hands of the dissenters and will allow the churchmen especially the highchurchmen to have little enough for themselves and by consequence less to spare to the public loans  others will tell you the highchurchparty have a large share of the nations cash in their hands that they have generally a proportion of money and beyond comparison more land than the other they add that as they have more land they can when they please have more money and that therefore though they should grant that the lowchurch and dissenters put together have the most ready money yet allowing them the superiority in the lands they can fetch the money into their own hands when they please  it is not for me to determine who has most land or who most money it is my opinion neither have so much or so little as to render them formidable or contemptible to one another in the matter of loan both sides have enough to be useful to and both sides have little enough to stand in need of one another and in this division the balance of parties which at this time is the only felicity that we can find in having any parties at all does consist  i make no difficulty to acknowledge that where the land is there is the foundation of all the real wealth in the nation i do not say it is in this or that party exclusive that the gentlemen who call themselves of the highparty have a great share of the land is most certain but that they have so much more than the whigs and dissenters joined as some will allege i cannot determine no doubt where the land is there can be no want of money because land will at any time raise money whereas money without the assistance of trade landedmen or governments can operate no way but like the viper preying upon it self  this leads me to examine the difference between loan and fund in this case examining which something may perhaps come to light for our instruction which has not been much thought of before  solomon tells us the borrower is servant to the lender but with the wisemans leave in this case it is not so solomon is there to be understood speaking of the poor borrowing wretch who borrowed upon the foot of charity and compassion and therefore he just before says the poor uses many entreaties but the rich answer roughly the poor man that borrows on his single promise to supply his urgent necessity uses entreaties as we may say he begs to borrow but the rich lender is surly hardly consents answers roughly and is with difficulty brought to lend  but we are to distinguish here between solomons borrower described as above and he that borrows on a sufficient current security he is no more servant to the lender than the lender is servant to him having an unquestioned security to give he scorns to ask you twice but if you do not think fit to lend your money he goes to another  this is apparent in the public securities as well as in private and will make it out if ever put to the test that the people of england stand in as much need of the funds to lend their money upon as the government stands in need of their money upon those funds i prove this by a matter of fact fresh in your memories and undeniable in all its circumstances in the beginning of the war when the money lay abroad in trade the knowledge of affairs young and the people not apprized of the thing the anticipations upon taxes and loans came heavy and were small what drew them on large premios high interests chances of prizes survivorship and the like  thus when the necessities of the government were great and their credit young to borrow the lenders made their market but when the government found themselves rich in funds their demands though great yet not pressing credit established the parliament the great fund of funds and center of credit ready to make good deficiencies and leaving no room for jealousies in the minds of the people what was the case you took off your premios you drew no more lotteries for    years you lowered your interest you brought your annuities from    to   per cent and your interest on tallies from   to   per cent per ann from   per cent upon exchequerbills you came down to   per cent and what was the consequence the necessity of the lenders being more to lodge their money for improvement than the necessity of the borrowers was to ask they came always down to your price and had you brought the general interest of loans to   per cent they must have come down for money is no longer money than it can be improved nay it is to be observed the eagerness of the people to bring in their money increased as the advantages of lending decreased having no way to improve it better they were under an absolute necessity of bringing it in for the sake of the improvement  are these any of the people who can be supposed to say to the parliament they will not lend their money it would almost provoke a man to laugh at them you will not lend your money why what will you do with it  perhaps you wont lend it to the government well you will then lend it upon private security upon land and the like why then those you lend it to will lend it to the government and so the malice of the affair will be lost and the advantage too will you run it into trade do so by all means some of those hands it will circulate through will lend it to the government your very export and import is a loan to the government in short the government shall have your money first or last do what you will with it  suppose it were possible to divide this nation into two parts the landedmen and the moneydmen and the government were to be put into the hands of the first against the consent of the last and the moneydmen knowing the landedmen could not carry on the war without money resolved to lend them none i mean as a government what course should the landedmen take  in my opinion they should pass an act that none of those people should be admitted to lend any money to the government at all what then would be the consequence they would be immediately distressed with the weight of money without improvement they would eagerly lend it to the landedmen at   per cent upon their land and they again lending it to the government at   and   per cent the government would be supplied and the landedmen would get   per cent by the other mens money  i am not making application but let any of the present parties who boast of their having the gross of the money reflect what they would say if an act were to pass that no whigs money or no dissenters money or no highchurchmans money should be accepted upon loan that they should not be allowed a transfer upon any stock or to buy any annuity the complaint would be very loud of their being excluded the common advantages of their fellow subjects and that paying their share of taxes they ought to have room for equal improvements and ought not to be excluded and this is true too it would be hard then they would run about to their friends among the contrary party shelter their money under their names and perhaps give per cent or   per cent commission to others to lend buy and transfer for them and what would the government feel in all this  the case is this no party can be so foolish to think they can be able stop the loan of money to the government nor need the government think of putting the laws in execution against such combination  though if any such appeared no doubt they might be prosecuted keep up but the credit of parliament and let that parliament find funds it is not in the power of any party of men to stop the current of loans any more than they can stop the tide at london bridge in its constant course of flux and reflux from and to the sea  there is no doubt but the french have agents amons us who would be glad to weaken our hands in the war and prevent our supplies for that purpose from them it must be that these notions creep into peoples heads english men cannot in their common senses be so weak telling us that we shall have no loans is much at one to telling us we shall have no recruits to our army as while you can pay armies you shall never want men so while you can pay interest you shall never want loans  the estates that some men boast of by which they are enabled to lend and made bold enough to threaten a stop of it were gained by lending those that have them are too eager to increase them those that want them too eager to gain them by the same method and all too covetous and too selfish not to come into any good proposal  the worst these men can do is by making things appear backward to raise the rate of interests and move the parliament to add something to the usual encouragements for lending and if the nation pays this who have they to blame for it yet neither will they be able to do this the present credit of the british parliament putting it out of their power for as the necessity of lending will prompt on one hand the undoubted security of parliamentary credit removes all the jealousies our partymen would raise on the other  the zeal some men show for their country as well as justice to the government is nevertheless very conspicuous in this who first to glorify their partyprejudices would have the war miscarry rather than money should be lent while such men manage as they pretend not to like secondly reproach some people with designs to make peace with france and yet endeavor by discouraging loans to render it impossible for them to carry on the war  but both these will be disappointed while the parliament supports credit and good funds support the parliament money will come in as naturally as fire will ascend or water flow nor will it be in the power of our worst enemies to prevent it  if the author of this appears again in public it may be upon the subject of fvnds finis
