the rambler  volume the fourth  nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri quo me cunque rapit tempestas deferor hospes hor london printed for j pain and j bouquet in paternoster row mdcclii  the rambler numb  0  tuesday march        mella jubes hyblaea tibi vel hymettia nasci et thyma cecropiae corsica ponis api mart to the rambler sir having by several years of continual study treasured in my mind a great number of principles and ideas and obtained by frequent exercise the power of applying them with propriety and combining them with readiness i resolved to quit the university where i considered myself as a gem hidden in the mine and to mingle in the crowd of public life i was naturally attracted by the company of those who were of the same age with myself and finding that my academical gravity contributed very little to my reputation applied my faculties to jocularity and burlesque thus in a short time i had heated my imagination to such a state of activity and ebullition that upon every occasion it fumed away in bursts of wit and evaporations of gaiety i became on a sudden the idol of the coffeehouse was in one winter solicited to accept the presidentship of five clubs was dragged by violence to every new play and quoted in every controversy upon theatrical merit was in every public place surrounded by a multitude of humble auditors who retailed in other places of resort my maxims and my jests and was boasted as their intimate and companion by many who had no other pretensions to my acquaintance than that they had drank chocolate in the same room  you will not wonder mr rambler that i mention my success with some appearance of triumph and elevation perhaps no kind of superiority is more flattering or alluring than that which is conferred by the powers of conversation by extemporaneous sprightliness of fancy copiousness of language and fertility of sentiment in other exertions of genius the greatest part of the praise is unknown and unenjoyed the writer indeed spreads his reputation to a wider extent but receives little pleasure or advantage from the diffusion of his name and only obtains a kind of nominal sovereignty over regions which pay no tribute the colloquial wit has always his own radiance reflected on himself and enjoys all the pleasure which he bestows he finds his power confessed by every one that approaches him sees friendship kindling with rapture and attention swelling into praise  the desire which every man feels of importance and esteem is so much gratified by finding an assembly at his entrance brightened with gladness and hushed with expectation that the recollection of such distinctions can scarcely fail to be pleasing whenever it is innocent and my conscience does not reproach me with any mean or criminal effects of vanity since i always employed my influence on the side of virtue and never sacrificed my understanding or my religion to the pleasure of applause  there were many whom either the desire of enjoying my pleasantry or the pride of being thought to enjoy it brought often into my company but i was caressed in a particular manner by demochares a gentleman of a large estate and a liberal disposition my fortune was by no means exuberant and therefore i was not displeased with a friend who was willing to be entertained at his own charge i became by daily invitations habituated to his table and as he had persuaded himself to believe my acquaintance necessary to the character of elegance which he was desirous of establishing i lived in all the luxury of affluence without expense or dependence and passed my life in a perpetual reciprocation of pleasure with men whom similitude of accomplishments or desire of improvement crowded about us  but all power has its sphere of activity beyond which it produces no effect demochares being called by his affairs into the country imagined that he should increase his reputation and popularity by coming among his neighbors accompanied by a man whose abilities were so generally allowed the report presently spread through half the county that demochares was arrived and had brought with him the celebrated hilarious by whom such merriment would be excited as had never been enjoyed or conceived before i knew indeed the purpose for which i was invited and as men do not look diligently out for possible miscarriages was pleased to find myself courted upon principles of interest and considered as capable of reconciling factions composing feuds and uniting a whole province in social happiness  after a few days spent in adjusting his domestic regulations demochares invited all the gentlemen of his neighborhood to dinner and did not forget to hint how much my presence was expected to heighten the pleasure of the feast he informed me what prejudices my reputation had raised in my favor and represented the satisfaction with which he should see me kindle up the blaze of merriment and should remark the various effects that my fire would have upon such diversity of matter  this declaration by which he intended to quicken my vivacity filled me with solicitude i felt an ambition of shining which i never knew before and was therefore embarrassed with an unusual fear of disgrace i passed the night in planning out to myself the conversation of the coming day recollected all my topics of raillery proposed proper subjects of ridicule prepared smart replies to a thousand questions accommodated answers to imaginary repartees and formed a magazine of remarks apophthegms tales and illustrations  the morning broke at last in the midst of these busy meditations i rose with the palpitations of a champion on the day of combat and notwithstanding all my efforts found my spirits sunk under the weight of expectation the company soon after began to drop in and every one at his entrance was introduced to hilarious what conception the inhabitants of this region had formed of a wit i cannot yet discover but observed that they all seemed after the regular exchange of compliments to turn away disappointed and that while we waited for dinner they cast their eyes first upon me and then upon each other like a theatrical assembly waiting for a show  from the uneasiness of this situation i was relieved by the dinner and as every attention was taken up by the business of the hour i sunk quietly to a level with the rest of the company but no sooner were the dishes removed than instead of cheerful confidence and familiar prattle an universal silence again showed their expectation of some unusual performane my friend endeavored to rouse them by healths and questions but they answered him with great brevity and immediately relapsed into their former taciturnity  i had waited in hope of some opportunity to divert them but could find no pass opened for a single sally and who can be merry without an object of mirth after a few faint efforts which produced neither applause nor opposition i was content to mingle with the mass to put round the glass in silence and solace myself with my own contemplations  my friend looked round him the guests stared at one another and if now and then a few syllables were uttered with timidity and hesitation there was none ready to make any reply all our faculties were frozen and every minute took away from our capacity of pleasing and disposition to be pleased thus passed the hours to which so much happiness was decreed the hours which had by a kind of open proclamation been devoted to wit to mirth and to hilarious  at last the night came on and the necessity of parting freed us from the persecutions of each other i heard them as they walked along the court murmuring at the loss of the day and enquiring whether any man would pay a second visit to a house haunted by a wit  demochares whose benevolence is greater than his penetration having flattered his hopes with the secondary honor which he was to gain by my sprightliness and elegance and the affection with which he should be followed for a perpetual banquet of gaiety was not able to conceal his vexation and resentment nor would easily be persuaded but that i had sacrificed his interest to fullenness and caprice had studiously endeavored to disgust his guests and suppressed my powers of delighting in obstinate and premeditated silence i am informed that the reproach of their ill reception is divided by the gentlemen of the country between us some being of opinion that my friend is deluded by an impostor who though he has found some art of gaining his favor is afraid to speak before men of more penetration and others concluding that i think only london the proper theater of my abilities and disdain to exert my genius for the praise of rusticks  i believe mr rambler that it has sometimes happened to others who have the good or ill fortune to be celebrated for wits to fall under the same censures upon the like occasions i hope therefore that you will prevent any misrepresentations of such failures by remarking that invention is not wholly at the command of its possessor that the power of pleasing is very often obstructed by the desire that all expectation lessens surprise yet some surprise is necessary to gaiety and that those who desire to partake of the pleasure of wit must contribute to its production since the mind stagnates without external ventilation and that effervescence of the fancy which flashes into transport can be rased only by the infusion of dissimilar ideas   numb  0  saturday march        ipsa quoque assiduo labuntur tempora mot non secus acflumen neque enim consistere flumen nec levis hora potest sed ut unda impellitur unda urgeturque prior veniente urgetque priorem tempora sic fugiunt pariter pariterque sequuntur ovid life says seneca is a voyage in the progress of which we are perpetually changing our scenes we first leave childhood behind us then youth then the years of ripened manhood then the better and more pleasing part of old age the perusal of this passage having excited in me a train of reflections on the state of man the incessant fluctuation of his wishes the gradual change of his disposition to all external objects and the thoughtlesness with which he floats along the stream of time i sunk into a slumber amidst my meditations and on a sudden found my ears filled with the tumult of labor the shouts of alacrity the shrieks of alarm the whistle of winds and the dash of waters  my astonishment for a time repressed my curiosity but soon recovering myself so far as to enquire whither we were going and what was the cause of such clamor and confusion i was told that they were launching out into the ocean of life that we had already passed the streights of infancy in which multitudes had perished some by the weakness and fragility of their vessels and more by the folly perverseness or negligence of those who undertook to steer them and that we were now on the main sea abandoned to the winds and billows without any other means of security than the care of the pilot whom it was always in our power to choose among great numbers that offered their direction and assistance  i then looked round with anxious eagerness and first turning my eyes behind me saw a stream flowing through flowery islands which every one that sailed along seemed to behold with pleasure but no sooner touched than the current which though not noisy or turbulent was yet irresistible bore him away beyond these islands all was darkness nor could any of the passengers describe the shore at which he first embarked  before me and each other side was an expanse of waters violently agitated and covered with so thick a mist that the most perspicacious eye could see but a little way it appeared to be full of rocks and whirlpools for many sunk unexpectedly while they were courting the gale with full sails and insulting those whom they had left behind so numerous indeed were the dangers and so thick the darkness that no caution could confer security yet there were many who by false intelligence betrayed their followers into whirlpools or by violence pushed those whom they found in their way against the rocks  the current was invariable and insurmountable but though it was impossible to sail against it or to return to the place that was once passed yet it was not so violent as to allow no opportunities for dexterity or courage since though none could retreat back from danger yet they might often avoid it by oblique direction  it was however not very common to steer with much care or prudence for by some universal infatuation every man appeared to think himself safe though he saw his consorts every moment sinking round him and no sooner had the waves closed over them than their fate and their misconduct were forgotten the voyage was persued with the same jocund confidence every man congratulated himself upon the soundness of his vessel and believed himself able to stem the whirlpool in which his friend was swallowed or glide over the rocks on which he was dashed nor was it often observed that the sight of a wreck made any man change his course if he turned aside for a moment he soon forgot the rudder and left himself again to the disposal of chance  this negligence did not proceed from indifference or from weariness of their present condition for not one of those who thus rushed upon destruction failed when he was sinking to call loudly upon his associates for that help which could not now be given him and many spent their last moments in cautioning others against the folly by which they were intercepted in the midst of their course their benevolence was sometimes praised but their admonitions were unregarded  the vessels in which we had embarked being confessedly unequal to the turbulence of the stream of life were visibly impaired in the course of the voyage so that every passenger was certain that how long soever he might by favorable accidents or by incessant vigilance be preserved he must sink at last  this necessity of perishing might have been expected to sadden the gay and intimidate the daring at least to keep the melancholy and timorous in perpetual torments and hidder them from any enjoyment of the varieties and gratifications which nature offered them as the solace of their labors yet in effect none seemed less to expect destruction than those to whom it was most dreadful they all had the art of concealing their danger from themselves and those who knew their inability to bear the sight of the terrors that embarrassed their way took care never to look forward but found some amusement for the present moment and generally entertained themselves by playing with hope who was the constant associate of the voyage of life  yet all that hope ventured to promise even to those whom she favored most was not that they should escape but that they should sink last and with this promise every one was satisfied though he laughed at the rest for seeming to believe it hope indeed apparently mocked the credulity of her companions for in proportion as their vessels grew leaky she redoubled her assurances of safety and none were more busy in making provisions for a long voyage than they whom all but themselves saw likely to perish soon by irreparable decay  in the midst of the current of life was the gulf of intemperance a dreadful whirlpool interspersed with rocks of which the pointed crags were concealed under water and the tops covered with herbage on which ease spread couches of repose and with shades where pleasure warbled the song of invitation within sight of these rocks all who sailed on the ocean of life must necessarily pass reason indeed was always at hand to steer the passengers through a narrow outlet by which they might escape but very few could by her entreaties or remonstrances be induced to put the rudder into her hand without stipulating that she should approach so near unto the rocks of pleasure that they might solace themselves with a short enjoyment of that delicious region after which they always determined to pursue their course without any other deviation  reason was too often prevailed upon so far by these promises as to venture her charge within the eddy of the gulf of intemperance where indeed the circumvolution was weak but yet interrupted the course of the vessel and drew it by insensible rotations toward the center she then repented her temerity and with all her force endeavored to retreat but the draught of the gulf was generally too strong to be overcome and the passenger having danced in circles with a pleasing and giddy velocity was at last overwhelmed and lost those few whom reason was able to extricate generally suffered so many shocks upon the points which shot out from the rocks of pleasure that they were unable to continue their course with the same strength and facility as before but floated along timorously and feebly endangered by every breeze and shattered by every ruffle of the water till they sunk by slow degrees after long struggles and innumerable expedients always repining at their own folly and warning others against the first approach to the gulf of intemperance  there were artists who professed to repair the breaches and stop the leaks of the vessels which had been shattered on the rocks of pleasure many appeared to have great confidence in their skill and some indeed were preserved by it from sinking who had received only a single blow but i remarked that few vessels lasted long which had been much repaired nor was it found that the artists themselves continued afloat longer than those who had least of their assistance  the only advantage which in the voyage of life the cautious had above the negligent was that they sunk later and more suddenly for they passed forward till they had sometimes seen all those in whose company they had issued from the streights of infancy perish in the way and at last were overset by a cross breeze without the toil of resistance or the anguish of expectation but such as had often fallen against the rocks of pleasure commonly subsided by sensible degrees contended long with the encroaching waters and harassed themselves by labors that scarce hope herself could flatter with success  as i was looking upon the various fate of the multitude about me i was suddenly alarmed with an admonition from some unknown power gaze not idly upon others when thou thyself art sinking whence is this thoughtless tranquillity when thou and they are equally endangered i looked and seeing the gulf of intemperance before me started and awaked  numb  0  tuesday march         scire volunt secreta domus atque inde timeri juv curiosity is one of the permanent and certain characteristicks of a vigorous inellect to which every advance into knowledge opens new prospects and produces new incitements to farther progress all the seize possible in our present state are evidently inadequate to our capacities of enjoyment conquest serves no purpose but that of kindling ambition discovery has no effect but of raising expectation the gratification of one desire encourages another and after all our labors studies and enquiries we are continually at the same distance from the completion of our schemes have still some wish importunate to be satisfied and some faculty restless and mutinous for want of employment  the desire of knowledge though it is often animated by extrinsick and adventitious motives seems on many occasions to operate without subordination to any other principle we are eager to see and hear without intention of referring our observations to a farther end we climb a mountain for a prospect of the plain we run to the strand in a storm that we may contemplate the agitation of the water we range from city to city though we profess neither architecture nor fortification we cross seas only to view nature in nakedness or magnificence in ruins we are equally allured by novelty of every kind by a desert or a palace a cataract or a cavern by every thing rude and every thing polished every thing great and every thing little we do not see a thicket but with some temptation to enter it nor remark an insect flying before us but with an inclination to pursue it  this passion is perhaps regularly heightened in proportion as the powers of the mind are elevated and enlarged lucan therefore introduces caesar speaking with dignity suitable to the grandeur of his designs and the extent of his capacity when he declares to the high priest of egypt that he has no desire equally powerful with that of finding the origin of the nile and that he would quit all the projects of the civil war for a sight of those fountains which had been so long concealed and homer when he would furnish the sirens with a temptation to which his hero renowned for wisdom might yield without disgrace makes them declare that none ever departed from them but with increase of knowledge  there is indeed scarce any kind of ideal acquirement which may not be applied to some use or which may not at least gratify pride with occasional superiority but whoever attends the motions of his own mind will find that upon the first appearance of an object or the first start of a question his inclination to a nearer view or more accurate discussion precedes all thoughts of profit or of competition and that his desires take wing by instantaneous impulse though their flight may be invigorated or their efforts renewed by subsequent considerations the gratification of curiosity rather frees us from uneasiness than confers pleasure we are more pained by ignorance than delighted by instruction curiosity is the thirst of the soul it inflames and torments us and makes us taste every thing with joy however otherwise insipid by which it may be quenched  it is evident that the earliest searchers after knowledge must have proposed knowledge only as their reward and that science though perhaps the nursling of interest was the daughter of curiosity for who can believe that they who first watched the course of the stars foresaw the use of their discoveries to the facilitation of commerce or the mensuration of time they were delighted with the splendour of the nocturnal skies they found that the lights changed their places what they admired they were anxious to understand and in time traced their revolutions  there are indeed beings in the form of men who appear satisfied with their intellectual possessions and seem to live without desire of enlarging their conceptions before whom the world passes without notice and who are equally unmoved by nature or by art  this negligence is sometimes only the temporary effect of a predominant passion a lover finds no inclination to travel any path but that which leads to the habitation of his mistress a trader can spare little attention to common occurrences when his fortune is endangered by a storm it is frequently the consequence of a total immersion in sensuality corporeal pleasures may be indulged till the memory of every other kind of happiness is obliterated the mind long habituated to a lethargick and quiescent state is unwilling to wake to the toil of thinking and though she may sometimes be disturbed by the obtrusion of new ideas shrinks back again to ignorance and rest  but indeed if we except them to whom the continual task of procuring the supports of life denies all opportunities of deviation from their own narrow track the number of such as live without the ardour of enquiry is very small though many content themselves with cheap amusements and waste their lives in researches of no importance  there is no snare more dangerous to busy and excursive minds than the cobwebs of petty inquisitiveness which entangle them in trivial employments and minute studies and detain them in a middle state between the tediousness of total inactivity and the fatigue of laborious efforts enchant them at once with ease and novelty and vitiate them with the luxury of learning the necessity of doing something and the fear of undertaking much sinks the historian to a genealogist the philosopher to a journalist of the weather and the mathematician to a constructer of dials  it is happy when those who cannot content themselves to be idle nor resolve to be industrious are at least employed without injury to others but it seldom happens that we can contain ourselves long in a neutral state or forbear to sink into vice when we are no longer soaring toward virtue  nugaculus was distinguished in his earlier years by an uncommon liveliness of imagination quickness of sagacity and extent of knowledge when after having passed through the usual methods of education he entered into life he applied himself with particular inquisitiveness to examine the various motives of human actions the complicated influence of mingled affections the different modifications of interest and ambition and the various causes of miscarriage and success both in public and private affairs  though his friends did not discover to what purpose all these observations were collected or how nugaculus would much improve his virtue or his fortune by an incessant attention to changes of countenance bursts of inconsideration sallies of passion and all the other casualties by which he used to trace a character yet they could not deny the study of human nature to be worthy of a wise man they therefore flattered his vanity applauded his discoveries and listened with submissive modesty to his lectures on the uncertainty of inclination the weakness of resolves and the instability of temper to his account of the various motives which agitate the mind and his ridicule of the modern dream of a ruling passion  such was the first incitement of nugaculus to a close inspection into the conduct of mankind he had no interest in view and therefore no design of supplantation he had no malevolence and therefore detected faults without any intention to expose them but having once found the art of engaging his attention upon others he had no inclination to call it back to himself but has passed his time in keeping a watchful eye upon every rising character and lived upon a small estate without any thought of increasing it  he is by continual application become a general master of secret history and can give an account of the intrigues private marriages competitions and stratagems of half a century he knows the mortgages upon every mans estate the terms upon which every spendthrift raises his money the real and reputed fortune of every lady the jointure stipulated by every contract and the expectations of every family from maiden aunts and childless acquaintances he can relate the economy of every house knows how much one mans cellar is robbed by his butler and the land of another underlet by his steward he can tell where the manorhouse is falling though large sums are yearly paid for repairs and where the tenants are felling woods without the consent of the owner  to obtain all this intelligence he is inadvertently guilty of a thousand acts of treachery he sees no mans servant without draining him of his trust he enters no family without flattering the children into discoveries he is a perpetual spy upon the doors of his neighbors and knows by long experience at whatever distance the looks of a creditor a borrower a lover and a pimp  nugaculus is not illnatured and therefore his industry has not hither to been very mischievous to others or dangerous to himself but since he cannot enjoy this knowledge but by discovering it and if he had no other motive to loquacity is obliged to traffic like the chemists and purchase one secret with another he is every day more hated as he is more known for he is considered by great numbers as one that has their fame and their happiness in his power and no man can much love him of whom he lives in fear  thus has an intention innocent at first if not laudable the intention of regulating his own behavior by the experience of others betrayed nugaculus not only to a foolish but vicious waste of a life which might have been honorably passed in public services or domestic virtues such is the fate of all excessive desires and such the consequence of giving up the mind to employments that engross but do not improve it  numb  0  saturday march          nihil est quod credere de se non possit  juv the apparent insufficiency of every individual to his own happiness or safety compels us to seek from one another assistance and support the necessity of joint efforts for the execution of any great or extensive design the variety of powers disseminated in the species and the proportion between the defects and excellencies of different persons demand an interchange of help and communication of intelligence and by frequent reciprocations of beneficence unite mankind in society and friendship  if it can be imagined that there ever was a time when the inhabitants of any country were in a state of equality without distinction of rank or peculiarity of possessions it is reasonable to believe that every man was then loved in proportion as he could contribute by his strength or his skill to the supply of natural wants that there was little room for peevish dislike or capricious favor that the affection then admitted into the heart was rather esteem than tenderness and that kindness was only purchased by benefits but when by force or policy by wisdom or by fortune property and superiority were introduced and established so that many were condemned to labor for the support of a few then they whose possessions swelled above their wants naturally laid out their super fluities upon pleasure and those who could not gain friendship by necessary offices endeavored to promote their interest by luxurious gratifications and to create need which they might be courted to supply  the desires of mankind are so much more numerous than their seize and the capacity of imagination so much larger than actual enjoyment that no power of bestowing can equal expectation every distant appearance of advantage must therefore excite struggles and competitions that which can be obtained only by one will be desired by multitudes while there remain multitudes unsatisfied with their allotment and he who cannot hope to succeed by real services and either finds no room for the exertion of great qualities or perceives himself excelled by his rivals will have recourse to other expedients will endeavor to become agreeable where he cannot be important and learn by degrees to number the art of pleasing among the most useful studies and most valuable acquisitions  this art like others is cultivated in proportion to its usefulness and will always flourish most where it is most rewarded for this reason we find it practiced with great assiduity under absolute governments where honors and riches are in the hands of one man whom all endeavor to propitiate and who soon becomes so much accustomed to compliance and officiousness as not easily to find in the most delicate address that novelty which is necessary to procure attention  it is discovered by a very few experiments that no man is much pleased with a companion who does not increase in some respect his fondness of himself and therefore he that wishes rather to be led forward to prosperity by the gentle hand of favor than to force his way by labor and merit must consider with more care how to display his patrons excellencies than his own that whenever he approaches he may fill the imagination with pleasing dreams and chase away disgust and weariness by a perpetual succession of delightful images  this may indeed sometimes be effected by turning the attention upon advantages which are really possessed or upon prospects which reason spreads before hope for whoever can deserve or require to be courted has generally either from nature or from fortune gifts which he may review with satisfaction and of which when he is artfully recalled to the contemplation he will seldom be displeased  but those who have once degraded their understanding to an application only to the passions and who have learned to derive hope from any other sources than industry and virtue seldom retain dignity and magnanimity sufficient to defend them against the constant recurrence of temptation to falsehood he that is too desirous to be loved will soon learn to flatter and when he has exhausted all the variations of honest praise and can delight no longer with the civility of truth he will invent new topics of panegyric and break out into raptures at virtues and beauties conferred by himself  the drudgeries of dependence would indeed be aggravated by hopelesness of success if no indulgence was allowed to adulation he that will obstinately confine his patron to hear only the commendations which he deserves will soon be forced to give way to others that regale him with more compass of music the greatest human virtue bears no proportion to human vanity we always think ourselves better than we are and are generally desirous that others should think us still better than we think ourselves to praise us for actions or dispositions which deserve praise is not to confer a benefit but to pay a tribute we have always pretensions to fame which in our own hearts we know to be disputable and which we are desirous to strengthen by a new fuffrage we have always hopes which we suspect to be fallacious and of which we eagerly snatch at every confirmation  it may indeed be proper to make the first approaches under the conduct of truth and to secure credit to future encomiums by such praise as may be ratified by the conscience but the mind once habituated to the lusciousness of eulogy becomes in a short time nice and fastidious and like a vitiated palate is incessantly calling for higher gratifications  it is scarcely credible how far discernment may be dazzled by the mist of pride and wisdom infatuated by the intoxication of flattery or how low the genius may descend by successive gradations of servility and how swiftly it may fall down the precipice of falsehood no man can indeed observe without indignation on what names both of ancient and modern times the utmost exuberance of praise has been lavished and by what hands it has been bestowed it has never yet been found that the tyrant the plunderer the oppressor the most hateful of the hateful the most profligate of the profligate have been denied any celebrations which they were willing to purchase or that wickedness and folly have not found correspondent flatterers through all their subordinations except when they have been associated with avarice or poverty and have wanted either inclination or ability to hire a panegyrist  as there is no character so deformed as to fright away from it the prostitutes of praise there is no degree of encomiastic veneration which pride has refused the emperors of rome suffered themselves to be worshipped in their lives with altars and sacrifice and in an age more enlightened the terms peculiar to the praise and worship of the supreme being have been applied to wretches whom it was the reproach of humanity to number among men and whom nothing but riches or power hindered those that read or wrote their deification from hunting into the toils of justice as disturbers of the peace of nature  there are indeed many among the poetical flatterers who must be resigned to infamy without vindication and whom we must confess to have deserted the cause of virtue for pay they have committed against full conviction the crime of obliterating the distinctions between good and evil and instead of opposing the encroachments of vice have incited her progress and celebrated her conquests but there is a lower class of sycophants whose understanding has not made them capable of equal guilt every man of high rank is surrounded with numbers who have no other rule of thought or action than his maxims and his conduct whom the honor of being numbered among his acquaintance reconciles to all his vices and all his absurdities and who easily persuade themselves to esteem him by whose regard they consider themselves as distinguished and exalted  it is dangerous for mean minds to venture themselve within the sphere of greatness stupidity is soon blinded by the splendor of wealth and cowardice is easily fettered in the shackles of dependence to solicit patronage is at least in the event to set virtue to sale none can be pleased without praise and few can be praised without falsehood few can be affiduous without servility and none can be servile without corruption  numb  0  tuesday march          animorum impulsu et coeca magnaque cupidine ducti juv i was lately considering among other objects of speculation the new attempt of an universal register an office in which every man may lodge an account of his superfluities and wants of whatever he desires to purchase or to sell my imagination soon presented to me the latitude to which this design may be extended by integrity and industry and the advantages which may be justly hoped from a general mart of intelligence when once its reputation shall be so established that neither reproach nor fraud shall be feared from it when an application to it shall not be censured as the last resource of desperation nor its informations suspected as the fortuitious suggestions of men obliged not to appear ignorant a place where every exuberance may be discharged and every deficiency supplied where every lawful passion may find its gratifications and every honest curiosity receive satisfaction where the stock of a nation pecuniary and intellectual may be brought together and where all conditions of humanity may hope to find relief pleasure and accommodation must equally deserve the attention of the merchant and philosopher of him who mingles in the tumult of business and him who only lives to amuse himself with the various employments and pursuits of others nor will it be an uninstructing school to the greatest masters of method and dispatch if such multiplicity can be preserved from embarrasment and such tumult from inaccuracy  while i was concerting this splendid project and filling my thoughts with its regulation its conveniences its variety and its consequences i sunk gradually into slumber but the same images though less distinct still continued to float upon my fancy i perceived myself at the gate of an immense edifice where innumerable multitudes were passing without confusion every face on which i fixed my eyes seemed settled in the contemplation of some important purpose and every foot was hastened by eagerness and expectation i followed the crowd without knowing whither i should be drawn and remained a while in the unpleasing state of an idler where all other beings were busy giving place every moment to those who had more importance in their looks ashamed to stand ignorant and afraid to ask questions at last i saw a lady sweeping by me whom by the quickness of her eyes the agility of her steps and a mixture of levity and impatience i knew to be my long loved protectress curiosity great goddess said i may thy votary be permitted to implore thy favor if thou have been my directress from the first dawn of reason if i have followed thee through the maze of life with invariable fidelity if i have turned to every new call and quitted at thy nod one persuit for another if i have never stopped at the invitations of fortune nor forgot thy authority in the bowers of pleasure inform me now whither chance has conducted me  thou art now replied the smiling power in the presence of justice and of truth whom the father of gods and men has sent down to register the demands and pretensions of mankind that the world may at last be reduced to order and that none may complain hereafter of being doomed to tasks for which they are unqualified of possessing faculties for which they cannot find employment or virtues that languish unobserved for want of opportunities to exert them of being encumbered with superfluities which they would willingly resign or of wasting away in desires which ought to be satisfied justice is now to examine every mans wishes and truth is to record them let us approach and observe the progress of this great transaction  she then moved forward and truth who knew her among the most faithful of her followers beckoned her to advance till we were placed near the seat of justice the first who required the assistance of the office came forward with a slow pace and tumor of dignity and shaking a weighty purse in his hand demanded to be registered by truth as the mecaenas of the presentage the chief encourager of literary merit to whom men of learning and wit might apply in any exigence or distress with certainty of succor justice very mildly enquired whether he had calculated the expense of such a declaration whether he had been informed what number of petitioners would swarm about him whether he could distinguish idleness and negligence from calamity ostentation from knowledge or vivacity from wit to these questions he seemed not well provided with a reply but repeated his desire to be recorded a patron justice then offered to register his proposal on these conditions that he should never suffer himself to be flattered that he should never delay an audience when he had nothing to do and that he should never encourage followers without intending to reward them these terms were too hard to be accepted for what said he is the end of patronage but the pleasure of reading dedications holding multitudes in suspense and enjoying their hopes their fears and their anxiety flattering them to assiduity and at last dismissing them for impatience justice heard his confession and ordered his name to be posted upon the gate among cheats and robbers and public nuisances which all were

raise monuments more durable than brass and more conspicuous than pyramids has been long the common boast of literature but among the innumerable architects that erect columns to themselves far the greatest part either for want of durable materials or of art to dispose them see their edifices perish as they are towering to completion and those few that for a while attract the eye of mankind are generally weak in the foundation and soon sink by the saps of time  no place affords a more striking conviction of the vanity of human hopes than a public library for who can see the wall crowded on every side by mighty volumes the works of laborious meditation and accurate enquiry now scarcely known but by the catalogue and preserved only to increase the pomp of learning without considering how many hours have been wasted in vain endeavors how often imagination has anticipated the praises of futurity how many statues have risen to the eye of vanity how many ideal converts have elevated zeal how often wit has exulted in the eternal infamy of his antagonists and dogmatism has delighted in the gradual advances of his authority the immutability of his decrees and the perpetuity of his power  non unquam dedit documenta fors majora quam fragili loco starent superbi  of the innumerable authors whose performances are thus treasured up in magnificent obscurity most are undoubtedly forgotten because they never deserved to be remembered and owed the honors which they once obtained not to judgment or to genius to labor or to art but to the prejudice of faction the stratagems of intrigue or the servility of adulation  nothing is more common than to find men whose works are now totally neglected mentioned with praises by their contemporaries as the oracles of their age and the legislators of science curiosity is naturally excited their volumes after long enquiry are found but seldom reward the labor of the search every period of time has produced these bubbles of artificial fame which are kept up a while by the breath of fashion and then break at once and are annihilated the learned often bewail the loss of ancient writers whose characters have survived their works but perhaps if we could now retrieve them we should find them only the granvilles montagues stepneys and sheffields of their time and wonder by what infatuation or caprice they could rise to notice  it cannot however be denied that many have sunk into oblivion whom it were unjust to number with this despicable class various kinds of literary fame seem destined to various measures of duration some spread into exuberance with a very speedy growth but soon wither and decay some rise more slowly but last long parnassus has its flowers of transient fragrance as well as its oaks of towering height and its laurels of eternal verdure  among those whose reputation is exhausted in a short time by its own luxuriance are the writers who take advantage of some present incidents and characters which strongly interest the passions and engage universal attention it is not difficult to obtain readers when we discuss a question which every one is desirous to understand which is debated in every assembly and has divided the nation into parties or when we display the faults or virtues of him whose public conduct has made almost every man his enemy or his friend to the quick circulation of such productions all the motives of interest and vanity concur the disputant enlarges his knowledge the zealot animates his passion and every man is desirous to inform himself concerning affairs so vehemently agitated and variously represented  it is scarcely to be imagined through how many subordinations of interest the ardour of party is diffused and what multitudes fancy themselves affected by every satire or panegyric on a man of eminence whoever has at any time taken occasion to mention him with praise or blame whoever happens to love or hate any of his adherents is desirous to confirm his opinion and to strengthen his party and diligently peruses every paper from which he can hope for sentiments like his own an object however small in itself if placed near to the eye will engross all the rays of light and a transaction however trivial swells into importance when it presses immediately on our attention he that shall peruse the political pamphlets of any past reign will wonder why they were so generally purchased so eagerly read or so loudly praised many of the performances which had power to inflame factions and fill a kingdom with confusion have now very little effect upon a frigid critic and the time is coming when the compositions of later hirelings shall lie equally despised and forgotten in proportion as those who write on temporary subjects are exalted above their merit at first they are afterward depressed below it nor can the brightest elegance of diction or most artful subtilty of reasoning hope for much esteem from those whose regard is no longer quickened by interest or by pride  it is indeed the fate of controvertists even when they contend for philosophical or theological truth to be soon laid aside and slighted either the question is decided and there is no more place for doubt and opposition or mankind despair of understanding it and grow weary of disturbance content themselves with quiet ignorance and refuse to be harassed with labors which they have no hopes of recompensing with knowledge  the authors of new discoveries may surely expect to be reckoned among those whose writings are secure of veneration yet it often happens that the general reception of a doctrine obscures the books in which it was delivered when any tenet is generally received and adopted as an incontrovertible principle we seldom look back to the arguments upon which it was first established or can bear that tediousness of deduction and multiplicity of evidence by which its author was forced to reconcile it to prejudice and fortify it in the weakness of novelty against obstinacy and envy  it is well known how much of our philosophy is derived from boyles discovery of the qualities of the air yet of those who now adopt or enlarge his theory very few have read the detail of his experiments his name is indeed reverenced but his works are neglected we are contented to know that he conquered his opponents without enquiring what cavils were produced against him or by what proofs they were confuted  some writers apply themselves to studies boundless and inexhaustible as experiments and natural philosophy these are always lost in successive compilations as new advances are made and former observations become more familiar others spend their lives in remarks on language or explanations of antiquities and only afford materials for lexicographers and commentators these are themselves overwhelmed by subsequent collectors who equally destroy the memory of their predecessors by amplification transposition or contraction every new system of nature gives birth to a swarm of expositors whose business is to explain and illustrate it and who can hope to exist no longer than the founder of their sect preserves his reputation  there are indeed few kinds of composition from which an author however learned or ingenious can hope a long continuance of fame he who has carefully studied human nature and can well describe it may with most reason flatter his ambition bacon among all his pretensions to the regard of posterity seems to have pleased himself chiefly with his essays which come home to mens business and bosoms and of which therefore he declares his expectation that they will live as long as books last it may however satisfy an honest and benevolent mind to have been useful though less conspicuous nor will he that extends his

uniformity many of my readers remark the want of those changes of colors which formerly fed the attention with unexhausted novelty and of that intermixture of subjects or alternation of manner by which other writers relieved weariness and awakened expectation  i have indeed hitherto avoided the practice of uniting gay and solemn subjects in the same paper because it seems absurd for an author to counteract himself to press at once with equal force upon both parts of the intellectual balance and give medicines which like the double poison of dryden destroy the force of one another i have endeavored sometimes to divert and sometimes to elevate but have imagined it an useless attempt to disturb merriment by solemnity or interrupt seriousness by drollery yet i shall this day publish two letters of very different tendency which i hope like tragicomedy may chance to please even when they are not critically approved  to the rambler dear sir though as my mamma tells me i am too young to talk at the table i have great pleasure in listening to the conversation of learned men especially when they discourse of things which i do not understand and have therefore been of late particularly delighted with many disputes about the alteration of the style which they say is to be made by act of parliament  one day when my mamma was gone out of the room i asked a very great scholar what the style was he told me he was afraid i should hardly understand him when he informed me that it was the stated and established method of computing time it was not indeed likely that i should understand him for i never yet knew time computed in my life nor can imagine why we should be at so much trouble to count what we cannot keep he did not tell me whether we are to count the time past or the time to come but i have considered them both by myself and think it as foolish to count time that is gone as money that is spent and as for the time which is to come it only seems farther off by counting and therefore when any pleasure is promised me i always think of the time as little as i can  i have since listened very attentively to every one that talked upon this subject of whom the greater part seem not to understand it better than myself for though they often hint how much the nation has been mistaken and rejoice that we are at last growing wiser than our ancestors i have never been able to discover from them that any body has died sooner or been married later for counting time wrong and therefore i began to fancy that there was great bustle with little consequence  at last two friends of my papa mr cycle and mr starlight being it seems both of high learning and able to make an almanac began to talk about the new style sweet mr starlight  i am sure i shall love his name as long as i live for he told cycle roundly with a fierce look that we should never be right without a year of confusion dear mr rambler did you ever hear any thing so charming a whole year of confusion when there has been a rout at mammas i have thought one night of confusion worth a thousand nights of rest and surely if i can but see a year of confusion a whole year of cards in one room and dancings in another here a feast and there a masquerade and plays and coaches and hurries and messages and milaners and raps at the door and visits and frolicks and new fashions i shall not care what they do with the rest of the time nor whether they count it by the old style or the new for i am resolved to break loose from the nursery in the tumult and play my part among the rest and it will be strange if i cannot get a husband and a chariot in the year of confusion  cycle who is neither so young nor so handsome as starlight very gravely maintained that all the perplexity may be avoided by leaping over eleven days in the reckoning and indeed if it should come only to this i think the new style is a delightful thing for my mamma says i shall go to court when i am sixteen and if they can but contrive often to leap over eleven days together the months of restraint will soon be at an end it is strange that with all the plots that have been laid against time they could never kill it by act of parliament before dear sir if you have any vote or interest get them but for once to destroy eleven months and then i shall be as old as some married ladies but this is desired only if you think they will not comply with mr starlights scheme for nothing surely could please me like a year of confusion when i shall no longer be fixed this hour to my pen and the next to my needle or wait at home for the dancing master one day and the next for the musickmaster but run from ball to ball and from drum to drum and spend all my time without tasks and without account and go out without telling whither and come home without regard to prescribed hours or familyrules  i am sir your humble servant properantia  mr rambler i was seized this morning with an unusual pensiveness and finding that books only served to heighten it took a ramble into the fields in hopes of relief and invigoration from the keenness of the air and brightness of the sun  as i wandered wrapped up in thought my eyes were struck with the hospital for the reception of deserted infants which i surveyed with pleasure till by a natural train of sentiment i began to reflect on the fate of the mothers for to what shelter can they fly only to the arms of their betrayer which perhaps are now no longer open to receive them and then how quick must be the transition from deluded virtue to shameless guilt and from shameless guilt to hopeless wretchedness  the anguish that i felt left me no rest till had by your means addressed myself to the public on behalf of those forlorn creatures the women of the town whose misery here might satisfy the most rigorous censor and whose participation of our common nature might purely induce us to endeavor at least their preservation from eternal punishment  these were all once if not virtuous at least innocent and might still have continued blameless and easy but for the arts and infinuations of those whose rank fortune or education furnished them with means to corrupt or to delude them let the libertine reflect a moment on the situation of that woman who being forsaken by her betrayer is reduced to the necessity of turning prostitute for bread and judge of the enormity of his guilt by the evils which it produces  it cannot be doubted but that numbers follow this dreadful course of life with shame horror and regret but where can they hope for refuge  the world is not their friend nor the worlds law their sighs and tears and groans are criminal in the eye of their tyrants the bully and the bawd who fatten on their misery and threaten them with want or a gaol if they show the least design of escaping from their bondage  to wipe all tears from off all faces is a task too hard for mortals but to alleviate misfortunes is often within the most limited power yet the opportunities which every day affords of relieving the most wretched of human beings are overlooked and neglected with equal disregard of policy and goodness  there are places indeed set apart to which these unhappy creatures may resort when the diseases of incontinence seize upon them but if they obtain a cure to what are they reduced either to return with the small remains of beauty to their former guilt or perish in the streets with nakedness and hunger  how frequently have the gay and thoughtless in their evening frolicks seen a band of these miserable females covered with rags shivering with cold and pining with hunger and without either pitying their calamities or reflecting upon the cruelty of those who perhaps first seduced them by caresses of fondness or magnificence of promises go on to reduce others to the same wretchedness by the same means  to stop the increase of this deplorable multitude is undoubtedly the first and most pressing consideration to prevent evil is the great end of government the end for which vigilance and severity are properly employed but surely those whom passion or interest have already depraved have some claim to compassion from beings equally frail and fallible with themselves nor will they long groan in their present afflictions if none were to refuse them relief but who owe their exemption from the same distress only to their wisdom and their virtue  i am etc amicus  numb  0  saturday march  0      sapere aude incipe vivendi recte qui prorogat horam rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis at ille labitur and labetur in omne volubilis aevum hor an ancient poet unreasonably discontented at the present state of things which his system of opinions obliged him to represent in its worst form has observed of the earth that its greater part is covered by the uninhabitable ocean that of the rest some is encumbered with naked mountains and some lost under barren sands some scorched with unintermitted heat and some petrified with perpetual frost so that only a few regions remain for the production of fruits the pasture of cattle and the accommodation of man  the same observation may be transferred to the time allotted us in our present state when we have deducted all that is absorbed in sleep all that is inevitably appropriated to the demands of nature or irresistibly engrossed by the tyranny of custom all that passes in regulating the superficial decorations of life or is given up in the reciprocations of civility to the disposal of others all that is torn from us by violence of disease or stolen imperceptibly away by lassitude and languor we shall find that part of our duration very small of which we can truly call ourselves masters or which we can spend wholly at our own choice many of our hours are lost in a rotation of petty cares in a constant recurrence of the same employments many of our provisions for ease or happiness are always exhausted by the present day and a great part of our existence serves no other purpose than that of enabling us to enjoy the rest  of the few moments which are left in our disposal it may reasonably be expected that we should be so frugal as to let none of them slip from us without some equivalent and perhaps it might be found that as the earth however streightened by rocks or waters is capable of producing more than all its inhabitants are able to consume our lives though much contracted by incidental distraction and inevitable avocations would yet afford us a large space vacant to the exercise of our reason and our virtue that we want not time but diligence for great performances and that we squander much of our allowance even think it sparing and insufficient  this natural and necessary comminution of our lives perhaps often makes us insensible of the negligence with which we suffer them to slide away we never consider ourselves as possessed at once of time sufficient for any great design and therefore indulge ourselves in fortuitous amusements we think it unnecessary to take an account of a few supernumerary moments which however employed could have produced little advantage and which were exposed to a thousand chances of disturbance and interruption  it is observable that either by nature or by habit our understandings are fitted to images of a certain extent to which we adjust great things by division and little things by accumulation of extensive surfaces we can only take a survey as the parts succeed one another and atoms we cannot perceive till they are united into masses thus we break the vast periods of time into centuries and years and thus if we would know the amount of moments we must agglomerate them into days and weeks  the proverbial oracles of our parsimonious ancestors have informed us that the fatal waste of fortune is by small expenses by the profusion of sums too little singly to alarm our caution and which we never suffer ourselves to consider together of the same kind is the prodigality of life he that hopes to look back hereafter with satisfaction upon past years must learn to know the present value of single minutes and endeavor to let no particle of time fall useless to the ground  it is usual for those who are advised to the persuit of any study or the attainment of any new qualification to look upon themselves as required to change the general course of their conduct to dismiss business and exclude pleasure and to devote their days and nights to a particular attention but all common degrees of excellence are attainable at a lower price he that should steadily and resolutely assign to any science or language those interstitial vacancies which intervene in the most crowded variety of diversion or employment would find every day new irradiations of knowledge and discover how much more is to be hoped from frequency and perseverance than from violent efforts and sudden desires efforts which are soon remitted when they encounter difficulty and desires which if they are indulged too often will shake off the authority of reason and range capriciously from one object to another  the disposition to defer every important design to a time of leisure and a state of settled uniformity proceeds generally from a false estimate of the human powers if we except those gigantick and stupendous intelligences who are said to grasp a system by intuition and bound forward from one series of conclusions to another without regular steps through intermediate propositions the most successful students make their advances in knowledge by short flights between each of which the mind may lie at rest for every single act of progression a short time is sufficient and it is only necessary that whenever that time is afforded it be well employed  few minds will be long confined to severe and laborious meditation and when a successful attack on knowledge has been made the student recreates himself with the contemplation of his conquest and forbears another incursion till the newacquired truth has become familiar and his curiosity calls upon him for fresh gratifications whether the time of intermission is spent in company or in solitude in necessary business or in voluntary levities the understanding is equally abstracted from the object of enquiry but perhaps if it be detained by occupations less pleasing it returns again to study with greater alacrity than when it is glutted with ideal pleasures and surfeited with intemperance of application he that will not suffer himself to be discouraged by fancied impossibilities may sometimes find his abilities invigorated by the necessity of exerting them in short intervals as the force of a current is increased by the contraction of its chanel  from some cause like this it has probably proceeded that among those who have contributed to the advancement of learning many have risen to eminence in opposition to all the obstacles which external circumstances could place in their way amidst the tumult of business the distresses of poverty or the dissipations of a wandering and unsettled state a great part of the life of erasmus was one continual peregrination ill supplied with the gifts of fortune and led from city to city and from kingdom to kingdom by the hopes of patrons and preferment hopes which always flattered and always deceived him he yet found means by unshaken

though it might supply you with many sage remarks and salutary cautions  i cannot but imagine the start of attention awakened by this welcome hint and at this instant see the rambler snuffing his

dolorous declamation and warble out your groans with uncommon elegance or energy it is certain that whatever be your subject melancholy for the most part bursts in upon your speculation your gaiety is quickly overcast and though your readers may be flattered with hopes of pleasantry they are seldom dismissed but with heavy hearts  that i may therefore gratify you with an imitation of your own syllables of sadness i will inform you that i was condemned by some disastrous influence to be an only son born to the apparent prospect of a large fortune and allotted to my parents at that time of life when satiety of common diversions allows the mind to indulge parental affection with greater intenseness my birth was celebrated by the tenants with feasts and dances and bagpipes congratulations were sent from every family within ten miles round and my parents discovered in my first cries such tokens of future virtue and understanding that they declared themselves determined to devote the remaining part of life to my happiness and the increase of their estate  the abilities of my father and mother were not perceptibly unequal and education had given neither much advantage over the other they had both kept good company rattled in chariots glittered in playhouses and danced at court and were both expert in the games that were in their time generally called in as auxiliaries against the intrusion of thought  when there is such a parity between two persons associated for life the dejection which the husband if he be not completely stupid must always suffer for want of superiority sinks him to submissiveness my mamma therefore governed the family without control and except that my father still retained some authority in the stables and now and then after a supernumerary bottle broke a lookingglass or china dish to prove his sovereignty the whole course of the year was regulated by her direction the servants received from her all their orders and the tenants were continued or dismissed at her discretion  she therefore thought herself entitled to the superintendence of her sons education and when my father at the instigation of the parson faintly proposed that i should be sent to school very positively told him that she would not suffer so fine a child to be ruined that she never knew any boys at a grammar school that could come into a room without blushing or sit at the table without some awkward uneasiness that they were always putting themselves into danger by boisterous plays or vitiating their behavior with mean company and that for her part she would rather follow me to the grave than see me tear my clothes and hang down my head and sneak about with dirty shoes and blotted fingers hair unpowdered and a hat uncocked  my father who had no other end in his proposal than to appear wise and manly soon acquiesced since i was not to live by my learning for indeed he had known very few students that had not some stiffness in their manner they therefore agreed that a domestic tutor should be procured and hired an honest gentleman of mean conversation and narrow sentiments but whom having passed the common forms of literary education they implicitly concluded qualified to teach all that was to be learned from a scholar he thought himself sufficiently exalted by being placed at the same table with his pupil and had no other view than to perpetuate his felicity by unlimited reverence and the utmost flexibility of submission to all my mothers opinions and caprices he therefore frequently took away my book lest i should mope with too much application charged me never to write without turning up my ruffles and generally brushed my coat before he dismissed me into the parlour  he had indeed no occasion to complain of too burdensome an employment for my mother very judiciously considered that i was not likely to grow politer in his company and therefore suffered me not to pass any more time in his apartment than my lesson required when i was summoned to my task she generally enjoined me not to get any of my tutors ways who was seldom mentioned before me but for practices to be avoided i was every moment admonished not to lean on my chair cross my legs or swing my hands like my tutor and once my mother very seriously deliberated upon his total dismission because i began she faid to learn his manner of sticking on my hat and had his bend in my shoulders and his totter in my gait  such however was her care that i escaped all these depravities and when i was only twelve years old had rid myself of every appearance of childish diffidence i was celebrated round the country for the petulance of my remarks and the quickness of my replies and many a scholar five years older than myself have i dashed into confusion by the steadiness of my countenance silenced by my readiness of repartee and tortured with envy by the address with which i picked up a fan presented a snuff box or received an empty teacup  at thirteen i was so completely skilled in all the niceties of dress that i could not only enumerate all the variety of silks and distinguish the product of a french loom but dart my eye through a numerous company and observe every deviation from the reigning mode i was universally skilful in all the changes of expensive finery but as they say every one has something to which he is particularly born was eminently knowing in brussels lace  the next year saw me advanced to the trust and power of adjusting the ceremonial of an assembly every one received his partner from my hand and to me every stranger applied for introduction my heart now disdained the instructions of a tutor who was rewarded with a small annuity for life and left me qualified in my own opinion to govern myself  in a short time i came to london and as my father was well known among the higher classes of life soon obtained admission to the most splendid assemblies and most crowded cardtables here i found myself universally caressed and applauded the ladies praised the fancy of my clothes the beauty of my form and the softness of my voice endeavored in every place to force themselves upon my notice and invited by a thousand oblique solicitations my attendance to the playhouse and my salutations in the park i was now happy to the utmost extent of my conception i passed every morning in dress every afternoon in visits and every night in some select assemblies where neither care nor knowledge were suffered to molest us  after a few years however these delights became familiar and i had leisure to look round me with more attention i then found that my flatterers had very little power to relieve the languor of satiety or recreate weariness by varied amusement and therefore endeavored to enlarge the sphere of my pleasures and to try what satisfaction might be found in the society of men i will not deny the mortification with which i perceived that every man whose name i had heard mentioned with respect received me with a kind of tenderness nearly bordering on compassion and that those whose reputation was not well established thought it necessary to justify their understandings by treating me with contempt one of these witlings elevated his crest by asking me in a full coffeehouse the price of patches and another whispered that he wondered why miss frisk did not keep me that afternoon to watch her squirrel  when i found myself thus hunted from all masculine conversation by those who were themselves barely admitted i returned to the ladies and resolved to dedicate my life to their service and their pleasure but i find that i have now lost my charms of those with whom i entered the gay world some are married some have retired and some have so much changed their opinion that they scarcely pay any regard to my civilities if there is any other man in the place the new flight of beauties to whom i have made addresses suffer me to pay the treat and then titter with boys so that i now find myself welcome only to a few grave ladies who unacquainted with all that gives either use or dignity to life are content to pass their hours between their bed and their cards without esteem from the old or reverence from the young  i cannot but think mr rambler that i have reason to complain for surely the females ought to pay some regard to the age of him whose youth was passed in endeavors to please them they that encourage folly in the boy have no right to punish it in the man yet i find that though they lavish their first fondness upon pertness and

confessed and since all rational agents are conscious of having neglected or violated those duties which are prescribed to them the fear of being deserted rejected or punished by god has always burdened and oppressed the human mind the expiation of crimes and renovation of the forfeited hopes of divine favor has therefore constituted a large part of every religion  the various methods of propitiation and atonement which fear and folly have dictated or artifice and interest tolerated in the different parts of the world however they may sometimes reproach or degrade humanity at least show the general consent of all ages and nations in their opinion of the mercy and placability of the divine nature that god will forgive may indeed be established as the first and fundamental truth of religion for though the knowledge of his existence is the origin of philosophy yet without the belief of his mercy it would have very little influence upon our moral conduct there could be no prospect of enjoying the protection or regard of him whom the least deviation from rectitude made inexorable for ever and every man would naturally withdraw his thoughts from the contemplation of a creator whom he must consider as a governor too pure to be pleased and too severe to be pacified as an enemy infinitely wise and infinitely powerful whom he could neither deceive escape nor resist  where there is no hope there can be no endeavor a constant and unfailing obedience is above the reach of terrestrial diligence and therefore the progress of life could only have been the natural descent of negligent despair from crime to crime had not the universal persuasion of forgiveness to be obtained by proper means of reconciliation recalled those to the paths of virtue whom their passions had solicited aside and animated to new attempts and firmer perseverance those whom difficulty had discouraged or negligence surprised  in ages and regions so disjoined from each other that

anticipating his vengeance by voluntary inflictions and appeasing his justice by a speedy and cheerful submission to a less penalty when a greater is incurred  incorporated minds will always feel some inclination toward exterior acts and ritual observances ideas not represented by sensible objects are fleeting variable and evanescent we are not able to judge of the degree of conviction which operated at any particular time upon our own thoughts but as it is recorded by some certain and definite effect he that reviews his life in order to determine the probability of his acceptance with god if he could once establish the necessary proportion between crimes and sufferings might securely rest upon his performance of the expiation but while safety remains the reward only of mental purity he is always afraid lest he should decide too soon in his own favor lest he should not have felt the pangs of true contrition lest he should mistake satiety for abhorrence or imagine that his passions are subdued when they are only sleeping  from this natural and reasonable diffidence arose in humble and timorous piety a disposition to confound penance with repentance to repose on human determinations and to receive from some judicial sentence the stated and regular assignment of reconciliatory pain we are never willing to be without resource we seek in the knowledge of others a succor for our own ignorance and are ready to trust any that will undertake to direct us when we have no confidence in ourselves  this desire to ascertain by some outward marks the state of the soul and this willingness to calm the conscience by some settled method have produced as they are diversified in their effects by various tempers and principles most of the disquisitions and rules the doubts and solutions that have embarrassed the doctrine of repentance and perplexed tender and flexible minds with innumerable scruples concerning the necessary measures of sorrow and adequate degrees of selfabhorrence and these rules corrupted by fraud or debased by credulity have by the common resiliency of the mind from one extreme to another incited others to an open contempt of all subsidiary ordinances all prudential caution and the whole discipline of regulated piety  repentance however difficult to be practiced is if it be explained without superstition easily understood repentance is the relinquishment of any practice from the conviction that it has offended god sorrow and fear and anxiety are properly not parts but adjuncts of repentance yet they are so closely connected with it that they cannot easily be separated for they not only mark its sincerity but promote its efficacy  no man commits any act of negligence or obstinacy by which his present safety or happiness is endangered without feeling the pungency of remorse he who is fully convinced that he suffers by his own failure can never forbear to trace back his miscarriage to its first cause to image to himself a contrary behavior and to form involuntary resolutions against the like fault even when he knows that he shall never again have the power of committing it no man finds himself in danger without such trepidations of impatience as leave all human means of safety behind them he that has once caught an alarm of terror is every moment seized with useless anxieties always adding one security to another trembling with sudden doubts and distracted by the perpetual occurrence of new expedients if therefore he whose crimes have deprived him of the favor of god can reflect upon his conduct without disturbance or can at will banish the reflection if he who considers himself as suspended over the abyss of eternal perdition only by the thread of life which must soon part by its own weakness and which the wing of every minute may divide can cast his eyes round him without shuddering with horror or panting for security what can he judge of himself but that he is not yet awaked to sufficient conviction since every loss is more lamented than the loss of the divine favor and every danger more dreaded than the danger of final condemnation  retirement from the cares and pleasures of the world has been often recommended as useful to repentance this at least is evident that every one retires whenever ratiocination and recollection are required on other occasions and surely the retrospect of life the disentanglement of actions complicated with innumerable circumstances and diffused in various relations the discovery of the primary movements of the heart and the extirpation of lusts and appetites deeply rooted and widely spread may be allowed to demand some secession from sport and noise and business and folly some suspension of common affairs some pause of temporal pain and pleasure is doubtless necessary to him that deliberates for eternity who is forming the only plan in which miscarriage cannot be repaired and examining the only question in which mistake cannot be rectified  austerities and mortifications are means by which the mind is invigorated and roused by which the attractions of pleasure are interrupted and the chains of sensuality are broken it is observed by one of the fathers that he who restrains himself in the use of things lawful will never encroach upon things forbidden abstinence if nothing more is at least a cautious retreat from the utmost verge of permission and confers that security which cannot be reasonably hoped by him that dares always to hover over the precipice of destruction or delights to approach the pleasures which he knows it fatal to partake austerity is the proper antidote to indulgence the diseases of mind as well as body are cured by contraries and to contraries we should readily have recourse if we dreaded guilt as we dread pain  the completion and sum of repentance is a change of life that sorrow which dictates no caution that fear which does not quicken our escape that austerity which fails to rectily our affections are vain and unavailing but sorrow and terror must naturally precede reformation for what other cause can produce it he therefore that feels himself alarmed by his conscience anxious for the attainment of a better state and afflicted by the memory of his past faults may justly conclude that the great work of repentance is begun and hope by retirement and prayer the natural and religious means of strengthening his conviction to impress upon his mind such a sense of the divine presence as may overpower the blandishments of secular delights and enable him to advance from one degree of holiness to another till death shall set him free from misery and temptation what better can we do than prostrate fall before him reverent and there confess humbly our faults and pardon beg with tears watring the ground and with our sighs the air frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek   numb     tuesday april         sophoc it has been observed by long experience that late springs produce the greatest plenty the delay of blooms and fragrance of verdure and breezes is for the most part liberally recompensed by the exuberance and fecundity of the ensuing seasons the blossoms which lie concealed till the year is advanced and the sun is high escape those chilling blasts and nocturnal frosts which are often fatal to early luxuriance prey upon the first smiles of vernal beauty destroy the feeble principles of vegetable life intercept the fruit in the gem and beat down the flowers unopened to the ground  i am afraid there is little hope of persuading the young and sprightly part of my readers upon whom the spring naturally forces my attention to learn from the great process of nature the difference between diligence and hurry between speed and precipitation to prosecute their designs with calmness to watch the concurrence of opportunity and endeavor to find the lucky moment which they cannot make youth is the time of enterprise and hope having yet had no occasion of comparing our force with any opposing power we naturally form presumptions in our own favor and imagine that obstruction and impediment will give way before us the first repulses rather inflame vehemence than teach prudence a brave and generous mind is long before it suspects its own weakness or submits to sap the difficulties which it purposed to subdue by storm and expected to overbear in the violence of its course before disappointments have enforced the dictates of philosophy we believe it in our power to shorten the interval between the first cause and the last effect we laugh at the timorous delays of plodding industry and fancy that by increasing the fire we can at pleasure accelerate the projection  at our entrance into the world when health and vigor give us fair promises of time sufficient for the regular maturation of all our schemes and a long enjoyment of all our acquisitions we are eager to seize the present moment to pluck every gratification within our reach without suffering it to ripen into perfection and to crowd all the varieties of delight into a narrow compass but age seldom fails to change our conduct we grow commonly negligent of time in proportion as we have less remaining and suffer the last part of life to steal from us in languid preparations for some future undertaking or in slow approaches to some remote advantage in weak hopes of some fortuitous occurrence or in drowsy equilibrations of undetermined counsel whether it be that the aged having tasted the pleasures of mans condition and found them false and delusive become less anxious for their attainment or that frequent miscarriages have depressed them to despair and frozen them to inactivity or that like all other objects of terror death shocks them more as it advances upon them and they are afraid of reminding themselves of their decay or to discover to their own hearts that the time of trifling is past  a perpetual conflict with our natural desires seems to be the lot of our present state in youth we require something of the tardiness and frigidity of age and in age we must labor to recall the fire and impetuosity of youth in youth we must learn to expect and in age to enjoy  the torment of expectation is indeed not easily to be born at a time when every idea of gratification fires the blood and flashes on the fancy when the heart is vacant to every fresh form of delight and has no rival engagements to withdraw it from the importunities of a new desire yet since the fear of missing what we seek must always be proportionable to the advantage that we expect from possessing it the passions even in this tempestuous state might be somewhat moderated and restrained by frequent inculcation of the mischief of temerity and the hazard of losing that which we endeavor to seize before our time  he that too early aspires to honors must resolve to encounter not only the opposition of interest but the malignity of envy he that is too eager to be rich generally endangers his fortune in wild adventures and uncertain projects and he that hastens too speedily to reputation often endeavors to support his character by artifices and fallacies decks himself in colors which quickly fade or in plumes which accident may shake off or competition pluck away  the uncertainty and danger of early eminence has been extended by some even to the gifts of nature and an opinion has been long conceived that quickness of invention accuracy of judgment or extent of knowledge appearing in an uncommon degree before the usual time presage a short life even those who are less inclined to form general conclusions from instances which by their own nature must be rare have yet been inclined to prognosticate no suitable progress from the first sallies of rapid wits but have observed that after a short effort they either loiter or faint and suffer themselves to be surpassed by the equal and regular perseverance of slower understandings  it indeed frequently happens that applause abates diligence he that finds himself to have performed more than was demanded is contented to spare the labor of unnecessary performances and sits down to enjoy at ease his supersluities of honor he whom success has made confident of his abilities easily allows himself the privilege of negligence and looks contemptuously on the gradual advances of a rival whom he imagines himself able to leave behind him whenever he shall again summon his force to the contest but long intervals of pleasure dissipate attention and weaken constancy nor is it easy for him that has sunk from diligence into sloth to rouse out of his lethargy to recollect his notions rekindle his curiosity and engage with his former ardour in the toils of study  even that friendship which intends the reward of genius too often tends to obstruct it the pleasure of being caressed distinguished and admired easily seduces the student from literary solitude he is ready to follow the call which summons him tohear his own praise and which perhaps at once flatters appetites with certainty of pleasures and his ambition with hopes of patronage pleasures which he conceives inexhaustible and hopes which he has not yet learned to distrust  these evils indeed are by no means to be imputed to nature or to be considered as inseparable from an early display of uncommon abilities they may be certainly escaped by prudence and resolution and must therefore be recounted rather as consolations to those who are less liberally endowed than as discouragements to such as are born with uncommon qualities beauty is well known to draw after it the persecutions of impertinence to incite the artifices of envy and to raise the flames of unlawful love yet among the ladies whom prudence or modesty have made most eminent who has ever complained of the inconveniences or the dangers of an amiable form or who would have purchased safety by the loss of beauty  neither grace of person nor vigor of understanding are to be regarded otherwise than as blessings as means of happiness indulged by the supreme benefactor but the advantages of either may be lost by too much eagerness to obtain them a thousand beauties in their first blossom by an imprudent exposure to the open world have suddenly withered at the blast of infamy and men who might have subjected new regions to the empire of learning have been lured by the praise of their first productions from academical retirement and wasted their days in vice and dependence the virgin who too soon aspires to celebrity and conquest perishes by childish vanity ignorant credulity or guiltless indiscretion the genius who catches at laurels and preferment before his time mocks the hopes that he had excited and loses those years which might have been most usefully employed the years of youth of spirit and vivacity  it is one of the innumerable absurdities of pride that we are never more impatient of direction than in that part of lise when we need it most we are in haste to meet enemies whom we have not strength to overcome and to undertake tasks which we cannot perform and as

in mea vesanas habui dispendia vires et valui poenas fortis in ipse meas ovid we are taught by celsus that health is best preserved by avoiding settled habits of life and deviating sometimes into slight aberrations from the strict laws of medicine by varying the proportions of food and exercise interrupting the successions of rest and labor and mingling hardships with indulgence the body long accustomed to stated quantities and uniform periods is soon disordered by the smallest irregularity and since we cannot exempt ourselves wholly from the power of accident nor adjust every day by the balance or barometer but must sometimes depart from rigid accuracy in compliance with necessary affairs or strong inclinations he that too long observes nice punctualities and condemns himself to voluntary imbecility will not long escape the miseries of disease  the same laxity of regimen is equally necessary to intellectual health to a constant enjoyment of gaiety and perpetual susceptibility of occasional pleasure he that by long confinement to the same company whom perhaps similitude of taste brought first together has been accustomed to hear only the echo of his own sentiments quickly contracts his faculties and makes a thousand things offensive that are in themselves indifferent he soon bars all the common avenues of delight and has no part in the general diversions or gratifications of mankind  in things which are not immediately subject to religious or moral consideration it is dangerous to be too long or too rigidly in the right sensibility may by an incessant attention to elegance and propriety be quickened to a tenderness inconsistent with the condition of humanity irritable by the smallest asperity and vulnerable by the gentlest touch he that pleases himself too much with minute exactness and submits to endure nothing in accommodations attendance or address below the utmost point of perfection will whenever he enters the crowd of life be harassed with innumerable distresses from which those who have not in the same manner increased their sensations find no disturbance his exotic softness will shrink at the coarseness of vulgar felicity like a plant transplanted to northern nurseries from the dews and sunshine of the tropical regions  there will always be a wide interval between practical and ideal excellence and he therefore that allows not himself to be satisfied while he can perceive any error or defect must refer his hopes of ease to some other period of existence it is well known that exposed to a microscope the smoothest polish of the most solid bodies discovers cavities and prominences and that the softest bloom of roseate virginity repels the eye with excrescences and discolorations the perceptions as well as the senses may be improved to our own disquiet and we may by diligent cultivation of the powers of dislike raise in time an artificial fastidiousness which shall fill the imagination with phantoms of turpitude show us the naked skeleton of every delight and present us only with the pains of pleasure and the deformities of beauty  peevishness indeed would perhaps very little disturb the peace of mankind were it always the consequence of superfluous delicacy for it is the privilege only of deep reflection or lively fancy to destroy happiness by art and refinement but by a continual indulgence of a particular humor or by a long enjoyment of undisputed superiority the dull and thoughtless may likewise acquire the power of tormenting themselves and others and become sufficiently ridiculous or hateful to those who are within sight of their conduct or reach of their influence  they that have grown old in a single state are generally found to be morose fretful and captious tenacious of their own practices and maxims soon offended by contradiction or negligence and impatient of any association but with such as will watch their nod give up all claim to choice and reason and submit themselves to unlimited authority such is the effect of having lived without the necessity of consulting any inclination but their own  the irascibility of this class of tyrants is generally exerted upon petty provocations such as are incident to understandings not far extended beyond the instincts of animal life but unhappily he that fixes his attention on things always before him will never have long cessations of anger there are many veterans of luxury upon whom every noon brings a paroxysm of violence fury and execration they never sit down to their dinner without finding the meat so injudiciously bought or so unskilfully dressed such blunders in the seasoning or such improprieties in the sauce as can scarcely be expiated without blood and in the transports of resentment make very little distinctions between guilt and innocence but let fly their menaces or growl out their discontent upon all whom sortune exposes to the storm  it is not easy to imagine a more unhappy condition than that of dependence on a peevish man in every other state of inferiority the certainty of pleasing is perpetually increased by a fuller knowledge of our duty and kindness and confidence are strengthened by every new act of trust and proof of fidelity but peevishness sacrifices to a momentary offense the obsequiousness or usefulness of half a life and as more is performed increases her

admonitions informed of his fathers inability to maintain him in his native rank cautioned against all opposition to the opinions or precepts of his uncle and animated to perseverance by the hopes of supporting the honor of the family and overtopping his elder brother he had a natural ductility of mind without much warmth of affection or elevation of sentiment and therefore readily complied with every variety of caprice patiently endured contradictory reproofs heard false accusations without pain and opprobrious reproaches without reply laughed obstreperously at the ninetieth repetition of a joke asked questions about the universal decay of trade admired the strength of those heads by which the price of stocks is changed and adjusted and behaved with such prudence and circumspection that

rigorous and spiteful superintendence of domestic trifles eriphile has employed her eloquence for twenty years upon the degeneracy of servants the nastiness of her house the ruin of her furniture the difficulty of preserving tapestry from the moths and the carelessness of the sluts whom she employs in brushing it it is her business every morning to visit all the rooms in hopes of finding a chair without its cover a window shut or open contrary to her orders a spot on the hearth or a feather on the floor that the rest of the day may be justifiably spent in taunts of contempt and vociferations of anger she lives for no other purpose but to preserve the neatness of a house and gardens and feels there inclination to pleasure nor aspiration after virtue while she is engrossed by the great

because she spilt her coffee on a turkey carpet and to the third because she let a wet dog run into the parlour she has broken off her intercourse of visits because company makes a house dirty and resolves to confine herself more to her own affairs and to live no longer in mire by foolish lenity and indulgence  peevishness is generally the vice of narrow minds and except when it is the effect of anguish and disease by which the resolution is broken and the mind made too feeble to bear the lightest addition to its miseries proceeds from an unreasonable persuasion of the importance of trifles the proper remedy against it is to consider the dignity of human nature and the folly of suffering perturbation and uneasiness from failures unworthy of our notice  he that resigns his peace to little casualties and suffers the course of his life to be interrupted by fortuitous inadvertencies or trivial offenses delivers up himself to the direction of the wind and loses all that constancy and equanimity which constitute the chief praise of a wise man  the province of prudence lies between the greatest things and the least some surpass our power by their magnitude and some escape our notice by their number and their frequency but the indispensable business of life will afford sufficient exercise to every understanding and such is the limitation of the human powers that by attention to trifles we must let things of importance pass unobserved when we examine a mite with a glass we see nothing but a mite  that it is every mans interest to be pleased will need little proof that it is his interest to please others experience will inform him it is therefore not less necessary to happiness than to virtue that he rid his mind of passions which make him uneasy to himself and

rambler sir i know not whether it is always a proof of innocence to treat censure with contempt we owe so much reverence to the wisdom of mankind as justly to wish that our own opinion of our merit may be ratified by the concurrence of other suffrages and since guilt and infamy must have the same effect upon intelligences unable to pierce beyond external appearance and influenced often rather by example than precept we are obliged to refute a false charge lest we should countenance the crime which we have never committed to turn away from an accusation with supercilious silence is equally in the power of him that is hardened by villiany and inspirited by innocence the wall of brass which horace erects upon a clear conscience may be sometimes raised by impudence or power and we should always wish to preserve the dignity of virtue by adorning her with graces which wickedness cannot assume  for this reason i have determined no longer to endure with either patient or sullen resignation a reproach which is at least in my opinion unjust but will lay my case honestly before you that you or your readers may at length decide it  whether you will be able to preserve your boasted impartiality when you hear that i am considered as an adversary by half the semale world you may surely pardon me for doubting notwithstanding the veneration to which you may imagine yourself entitled by your age your learning your abstraction or your virtue beauty mr rambler has often overpowered the resolutions of the firm and the reasonings of the wise roused the old to sensibility and subdued the rigorous to softness  i am one of those unhappy beings who have been marked out as husbands for many different women and deliberated a hundred times on the brink of matrimony i have discussed all the nuptial preliminaries so often that i can repeat the forms in which jointures are settled pinmoney secured and provisions for younger children ascertained but am at last doomed by general consent to everlasting solitude and excluded by an irreversible decree from all hopes of connubial felicity i am pointed out by every mother as a man whose visits cannot be admitted without reproach who raises hopes only to embitter disappointment and makes offers only to seduce girls into a waste of that part of life in which they might gain advantageous matches and become mistresses and mothers  i hope you will think that some part of this penal severity may justly be remitted when i inform you that i never yet professed love to a woman without sincere intentions of marriage that i have never continued an appearance of intimacy from the hour that my inclination changed but to preserve her whom i was leaving from the shock of abruptness or the ignominy of contempt that i always endeavored to give the ladies an opportunity of seeming to discard me and that i never forsook a mistress for larger fortune or brighter beauty but because i discovered some irregularity in her conduct or some depravity in her mind not because i was charmed by another but because i was offended by herself  i was very early tired of that succession of amusements by which the thoughts of most young men are dissipated and enfeebled and had not long glittered in the splendor of an ample patrimony before i wished for the calm and serenity of domestic happiness youth is naturally delighted with sprightliness and ardour and therefore i breathed out the sighs of my first affection at the feet of the gay the sparkling the vivacious ferocula i fancied to myself a perpetual source of happiness in wit never exhausted and spirit never depressed looked with veneration on her readiness of expedients contempt of difficulty assurance of address and promptitude of reply considered her as exempt by some prerogative of nature from the weakness and timidity of female minds and congratulated myself upon a companion superior to all common troubles and embarrassments i was indeed somewhat disturbed by the unshaken perseverance with which she enforced her demands of an unreasonable settlement but should have consented to pass my life in her arms had not my curiosity led me to a crowd gathered in the street where i found ferocula in the presence of hundreds disputing for sixpence with a chairman i saw her in so little need of assistance that it was no breach of the laws of chivalry to forbear interposition and i spared myself therefore the shame of owning her acquaintance i forgot some point of ceremony at our next interview and soon provoked her to forbid me her presence  my next attempt was upon a lady of great eminence for learning and philosophy i had frequently observed the barrenness and uniformity of connubial conversation and therefore thought highly of my own prudence and discernment when i selected from a multitude of wealthy beauties the deepread misothea who declared herself the inexorable enemy of ignorant pertness and puerile levity and scarcely condescended to make tea but for the linguist the geometrician the astronomer or the poet the queen of the amazons was only to be gained by the hero who could conquer her in single combat and misotheas heart was only to bless the scholar who could overpower her by disputation amidst the fondest transports of courtship she could call for a definition of terms and treated every argument with contempt that could not be reduced to regular syllogism you may easily imagine that i wished this courtship at an end but when i desired her to shorten my torments and fix the day of my felicity we were led into a long conversation in which misothea endeavored to demonstrate the folly of attributing choice and selfdirection to any human being it was not difficult to discover the danger of committing myself for ever to the arms of one who might at any time mistake the dictates of passion or the calls of appetite for the decree of fate or consider cuckoldom as necessary to the general system as a link in the everlasting chain of successive causes i therefore told her that destiny had ordained us to part and that nothing should have torn me from her but the talons of necessity  i then solicited the regard of the calm the prudent the oeconomical sophronia a lady who considered wit as dangerous and learning as superfluous and thought that the woman who kept her house clean and her accounts exact took receipts for every payment and could find them at a sudden call enquired nicely after the condition of the tenants read the price of stocks once a week and purchased every thing at the best market could want no accomplishments necessary to the happiness of a wise man she discoursed with great solemnity on the care and vigilance which the superintendance of a family demands observed how many were ruined by confidence in servants and told me that she never expected honesty but from a strong chest and that the best storekeeper was the mistresss eye many such oracles of generosity she uttered and made every day new improvements in her schemes for the regulation of her servants and the distribution of her time i was convinced that whatever i might suffer from sophronia i should escape poverty and we therefore proceeded to adjust the settlements according to her own rule fair and softly but one morning her maid came to me in tears to entreat my interest for a reconciliation to her mistress who had turned her out at night for breaking six teeth in a tortoiseshell comb she had attended her lady from a distant province and having not lived long enough to save much money was destitute among strangers and though of a good family in danger of perishing in the streets or of being compelled by hunger to prostitution i made no scruple of promising to restore her but upon my first application to sophronia was answered with an air which called for approbation that if she neglected her own affairs i might suspect her of neglecting mine that the comb stood her in three halfcrowns that no servant should wrong her twice and that indeed she took the first opportunity of parting with phyllida because though she was honest her constitution was bad and she thought her very likely to fall sick of our conference i need not tell you the effect it furely may be forgiven me if on this occasion i forgot the decency of common forms  from two more ladies i was disengaged by finding that they entertained my rivals at the same time and determined their choice by the liberality of our settlements another i thought myself justified in forsaking because she gave my attorney a bribe to favor her in the bargain another because i could never soften her to tenderness till she heard that most of my family had died young and another because to increase her fortune by expectations she represented her sister as languishing and consumptive  i shall in another letter give the remaining part of my history of courtship i presume that i should

cunctatio longa est juv power and superiority are so flattering and delightful that fraught with temptation and exposed to danger as they are scarcely any virtue is so cautious or any prudence so timorous as to decline them even those that have most reverence for the laws of right are pleased with showing that not fear but choice regulates their behavior and would be thought to comply rather than obey we love to overlook the boundaries which we do not wish to pass and as the roman satirist remarks he that has no design to take the life of another is yet glad to have it in his hands  from the same principle tending yet more to degeneracy and corruption proceeds the desire of investing lawful authority with terror and governing by force rather than persuasion pride is unwilling to believe the necessity of assigning any other reason than her own will and would rather maintain the most equitable claims by violence and penalties than descend from the dignity of command to dispute and expostulation  it may i think be suspected that this political pride has sometimes found its way into legislative assemblies and mingled with deliberations upon property and life a slight perusal of the laws by which the measures of vindictive and coercive justice are established will discover so many disproportions between crimes and punishments such capricious distinctions of guilt and such confusion of remissness and severity as can scarcely be believed to have been produced by public wisdom sincerely and calmly studious of public happiness  the learned the judicious the pious boerhaave relates that he never saw a crimiminal dragged to execution without asking himself who knows whether this man is not less culpable than me on the days when the prisons of this city are emptied into the grave let every spectator of the dreadful procession put the same question to his own heart how few among those that crowd in thousands to the legal massacre and look with carelessness perhaps with triumph on the utmost exacerbations of human misery would then be able to return without horror and dejection for who can congratulate himself upon a life passed without some act more mischievous to the peace or prosperity of others than the theft of a piece of money  it has been always the practice when any particular species of robbery becomes prevalent and common to endeavor its suppression by capital denunciations thus one generation of malefactors is commonly cut off and their successors are frighted into new expedients the art of thievery is augmented with greater variety of fraud and subtilized to higher degrees of dexterity and more occult methods of conveyance the law then renews the persuit in the heat of anger and overtakes the offender again with death by this practice capital inflictions are multiplied and crimes very different in their degrees of enormity are equally subjected to the severest punishment that man has the power of exercising upon man  the lawgiver is undoubtedly allowed to estimate the malignity of an offense not merely by the loss or pain which single acts may produce but by the general alarm and anxiety arising from the fear of mischief and insecurity of possession he therefore exercises the right which societies are supposed to have over the lives of those that compose them not simply to punish a transgression but to maintain order and preserve quiet he enforces those laws with severity that are most in danger of violation as the commander of a garrison doubles the guard on that side which is threatened by the enemy  this method has been long tried but tried with so little success that rapine and violence are hourly increasing yet few seem willing to despair of its efficacy and of those who employ their speculations upon the present corruption of the people some propose the introduction of more horrid lingering and terrifick punishments some are inclined to accelerate the executions some to discourage pardons and all seem to think that lenity has given confidence to wickedness and that we can only be rescued from the talons of robbery by inflexible rigor and sanguinary justice  yet since the right of setting an uncertain and arbitrary value upon life has been disputed and since experience of past times gives us little reason to hope that any reformation will be effected by a periodical havoc of our fellow beings perhaps it will not be useless to consider what consequences might arise from relaxations of the law and a more rational and equitable proportion of penalties to offenses  death is as one of the ancients observes  of dreadful things the most dreadful an evil beyond which nothing can be threatened by sublunary power or feared from human enmity or vengeance this terror should therefore be reserved as the last resort of authority as the strongest and most operative of prohibitory sanctions and placed before the treasure of life to guard from invasion what cannot be restored to equal robbery with murder is to reduce murder to robbery to confound in common minds the gradations of injury and incite the commission of a greater crime to prevent the detection of a less if only murder were punished with death very few robbers would stain their hands in blood but when by the last act of cruelty no new danger is incurred and greater security may probably be obtained upon what principle shall we bid them forbear  it may be urged that the sentence is often mitigated to simple robbery but surely this is to confess that our laws are unreasonable in our own opinion and indeed it may be observed that all but murderers have at their last hour the common sensations of mankind pleading in their favor  from this conviction of the inequality of the punishments to the offense proceeds the frequent solicitation of pardons they who would rejoice at the correction of a thief are yet shocked at the thought of destroying him his crime shrinks to nothing compared with his misery and severity defeats itself by exciting pity  the gibbet indeed certainly disables those who die upon it from infesting the community but their death seems not to contribute more to the reformation of their associates than any other method of separation a thief seldom passes much of his time in recollection or anticipation but from robbery haftens to riot and from riot to robbery nor when the grave closes upon his companion has any other care than to find another  the frequency of capital punishments therefore rarely hinders the commission of a crime but naturally and commonly prevents its detection and is if we reason only upon prudential principles chiefly for that reason to be avoided whatever may be urged by casuists or politicians the greater part of mankind as they can never think that to pick the pocket and to pierce the heart is equally criminal will scarcely believe that two malefactors so different in guilt can be justly doomed to the same punishment nor is the necessity of submitting the conscience to human laws so plainly evinced so clearly stated or so generally allowed but that the pious the tender and the just will always scruple to concur with the community in an act which their private judgment cannot approve  he who knows not how often rigorous laws produce total impunity and how many crimes are concealed and forgotten for fear of hurrying the offender to that state in which there is no repentance has conversed very little with mankind and whatever epithets of reproach or contempt this compassion may incur from those who confound cruelty with firmness i know not whether any wise man would wish it less powerful or less extensive  if those whom the wisdom of our laws has condemned to die had been detected in their rudiments of robbery they might by proper discipline and useful labor have been disentangled from their habits and by escaping all the temptations to subsequent crimes have passed their days in reparation and penitence and detected they might all have been had the prosecutors been certain that their lives would have been spared i believe every thief will confess that he has been more than once seized and dismissed and that he has sometimes ventured upon capital crimes because he knew that those whom he injured would rather connive at his escape than cloud their minds with the horrors of his death  all laws against crimes are ineffectual unless some will inform and some will prosecute but till we mitigate the penalties for mere violations of property information will always be hated and prosecution dreaded the heart of a good man cannot but recoil at the thought of punishing a slight injury with death especially when he remembers that the thief might have procured safety by another crime from which he was restrained only by his remaining virtue  the obligations to assist the exercise of public justice are indeed strong but they will certainly be overpowered by tenderness for life what is punished with severity contrary to our ideas of adequate retribution will be seldom discovered and multitudes will be suffered to advance from crime to crime till they deserve death because if they had been early prosecuted they would have suffered death before they deserved it  this scheme of invigorating the laws by relaxation and extirpating wickedness by lenity is so remote from common practice that i might reasonably fear to expose it to the public could it be supported only by my own observations i shall therefore by ascribing it to its author sir thomas more endeavor to procure it that attention which i wish always paid to prudence to justice and to mercy  numb     tuesday april         quaedam parva quidem sed non toleranda maritis juv to the rambler sir i sit down in pursuance of my late engagement to recount the remaining part of the adventures that befell me in my long quest of conjugal felicity which though i have not yet been so happy as to obtain it i have at least endeavored to deserve by unwearied diligence without suffering from repeated disappointments any abatement of my hope or repression of my activity  you must have observed in the world a species of mortals who employ themselves in promoting matrimony and without any visible motive of interest or vanity without any discoverable impulse of malice or benevolence without any reason but that they want objects of attention and topics of conversation are incessantly busy in procuring wives and husbands fill the ears of every single man and woman with some convenient match and when they are informed of your age and fortune offer a partner of life with the same readiness and the same indifference as a salesman when he has taken measure by his eye fits his customer with a coat  it might be expected that they should soon be discouraged from this officious interposition by resentment or contempt and that every man should determine the choice on which so much of his happiness must depend by his own judgment and observation yet it happens that as these proposals are generally made with a show of kindness they seldom provoke anger but are at worst heard with patience and forgotten they influence weak minds to approbation for many are sure to find in a new acquaintance whatever qualities report has taught them to expect and in more powerful and active understandings they excite curiosity and sometimes by a lucky chance bring persons of similar tempers within the attraction of each other  i was known to possess a fortune and to want a wife and therefore was frequently attended by these hymeneal solicitors with whose importunity i was sometimes diverted and sometimes perplexed for they contended for me as vulturs for a carcass each employed all his eloquence and all his artifices to enforce and promote his own scheme from the success of which he was to receive no other advantage than the pleasure of defeating others equally eager and equally industrious  an invitation to sup with one of those busy friends made me by a concerted chance acquainted with camilla by whom it was expected that i should be suddenly and irresistibly enslaved the lady whom the same kindness had brought without her own concurrence into the lists of love seemed to think me at least worthy of the honor of captivity and exerted the power both of her eyes and wit with so much art and spirit that though i had been too often deceived by appearances to devote myself irrevocably at the first interview yet i could not suppress some raptures of admiration and flutters of desire i was easily persuaded to make nearer approaches but soon discovered that an union with camilla was not much to be wished camilla professed a boundless contempt for the folly levity ignorance and impertinence of her own sex and very frequently expressed her wonder that men of learning or experience could submit to trifle away life with beings incapable of solid thought in mixed companies she always associated with the men and declared her satisfaction when the ladies retired if any short excursion into the country was proposed she commonly insisted upon the exclusion of women from the party because where they were admitted the time was wasted in frothy compliments weak indulgences and idle ceremonies to show the greatness of her mind she avoided all compliance with the fashion and to boast the profundity of her knowledge mistook the various textures of silk confounded tabbies with damasks and sent for ribbands by wrong names she despised the commerce of stated visits a farce of empty form without instruction and congratulated herself that she never learned the low style of messagecards she often applauded the noble sentiment of plato who rejoiced that he was born a man rather than a woman proclaimed her approbation of swifts opinion that women are only a higher species of monkies and confessed that when she considered the behavior or heard the conversation of her sex she could not but forgive the turks for suspecting them to want souls  it was the joy and pride of camilla to have provoked by this insolence all the rage of hatred and all the persecutions of calumny nor was she ever more elevated with her own superiority than when she talked of female anger and female cunning well says she has nature provided that such virulence should be disabled by folly and such cruelty be restrained by impotence  camilla doubtless expected that what she lost on one side she should gain on the other and imagined that every male heart would be open to a lady who made such generous advances to the borders of virility but man ungrateful man instead of springing forward to meet her shrunk back at her approach she was persecuted by the ladies as a deserter and at best received by the men only as a fugitive i for my part amused myself a while with her fopperies but novelty soon gave way to detestation for nothing out of the common order of nature can be long borne i had no inclination to a wife who had the ruggedness of man without his force and the ignorance of woman without her softness nor could i think it my quiet and honor to be trusted to such audacious virtue as was hourly courting danger and soliciting assault  my next mistress was nitella a lady of gentle mien and soft voice always speaking to approve and ready to receive direction from those with whom chance had brought her into company in nitella i promised myself an easy friend with whom i might loiter away the day without disturbance or altercation i therefore soon resolved to address her but was discouraged from prosecuting my courtship by observing that her apartments were superstitiously regular and that unless she had notice of my visit she was never to be seen there is a kind of anxious cleanliness which i have always noted as the characteristick of a slattern it is the superfluous scrupulosity of guilt dreading discovery and shunning suspicion it is the violence of an effort against habit which being impelled by external motives cannot stop at the middle point  nitella was always tricked out rather with nicety than with elegance and seldom could forbear to discover by her uneasiness and constraint that her attention was burdened and her imagination engrossed i therefore concluded that being only occasionally and ambitiously dressed she was not familiarized to her own ornaments there are so many competitors for the same of cleanliness that it is not hard to gain information of those that fail from those that desire to excel i quickly found that nitella passed her time between finery and dirt and was always in a wrapper nightcap and slippers when she was not decorated for immediate show  i was then led by my evil destiny to charybdis who never neglected an opportunity of seizing a new prey when it came within her reach i thought myself quickly made happy by a permission to attend her to public places and pleased my own vanity with imagining the envy which i should raise in a thousand hearts by appearing as the acknowledged favorite of charybdis she soon after hinted her intention to take a ramble for a fortnight into a part of the kingdom which she had never seen i solicited the happiness of accompanying her which after a short reluctance was indulged me she had no other curiosity in her journey than after all possible means of expense and was every moment taking occasion to mention some delicacy which i knew it my duty upon such notices to procure  after our return being now more familiar she told me whenever we met of some new diversion at night she had always notice of a charming company that would breakfast in the gardens and in the morning she had been informed of some new song in the opera some new dress at the playhouse or some performer at a concert whom she longed to hear her intelligence was such that there never was a show to which she did not summon me on the second day and as she hated a crowd and could not go alone i was obliged to attend at some intermediate hour and pay the price of a whole company when we passed the streets she was often charmed with some trinket in the toyshops and from moderate desires of seals and snuffboxes rose by degrees to gold and diamonds i now began to find the smile of charybdis too costly for a private purse and added one more to six and forty lovers whose fortune and patience her rapacity had exhausted  imperia then took possession of my affections but kept them only for a short time she had newly inherited a large fortune and having spent the early part of her life in the perusal of romances brought with her into the gay world all the pride of cleopatra expected nothing less than vows altars and sacrifices and thought her charms dishonored and her power infringed by the softest opposition to her sentiments or the smallest transgression of her commands time might indeed cure this species of pride in a mind not naturally undiscerning and vitiated only by false representations but the operations of time are slow and i therefore left her to grow wise at leisure or to continue in error at her own expense  thus i have hitherto in spite of myself passed my life in frozen celibacy my friends indeed often tell me that i flatter my imagination with higher hopes than human nature can gratify that i dress up an ideal charmer in all the radiance of perfection and then enter the world to look for the same excellence in corporeal beauty but surely mr rambler it is not madness to hope for some terrestrial lady unstained with the spots which i have been describing at least i am resolved to pursue my search for i am so far from thinking meanly of marriage that i believe it able to afford the highest happiness decreed to our present

mortgage and paid his sisters their portions thought himself discharged from all obligation to farther thought and entitled to spend the rest of his life in rural pleasures he therefore spared nothing that might contribute to the completion of his felicity he procured the best guns and horses that the kingdom could supply paid large salaries to his groom and huntsman and became the envy of the county for the discipline of his hounds but above all his other seize he was eminent for a breed of pointers and setting dogs which by long and vigilant cultivation he had so much improved that not a partridge or heathcock could rest in security and game of whatever species that dared to light upon his manor was beaten down by his shot or covered with his nets  my elder brother was very early initiated in the chase and at an age when other boys are creeping like snails unwillingly to school he could wind the horn beat the bushes bound over hedges and swim rivers when the huntsman one day broke his leg he supplied his place with equal abilities and came home with the scut in his hat amidst the acclamations of the whole village i being either delicate or timorous less desirous of honor or less capable of sylvan heroism was always the favorite of my mother because i kept my coat clean and my complexion free from freckles and did not come home like my brother mired and tanned nor carry corn in my hat to the horse nor bring dirty curs into the parlour  my mother had not been taught to amuse herself with books and being much inclined to despise the ignorance and barbarity of the country ladies disdained to learn their sentiments or conversation and had made no addition to the notions which she had brought from the precincts of cornhill she was therefore always recounting the glories of the city enumerating the succession of mayors celebrating the magnificence of the banquets at guildhall and relating the civilities paid her at the companies feasts by men of whom some are now made aldermen some have fined for sheriffs and none are worth less than forty thousand pounds she frequently displaid her fathers greatness told of the large bills which he had paid at sight of the sums for which his word would pass upon the exchange the heaps of gold which he used on saturday night to toss about with a shovel the extent of his warehouse and the strength of his doors and when she relaxed her imagination with lower subjects described the furniture of their country house or repeated the wit of the clerks and porters  by these narratives i was fired with the splendour and dignity of london and of trade i therefore devoted myself to a shop and warmed my imagination from year to year with enquiries about the privileges of a freeman the power of the common council the dignity of a wholesale dealer and the grandeur of mayoralty to which my mother assured me that many had arrived who began the world with less than myself  i was very impatient to enter into a path which led to such honor and felicity but was forced for a time to endure some repression of my eagerness for it was my grandfathers maxim that a young man seldom makes much money who is out of his time before twoandtwenty they thought it necessary therefore to keep me at home till the proper age without any other employment than that of learning merchants accounts and the art of regulating books but at length the tedious days elapsed i was transplanted to town and with great satisfaction to myself bound to a haberdasher  my master who had no conception of any virtue merit or dignity but that of being rich had all the good qualities which naturally arise from a close and unwearied attention to the main chance his desire to gain wealth was so well tempered by the vanity of showing it that without any other principle of action he lived in the esteem of the whole commercial world and was always treated with respect by the only men whose good opinion he valued or solicited those who were universally allowed to be richer than himself  by his instructions i learned in a few weeks to handle a yard with great dexterity to wind tape neatly upon the ends of my fingers and to make up parcels with exact frugality of paper and packthread and soon caught from my fellow apprentices the true grace of a counter bow the careless air with which a small pair of scales is to be held between the fingers and the vigor and sprightliness with which the box after the ribband has been cut is returned into its place having no desire of any higher employment and therefore applying all my powers to the knowledge of my trade i was quickly master of all that could be known became a critic in small wares contrived new variations of figures and new mixtures of colors and was sometimes consulted by the weavers when they projected fashions for the ensuing spring  with all these accomplishments in the fourth year of my apprenticeship i paid a visit to my friends in the country where i expected to be received as a new ornament of the family and consulted by the neighboring gentlemen as a master of pecuniary knowledge and by the ladies as an oracle of the mode but unhappily at the first public table to which i was invited appeared a student of the temple and an officer of the guards who looked upon me with a smile of contempt which destroyed at once all my hopes of distinction so that i durst hardly raise my eyes for fear of encountering their superiority of mien nor was my courage revived by any opportunities of displaying my knowledge for the templar entertained the company for part of the day with historical narratives and political observations and the colonel afterward detailed the adventures of a birthnight told the claims and expectations of the courtiers and gave an account of assemblies gardens and diversions i indeed essayed to fill up a pause in a parliamentary debate with a saint mention of trade and spaniards and once attempted with some wramth to correct a gross mistake about a silver breastknot but neither of my antagonists seemed to think a reply necessary they resumed their discourse without emotion and again engrossed the attention of the company nor did one of the ladies appear desirous to know my opinion of her dress or to hear how long the carnation shot with white that was then new amongst them had been antiquated in town  as i knew that neither of these gentlemen had more money than myself i could not discover what had depressed me in their presence nor why they were considered by others as more worthy of attention and respect and therefore resolved when we met again to rouse my spirit and force myself into notice i went very early to the following weekly meeting and was entertaining a small circle very successfully with a minute representation of my lord mayors show when the colonel entered careless and gay sat down with a kind of unceremonious civility and without appearing to intend any interruption drew my audience away to the other part of the room to which i had not the courage to follow them soon after came in the lawyer not indeed with the same attraction of mien but with greater powers of language and by one or other the company was so happily amused that i was neither heard nor seen nor was able to give any other proof of my existence than that i put round the glass and was in my turn permitted to name the toast  my mother indeed endeavored to comfort me in my vexation by telling me that perhaps these showy talkers were hardly able to pay every one his own that he who has money in his pocket needs not care what any man says of him that if i minded my trade the time would come when lawyers and soldiers would be glad to borrow out of my purse and that it is fine when a man can set his hands to his sides and say he is worth forty thousand pounds every day of the year these and many more such consolations and encouragements i received from my good mother which however did not much allay my uneasiness for having by some accident heard that the country ladies despised her as a cit i had therefore no longer much reverence for her opinions but considered her as one whose ignorance and prejudice had hurried me though without ill intentions into a state of meanness and ignominy from which i could not find any possibility of rising to the rank which my ancestors had always held  i returned however to my master and busied myself among thread and silk and laces but without my former cheerfulness or alacrity i had now no longer any felicity in contemplating the exact disposition of my powdered curls the equal plaits of my ruffles or the glossy blackness of my shoes nor heard with my former elevation those compliments which ladies sometimes condescended to pay me upon my readiness in twisting a paper or counting out the change the term of young man with which i was sometimes honored as i carried a parcel to the door of a coach tortured my imagination i grew negligent of my person and sullen in my temper often mistook the demands of the customers treated their caprices and objections with contempt and received and dismissed them with surly silence  my master was afraid lest the shop should suffer by this change of my behavior and therefore after some expostulations posted me in the warehouse and preserved me from the danger and reproach of desertion to which my discontent would certainly have urged me had i continued any longer behind the counter  in the sixth year of my servitude my brother died of drunken joy for having run down a fox that had baffled

what they cannot comprehend all industry must be excited by hope and as the student often proposes no other reward to himself than praise he is easily discouraged by contempt and insult he who brings with him into a clamorous multitude the timidity of recluse speculation and has never hardened his front in public life nor accustomed his passions to the vicissitudes and accidents the triumphs and defeats of mixed conversation will blush at the stare of petulant incredulity and suffer himself to be driven by a burst of laughter from the fortresses of demonstration the mechanist will be afraid to assert before hardy contradiction the possibility of tearing down bulwarks with a silkworms thread and the astronomer of relating the rapidity of light the distance of the fixed stars and the height of the lunar mountains  if i could by any efforts have shaken off this cowardice i had not sheltered myself under a borrowed name nor applied to you for the means of communicating to the public the theory of a garret a subject which except some slight and transient strictures has been hitherto neglected by those who were best qualified to adorn it either for want of leisure to prosecute the various researches in which a nice discussion must necessarily engage them or because it requires such diversity of knowledge and such extent of curiosity as is scarcely to be found in any single intellect or perhaps others having more sagacity than myself foresaw the tumults which would be raised against them and considering that it was vain to write what they durst not publish confined their knowledge to their own breasts and abandoned prejudice and folly to the direction of chance  that the professors of literature generally reside in the highest stories has been immemorially observed the wisdom of the ancients was well acquainted with the intellectual advantages of an elevated situation why else were the muses stationed on olympus or parnassus by those who could with equal right have raised them bowers in the vale of tempe or erected their altars among the flexures of meander why was jove himself nursed upon a mountain or why did the gooddesses when the prize of beauty was contested try the cause upon the top of ida such were the fictions by which the great masters of the earlier ages endeavored to inculcate to posterity the importance of a garret which though they had been long obscured by the negligence and ignorance of succeeding times were well enforced by the celebrated symbol of pythagoras  when the wind blows worship its echo this could not but be understood by his disciples as an inviolable injunction to live in a garret which i have found frequently visited by the echo and the wind nor was the tradition wholly obliterated in the age of augustus for tibullus evidently congratulates himself upon his garret not without some allusion to the pythagorean precept quam juvat immites ventos audire cubantem  aut gelidas hybernus aquas cum fuderit auster securum somnos imbre juvante sequi and it is impossible not to discover the fondness of lucretius an earlier writer for a garret in his description of the lofty to wers of serene learning and of the pleasure with which a wise man looks down upon the confused and erratic state of the world moving below him sed nil dulcius est been quam munita tenere edita doctrina sapientum templa serena despicere unde queas alios passimque videre errare atque viam palanteis quaerere vitae   the institution has indeed continued to our own time the garret is still the usual receptacle of the philosopher and poet but this like many ancient customs is perpetuated only by an accidental imitation without knowledge of the original reason for which it was established causa latet res est notissimaconjectures have indeed been advanced concerning these habitations of literature but without much satisfaction to the judicious enquirer some have imagined that the garret is generally chosen by the wits as most easily rented and concluded that no man rejoices in his aereal abode but on the days of payment others suspect that a garret is chiefly convenient as it is remoter than any other part of the house from the outer door which is often observed to be infested by visitants who talk incessantly of beer or linen or a coat and repeat the same sounds every morning and sometimes again in the afternoon without any variation except that they grow daily more importunate and clamorous and raise their voices in time from mournful murmurs to raging vociferations this eternal monotony is always detestable to a man whose chief pleasure is to enlarge his knowledge and vary his ideas others talk of freedom from noise and abstraction from common business or amusements and some yet more visionary tell us that the faculties are enlarged by open prospects and that the fancy is more at liberty when the eye ranges without confinement  these conveniences may perhaps all be found in a well chosen garret but surely they cannot be supposed sufficiently important to have operated unvariably upon different climates distant ages and separate nations of an universal practice there must still be presumed an universal cause which however recondite and abstruse may be perhaps reserved to make me illustrious by its discovery and you by its promulgation  it is universally known that the faculties of the mind are invigorated or weakened by the state of the body and that the body is in a great measure regulated by the various compressions of the ambient element the effects of the air in the production or cure of corporal maladies have been acknowledged from the time of hippocrates but no man has yet sufficiently considered how far it may influence the operations of the genius though every day affords instances of local understanding of wits and reasoners whose faculties are adapted to some single spot and who when they are removed to any other place sink at once into silence and stupidity i have discovered by a long series of observations that invention and elocution suffer great impediments from dense and impure vapors and that the tenuity of a defecated air at a proper distance from the surface of the earth accelerates the fancy and sets at liberty those intellectual powers which were before shackled by too strong attraction and unable to expand themselves under the pressure of a gross atmosphere i have found dullness to quicken into sentiment in a thin either as water though not very hot boils in a receiver partly exhausted and heads in appearance empty have teemed with notions upon rising ground as the flaccid sides of a football would have swelled out into stiffness and extension  for this reason i never think myself qualified to judge decisively of any mans faculties whom i have only known in one degree of elevation but take some opportunity of attending him from the cellar to the garret and try upon him all the various degrees of rarefaction and condensation tension and laxity if he is neither vivacious aloft nor serious below i then consider him as hopeless but as it seldom happens that i do not find the temper to which the texture of his brain is fitted i accommodate him in time with a tube of mercury first marking the point most favorable to his intellects according to rules which i have long studied and which i may perhaps reveal to mankind in a complete treatise of barometrical pneumatology  another cause of the gaiety and sprightliness of the dwellers in garrets is probably the increase of that vertiginous motion with which we are carried round by the diurnal revolution of the earth the power of agitation upon the spirits is well known every man has felt his heart lightened in a rapid vehicle or on a galloping horse and nothing is plainer than that he who towers to the fifth story is whirled through more space by every circumrotation than another that grovels upon the groundfloor the nations between the tropicks are known to be fiery inconstant inventive and fanciful because living at the utmost length of the earths diameter they are carried about with more swiftness than those whom nature has placed nearer to the poles and therefore as it becomes a wise man to struggle with the inconveniences of his country whenever celerity and acuteness are requisite we must actuate our languor by taking a few turns round the center in a garret  if you imagine that i ascribe to air and motion effects which they cannot produce i desire you to consult your own memory and consider whether you have never known a man acquire reputation in his garret which when fortune or a patron had placed him upon the first floor he was unable to maintain and who never recovered his former vigor of understanding till he was restored to his original situation that a garret will make every man a wit i am very far from supposing i know there are some who would continue blockheads even on the summit of the andes or on the pic of teneriffe but let not any man be considered as unimproveable till this potent remedy has been tried for perhaps he was formed to be great only in a garret as the joiner of aretaeus was rational in no other place but his own shop  i think a frequent removal to various distances from the center so necessary to a just estimate of intellectual abilities and consequently of so great use in education that if i hoped that the public could be persuaded to so expensive an experiment i would propose that there should be a cavern dug and a tower erected like those which bacon describes in solomons house for the expansion and concentration of understanding according to the exigence of different employments or constitutions perhaps some that fume away in meditations upon time and space in the tower might compose tables of interest at a certain depth and he that upon level ground stagnates in silence or creeps in narrative might at the height of half a mile ferment into merriment

depreciate those honors for which he himself appears to have panted with restless and importunate solicitude by showing within what narrow limits all that fame and celebrity which man can hope from men is circumscribed  you see says africanus pointing at the earth from the celestial regions that the globe assigned to the residence and habitation of human beings is of small dimensions how then can you obtain from the praise of men any glory worthy of a wish of this little world the inhabited parts are neither numerous nor wide even the spots where men are found are broken by intervening deserts and the nations are so separated as that nothing can be transmitted from one to another with the people of the south by whom the opposite part of the earth is possessed you have no intercourse and by how small a tract do you communicate with the countries of the north the territory which you inhabit is no more than a scanty island enclosed by a small body of water to which you give the name of the great sea and the atlantic ocean and even in this known and frequented continent what hope can you entertain that your renown will pass the stream of ganges or the cliffs of caucasus or by whom will your name be uttered in the extremities of the north or south toward the rising or the setting sun so narrow is the space to which your fame can be propagated and even there how long will it remain  he then proceeds to assign natural causes why fame is not only narrow in its extent but short in its duration he observes the difference between the computation of time in earth and heaven and declares that according to the celestial chronology no human honors can last a single year  such are the objections by which tully has made a show of discouraging the persuit of fame objections which sufficiently discover his tenderness and regard for his darling phantom homer when the plan of his poem made the death of patroclus necessary resolved at least that he should die with honor and therefore brought down against him the patron god of troy and left to hector only the mean task of giving the last blow to an enemy whom a divine hand had disabled from resistance thus tully ennobles fame which he professes to degrade by opposing it to celestial happiness he confines not its extent but by the boundaries of nature nor contracts its duration but by representing it small in the estimation of superior beings he still admits it the highest and noblest of terrestrial objects and alleges little more against it than that it is neither without end nor without limits  what might be the effect of these observations conveyed in ciceronian eloquence to roman understandings cannot be determined but few of those who shall in the present age read my humble version will find themselves much depressed in their hopes or retarded in their designs for i am not inclined to believe that they who among us pass their lives in the cultivating of knowledge or the acquisition of power have very anxiously enquired what opinions prevail on the farther banks of the ganges or have invigorated any effort by the desire of spreading their renown among the clans of caucasus the hopes and fears of modern minds are content to range in a narrower compass a single nation and a few years have generally sufficient amplitude to fill our imagination  a little consideration will indeed teach us that fame has other limits than mountains and oceans and that he who places happiness in the frequent repetition of his name may spend his life in propagating it without any danger of weeping for new worlds or necessity of passing the atlantic sea  the numbers to whom any real and perceptible good or evil can be derived by the greatest power or most active diligence are inconsiderable and where neither benefit nor mischief operate the only motive to the mention or remembrance of others is curiosity a passion which though in some degree universally associated with reason is easily confined overborn or diverted from any particular object  among the lower classes of mankind there will be found very little desire of any other knowledge than what may contribute immediately to the relief of some pressing uneasiness or the attainment of some near advantage the turks are said to hear with wonder a proposal to walk out only that they may walk back and enquire why any man should labor for nothing so those whose condition has always restrained them to the contemplation of their own necessities and who have been accustomed to look forward only to a small distance will scarcely understand why nights and days should be spent in studies which end in new studies and which according to malherbes observation do not tend to lessen the price of bread nor will the trader or manufacturer easily be persuaded that much pleasure can arise from the mere knowledge of actions performed in remote regions or in distant times or that any thing can deserve their enquiry of which  we can only hear the report but which cannot influence our lives by any consequences  the truth is that very few have leisure from indispensable business to employ their thoughts upon narrative or characters and among those to whom fortune has given the liberty of living more by their own choice many create to themselves engagements by the indulgence of some petty ambition the admission of some insatiable desire or the toleration of some predominant passion the man whose whole wish is to accumulate money has no other care than to collect interest to estimate securities and to enquire for mortgages the lover disdains to turn his ear to any other name than that of corinna and the courtier thinks the hour lost which is not spent in promoting his interest and facilitating his advancement the adventures of valor and the discoveries of science will find a cold reception when they are obtruded upon an attention thus busy with its favorite amusement and impatent of interruption or disturbance  but not only such employments as seduce attention by the appearance of dignity or the promise of happiness may restrain the mind from excursion and enquiry curiosity may be equally destroyed by less formidable enemies it may be dissipated in trifles or congealed by indolence the sportsmen and the men of dress have their heads filled with a fox or a horserace a feather or a ball and live in ignorance of every thing beside with as much content as he that heaps up gold or solicits preferment digs the field or beats the anvil and some dream out their days without pleasure or business without joy or sorrow nor ever rouse from their lethargy to hear or think  even of those who have dedicated themselves to knowledge the far greater part have confined their curiosity to a few objects and have very little inclination to promote any fame but that of which their own studies entitle them to partake the naturalist has no desire to know the opinions or conjectures of the philologer the botanist looks upon the astronomer as a being unworthy of his regard the lawyer scarcely hears the name of a physician without contempt and he that is growing great and happy by electrifying a bottle wonders how the world can be engaged by trifling prattle about war or peace  if therefore he that imagines the world filled with his actions and praises shall subduct from the number of his encomiasts all those who are placed below the flight of fame and who hear in the valleys of life no other voice than that of necessity all those who imagine themselves too important to regard him and consider the mention of

and perceive that no man can be venerable or formidable but to a small part of his fellow creatures  that we may not languish in our endeavors after excellence it is necessary that as africanus

human power can bestow  numb     tuesday may        iliacos intra muros peccatur et extra hor to the rambler sir as notwithstanding all that wit or malice or pride or prudence will be able to suggest men and women must at last pass their lives together i have never been able to think those writers friends to human happiness who endeavor to excite in either sex a general contempt or suspicion of the other to persuade them who are entering the world and looking abroad for a suitable associate that all are equally vicious or equally ridiculous that they who trust are certainly betrayed and they who esteem are always disappointed is not to awaken judgment but to inflame temerity without hope there can be no caution those who are convinced that no reason for preference can be found will never harass their thoughts with doubt and deliberation they will resolve since they are doomed to misery that no needless anxiety shall disturb their quiet they will plunge at hazard into the crowd and snatch the first hand that shall be held toward them  that the world is overrun with vice cannot be denied but vice however predominant has not yet gained an unlimited dominion simple and unmingled good is not in our power but we may generally escape a greater evil by suffering a less and therefore those who undertake to initiate the young and ignorant in the knowledge of life should be careful to inculcate the possibility of virtue and happiness and to encourage endeavors by prospects of success  you perhaps do not suspect that these are the sentiments of one who has been subject for many years to all the hardships of antiquated virginity has been long accustomed to the coldness of neglect and the petulance of insult has been mortified in full assemblies by enquiries after forgotten fashions games long disused and wits and beauties of ancient renown has been invited with malicious importunity to the second wedding of many acquaintances has been ridiculed by two generations of coquets in whispers intended to be heard and been long considered by the airy and gay as too venerable for familiarity and too wise for pleasure it is indeed natural for injury to provoke anger and by continual repetition to produce an habitual asperity yet i have hitherto struggled with so much vigilance against my pride and my resentment that i have preserved my temper uncorrupted i have not yet made it any part of my employment to collect sentences against marriage nor am inclined to lessen the number of the few friends whom time has left me by obstructing that happiness which i cannot partake and venting my vexation in censures of the forwardness and indiscretion of girls or the inconstancy tastelesness and perfidy of men  it is indeed not very difficult to bear that condition to which we are not condemned by necessity but induced by observation and choice and therefore i perhaps have never yet felt all the malignity with which a reproach edged with the appellation of old maid swells some of those hearts in which it is infixed i was not condemned in my youth to solitude either by indigence or deformity nor passed the earlier part of life without the flattery of courtship and the joys of triumph i have danced the round of gaiety amidst the murmurs of envy and gratulations of applause been attended from pleasure to pleasure by the great the sprightly and the vain and seen my regard solicited by the obsequiousness of gallantry the gaiety of wit and the timidity of love if therefore i am yet a stranger to nuptial happiness i suffer only the consequences of my own resolves and can look back upon the succession of lovers whose addresses i have rejected without grief and without malice  when my name first began to be inscribed upon glasses i was honored with the amorous professions of the gay venustulus a gentleman who being the only son of a wealthy family had been educated in all the wantonness of expense and softness of effeminacy he was beautiful in his person and easy in his address and therefore soon gained upon my eye at an age when the sight is very little overruled by the understanding he had not any power in himself of gladdening or amusing but supplied his want of conversation by treats and diversions and his chief art of courtship was to fill the mind of his mistress with parties rambles music and shows we were often engaged in short excursions to gardens and seats and i was for a while pleased with the care which venustulus discovered in securing me from any appearance of danger or possibility of mischance he never failed to recommend caution to his coachman or to promise the waterman a reward if he landed us safe and always contrived to return by daylight for fear of robbers this extraordinary solicitude was represented for a time as the effect of his tenderness for me but fear is too strong for continued hypocrisy i soon discovered that venustulus had the cowardice as well as elegance of a female his imagination was perpetually clouded with terrors and he could scarcely refrain from screams and outcries at any accidental surprise he durst not enter a room if a rat was heard behind the wainscoat nor cross a field where the cattle were frisking in the sunshine the least breeze that waved upon the river was a storm and every clamor in the street was a cry of fire i have seen him lose his color when my squirrel had broke his chain and was forced to throw water in his face on the sudden entrance of a black cat compassion once obliged me to drive away with my fan a beetle that kept him in distress and chide off a dog that yelped at his heels to which he would gladly have given up me to facilitate his own escape women naturally expect defense and protection from a lover or a husband and therefore you will not think me culpable in refusing a wretch who would have burdened life with unnecessary fears and flown to me for that succor which it was his duty to have given  my next lover was fungoso the son of a stockjobber whose visits my friends by the importunity of persuasion prevailed upon me to allow fungoso was no very suitable companion for having been bred in a countinghouse he spoke a language unintelligible in any other place he had no desire of any reputation but that of an acute prognosticator of the changes in the funds nor had any means of raising merriment but by telling how somebody was overreached in a bargain by his father he was however a youth of great sobriety and prudence and frequently informed us how carefully he would improve my fortune i was not in haste to conclude the match but was so much awed by my parents that i durst not dismiss him and might perhaps have been doomed for ever to the grosness of pedlary and the jargon of usury had not a fraud been discovered in the settlement which set me free from the persecution of grovelling pride and pecuniary impudence  i was afterward six months without any particular notice but at last became the idol of the glittering flosculus who prescribed the mode of embroidery to all the fops of his time and varied at pleasure the cock of every hat and the sleeve of every coat that appeared in fashionable assemblies flosculus made some impression upon my heart by a compliment which few ladies can hear without emotion he commended my skill in dress my judgment in suiting colors and my art in disposing ornaments but flosculus was too much engaged by his own elegance to be sufficiently attentive to the duties of a lover or to please with varied praise an ear made delicate by riot of adulation he expected to be repaid part of his tribute and staid away three days because i neglected to take notice of a new coat i quickly found that flosculus was rather a rival than an admirer and that we should probably live in a perpetual struggle of emulous finery and spend our lives in stratagems to be first in the fashion  i had soon after the honor at a feast of attracting the eyes of dentatus one of those human beings whose only happiness is to dine dentatus regaled me with foreign varieties told me of measures that he had laid for procuring the best cook in france and entertained me with bills of fare prescribed the arrangement of dishes and taught me two sawces invented by himself at length such is the uncertainty of human happiness i declared my opinion too hastily upon a pie made under his own direction after which he grew so cold and negligent that he was easily dismissed  many other lovers or pretended lovers i have had the honor to lead a while in triumph but two of them i drove from me by discovering that they had no taste or knowledge in music three i dismissed because they were drunkards two because they paid their addresses at the same time to other ladies and six because they attempted to influence my choice by bribing my maid two more i discarded at the second visit for obscene allusions and five for drollery on religion in the latter part of my reign i sentenced two to perpetual exile for offering me settlements by which the children of a former marriage would have been injured four for representing falsely the value of their estates three for concealing their debts and one for raising the rent of a decrepit tenant  i have now sent you a narrative which the ladies may oppose to the tale of hymenaeus i mean not to depreciate the sex which has produced poets and philosophers heroes and martyrs but will not suffer the rising generation of beauties to be dejected by partial satire or to imagine that those who censure them have not likewise their follies and their vices i do not yet believe happiness unattainable in marriage though i have never yet been able to find a man with whom i could prudently venture an inseparable union it is necessary to expose faults that their deformity may be seen but the reproach ought not to be extended beyond the crime nor either sex to be condemned because some women or men are indelicate or dishonest  i am etc

with all the commodities of the remotest nations every rarity of nature every curiosity of art whatever was valuable whatever was useful hasted to his hand the streets were crowded with his carriages the sea was covered with his ships the streams of oxus were wearied with conveyance and every breeze of the sky wasted wealth to nouradin  at length nouradin felt himself seized with a slow malady which he first endeavored to divert by application and afterward to relieve by luxury and indulgence but finding his strength every day less he was at last terrified and called for help upon the sages of physic they filled his apartments with alexipharmicks restoratives and essential virtues the pearls of the ocean were dissolved the spices of arabia were distilled and all the powers of nature were employed to give new spirits to his nerves and new balsam to his blood nouradin was for some time amused with promises invigorated with cordials or soothed with anodynes but the disease preyed upon his vitals and he soon discovered with indignation that health was not to be bought he was confined to his chamber deserted by his physicians and rarely visited by his friends but his unwillingness to die flattered him long with hopes of life  at length having passed the night in tedious languor he called to him almamoulin his only son and dismissing his attendants my son says he behold here the weakness and fragility of man look backward a few days thy father was great and happy fresh as the vernal rose and strong as the cedar of the mountain the nations of asia drank his dews and art and commerce delighted in his shade malevolence beheld me and sighed his root she cried is fixed in the depths it is watered by the fountains of oxus it sends out branches afar and bids defiance to the blast prudence reclines against his trunk and prosperity dances on his top now almamoulin look upon me withering and prostrate look upon me and attend i have trafficked i have prospered i have rioted in gain my house is splendid my servants are numerous yet i displayed only a small part of my riches the rest which i was hindered from enjoying by the fear of raising envy or tempting rapacity i have piled in towers i have buried in caverns i have hidden in secret repositories which this scroll will discover my purpose was after ten months more spent in commerce to have withdrawn my wealth to a safer country to have given seven years to delight and festivity and the remaining part of my days to solitude and repentance but the hand of death is upon me a frigorifick torpor encroaches upon my veins i am now leaving the produce of my toil which it must be thy business to enjoy with wisdom the thought of leaving his wealth filled nouradin with such grief that he fell into convulsions became delirious and expired  almamoulin who loved his father was touched a while with honest sorrow and sat two hours in profound meditation without perusing the paper which he held in his hand he then retired to his own chamber as overborn with affliction and there read the inventory of his new possessions which swelled his heart with such transports that he no longer lamented his fathers death he was now sufficiently composed to order a funeral of modest magnificence suitable at once to the rank of nouradins profession and the reputation of his wealth the two next nights he spent in visiting the tower and the caverns and found the treasures greater to his eye than to his imagination  almamoulin had been bred to the practice of exact frugality and had often looked with envy on the finery and expenses of other young men he therefore believed that happiness was now in his power since he could obtain all of which he had hitherto been accustomed to regret the want he resolved to give a loose to his desires to revel in enjoyment and feel pain or uneasiness no more  he immediately procured a splendid equipage dressed his servants in rich embroidery and covered his horses with golden caparisons he showered down silver on the populace and suffered their acclamations to swell him with insolence the nobles saw him with anger the wise men of the state combined against him the leaders of armies threatened his destruction almamoulin was informed of his danger he put on the robe of mourning in the presence of his enemies and appeased them with gold and gems and supplication  he then sought to strengthen himself by an alliance with the princes of tartary and offered the price of kingdoms for a wife of noble birth his suit was generally rejected and his presents refused but a princess of astracan once condescended to admit him to her presence she received him sitting on a throne attired in the robe of royalty and shining with the jewels of golconda command sparkled in her eyes and dignity towered on her forehead almamoulin approached and trembled she saw his confusion and disdained him how says she dares the wretch hope my obedience who thus shrinks at my glance retire and enjoy thy riches in forbid ostentation thou wast born to be wealthy but never can be great  he then contracted his desires to more private and domestic pleasures he built palaces he laid out gardens he changed the face of the land he transplanted forests he levelled mountains opened prospects into distant regions poured fountains from the tops of turrets and rolled rivers through new channels  these amusements pleased him for a time but languor and weariness soon invaded him his bowers lost their fragrance and the waters murmured without notice he purchased large tracts of land in distant provinces adorned them with houses of pleasure and diversified them with accommodations for different seasons change of place at first relieved his satiety but all the novelties of situation were soon exhausted he found his heart vacant and his desires for want of external objects ravaging himself  he therefore returned to samarcand and set open his doors to those whom idleness sends out in search of pleasure his tables were always covered with delicacies wines of every vintage sparkled in his bowls and his lamps scattered perfumes the sound of the lute and the voice of the singer chased away sadness every hour was crowded with pleasure and the day ended and began with feasts and dances and revelry and merriment almamoulin cried out i have at last found the use of riches i am surrounded by companions who view my greatness without envy and i enjoy at once the raptures of popularity and the safety of an obscure station what trouble can he feel whom all are studious to please that they may be repaid with pleasure what danger can he dread to whom every man is a friend  such were the thoughts of almamoulin as he looked down from a gallery upon the gay assembly regaling at his expense but in the midst of this soliloquy an officer of justice entered the house and in the form of legal citation summoned almamoulin to appear before the emperor the guests stood a while aghast then stole imperceptible away and he was led off without a single voice to witness his integrity he now found one of his most frequent visitants accusing him of treason in hopes of sharing his confiscation yet unpatronized and unsupported he cleared himself by the openness of innocence and the consistence of truth he was dismissed with honor and his accuser perished in prison  almamoulin now perceived with how little reason he had hoped for justice or fidelity from those who live only to gratify their senses and being now weary with vain experiments upon life and fruitless searches after felicity he had recourse to a sage who after spending his youth in travel and observation had retired from all human cares to a small habitation on the banks of oxus where he conversed only with such as solicited his counsel brother said the philosopher thou have suffered thy reason to be deluded by idle hopes and fallacious appearances having long looked with desire upon riches thou had taught thyself to think them more valuable than nature designed them and to expect from them what experience has now taught thee that they cannot give that they do not confer wisdom thou may be convinced by considering at how dear a price they tempted thee upon thy first entrance into the world to purchase the empty sound of vulgar acclamation that they cannot bestow fortitude or magnanimity that man may be certain who stood trembling at astracan before a being not naturally superior to himself that they will not supply unexhausted pleasure the recollection of forsaken palaces and neglected gardens will easily inform thee that they rarely purchase friends thou did soon discover when thou were left to stand thy trial uncountenanced and alone yet think not riches useless there are purposes to which a wise man may be delighted to apply them they may by a rational distribution to those who want them ease the pains of helpless disease still the throbs of restless anxiety relieve innocence from oppression and raise imbecility to cheerfulness and vigor this they will enable thee to perform and this will afford the only happiness ordained for our present state the confidence of divine favor and the hope of future rewards  numb     tuesday may         o imitatores servum pecus hor i have been informed by a letter from one of the universities that among the youth from whom the next swarm of reasoners is to learn philosophy and the next flight of beauties to hear elegies and sonnets there are many who instead of endeavoring by books and meditation to form their own opinions content themselves with the secondary knowledge which a convenient bench in a coffeehouse can supply and without any examination or distinction adopt the criticisms and remarks which happen to drop from those who have risen by merit or fortune to reputation and authority  these humble retailers of knowledge my correspondent stigmatizes with the name of echoes and seems desirous that they should be made ashamed of lazy submission and animated to attempts after new discoveries and original sentiments  it is very natural for young men to be vehement acrimonious and severe for as they seldom comprehend at once all the consequences of a position or perceive the difficulties by which cooler and more experienced reasoners are restrained from confidence they form their conclusions with great precipitance as they see nothing that can darken or embarrass the question they expect to find their own opinion universally prevalent and are inclined to impute uncertainty and hesitation to want of honesty rather than of knowledge i may perhaps therefore be reproached by my lively correspondent when it shall be found that i have no inclination to persecute these collectors of fortuitous knowledge with the severity required yet as i am now too old to be much terrified or pained by hasty censure i shall not be afraid of taking into protection those whom i think condemned without a sufficient knowledge of their cause  he that adopts the sentiments of another whom he has reason to believe wiser than himself is only to be blamed when he claims the honors which are not due but to the author and endeavors to deceive the world into praise and veneration for to learn is the proper business of youth and whether we increase our knowledge by books or by conversation we are equally indebted to foreign assistance  the greater part of students are not born with abilities to construct systems or advance knowledge nor can have any hope beyond that of becoming intelligent hearers in the schools of art of being able to comprehend what others discover and to remember what others teach even those to whom providence has allotted greater strength of understanding can expect only to improve a single science in every other part of learning they must be content to follow opinions which they are not able to examine and even in that which they claim as peculiarly their own can seldom add more than some small particle of knowledge to the hereditary stock devolved to them from ancient times the collective labor of a thousand intellects  in science which being fixed and limited admits of no other variety than such as arises from new methods of distribution or new arts of illustration the necessity of following the traces of our predecessors is indisputably evident but there appears no reason why imagination should be subject to the same restraint it might be conceived that of those who profess to forsake the narrow paths of truth every one may deviate toward a different point since though rectitude is uniform and fixed obliquity may be infinitely diversified the fields of science are narrow so that they who travel them must either follow or meet one another but in the boundless regions of possibility which fiction claims for her dominion there are surely a thousand recesses unexplored a thousand flowers unplucked a thousand fountains unexhausted combinations of imagery yet unobserved and races of ideal inhabitants not hitherto described  yet whatever hope may persuade or reason evince experience can boast of very few additions to ancient fable the wars of troy and the travels of ulysses have furnished almost all succeeding poets with incidents characters and sentiments the romans are confessed to have attempted little more than to display in their own tongue the inventions of the greeks there is in all their writings such a perpetual recurrence of allusions to the tales of the fabulous age that they must be confessed often to want that power of giving pleasure which novelty supplies nor can we wonder that they excelled so much in the graces of diction when we consider how rarely they were employed in search of new thoughts  the warmest admirers of the great mantuan poet can extol him for little more than the skill with which he has by making his hero both a traveller and a warrior united the beauties of the iliad and odyssey in one composition yet his judgment was perhaps sometimes overborn by his avarice of the homeric treasures and for fear of suffering a sparkling ornament to be lost he has inserted it where it cannot shine with its original splendour  when ulysses visited the infernal regions he found that among the heroes that perished at troy his competitor ajax who when the arms of achilles were adjudged to ulysses died by his own hand in the madness of disappointment he still appeared to resent as on earth his loss and disgrace ulysses endeavored to pacify him with praises and submission but ajax walked away without reply this passage has always been considered as eminently beautiful because ajax the haughty chief the unlettered soldier of unshaken courage of immovable constancy but without the power of recommending his own virtues by eloquence or enforcing his assertions by any other argument than the sword had no way of making his anger known but by gloomy sullenness and dumb ferocity his hatred of a man whom he conceived to have defeated him only by volubility of tongue was therefore naturally shown by silence more contemptuous and piercing than any words that so rude an orator could have found and by which he gave his enemy no opportunity of exerting the only power in which he was superior  when aeneas is sent by virgil to visit the shades he meets with dido the queen of carthage whom his perfidy had hurried to the grave he accosts her with tenderness and excuses but the lady turns away like ajax in mute disdain she turns away like ajax but she resembles him in none of those qualities which give either dignity or propriety to silence she might without any departure from the tenor of her conduct have burst out like other injured women into clamor reproach and denunciation but virgil had his imagination full of ajax and therefore could not prevail on himself to teach dido any other mode of resentment  if virgil could be thus seduced by imitation there will be little hope that common wits should escape and accordingly we find that besides the universal and acknowledged practice of copying the ancients there has prevailed in every age a particular species of fiction at one time all truth was conveyed in allegory at another nothing was seen but in a vision at one period all the poets followed sheep and every event produced a pastoral at another they busied themselves wholly in giving directions to a painter  it is indeed easy to conceive why any fashion should become popular by which idleness is favored and imbecility assisted but surely no man of genius can much applaud himself for repeating a tale with which the audience is already tired and which could bring no honor to any but its inventor  there are i think two schemes of writing on which the laborious wits of the present time employ their faculties one is the adaptation of sense to all the rhymes which our language can supply to some word that makes the burden of the stanza but this as it has been only used in a kind of amorous burlesque can scarcely be censured with much acrimony the other is the imitation of spenser which by the influence of some men of learning and genius seems likely to gain upon the age and therefore deserves to be more attentively considered  to imitate the fictions and sentiments of spenser can incur no reproach for allegory is perhaps one of the most pleasing vehicles of instruction but i am very far from extending the same respect to his diction or his stanza his style was in his own time allowed to be vicious so darkened with old words and peculiarities of phrase and so remote from common use that johnson boldly pronounces him to have written no language his stanza is at once difficult and unpleasing tiresome to the ear by its uniformity and to the attention by its length it was at first formed in imitation of the italian poets without due regard to the genius of our language the italians have so little variety of termination that they were forced to contrive such a stanza as might admit the greatest number of similar rhymes but our words end with so much diversity that it is seldom convenient for us to bring more than two of the same sound together if it be justly observed by milton that rhyme obliges poets to express their thoughts in improper terms these improprieties must always be multiplied as the difficulty of rhyme is increased by long concatenations  the imitators of spenser are indeed not very rigid censors of themselves for they seem to conclude that when they have disfigured their lines with a few obsolete syllables they have accomplished their design without considering that they ought not only to admit words but to avoid new the laws of imitation are broken by every word introduced since the time of spenser as the character of hector is violated by quoting aristotle in the play it would indeed be difficult to exclude from a long poem all modern phrases though it is easy to sprinkle it with gleanings of antiquity perhaps however the style of spenser might by long labor be justly copied but life is surely given us for higher purposes than to gather what our ancestors have wisely thrown away and to learn what is of no value but because it has been forgotten  numb     saturday may         nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos ducit ovid nothing is more subject to mistake and disappointment than anticipated judgment concerning the easiness or difficulty of any undertaking whether we form our opinion from the performances of others or from abstracted contemplation of the thing to be attempted  whatever is done skilfully appears to be done with ease and art when it is once matured to habit vanishes from observation we are therefore more powerfully excited to emulation by those who have attained the highest degree of excellence and whom we can therefore with least reason hope to equal  in adjusting the probability of success by a previous consideration of the undertaking we are equally in danger of deceiving ourselves it is never easy nor often possible to comprise the series of any process with all its circumstances incidents and variations in a speculative scheme experience soon shows us the tortuosities of imaginary rectitude the complications of simplicity and the asperities of smoothness sudden difficulties often start up from the ambushes of art stop the career of activity repress the gaiety of confidence and when we imagine ourselves almost at the end of our labors drive us back to new plans and different measures  there are many things which we every day see others unable to perform and perhaps have even ourselves miscarried in attempting and yet can hardly allow to be difficult nor can we forbear to wonder afresh at every new failure or to promise certainty of success to our next essay but when we try the same hindrances recur the same inability is perceived and the vexation of disappointment must again be suffered  of the various kinds of speaking or writing which serve necessity or promote pleasure none appears so artless or easy as simple narration for what should make him that knows the whole order and progress of an affair unable to relate it yet we hourly find such as endeavor to entertain or instruct us by recitals clouding the facts which they intend to illustrate and losing themselves and their auditors in wilds and mazes in digression and confusion when we have congratulated ourselves upon a new opportunity of enquiry and new means of information it often happens that without designing either deceit or concealment without ignorance of the fact or unwillingness to disclose it the relator fills the ear with empty sounds harasses the attention with fruitless impatience and disturbs the imagination by a tumult of events without order of time or train of consequence  it is natural to believe upon the same principle that no writer has a more easy task than the historian the philosopher has the works of omniscience to examine and is therefore engaged in disquisitions to which finite intellects are utterly unequal the poet trusts to his invention and is not only in danger of those inconsistencies to which every one is exposed by departure from truth but may be censured as well for deficicencies of matter as for irregularity of disposition or impropriety of ornament but the happy historian has no other labor than of gathering what tradition pours down before him or records treasure for his use he has only the actions and designs of men like himself to conceive and to relate he is not to form but copy characters and therefore is not blamed for the inconsistency of statesmen the injustice of tyrants or the cowardice of commanders the difficulty of making variety consistent or uniting probability with surprise needs not to distrub him the manners and actions of his personages are already fixed his materials are provided and put into his hands and he is at leisure to employ all his powers in arranging and displaying them  yet even with these advantages very few in any age have been able to raise themselves to reputation by writing histories and among the innumerable authors who fill every nation with accounts of their ancestors or undertake to ttansmit to futurity the events of their own time the greater part when fashion and novelty have ceased to recommend them are of no other use than chronological memorials which necessity may sometimes require to be consulted but which fright away curiosity and disgust delicacy  it has been observed that our nation which has produced so many authors eminent for almost every other species of literary excellence has been hitherto remarkably barren of historical genius and so far has this defect raised prejudices against us that some have doubted whether an englishman can stop at that mediocrity of style or confine his mind to that even tenor of imagination which narrative requires  they who can believe that nature has so capriciously distributed understanding have surely no claim to the honor of serious consutation the inhabitants of the same country have opposite characters in different ages the prevalence or neglect of any particular study can proceed only from the accidental influence of some temporary cause and if we have failed in history we can have failed only because history has not hitherto been diligently cultivated  but how is it evident that we have not historians among us whom we may venture to place in comparison with any that the neighboring nations can produce the attempt of raleigh is deservedly celebrated for the labor of his researches and the elegance of his style but he has endeavored to exert his judgment more than his genius to select facts rather than adorn them and has produced an historical dissertation but seldom risen to the majesty of history  the work of clarendon deserves more regard his diction is indeed neither exact in itself nor suited to the purpose of history it is the effusion of a mind crowded with ideas and desirous of imparting them and therefore always accumulating words and involving one clause and sentence in another but there is dignity in his negligence a rude inartificial majesty which without the nicety of labored elegance swells the mind by its plenitude and diffusion his narration is not perhaps sufficiently rapid being stopped too frequently by particularities which though they might strike the author who was present at the transactions will not equally detain the attention of posterity but his ignorance or carelessness of the art of writing are amply compensated by his knowledge of nature and of policy the wisdom of his maxims the justness of his reasonings and the variety distinctness and strength of his characters  but none of our writers can in my opinion justly contest the superiority of knolles who in his history of the turks has displayed all the excellencies that narration can admit his style though somewhat obscured by time and sometimes vitiated by false wit is pure nervous elevated and clear a wonderful multiplicity of events is so artfully arranged and so distinctly explained that each facilitates the knowledge of the next whenever a new personage is introduced the reader is prepared by his character for his actions when a nation is first attacked or city besieged he is made acquainted with its history or situation so that a great part of the world is brought under his view the descriptions of this author are without minuteness and the digressions without ostentation collateral events are so artfully woven into the contexture of his principal story that they cannot be disjoined without leaving it lacerated and broken there is nothing turgid in his dignity nor superfluous in his copiousness his orations only which he feigns like the ancient historians to have been pronounced on remarkable occasions are tedious and languid and since they are merely the voluntary sports of imagination prove how much the most judicious and skilful may be mistaken in the estimate of their own powers  nothing could have sunk this author in obscurity but the remoteness and barbarity of the people whose story he relates it seldom happens that all circumstances concur to happiness or fame the nation which produced this great historian has the grief of seeing his genius employed upon a foreign and uninteresting subject and that writer who might have secured perpetuity to his name by a history of his own country has exposed himself to the danger of oblivion by recounting enterprises and revolutions of which none desire to be informed  numb     tuesday may         quo semel est imbuta recens servabit cdorem testa diu hor to the rambler sir though

difficulties at my first reentrance into the world for my haste to be a gentleman inclined me to precipitate measures and every accident that forced me back toward my old station was considered by me as an obstruction of my happiness  it was no common grief and indignation that i found my former companions still daring to claim my notice and the journeymen and apprentices sometimes pulling me by

histories of the girls in the neighborhood i had always in my officinal state been kept in awe by lace and embroidery and imagined that to fright away these unwelcome familiarities nothing was

therefore issued forth in my new coat with a resolution of dazzling intimacy to a fitter distance and pleased myself with the timidity and reverence which i should impress upon all who had hitherto presumed to harass me with their freedoms but whatever was the cause i did not find myself received with any new degree of respect those whom i intended to drive from me ventured to advance with their usual phrases of benevolence and those whose acquaintance i solicited grew more supercilious and reserved i began soon to repent the expense by which i had procured no advantage and to suspect that a shining dress like a weighty weapon has no force in itself but owes all its efficacy to him that wears it  many were the mortifications and calamities which i was condemned to suffer in my initiation to politeness i was so much tortured by the incessant civilities of my companions that i never passed through that region of the city but in a chair with the curtains drawn and at last left my lodgings and fixed myself in the verge of the court here i endeavored to be thought a gentleman just returned from his travels and was pleased to have my landlord believe that i was in some danger from importunate creditors but this scheme was quickly defeated by a formal deputation sent to offer me though i had now retired from business the freedom of my company  i was now detected in trade and therefore resolved to stay no longer i hired another apartment and changed my servants here i lived very happily for three months and with secret satisfaction often overheard the family celebrating the greatness and felicity of the esquire though the conversation seldom ended without some complaint of my covetousness or some remark upon my language or my gait i now began to venture into the public walks and to know the faces of nobles and beauties but could not observe without wonder as i passed by them how frequently they were talking of a tailor i longed however to be admitted to conversation and was somewhat weary of walking in crowds without a companion yet continued to come and go with the rest till a lady whom i endeavored to protect in a crowded passage as she was about to step into her chariot thanked me for my civility and told me that as she had often distinguished me for my modest and respectful behavior whenever i set up for myself i might expect to see her among my first customers  here was an end of all my ambulatory projects i indeed sometimes entered the walks again but was always blasted by this destructive lady whose mischievous generosity recommended me to her acquaintance being therefore forced to practice my adscititious character upon another stage i betook myself to a coffeehouse frequented by wits among whom i learned in a short time the cant of criticism and talked so loudly and volubly of nature and manners and sentiment and diction and similies and contrasts and action and pronunciation that i was often desired to lead the hiss and clap and was feared and hated by the players and the poets many a sentence have i hissed which i did not understand and many a groan have i uttered when the ladies were weeping in the boxes at last a malignant author whose performance i had persecuted through the nine nights wrote an epigram upon tape the critic which drove me from the pit for ever  my desire to be a fine gentleman still continued i therefore after a short suspense chose a new set of friends at the gaming table and was for some time pleased with the civility and openness with which i found myself treated i was indeed obliged to play but being naturally timorous and vigilant was never surprised into large sums what might have been the consequence of long familiarity with these plunderers i had not an opportunity of knowing for one night the constables entered and seized us and i was once more compelled to sink into my former condition by sending for my old master to attest my character  when i was deliberating to what new qualifications i should aspire i was summoned into the country by an account of my fathers death here i had hopes of being able to distinguish myself and to support the honor of my family i therefore bought guns and horses and contrary to the expectation of the tenants increased the salary of the huntsman but when i entered the field it was soon discovered that i was not destined to the glories of the chase i was afraid of thorns in the thicket and of dirt in the marsh i shivered on the brink of a river while the sportsmen crossed it and trembled at the sight of a fivebar gate when the sport and danger were over i was still equally disconcerted for i was effeminate though not delicate and could only join a feebly whispering voice in the clamours of their triumph  a fall by which my ribs were broken soon recalled me to domestic pleasures and i exerted all my art to obtain the favor of the neighboring ladies but wherever i came there was always some unlucky conversation upon ribbands fillets pins or thread which drove all my stock of compliments out of my memory and overwhelmed me with shame and dejection  thus i passed the ten first years after the death of my brother in which i have learned at last to repress that ambition which i could never gratify and instead of wasting more of my life in vain endeavors after accomplishments which if not early acquired no endeavors can obtain i shall confine my care to those higher excellencies which are in every mans power and though i cannot enchant affection by elegance and ease hope to secure esteem by honesty

theaters are shut and the cardtables forsaken the regions of luxury are for a while unpeopled and pleasure leads out her votaries to groves and gardens to still scenes and erratick gratifications those who have passed many months in a continual tumult of diversion who have never opened their eyes in the morning but upon some new appointment nor slept at night without a dream of dances music and good hands or of soft sighs languishing looks and humble supplications must now retire to distant provinces where the sirens of flattery are scarcely to be heard where beauty sparkles without praise or envy and wit is repeated only by the echo  as i think it one of the most important duties of social benevolence to give warning of the approach of calamity when by timely prevention it may be turned aside or by preparatory measures be more easily endured i cannot feel the increasing warmth or observe the lengthening days without considering the condition of my fair readers who are now preparing to leave all that has so long filled up their hours all from which they have been accustomed to hope for delight and who till fashion proclaims the liberty of returning to the seats of mirth and elegance must endure the rugged squire the sober housewife the loud huntsman or the formal parson the roar of obstreperous jollity or the dullness of prudential instruction without any retreat but to the gloom of solitude where they will yet find greater inconveniences and must learn however unwillingly to endure themselves  in winter the life of the polite and gay may be said to roll on with a strong and rapid current they float along from pleasure to pleasure without the trouble of regulating their own motions and pursue the course of the stream in all the felicity of inattention content that they find themselves in progression and careless whither they are going but the months of summer are a kind of sleeping stagnation without wind or tide where they are left to force themselves forward by their own labor and to direct their passage by their own skill and where if they have not some internal principle of activity they must be stranded upon shallows or lie torpid in a perpetual calm  there are indeed some to whom this universal dissolution of gay societies affords a welcome opportunity of quitting without disgrace the post which they have found themselves unable to maintain and of seeming to retreat only at the call of nature from assemblies where after a short triumph of uncontested superiority they are overpowered by some new intruder of softer elegance or sprightlier vivacity by these hopeless of victory and yet ashamed to confess a conquest the summer is regarded as a release from the fatiguing service of celebrity a dismission to more certain joys and a safer empire they now solace themselves with the influence which they shall obtain where they have no rival to fear and with the luster which they shall effuse when nothing can be seen of brighter splendor they image while they are preparing for their journey the admiration with which the rusticks will crowd about them plan the laws of a new assembly or contrive to delude provincial ignorance with a fictitious mode a thousand pleasing expectations swarm in the fancy and all the approaching weeks are filled with distinctions honors and authority  but others who have lately entered the world or have yet had no proofs of its inconstancy and desertion are cut off by this cruel interruption from the enjoyment of their prerogatives and doomed to lose four months in unactive obscurity many complaints do vexation and desire extort from these exiled tyrants of the town against the inexorable sun who persues his course without any regard to love or beauty and visits either tropic at the stated time whether shunned or courted deprecated or implored  to them who leave the places of public resort in the full bloom of reputation and withdraw from admiration courtship submission and applause a rural triumph can give nothing equivalent the praise of ignorance and the subjection of weakness are little regarded by beauties who have been accustomed to more important conquests and more valuable panegyricks nor indeed should the powers which have made havoc in the theaters or borne down rivalry in courts be degraded to a mean attack upon the untravelled heir or ignoble contest with the ruddy milkmaid  how then must four long months be worn away four months in which there will be no routes no shows no ridottos in which visits must be regulated by the weather and assemblies will depend upon the moon the platonists imagine that the future punishment of those who have in this life debased their reason by subjection to their senses and have preferred the gross gratifications of lewdness and luxury to the pure and sublime felicity of virtue and contemplation will arise from the predominance and solicitations of the same appetites in a state which can furnish no means of appeasing them i cannot but suspect that this month bright with sunshine and fragrant with perfumes this month which covers the meadow with verdure and decks the gardens with all the mixtures of colorifick radiance this month from which the man of fancy expects new infusions of imagery and the naturalist new scenes of observation this month will chain down multitudes to the platonic penance of desire without enjoyment and hurry them from the highest satisfactions which they have yet learned to conceive into a state of hopeless wishes and pining recollection where the eye of vanity will look round for admiration to no purpose and the hand of avarice shuffle cards in a bower with ineffectual dexterity  from the tediousness of this melancholy suspension of life i would willingly preserve those who are exposed to it only by inexperience who want not inclination to wisdom or virtue though they have been dissipated by negligence or misled by example and who would gladly find the way to rational happiness though it should be necessary to struggle with habit and abandon fashion to these many arts of spending time might be recommended which would neither sadden the present hour with weariness nor the future with repentance  it would seem impossible to a solitary speculatist that a human being can want employment to be born in ignorance with a capacity of knowledge and to be placed in the midst of a world filled with variety perpetually pressing upon the senses and irritating curiosity is surely a sufficient security against the languishment of inattention novelty is indeed necessary to preserve eagerness and alacrity but art and nature have stores inexhaustible by human intellects and every moment produces something new to him who has quickened his faculties by diligent observation  some studies for which the country and the summer afford peculiar opportunities i shall perhaps endeavor to recommend in a future essay but if there be any apprehension not apt to admit unaccustomed ideas or any attention so stubborn and inflexible as not easily to comply with new directions even these obstructions cannot exclude the pleasure of application for there is a higher and nobler employment to which all faculties are adapted by him who gave them the duties of religion sincerely and regularly performed will always be sufficient to exalt the meanest and to exercise the highest understanding that mind will never be vacant which is frequently recalled by stated duties to meditations on eternal interests nor can any hour be long

one of the maxims of the civil law that definitions are hazardous things modified by human understandings subject to varieties of complication and changeable as experience advances knowledge or accident influences caprice are scarcely to be included in any standing form of expression because they are always suffering some alteration of their state definition is indeed not the province of man every thing is set above or below our faculties the works and operations of nature are too great in their extent or too much diffused in their relations and the performances of art too inconstant and uncertain to be reduced to any determinate idea it is impossible to impress upon our minds an adequate and just representation of an object so great that we can never take it into our view or so mutable that it is always changing under our eye and has already lost its form while we are laboring to conceive it  definitions have been no less difficult or uncertain in criticism than in law imagination a licentious and vagrant faculty unsusceptible of limitations and impatient of restraint has always endeavored to baffle the logician to perplex the consines of distinction and burst the enclosures of regularity there is therefore scarcely any species of writing of which we can tell what is its essence and what are its constituents every new genius produces some innovation which when invented and approved subverts the rules which the practice of foregoing authors had established  comedy has been particularly unpropitious to definers for though perhaps they might properly have contented themselves with declaring it to be such a dramatic representation of human life as may excite mirth they have embarrassed their definition with the means by which the comic writers attain their end without considering that the various methods of exhilarating their audience not being limited by nature cannot be comprised in precept thus some make comedy a representation of mean and others of bad men some think that its essence consists in the unimportance others in the fictitiousness of the transaction but any mans reflections will inform him that every dramatic composition which raises mirth is comic and that to raise mirth it is by no means universally necessary that the personages should be either mean or corrupt nor always requisite that the action should be trivial nor ever that it should be fictitious  if the two kinds of dramatick poetry had been defined only by their effects upon the mind some absurdities might have been prevented with which the compositions of our greatest poets are disgraced who for want of some settled ideas and accurate distinctions have unhappily confounded tragic with comic sentiments they seem to have thought that as the meanness of personages constituted comedy their greatness was sufficient to form a tragedy and that nothing was necessary to dignity and seriousness but that they should crowd the scene with monarchs and generals and guards and make them talk at certain intervals of the downfall of kingdoms and the rout of armies they have not considered that thoughts or incidents in themselves ridiculous grow still more grotesque by the solemnity of such characters that reason and nature are uniform and inflexible and that what is despicable and absurd will not by any association with splendid titles become rational or great that the most important affairs by an intermixture of an unseasonable levity may be made contemptible and that the robes of royalty can give no protection to nonsense or to folly  comedy says horace sometimes raises her voice and tragedy may likewise on proper occasions abate her dignity but as the comic personages can only depart from their familiarity of style when the more violent passions are put in motion the heroes and queens of tragedy should never descend to trifle but in the hours of ease and intermissions of danger yet in the tragedy of don sebastian when the king of portugal is in the hands of his enemy and having just drawn the lot by which he is condemned to die breaks out into a wild boast that his dust shall take possession of africa the dialogue proceeds thus between the captive and his conqueror muley moluch what shall i do to conquer thee   seb impossible souls know no conquerors  m mol i will show thee for a monster through my africa   seb

the contemptible subjection of the lover the folly of obliging him to read the letter only because it ought to have been concealed from him the frequent interruptions of amorous impatience the faint expostulations of a voluntary slave the imperious haughtiness of a tyrant without power the deep reflection of the yielding rebel upon fate and free will and his wise wish to lose his reason as soon as he finds himself about to do what he cannot persuade his reason to approve are surely sufficient to awaken the most torpid risibility  there is scarce a tragedy of the last century which has not debased its most important incidents and polluted its most serious interlocutions with buffoonry and meanness but though perhaps it cannot be pretended that the present age has added much to the force and efficacy of the drama it has at least been able to escape many faults which either ignorance had overlooked or indulgence had licensed the later tragedies indeed have faults of another kind perhaps more destructive to delight though less open to censure that perpetual tumor of phrase with which every thought is now expressed by every personage the paucity of adventures which regularity admits and the unvaried equality of flowing dialogue has taken away from our present writers almost all that dominion over the passions which was the boast of their predecessors yet they may at least claim this commendation that they avoid gross faults and that if they cannot often move terror or pity they are always careful not to provoke laughter  numb     saturday june         nihil est aliud magnum quam multa minuta vet auct to the rambler sir among other topics of conversation which your papers supply i was lately engaged in a discussion of the character given by tranquilla of her lover venustulus whom notwithstanding the severity of his mistress the greater number seemed inclined to acquit of unmanly or culpable timidity  one of the company remarked that prudence ought to be distinguished from fear and that if venustulus was afraid of nocturnal adventures no man who considered how much every avenue of the town was infested with robbers could think him blameable for why should life be hazarded without prospect of honor or advantage another was of opinion that a brave man might be afraid of crossing the river in the calmest weather and declared that for his part while there were coaches and a bridge he would never be seen tottering in a wooden case out of which he might be thrown by any irregular agitation or which might be overset by accident or negligence or by the force of a sudden gust or the rush of a larger vessel it was his custom he said to keep the security of daylight and dry ground for it was a maxim with him that no wise man ever perished by water or was lost in the dark  the next was humbly of opinion that if tranquilla had seen like him the cattle run roaring about the meadows in the hot months she would not have thought meanly of her lover for not venturing his safety among them his neighbor then told us that for his part he was not ashamed to confess that he could not see a rat though it was dead without palpitation that he had been driven six times out of his lodging either by rats or mice and that he always had a bed in the closet for his servants whom he called up whenever the enemy was in motion another wondered that any man should think himself disgraced by a precipitate retreat from a dog for there was always a possibility that a dog might be mad and that surely though there was no danger but of being bit by a fierce animal there was more wisdom in flight than contest by all these declarations another was encouraged to confess that if he had been admitted to the honor of paying his addresses to tranquilla he should have been likely to incur the same censure for among all the animals upon which nature has impressed deformity and horror there was none whom he durst not encounter rather than a beetle  thus sir though cowardice is universally defined too close and anxious an attention to personal safety there will be found scarcely any fear however excessive in its degree or unreasonable in its object which will be allowed to characterize a coward fear is a passion which every man feels so frequently predominant in his own breast that he is unwilling to hear it censured with great asperity and perhaps if we confess the truth the same restraint which would hinder a man from declaiming against the frauds of any employment among those who profess it should withold him from treating fear with contempt among human beings  yet since fortitude is one of those virtues which the condition of our nature makes hourly necessary i think you cannot better direct your admonitions than against superfluous and panick terrors fear is indeed implanted in us as a preservative from evil but its duty like that of other passions is not to overbear reason but to assist it nor should it be suffered to tyrannize in the imagination to blind the discernment or obstruct activity to raise phantoms of horror or beset life with supernumerary distresses  to be always afraid of losing life is indeed scarcely to enjoy a life that can deserve the care of preservation he that once indulges idle fears will never be at rest our present state admits only of a kind of negative security we must conclude ourselves safe when we see no danger or none inadequate to our powers of opposition death indeed continually hovers about us but hovers commonly unseen unless we sharpen our sight by useless curiosity  there is always a point at which caution however solicitous must limit its preservatives because one terror often counteracts another i once knew one of the speculatists of cowardice whose reigning disturbance was the dread of housebreakers his enquiries were for nine years employed upon the best method of barring a window or a door and many an hour has he spent in establishing the preference of a bolt to a lock he had at last by the daily superaddition of new expedients contrived a door which could never be forced for one bar was secured by another with such intricacy of subordination that he was himself not always able to disengage them in the proper method he was happy in this fortification till being asked how he would escape if he was threatened by fire he discovered that with all his care and all his expense he had only been assisting his own destruction he then immediately tore off his bolts and now leaves at night his outer door half locked that he may not by his own folly perish in the flames  there is one species of terror which those who are unwilling to suffer the reproach of cowardice have wisely dignified with the name of antipathy a man who talks with intrepidity of the monsters of the wilderness while they are out of sight will readily confess his antipathy to a mole a weasel or a frog he has indeed no dread of harm from an insect or a worm but his antipathy turns him pale whenever they approach him he believes that a boat will transport him with as much safety as his neighbors but he cannot conquer his antipathy to the water thus he goes on without any reproach from his own reflections and every day multiplies antipathies till he becomes contemptible to others and burdensome to himself  it is indeed certain that impressions of dread may sometimes be unluckily made by objects not in themselves justly formidable but when fear is discovered to be groundless it is to be eradicated like other false opinions and antipathies are generally superable by a single effort he that has been taught to shudder at a mouse if he can persuade himself to risque one encounter will find his own superiority and exchange his terrors for the pride of conquest  i am

before you a mode of persecution by which i have been exiled to taverns and coffeehouses and deterred from entering the doors of my friends  among the ladies who please themselves with splendid furniture or elegant entertainment it is a practice if not universal yet every common to ask every guest how he likes the carved work of the cornice or the figures of the tapestry the china at the table or the plate on the sideboard and on all occasions to enquire his opinion of their judgment and their choice melania has laid her new watch in the window nineteen times that she may desire me to look upon it callista has an art of dropping her snuff box by drawing out her handkerchief that when i pick it up i may admire it and fulgentia has conducted me by mistake into the wrong room at every visit i have paid since her picture was put into a new frame  i hope mr rambler you will inform them that no man should be denied the privilege of silence or tortured to false declarations and that though ladies may justly claim to be exempt from rudeness they have no right to force unwilling civilities to please is a laudable and elegant ambition and is properly rewarded with honest praise but to seize applause by violence and call out for commendation without knowing or caring to know whether it be given from conviction is a species of tyranny by which modesty is oppressed and sincerity corrupted the tribute of admiration thus exacted by impudence and importunity differs from the respect paid to silent merit as the plunder of a pirate from the merchants profit  i am sir etc misocolax

endeavoring to discourage them from any laudable persuit but however either he or you may excite our curiosity you have not yet informed us how it may be gratified the world seems to have formed an universal conspiracy against our understandings our questions are supposed not to expect answers our arguments are confuted with a jest and we are treated like beings who transgress the limits of our nature whenever we aspire to seriousness or improvement  i enquired yesterday of a gentleman eminent for astronomical skill what made the day long in summer and short in winter and was told that nature protracted the days in summer lest ladies should want time to walk in the park and the nights in winter lest they should not have hours sufficient to spend at the cardtable  i hope you do not doubt but i heard such information with just contempt and i desire you to discover to this great master of ridicule that i was very far from wanting any intelligence which he could have given me i asked the question with no other intention than to set him free from the necessity of silence and gave him an opportunity of mingling on equal terms with a polite assembly from which however uneasy he

of his age at which they were composed he might design by this information either to boast the early maturity of his genius or to conciliate indulgence to the puerility of his performances but whatever was his intent it is remarked by scaliger that he very little promoted his own reputation because he fell below the promise which his first productions had given and in the latter part of life seldom equalled the sallies of his youth  it is not uncommon for those who at their first entrance into the world were distinguished for eminent seize or superior abilities to disappoint the hopes which they had raised and to end in neglect and obscurity that life which they began in celebrity and honor to the long catalogue of the inconveniences of old age which moral and satirical writers have so copiously displayed may be often added the loss of fame  the advance of the human mind toward any object of laudable persuit may be compared to the progress of a body driven by a blow it moves for a time with great velocity and vigor but the force of the first impulse is perpetually decreasing and though it should encounter no obstacle capable of quelling it by a sudden stop the resistance of the medium through which it passes and the latent inequalities of the smoothest surface will in a short time by continued retardation wholly overpower it some hindrances will be found in every road of life but he that fixes his eyes upon any thing at a distance necessarily loses sight of all that fills up the intermediate space and therefore sets forward with alacrity and confidence nor suspects a thousand obstacles by which he afterward finds his passage embarrassed and obstructed some are indeed stopped at once in their career by a sudden shock of calamity or diverted to a different direction by the cross impulse of some violent passion but far the greater part languish by slow degrees deviate at first into slight obliquities and themselves scarcely perceive at what time their ardour forsook them or when they lost sight of their original design  weariness and negligence are perpetually prevailing by silent encroachments assisted by different causes and not observed till they cannot without great difficulty be opposed labor necessarily requires pauses of ease and relaxation and the deliciousness of ease commonly makes us unwilling to return to labor we perhaps prevail upon ourselves to renew our attempts but eagerly listen to every argument for frequent interpositions of amusement for when indolence has once entered upon the mind it can scarcely be dispossessed but by such efforts as very few are found willing to exert  it is the fate of industry to be equally endangered by miscarriage and success by confidence and despondency he that engages in a great undertaking with a false opinion of its facility or too high conceptions of his own strength is easily discouraged by the first hindrance of his advances because he had promised himself an equal and perpetual progression without impediment or disturbance when unexpected interruptions break in upon him he is in the state of a man surprised by a tempest where he purposed only to bask in the calm or sport in the shallows  it is not only common to find the difficulty of an enterprise greater but the profit less than hope had pictured it youth enters the world with very happy prejudices in her own favor she imagines herself not only certain of accomplishing every adventure but of obtaining those rewards which the accomplishment may deserve she is not easily persuaded to believe that the force of merit can be resisted by obstinacy and avarice or its luster darkened by envy and malignity she has not yet learned that the most evident claims to praise or preferment may be rejected by malice against conviction or by indolence without examination that they may be sometimes defeated by artifices and sometimes overborn by clamor that in the mingled numbers of mankind many need no other provocation to enmity than that they find themselves excelled that others have ceased their curiosity and consider every man who fills the mouth of report with a new name as an intruder upon their retreat and disturber of their repose that some are engaged in complications of interest which they imagine endangered by every innovation that many yield themselves up implicitly to every report which hatred disseminates or folly scatters and that whoever aspires to the notice of the public he has in almost every man an enemy and a rival and must struggle with the opposition of the daring and elude the stratagems of the timorous must quicken the frigid and soften the obdurate must reclaim perverseness and inform stupidity  it is no wonder that when the prospect of reward has vanished the zeal of enterprise should cease for who would persevere to cultivate the soil which he has after long labor discovered to be barren he who had pleased himself with anticipated praises and expected that he should meet in every place with patronage or friendship will soon remit his vigor when he finds that from those who desire to be considered as his admirers nothing can be hoped but cold civility and that many refuse to own his excellence lest they should be too justly expected to reward it  a man thus cut off from the prospect of that port to which his address and fortitude had been employed to steer him often abandons himself to chance and to the wind and glides careless and idle down the current of life without resolution to make another effort till he is swallowed up by the gulf of mortality  others are betrayed to the same desertion of themselves by a contrary fallacy it was said of hannibal that he wanted nothing to the completion of his martial virtues but that when he had gained a victory he should know how to use it the folly of desisting too soon from successful labors and the haste of enjoying advantages before they are secured is often fatal to men of impetuous desire and ardent imagination to men whose consciousness of uncommon powers fills them with presumption and who having born opposition down before them and left emulation panting behind are early persuaded to imagine that they have reached the heights of perfection and that now being no longer in danger from competitors they may pass the rest of their days in the enjoyment of their acquisitions in contemplation of their own superiority and in attention to their own praises and look unconcerned from their eminence upon the toils and contentions of meaner beings  it is not sufficiently considered in the hour of exultation that all human excellence is comparative that no man performs much but in proportion to what others accomplish or to the time and opportunities which have been allowed him and that he who stops at any point of excellence is every day sinking in estimation because his improvement grows continually more incommensurate to his life yet as no man willingly quits opinions favorable to himself they who have once been justly celebrated imagine that they still have the same pretensions to regard and seldom perceive the diminution of their character while there is time to recover it nothing then remains but murmurs and remorse for if the spendthrifts poverty be imbittered by the reflection that he once was rich how must the idlers obscurity be clouded by remembering that he once had luster  these errors all arise from an original mistake of the true motives of action he that never extends his view beyond the praises or rewards of men will be dejected by neglect and envy or infatuated by honors and applause but the consideration that life is only deposited in his hands to be employed in obedience to a master who will regard his endeavors not his success would have preserved him from trivial elations and discouragements and enabled him to proceed with constancy and cheerfulness neither enervated by commendation nor intimidated by censure  numb     saturday june         pind the writers who have undertaken the task of reconciling mankind to their present state and of relieving the discontent produced by the various distribution of terrestrial advantages very frequently remind us that we judge too hastily of good and evil that we view only the superficies of life and determine of the whole by a very small part and that in the condition of men it frequently happens that grief and fear anxiety and desire lie hid under the golden robes of prosperity and the gloom of calamity is cheared by secret radiations of hope and comfort as in the works of nature the bog is sometimes covered with flowers and the mine concealed in the barren crags  none but those who have learned the art of subjecting their senses as well as their reason to hypothetical systems will be persuaded by the most specious rhetorician that the lots of life are equal yet it cannot be denied that every one has his peculiar pleasures and vexations that external accidents operate variously upon different minds and that no man can exactly judge from his own sensations what another would feel in the same circumstances  if the general disposition of things be estimated by the representation which every one makes of his own state the world must be considered as the abode of sorrow and misery for how few can forbear to relate their troubles and distresses if we judge by the account which may be obtained of every mans fortune from others it may be concluded that we are all placed in an elysian region overspread with the luxuriance of plenty and fanned by the breezes of felicity since scarcely any complaint is uttered without censure from those that hear it and almost all are allowed to have obtained a provision at least adequate to their virtue or their understanding to possess either more than they deserve or more than they enjoy  we are either born with such dissimilitude of temper and inclinations or receive so many of our ideas and opinions from the state of life in which we are engaged and the particular objects by which we are surrounded that the griefs and cares of one part of mankind seem to the other hypocrisy folly and affectation every class of society has its cant of lamentation which is understood or regarded by none but themselves and every part of life has its uneasinesses which those who do not feel them will not commiserate an event which spreads terror and distraction over half the commercial world that assembles the trading companies in councils and committees and sinks the hearts and shakes the nerves of a thousand stockjobbers is read by the landlord and the farmer with frigid indifference an affair of love which fills the young breast with incessant alternations of hope and fear and steals away the night and day from every other pleasure or employment is regarded by them whose passions time has extinguished as a trivial amusement which can properly raise neither joy nor sorrow and which though it may be suffered to fill the vacuity of an idle moment should always give way to prudence or interest  he that never had any other desire than to fill a chest with money or to add another manor to his estate who never grieved but at a bad mortgage or entered a company but to make a bargain would be astonished to hear of beings known among the polite and gay by the denomination of wits how would he gape with curiosity or grin with contempt at the mention of beings who have no wish but to speak what was never spoke before who if they happen to inherit wealth often exhaust their patrimonies in treating those who will hear them talk and if they are poor neglect a thousand opportunities of improving their fortunes for the pleasure of making others laugh how slowly would he believe that there are men who would rather lose a legacy than the reputation of a distich who think it less disgrace to want money than repartee whom the vexation of having been foiled in a contest of raillery is sometimes sufficient to deprive of sleep and who would esteem it a lighter evil to miss a profitable bargain by some accidental delay than not to have thought of a smart reply till the time of producing it was past how little would he suspect that this child of idleness and frolic enters every assembly with a beating bosom like a litigant on the day of decision and revolves the probability of applause with all the anxiety of a conspirator whose fate depends upon the next night that at the hour of retirement he often carries home amidst all his airy negligence a heart lacerated with envy or depressed with disappointment and immures himself in his closet that he may disencumber his memory at leisure review the progress of the day state with accuracy his loss or gain of reputation and examine the causes of his failure or success  and yet more remote from common conceptions are the numerous and restless anxieties by which female happiness is particularly disturbed a solitary philosopher would imagine ladies born with an exemption from care and sorrow lulled in perpetual security and feasted with unmingled pleasure for what can interrupt the content of those upon whom one age has labored after another to confer honors and accumulate immunities those to whom rudeness is infamy and insult is cowardice whose eye commands the brave and whose smile softens the severe whom the sailor travels to adorn the soldier bleeds to defend and the poet wears out life to celebrate who claim tribute from every art and science and for whom all who approach them endeavor to multiply delights without requiring from them any return but willingness to be pleased  surely among these favorites of nature thus unacquainted with toil and danger felicity must have fixed her residence they must know only the changes of more vivid or more gentle joys their life must always move either to the slow or sprightly melody of the lyre of gladness they can never assemble but to pleasure or retire but to peace  such would be the thoughts of every man who should hover at a distance round the world and know it only by conjecture and speculation but experience will soon discover how easily those are disgusted who have been made nice by plenty and tender by indulgence he will soon see to how many dangers power is exposed which has no other guard than youth and beauty and how easily that tranquillity is molested which can only be soothed with the songs of flattery it is impossible to supply wants as fast as an idle imagination may be able to form them or to remove all inconveniences by which elegance refined into impatience may be offended none are so hard to please as those whom satiety of pleasure makes weary of themselves nor any so readily provoked as those who have been always courted with an emulation of civility  there are indeed some strokes which the envy of fate aims immediately at the fair the mistress of catullus wept for her sparrow many centuries ago and lapdogs will be sometimes sick in the present age the most fashionable brocade is subject to stains a pinner the pride of brussels may be torn by a careless washer a picture may drop from a watch or the triumph of a new suit may be interrupted on the first day of its enjoyment and all distinctions of dress unexpectedly obliterated by a general mourning  such is the state of every age every sex and every condition all have their cares either from nature or from folly and whoever therefore finds himself inclined to envy another should remember that he knows not the real condition which he desires to obtain but is certain that by indulging a vicious passion he must lessen that happiness which he thinks already too sparingly bestowed  numb     tuesday june          nunc o nunc daedale dixit materiam qua sis ingeniosus habes possidet en terras et possidet aequora minos nec tellus nostrae nec patet unda fugae restat iter coelo coelo tentabimus ire da veniam coepto jupiter alte meo ovid the greater part of moralists like other writers instead of casting their eyes abroad into the living world and endeavoring to form from their own observations new maxims of practice and new hints of theory content their curiosity with that secondary knowledge which the perusal of books affords and think themselves entitled to reverence and to fame by a new arrangement of an ancient system or new illustration of established principles the sage precepts of the first instructors of the world are transmitted from age to age with little variation and echoed from one author to another not perhaps without some loss of their original force at every repercussion  i know not whether any other reason than this idleness of imitation can be assigned for that uniform and constant partiality by which some vices have hitherto escaped censure and some virtues wanted recommendation nor can i discover why else we have been warned only against part of our enemies while the rest have been suffered to steal upon us without notice or why on one side the heart has been doubly fortified while it has lain open on the other to the incursions of error and the ravages of vice  among the favorite topics of moral declamation may be numbered the dangers and miscarriages of imprudent boldness the folly of attempts beyond our power and the necessity of modest diffidence and cautious deliberation every page of every philosopher is crowded with examples of temerity that sunk under burdens which she laid upon herself and called out enemies to battle by whom she was destroyed  their remarks are certainly too just to be disputed and too salutary to be rejected but there is likewise some danger lest timorous prudence should be too strongly inculcated lest courage and enterprise should be wholly repressed and the mind congealed in perpetual inactivity by the fatal influence of frigorifick wisdom  every man should indeed carefully compare his force with his undertaking for though we ought not to live only for our own sakes or act with regard folely to our own advantage and though therefore danger or difficulty should not be avoided merely because we may expose ourselves to misery or disgrace yet it may be justly required of us not to hazard our lives or throw away our labor upon inadequate and hopeless designs since we might by a more just estimate of our abilities have become more useful to mankind  therr is doubtless an irrational contempt of danger which approaches very nearly to the folly if not the guilt of suicide there is a ridiculous perseverance in impracticable schemes which is justly punished with ignominy and reproach but in the wide regions of probability which are the proper province of prudence and election there is always room to deviate on either side of rectitude without rushing against apparent absurdity and according to the inclinations of nature or the impressions of precept the daring and the cautious may move in different directions without touching upon rashness or cowardice  that there is a middle path which it is every mans duty to find and to observe is unanimously confessed but it is likewise universally acknowledged that this middle path is so narrow that it cannot easily be discovered and so little beaten that there are no certain marks by which it can be followed the care therefore of all those who have undertaken conduct others has been that whenever they decline into obliquities they should be certain to tend toward the side of safety  it can indeed raise no wonder that temerity has been generally censured for it is one of the vices with which few can be charged and which therefore great numbers are ready to condemn it is the vice of noble and generous minds the exuberance of magnanimity and the ebullition of genius and is therefore not regarded with much tenderness because it never flatters us by that appearance of softness and imbeciility which is commonly necessary to conciliate compassion but if the same attention had been applied to the search of arguments against cold despondency against the mean and cowardly dereliction of ourselves and the folly of presupposing impossibilities and anticipating frustration i know not whether many would not have been roused to usefulness who having been taught to confound prudence with timidity never ventured to excel left they should unfortunately fail  it is always necessary to distinguish our own interest from that of others and that distinction will perhaps assist us in fixing the just limits of caution and adventurousness in an undertaking that involves the happiness or the safety of many we have certainly no right to hazard more than is allowed by those who partake the dangers but where only ourselves can suffer by miscarriage we are not confined within such narrow limits and still less is the reproach of temerity when numbers will receive advantage by success and only one be incommoded by failure  men are generally willing to hear precepts by which ease is favored and as no resentment is raised by general representations of human folly even in those who are most eminently jealous of comparative reputation we confess without reluctance that vain man is ignorant of his own weakness and therefore frequently presumes to attempt what he can never accomplish but it ought likewise to be remembered that he is no less ignorant of his own powers and might perhaps have accomplished a thousand designs which the prejudices of cowardice restrained him from attempting  it is observed in the golden verses of pythagoras that power is never far from necessity the vigor of the human mind quickly appears when there is no longer any place for doubt and hesitation when diffidence is absorbed in the sense of danger or overwhelmed by some resistless passion we then soon discover that difficulty is for the most part the daughter of idleness that the obstacles with which our way seemed to be obstructed were only phantoms which we believed real because we durst not advance to a close examination and we learn that it is impossible to determine without experience how much constancy may endure or diligence perform  but whatever pleasure may be found in the review of distresses when art or courage has surmounted them few will be persuaded to wish that they may be awakened by want or terror to the conviction of their own abilities every one should therefore endeavor to invigorate himself by reason and reflection and determine to exert in any laudable undertaking the latent force that nature may have reposited in him against the hour of exigence before external compulsion shall torture him to diligence it is below the dignity of a reasonable being to owe that strength to necessity which ought always to act at the call of choice or to need any other motive to industry and perseverance than the desire of performing the duties of his condition  reflections that may at least drive away despair cannot easily be wanting to him who has taken a survey of the world and considers how much life is now advanced beyond the state of naked undisciplined uninstructed nature whatever has been effected for convenience or elegance while it was yet unknown was believed impossible and therefore would never have been attempted had not some more daring than the rest adventured to bid defiance to prejudice and censure nor is there yet any reason to doubt that the same labor would be rewarded with the same success there are certainly innumerable qualities in the products of nature yet undiscovered and innumerable combinations in the powers of art yet untried it is the duty of every man to endeavor that something may be added by his industry to the hereditary aggregate of knowledge and happiness to add much can indeed be the lot of few but to add something however little every one may hope and of every honest endeavor it is certain that however unsuccessful it will be at last rewarded  numb   0 saturday june         non sic prata novo vere decentia aestatis calidae dispoliat vapor saevit solstitio cum

have very lately observed that in the numerous subdivisions of the world every class and order of mankind have joys and sorrows of their own we all feel hourly pain and pleasure from events which pass unheeded before other eyes but can scarcely communicate our perceptions to minds preoccupied by different objects any more than the delight of well disposed colors or harmonious sounds can be imparted to such as want the senses of hearing or of sight  i am so strongly convinced of the justness of this remark and have on so many occasions discovered with how little attention pride looks upon calamity of which she thinks herself not in danger and indolence listens to complaint when it is not echoed by her own remembrance that though i am about to lay the occurrences of my life before you i question whether you will condescend to peruse my narrative or without the help of some female speculatist be able to understand it  i was bern a beauty from the dawn of reason i had my regard turned wholly upon myself nor can recollect any thing earlier than praise and admiration my mother whose face had luckily advanced her to a condition above her birth thought no evil so great as deformity she had not the power of imagining any other defect than a cloudy complexion or disproportionate features and therefore contemplated me as an assemblage of all that could raise envy or desire and predicted with triumphant fondness the extent of my conquests and the number of my slaves  she never mentioned any of my young acquaintance before me but to remark how much they fell below my perfection how one would have had a fineface but that her eyes were without luster how another struck the sight at a distance but wanted my hair and teeth at a nearer view another disgraced an elegant shape with a brown skin some had short fingers and others had dimples in a wrong place  as she expected no happiness nor advantage but from beauty she thought nothing but beauty worthy of her care and her maternal kindness was chiefly exercised in contrivances to protect me from any accident that might deface me with a scar or stain me with a freckle she never thought me sufficiently shaded from the sun or screened from the fire she was severe or indulgent with no other intention than the preservation of my form she excused me from work lest i should learn to hang down my head or harden my finger with a needle she snatched away my book because a young lady in the neighborhood had made her eyes red with reading by a candle but she would scarcely suffer me to eat lest i should spoil my shape nor to walk lest i should swell my ancle with a sprain at night i was accurately surveyed from head to foot lest i should have suffered any diminution of my charms in the adventures of the day and was never permitted to sleep till i had passed through the cosmetick discipline part of which was a regular lustration performed with beanflower water and maydews my hair was perfumed with variety of unguents by some of which it was to be thickened and by others to be curled the softness of my hands was secured by medicated gloves and my bosom rubbed with a pomade prepared by my mother of virtue to discuss pimples and clear discolorations  i was always called up early because the morning air gives a freshness to the cheeks but i was placed behind a curtain in my mothers chamber because the neck is easily tanned by the rising sun i was then dressed with a thousand precautions and again heard my own praises and triumphed in the compliments and prognostications of all that approached me  my mother was not so much prepossessed with an opinion of my natural excellencies as not to think some cultivation necessary to their completion she took care that i should want none of the accomplishments included in female education or considered as necessary in fashionable life i was looked upon in my ninth year as the chief ornament of the dancingmasters ball and mr ariet used to reproach his other scholars with my performances on the harpsichord at twelve i was remarkable for playing my cards with great elegance of manner and accuracy of judgment  at last the time came when my mother thought me perfect in my exercises and qualified to display in the open world those accomplishments which had yet only been discovered in select parties or domestic assemblies preparations were therefore made for my appearance on a public night which she considered as the most important and critical moment of my life she cannot be charged with neglecting any means of recommendation or leaving any thing to chance which prudence could ascertain every ornament was tried in every position every friend was consulted about the color of my dress and the manteaumakers were harassed with directions and alterations  at last the night arrived from which my future life was to be reckoned i was dressed and sent out to conquer with a heart beating like that of an old knight errant at his first fally scholars have told me of a spartan matron who when she armed her son for battle bade him bring back his shield or be brought upon it my venerable parent dismissed me to a field in her opinion of equal glory with a command to show that i was her daughter and not to return without a lover  i went and was received like other pleasing novelties with a tumult of applause every man who valued himself upon the graces of his person or the elegance of his address crowded about me and wit and splendour contended for my notice i was delightfully fatigued with incessant civilities which were made more pleasing by the apparent envy of those whom my presence exposed to neglect i returned with an attendant equal in rank and wealth to my utmost wishes and from this time stood in the first rank of beauty was followed by gazers in the mall celebrated in the papers of the day imitated by all who endeavored to rise into fashion and censured by those whom age or disappointment forced to retire  my mother who pleased herself with the hopes of seeing my exaltation dressed me with all the exuberance of finery and when i represented to her that a fortune might be expected proportionate to my appearance told me that she should scorn the reptile who could enquire after the fortune of a girl like me she advised me to prosecute my victories and time would certainly bring me a captive who might deserve the honor of being enchained for ever  my lovers were indeed so numerous that i had no other care than that of determining to whom i should seem to give the preference but having been steadily and industriously instructed to preserve my heart from any impressions which might hinder me from consulting my interest i acted with less embarrassment because my choice was regulated by principles more clear and certain than the caprice of approbation when i had singled out one from the rest as more worthy of encouragement i proceeded in my measures by the rules of art and yet when the ardour of the first visits was spent generally found a sudden declension of my influence i felt in myself the want of some power to diversify amusement and enliven conversation and could not but suspect that my mind failed in performing the promises of my face this opinion was soon confirmed by one of my lovers who married lavinia with less beauty and fortune than mine because he thought a wife ought to have qualities which might make her amiable when her bloom was past  the vanity of my mother would not suffer her to discover any defect in one that had been formed by her instructions and had all the excellence which she herself could boast she told me that nothing so much hindered the advancement of women as literature and wit which generally frightened away those that could make the best settlements and drew about them a needy tribe of poets and philosophers that filled their heads with wild notions of content and contemplation and virtuous obscurity she therefore enjoined me to improve my minuet step with a new french dancing master and wait the event of the next birthnight  i had now almost completed my nineteenth year if my charms had lost any of their softness it was more than compensated by additional dignity and if the attractions of innocence were impaired their place was supplied by the arts of allurement i was therefore preparing for a new attack without any abatement of my confidence when in the midst of my hopes and schemes i was seized by that dreadful malady which has so often put a sudden end to the tyranny of beauty i recovered my health after a long confinement but when i looked again on that face which had been often flushed with transport at its own reflection and saw all that i had learned to value all that i had endeavored to improve all that had procured me honors or praises irrecoverably destroyed i sunk at once into melancholy and despondence my pain was not much confoled or alleviated by my mother who grieved that i had not lost my life together with my beauty and declared that she thought a young woman divested of her charms had nothing for which those who loved her could desire to save her from the grave  having thus continued my relation to the period from which my life took a new course i shall conclude it in another letter if by publishing this you show any regard for the correspondence of  sir etc victoria   numb     tuesday june          fatis accede deisque et cole felices miseros fuge sidera coelo ut distant et flamma mari sic utile recto lucan there is scarcely any sentiment in which amidst the innumerable varieties of inclination that nature or accident have scattered in the world we find greater numbers concurring than in the wish for riches a wish indeed so prevalent that it may be considered as universal and transcendental as the desire in which all other desires are included and of which the various purposes which actuate mankind are only subordinate species and different modifications  wealth is indeed the general center of inclination the point to which all minds preserve an invariable tendency and from which they afterward diverge in numberless directions whatever is the remote or ultimate design the immediate care is to be rich and in whatever enjoyment we intend finally to acquiesce we seldom consider it as attainable but by the means of money of wealth therefore all unanimously confess the value nor is there any disagreement but about the use  no desire can be formed which riches do not assist us to gratify he that places his happiness in splendid equipage or numerous dependents in refined praise or popular acclamations in the accumulation of curiosities or the revels of luxury in splendid edifices or wide plantations must still either by birth or acquisition possess riches they may be considered as the elemental principles of pleasure which may be combined with endless diversity as the essential and necessary substance of which only the form is left to be adjusted by choice  the necessity of riches being thus apparent it is not wonderful that almost every mind has been employed in endeavors to acquire them that multitudes have vied with each other in arts by which life is furnished with accommodations and which therefore mankind may reasonably be expected to reward  it had indeed been happy if this predominant appetite had operated only in concurrence with virtue by influencing none but those who were zealous to deserve what they were eager to possess and had abilities to improve their own fortunes by contributing to the ease or happiness of others to have riches and to have merit would then have been the same and success might reasonably have been considered as a proof of excellence  but we do not find that any of the wishes of men keep a stated proportion to their powers of attainment many envy and desire wealth who can never procure it by honest industry or useful knowledge they therefore turn their eyes about to examine what other methods can be sound of gaining that which none however impotent or worthless will be content to want  a little enquiry will discover that there are nearer ways to profit than through the intricacies of art or up the steeps of labor that what wisdom and virtue scarcely receive at the close of life as the recompense of long toil and repeated efforts is brought within the reach of subtilty and dishonesty by more expeditious and compendious measures that the wealth of credulity is an open prey to falsehood and that the possessions of ignorance and imbecility are easily stolen away by the conveyances of secret artifice or seized by the gripe of unresisted violence  it is likewise not hard to discover that riches always procure protection for themselves that they dazzle the eyes of enquiry divert the celerity of pursuit or appease the ferocity of vengeance when any man is incontestably known to have large possessions very few think it requisite to enquire by what practices they were obtained the resentment of mankind rages only against the struggles of feeble and timorous corruption but when it has surmounted the first opposition it is afterward supported by favor and animated by applause  the prospect of gaining speedily what is ardently desired and the certainty of obtaining by every accession of advantage an addition of security have so far prevailed upon the passions of mankind that the peace of life is destroyed by a general and incessant struggle for riches it is observed of gold by an old epigrammatist that to have it is to be in fear and to want it is to be in sorrow there is no condition which is not disquieted either with the care of gaining or of keeping money and the race of man may be divided in a political estimate between those who are practicing fraud and those who are repelling it  if we consider the present state of the world it will be found that all confidence is lost among mankind that no man ventures to act where money can be endangered upon the faith of another it is impossible to see the long scrolls in which every contract is included with all their appendages of seals and attestation without wondering at the depravity of those beings who must be restrained from violation of promise by such formal and public evidences and precluded from equivocation and subterfuge by such punctilious minuteness among all the satires to which folly and wickedness have given occasion none is equally severe with a bond or a settlement  of the various arts by which riches may be obtained the greater part are at the first view irrreconcileable with the laws of virtue some are openly flagitious and practiced not only in neglect but in defiance of faith and justice and the rest are on every side so entangled with dubious tendencies and so beset with perpetual temptations that very few even of those who are not yet abandoned are able to preserve their innocence or can produce any other claim to pardon than that they have deviated from the right less than others and have sooner and more diligently endeavored to return  one of the chief characteristicks of the golden age of the age in which neither care nor danger had intruded on mankind is the community of possessions strife and fraud were totally excluded and every turbulent passion was stilled by plenty and equality such were indeed happy times but such times can return no more community of possession must always include spontaneity of production for what is only to be obtained by labor must be of right the property of him by whose labor it is gained and while a rightful claim to pleasure or to affluence must be procured either by slow industry or uncertain hazard there will always be multitudes whom cowardice or impatience will incite to more safe and more speedy methods who will strive to pluck the fruit without cultivating the tree and to share the advantages of victory without partaking the danger of the battle  in later ages the conviction of the danger to which virtue is exposed while the mind continues open to the influence of riches has determined many to vows of perpetual poverty they have suppressed desire by cutting off the possibility of gratification and secured their peace by destroying the enemy whom they had no hope of reducing to quiet subjection but by debarring themselves from evil they have rescinded many opportunities of good they have too often sunk into inactivity and uselessness and though they have forborne to injure society have not fully paid their contributions to its happiness  while riches are so necessary to present convenience and so much more easily obtained by crimes than virtues the mind can only be secured from yielding to the continual impulse of covetousness by the preponderation of unchangeable and eternal motives gold will generally turn the intellectual balance when weighed only against reputation but will be light and ineffectual when the

having passed the usual course of education at least with common proficiency and credit i found it necessary to employ for the support of life that learning which i had almost exhausted my little fortune in acquiring the lucrative professions drew my regard with equal attraction each had its peculiar advantages and inconveniences each presented ideas which excited my curiosity and each imposed duties which terrified my apprehension  there is no temper more unpropitious to interest than desultory application and unlimited enquiry by which the desires are held in a perpetual equipoise and the mind fluctuates between different purposes without determination i had books of every kind round me among which i divided my time as caprice or accident directed i often spent the first hours of the day in considering to what study i should devote the rest and at last when i was harassed with deliberation snatched up any author that lay upon the table or perhaps fled to a coffeehouse for deliverance from the anxiety of irresolution and the gloominess of solitude but when my attention happened to be vigorous and my intellects unclouded i ranged from art to art from writer to writer and have distributed a single hour among chrysostom galen homer euclid and justinian  in the mean time my little patrimony grew imperceptibly less till i was at last roused from my literary slumber by the impatience of a creditor whose importunity obliged me to pacify him with so large a sum that what remained was not sufficient to support me more than eight months i hope you will not reproach me with avarice or cowardice if i acknowledge that i now thought myself in danger of distress and obliged to endeavor after some certain competence  there have been heroes of negligence who have laid the price of their last acre in a drawer and without the least interruption of their tranquillity or abatement of their expenses taken out one piece after another till there was no more remaining but i was not born to such dignity of imprudence or such exaltation above the cares and necessities of life i therefore immediately engaged my friends to procure me a little employment which might set me free from the dread of poverty and afford me time to plan out some final scheme of lasting advantage  my friends whose kindness had never risen into much solicitude and who had neither inclination nor opportunity to know the state of my revenues were struck with honest perturbation at the confession of my uneasiness and immediately promised their endeavors for my extrication they did not suffer their kindness to languish by delay but in the first ardour of their zeal prosecuted their enquiries with such success that in less than a month i was perplexed with variety of offers and contrariety of prospects  i had however no time for long pauses of consideration and therefore soon resolved to accept the office of instructing a young nobleman in the house of his father i went to the seat at which the family then happened to reside was received with great politeness and invited to enter immediately on my charge the terms offered were such as i should willingly have accepted though my circumstances had allowed me greater liberty of choice the respect with which i was treated flattered my vanity and perhaps the splendour of the apartments and the luxury of the table were not wholly without their influence i immediately complied with the proposals and received the young lord into my care  having no desire to gain more than i should truly deserve i very diligently prosecuted my undertaking and had the satisfaction of discovering in my pupil a flexible temper a quick apprehension and a retentive memory i did not much doubt that my care would in time produce a wise and useful counselor to the state though my labors were somewhat obstructed by want of authority and the necessity of complying with the freaks of negligence and of waiting patiently for the lucky moment of voluntary attention to a man whose imagination was filled with the dignity of knowledge and to whom a studious life had made all the common amusements insipid and contemptible it was not very easy to suppress his indignation when he saw himself forsaken in the midst of his lecture for an opportunity to catch an insect and found his instructions debarred from access to the intellectual faculties by the memory of a childish frolic or the desire of a new plaything  those vexations however would have recurred less frequently had not his mamma by entreating at one time that he should be excused from his task as a reward for some petty compliance and withholding him from his book at another to gratify herself or her visitants with his vivacity shown him that every thing was more pleasing and more important than knowledge and that study was to be endured rather than chosen and was only the business of those hours which pleasure left vacant or discipline usurped  i thought it my duty to complain in tender terms of these frequent avocations but was answered that rank and fortune might reasonably hope for some indulgence that the retardation of my pupils progress would not be imputed to any negligence or inability of mine and that with the success which satisfied every body else i might surely satisfy myself i had now done my duty and without more remonstrances continued to inculcate my precepts whenever they would be heard gained every day new influence and found that by degrees my scholar began to feel the quick impulses of curiosity and the honest ardour of studious ambition  at length it was resolved to pass a winter in london the lady had too much fondness for her son to live five months without him and too high an opinion of his wit and learning to refuse her vanity the gratification of exhibiting him to the public i remonstrated against too early an acquaintance with cards and company but with a soft contempt of my ignorance and pedantry she said that he had been already confined too long to solitary study and it was now time to show him the world that nothing was more a brand of meanness than bashful timidity that gay freedom and elegant assurance were only to be gained by mixed conversation a frequent intercourse with strangers and a timely introduction to splendid assemblies and she had more than once observed that his forwardness and complaisance began to desert him that he was silent when he had not something of consequence to say blushed whenever he happened to find himself mistaken and hung down his head in the presence of ladies without that readiness of reply and activity of officiousness remarkable in young gentlemen that are bred in london  again i found resistance hopeless and again therefore i thought it proper to comply we entered the coach and in four days were placed in the gayest and most magnificent region of the town my pupil who had for several years lived at a remote seat was immediately dazzled with a thousand beams of novelty and show his imagination was filled with the perpetual tumult of pleasure that passed before him and it was impossible to allure him from the window or to overpower by any charm of eloquence the rattle of coaches and the sounds which echoed from the doors in the neighborhood in three days his attention which he began to regain was disturbed by a rich suit in which he was equipped for the reception of company and which having been long accustomed to a plain dress he could not at first survey without ecstasy  the arrival of the family was now formally notified every hour of every day brought more intimate or more distant acquaintance to the door and my pupil was indiscriminately introduced to all that he might accustom himself to change of faces and be rid with speed of his rustic diffidence he has easily endeared himself to his mother by the speedy acquisition or recovery of her darling qualities his eyes sparkle at a numerous assembly and his heart dances at the mention of a ball he has at once caught the infection of high life and has no other test of principles or actions than the quality of those to whom they are ascribed he begins already to look down on me with superiority and submits to one short lesson in a week as an act of condescension rather than obedience for he is of opinion that no tutor is properly qualified who cannot speak french

sapientia dicimus autem hos quoque felices qui far incommoda vitae nec jactare jugum vita didicere magistra juv to the rambler sir you have shown by the publication of my letter that you think the life of victoria not wholly unworthy of the notice of a philosopher i shall therefore continue my narrative without any apology for unimportance which you have dignified or for inaccuracies which you are to correct  when my life appeared to be no longer in danger and as much of my strength was recovered as enabled me to bear the agitation of a coach i was placed at a lodging in a neighboring village to which my mother dismissed me with a faint embrace having repeated her command not to expose my face too soon to the sun or wind and told me that with care i might perhaps become tolerable again the prospect of being tolerable had very little power to elevate the imagination of one who had so long been accustomed to praise and ecstacy but it was some satisfaction to be separated from my mother who was incessantly ringing the knell of departed beauty and never entered my room without the whine of condolence or the growl of anger she often wandered over my face as travelers over the ruins of a celebrated city to note every place which had once been remarkable for a happy feature she condescended to visit my retirement but always left me more melancholy for after a thousand trifling enquiries about my diet and a minute examination of my looks she generally concluded with a sigh that i should never more be fit to be seen  at last i was permitted to return home but found no great improvement of my condition for i was imprisoned in my chamber as a criminal whose appearance would disgrace my friends and condemned to be tortured into new beauty every experiment which the officiousness of folly could communicate or the credulity of ignorance believe was tried upon me sometimes i was covered with emollients by which it was expected that all the scars would be filled and my cheeks plumped up to their sormer smoothness and sometimes i was punished with artificial excoriations in hopes of gaining new graces with a new skin the cosmetick science was exhausted upon me but who can repair the ruins of nature my mother was forced to give me rest at last and abandon me to the fate of a fallen toast whose fortune she considered as a hopeless game no longer worthy of solicitude or attention  the condition of a young woman who has never thought or heard of any other excellence than beauty and whom the sudden blast of disease wrinkles in her bloom is indeed sufficiently calamitous she is at once deprived of all that gave her eminence or power of all that elated her pride or animated her activity all that filled her days with pleasure and her nights with hope all that gave gladness to the present hour or brightened her prospects of futurity it is perhaps not in the power of a man whose attention has been divided by diversity of pursuits and who has not been accustomed to derive from others much of his happiness to image to himself such helpless destitution such dismal inanity every object of pleasing contemplation is at once snatched away and the soul finds every receptacle of ideas empty or filled only with the memory of joys that can return no more all is gloomy privation or impotent desire the faculties of anticipation slumber in despondency or the powers of pleasure mutiny for employment  i was so little able to find entertainment for myself that i was forced in a short time to venture abroad as the solitary savage is driven by hunger from his cavern i entered with all the humility of disgrace into assemblies where i had lately sparkled with gaiety and towered with triumph i was not wholly without hope that dejection had misrepresented me to myself and that the remains of my former face might yet have some attraction and influence but the first circle of visits convinced me that my reign was at an end that life and death were no longer in my hands that i was no more to practice the glance of command or the frown of prohibition to receive the tribute of sighs and praises or be soothed with the gentle murmurs of amorous timidity my opinion was now unheard and my proposals were unregarded the narrowness of my knowledge and the meanness of my sentiments were easily discovered when the eyes were no longer engaged against the judgment and it was observed by those who had formerly been charmed with my vivacious loquacity that my understanding was impaired as well as my face and that i was no longer qualified to fill a place in any company but a party at cards  it is scarcely to be imagined how soon the mind sinks to a level with the condition i who had long considered all who approached me as vassals condemned to regulate their pleasures by my eyes and harass their inventions for my entertainment was in less than three weeks reduced to receive a ticket with professions of obligation to catch with eagerness at a compliment and to watch with all the anxiousness of dependence lest any little civility that was paid me should pass unacknowledged  though the negligence of the men was not very pleasing when compared with vows and adoration yet it was far more supportable than the insolence of my own sex for the first ten months after my return into the world i never entered a single house in which the memory of my downfall was not revived at one place i was congratulated on my escape with life at another i heard of the benefits of early inoculation by some i have been told in express terms that i am yet not without my charms others have whispered at my entrance this is the celebrated beauty one told me of a wash that would smooth the skin and another offered me her chair that i might not front the light some soothed me with the observation that none can tell how soon my case may be her own and some thought it proper to receive me with mournful tenderness formal condolence and consolatory blandishments  thus was i every day harassed with all the stratagems of wellbred malignity yet insolence was more tolerable than solitude and i therefore persisted to keep my time at the doors of my acquaintance without gratifying them with any appearance of resentment or depression i expected that their exultation would in time vapor away that the joy of their superiority would end with its novelty and that i should be suffered to glide along in my present form among the nameless multitude whom nature never intended to excite envy or admiration nor enabled to delight the eye or inflame the heart  this was naturally to be expected and this i began to experience but when i was no longer agitated by the perpetual ardour of resistance and effort of perseverance i found more sensibly the want of those entertainments which had formerly delighted me the day rose upon me without an engagement and the evening closed in its natural gloom without summoning me to a concert or a ball none had any care to find amusements for me and i had no power of amusing myself idleness exposed me to melancholy and life began to languish in motionless indifference  misery and shame are nearly allied it was not without many struggles that i prevailed on myself to confess my uneasiness to euphemia the only friend who had never pained me with comfort or with pity i at last laid my calamities before her rather to ease my heart than receive assistance we must distinguish said she my victoria those evils which are imposed by providence from those to which we ourselves give the power of hurting us of your calamity a small part is the infliction of heaven the rest is little more than the corrosion of idle discontent you have lost that which may indeed sometimes contribute to happiness but to which happiness is by no means inseparably annexed you have lost what the greater number of the human race never have possessed what those on whom it is bestowed for the most part possess in vain and what you while it was yours knew not how to use you have only lost early what the laws of nature forbid you to keep long and have lost it while your mind is yet flexible and while you have time to substitute more valuable and more durable excellencies consider yourself my victoria as a being born to know to reason and to act rise at once from your dream of melancholy to wisdom and to piety you will find that there are other charms than those of beauty and other joys than the praise of fools  i am sir etc victoria   numb     saturday june         quis scit an adjiciant hodiernae crastina summae tempora di superi hor i sat yesterday morning employed in deliberating on which among the various subjects that occurred to my imagination i should bestow the paper of today after a short effort of meditation which by nothing was determined i grew every moment more irresolute my ideas wandered from the first intention and i rather wished to think than thought upon any settled subject till at last i was awakened from this dream of study by a summons from the press the time was come for which i had been thus negligently purposing to provide and however dubious or sluggish i was now necessitated to write  though to a writer whose design is so comprehensive and miscellaneous that he may accommodate himself with a topic from every scene of life or view of nature it is no great aggravation of his task to be obliged to a sudden composition yet i could not forbear to reproach myself for having so long neglected what was unavoidably to be done and of which every moments idleness increased the difficulty there was however some pleasure in reflecting that i who had only trifled till diligence was necessary might still congratulate myself upon my superiority to multitudes who have trifled till diligence is vain who can by no degree of activity or resolution recover the opportunities which have slipped away and who are condemned by their own carelessness to hopeless calamity and barren sorrow  the folly of allowing ourselves to delay what we know cannot be finally escaped is one of the general weaknesses which in spite of the instruction of moralists and the remonstrances of reason prevail to a greater or less degree in almost every mind even they who most steadily withstand it find it if not the most violent the most pertinacious of their passions always renewing its attacks and though often vanquished never destroyed  it is indeed natural to have particular regard to the time present and to be most solicitous for that which is by its nearness enabled to make the strongest impressions when therefore any sharp pain is to be suffered or any formidable danger to be incurred we can scarcely exempt ourselves wholly from the seducements of imagination we readily believe that another day will bring some support or advantage which we now want and are easily persuaded that the moment of necessity which we desire never to arrive is at a great distance from us  thus life is languished away in the gloom of anxiety and consumed in collecting resolution which the next morning dissipates in forming purposes which we scarcely hope to keep and reconciling ourselves to our own cowardice by excuses which while we admit them we know to be absurd our firmness is by the continual contemplation of misery hourly impaired every submission to our fear enlarges its dominion we not only waste that time in which the evil we dread might have been suffered and surmounted but even where procrastination produces no absolute increase of our difficulties make them less superable to ourselves by habitual terrors when evils cannot be avoided it is wise to contract the interval of expectation to meet the mischiefs which will overtake us if we fly and suffer only their real malignity without the conflicts of doubt and anguish of anticipation  to act is far easier than to suffer yet we every day see the progress of life retarded by the vis inertiae the mere repugnance to motion and find multitudes repining at the want of that which nothing but idleness hinders them from enjoying the case of tantalus in the region of poetic punishment was somewhat to be pitied because the fruits that hung about him retired from his hand but what tenderness can be claimed by those who though perhaps they suffer the pains of tantalus will never lift their hands for their own relief  there is nothing more common among this torpid generation than murmurs and complaints murmurs at uneasiness which only vacancy and suspicion expose them to feel and complaints of distresses which it is in their own power to remove laziness is commonly associated with timidity either fear originally prohibits endeavors by infusing despair of success or the frequent failure of irresolute struggles and the constant desire of avoiding labor impress by degrees false terrors on the mind but fear whether natural or acquired when once it has full possession of the fancy never fails to employ it upon visions of calamity such as if they are not soon dissipated by useful employment will soon overcast it with horrors and imbitter life not only with those miseries by which all earthly beings are really more or less tormented but with those which do not yet exist and which can only be discerned by the perspicacity of cowardice  among all who sacrifice future advantage to present inclination scarcely any gain so little as those that suffer themselves to freeze in idleness others are corrupted by some enjoyment of more or less power to gratify the passions but to neglect our duties merely to avoid the labor of performing them a labor which is always punctually rewarded is surely to sink under weak temptations idleness never can secure tranquillity the call of reason and of conscience will pierce the closest pavilion of the sluggard and though it may not have force to drive him from his down will be loud enough to hinder him from sleep those moments which he cannot resolve to make useful by devoting them to the great business of his being will still be usurped by powers that will not leave them to his disposal remorse and vexation will seize upon them and forbid him to enjoy what he is so desirous to appropriate  there are other causes of inactivity incident to more active faculties and more acute discernment he to whom many objects of persuit arise at the same time will frequently hesitate between different desires till a rival has precluded him or change his course as new attractions prevail and harass himself without advancing he who sees different ways to the same end will unless he watches carefully over his own conduct lay out too much of his attention upon the comparison of probabilities and the adjustment of expedients and pause in the choice of his road till some accident intercepts his journey he whose penetration extends to remote consequences and who whenever he applies his attention to any design discovers new prospects of advantage and new possibilities of improvement will not easily be persuaded that his project is ripe for execution but will superadd one contrivance to another endeavor to unite various purposes in one operation multiply complications and refine niceties till he is entangled in his own scheme and bewildered in the perplexity of various intentions he will resolve to unite all the beauties of situation in a new purchase and waste his life in roving to no purpose from province to province he will hope in the same house to obtain every convenience and draw plans and study palladio but never lay a stone he will attempt a treatise on some important subject and amass materials consult authors and study all the dependent and collateral parts of learning but never conclude himself qualified to write he that has abilities to conceive perfection will not easily be content without it and since perfection cannot be reached will lose the opportunity of doing well in the vain hope of unattainable excellence  the certainty that life cannot be long and the probability that it will be much shorter than nature allows ought to awaken every man to the active prosecution of whatever he is desirous to perform it is true that no diligence can ascertain success death may intercept the swiftest career but he who is cut off in the execution of an honest undertaking has at least the honor of falling in his rank and has fought the battle though he missed the victory  numb     tuesday july        coelum non animum mutant hor it is impossible to take a view on any side or observe any of the various classes that form the great community of the world without discovering some proof of the influence of example and admitting with new conviction and in a sense more extensive the observation of arstotle that man is an imitative being the greater far the greater number follow the track which others have beaten without any curiosity after new discoveries or ambition of trusting themselves to their own conduct and of those whom the confidence of juvenile temerity incites to break the ranks and disorder the uniformity of the march most return in a short time from their deviation and prefer the equal and steady satisfaction of security before the frolicks of caprice and the honors of adventure  in questions difficult or dangerous it is indeed natural to repose upon authority and when fear happens to predominate upon the authority of those whom we do not in general think wiser than ourselves very few have abilities requisite for the discovery of abstruse truth and of those few some want leisure and some resolution some are drawn off from the search by business or amusements and some retire at the appearance of difficulty but it is not so easy to find the reason of the universal submission to precedent where every man might safely judge for himself where no irrereparable loss can be hazarded nor any mischief of long continuance incurred vanity might be expected to operate on those who are not restrained by any more powerful passion the mere pleasure of acknowledging no superior might sometimes produce slight singularities or the hope of gaining some new degree of happiness awaken the mind to invention or experiment  if in any case the shackles of prescription could be wholly shaken off and the imagination left to act without control on what occasion should it be expected but in the selection of lawful pleasure pleasure of which the essence is choice which compulsion dissociates from every thing to which nature has united it and which owes not only its vigor but its being to the smiles of liberty yet we see that the senses as well as the reason are regulated by credulity and that most will feel or say that they feel the gratifications which others have taught them to expect  at this time of universal migration when almost every one confiderable enough to attract regard has retired or is preparing with all the earnestness of distress to retire into the country when nothing is to be heard but the hopes of speedy departure or the complaints of involuntary delay i have often been tempted to enquire what happiness to be gained or what inconvenience to be avoided by this stated recession of the birds of passage some follow the summer and some the winter because they live upon sustenance which only summer or winter can supply but of the annual flight of human rovers it is much harder to assign the reason because they do not appear either to find or seek any thing which is not equally afforded by the town and country  i believe that many of these fugitives may have heard of men whose continual wish was for the quiet of retirement who watched every opportunity to steal away from observation to forsake the crowd and delight themselves with the society of solitude there is indeed scarcely any writer who has not celebrated the happiness of rural privacy and delighted himself and his reader with the melody of birds the whisper of groves and the murmur of rivulets nor any man eminent for extent of capacity or greatness of exploits that has not left behind him some memorials of lonely wisdom and silent dignity  but almost all absurdity of conduct arises from the imitation of those whom we cannot resemble those who thus testified their weariness of tumult and hurry and hasted with so much eagerness to the leisure of retreat were either men overwhelmed with the pressure of difficult employments harassed with importunities and distracted with multiplicity or men wholly engrossed by speculative sciences who having no other end of life but to learn and teach found their searches interrupted by the common commerce of civility and their reasonings disjointed by frequent interruptions such men might reasonably fly to that ease and convenience which their condition allowed them to find only in the country the statesman who devoted the greater part of his time to the public was desirous of keeping the remainder in his own power the general ruffled with dangers wearied with labors and stunned with acclamations gladly snatched an interval of silence and relaxation the naturalist was unhappy where the works of providence were not always before him the reasoner could adjust his systems only where his mind was free from the intrusion of outward objects  such examples of solitude very few of those who are now hastening from the town have any pretensions to plead in their own justification since they cannot pretend either weariuess of labor or desire of knowledge they purpose nothing more than to quit one scene of idleness for another and after having trifled in public to sleep in secrecy the utmost that they can hope to gain is the change of ridiculousness to obscurity and the privilege of having fewer witnesses to a life of folly he who is not sufficiently important to be disturbed in his pursuits but spends all his hours according to his own inclination and has more hours than his mental faculties enable him to fill either with enjoyment or desires can have nothing to demand of shades and valleys as bravery is said to be a panoply insignificancy is always a shelter  there are however pleasures and advantages in a rural situation which are not confined to philosophers and heroes the freshness of the air the verdure of the woods the paint of the meadows and the unexhausted variety which summer scatters upon the earth may easily give delight to an unlearned spectator it is not necessary that he who looks with pleasure on the colors of a flower should study the principles of vegetation or that the ptolemaick and copernican system should be compared before the light of the sun can gladden or its warmth invigorate novelty is itself a source of gratification and milton justly observes that to him who has been long pent up in cities no rural object can be presented which will not gladden some of his senses with refreshment  yet even these easy pleasures are missed by the greater part of those who waste their summer in the country should any man pursue his acquaintances to their retreats he would find few of them listening to philomel loitering in woods or plucking daisies catching the healthy gale of the morning or watching the gentle coruscations of declining day some will be discovered at a window by the road side rejoicing when a new cloud of dust gathers toward them as at the approach of a momentary supply of conversation and a short relief from the tediousness of unideal vacancy others are placed in the adjacent villages where they look only upon houses as in the rest of the year with no change of objects but what a remove to any new street in london might have given them the same set of acquaintances still settle together and the form of life is not otherwise diversified than by doing the same things in a different place they pay and receive visits in the usual form they frequent the walks in the morning they deal cards at night they attend to the same tattle and dance with the same partners nor can they at their return to their former habitation congratulate themselves on any other advantage than that they have passed their time like others of the same rank and have the same right to talk of the happiness and beauty of the country of happiness which they never felt and beauty which they never regarded  to be able to procure its own entertainments and to subsist upon its own stock is not the prerogative of every mind there are indeed understandings so fertile and comprehensive that they can always feed reflection with new supplies and suffer nothing from the preclusion of adventitious amusements as some cities have within their own walls enclosed ground enough to feed their inhabitants in a siege but others live only from day to day and must be constantly enabled by foreign supplies to keep out the encroachments of languor and stupidity such could not indeed be blamed for hovering within reach of their usual pleasures more than any other animal for not quitting its native element were not their faculties contracted by their own fault but let not those who go into the country merely because they dare not be left alone at home boast their love of nature or their qualifications for solitude nor pretend that they receive instantaneous infusions of wisdom from the dryads and are able when they leave smoke and noise behind to act or think or reason for themselves  numb     saturday july          hom the regard which they whose abilities are employed in the works of imagination claim from the rest of mankind arises in a great measure from their influence on futurity rank may be conserred by princes and wealth bequeathed by misers or by robbers but the honors of a lasting name and a title to the veneration of distant ages only the sons of learning have the power of bestowing while therefore the love of fame is a motive of action while it continues one of the characteristicks of rational nature to decline oblivion authors never can be wholly overlooked in the search after happiness nor become contemptible but by their own fault  the man who considers himself as constituted the ultimate judge of disputable characters as entrusted with the distribution of the last terrestrial rewards of merit ought surely to summon all his fortitude to the support of his integrity and resolve to discharge an office of such dignity and importance with the most vigilant caution and scrupulous justice to deliver examples to posterity and to regulate the opinion of future times is no slight or trivial undertaking nor is it easy to commit more atrocious treason against the great republic of humanity than by falsifying its records and misguiding its decrees  to scatter praise or blame without regard to justice is to destroy the distinction of good and evil many have no other test of actions than general opinion and all are so far influenced by a sense of reputation that they are often restrained by fear of reproach and excited by hope of honor when other principles have lost their power nor can any species of prostitution promote general depravity more than that which destroys the value of praise by showing that it may be acquired without deserving it and which by setting free the active and ambitious who must always determine the fate of others from the dread of infamy lets loose the rapacity of power and weakens the only authority by which greatness is controlled  praise like gold and diamonds owes its value only to its scarcity it must become cheap as it becomes vulgar and will no longer raise expectation or animate enterprise it is therefore not only necessary that wickedness even when it is not safe to censure it be denied applause but that goodness be commended only in proportion to its degree and that the garlands due to the great benefactors of mankind be not suffered to fade upon the brow of him who can boast only petty services and easy virtues  had these maxims been universally received how much would have been added to the task of dedication the work on which all the power of modern wit has been exhausted how few of these initial panegyricks had appeared if the author had been obliged first to find a man of virtue then to know the distinct species and degree of his desert and at last to pay him only the honors which he might justly claim it is much easier to learn the name of the last man whom chance has exalted to wealth and power to obtain by the intervention of some of his domestics the privilege of addressing him or to venture on an address without any previous solicitation in confidence of the general acceptance of flattery and after having heaped upon him all the virtues to which philosophy has assigned a name inform him how much more might be truly said did not the fear of giving pain to his modesty repress the raptures of wonder and the zeal of veneration  nothing has so much degraded literature from its natural rank as the practice of indecent and promiscuous dedication for what credit can he expect who professes himself the hireling of vanity however profligate and without shame or scruple celebrates the worthless dignifies the mean and gives to the corrupt licentious and oppressive the ornaments which ought only to add grace to truth and loveliness to innocence every other kind of fraud or adulteration however shameful however mischievous is certainly far less detestable than the crime of counterfeiting characters and fixing the stamp of literary sanction upon the dross and refuse of the world  i would not yet overwhelm the authors with the whole load of infamy of which part perhaps the greater part ought to fall upon their patrons if he that hires a bravo partakes the guilt of murder why should he who bribes a flatterer hope to be exempted from the shame of falsehood the unhappy dedicator is seldom without some motives which obstruct though not destroy the liberty of choice he is perhaps oppressed by miseries which he hopes to relieve or inflamed by ambition which he expects to gratify but the patron has no incitements equally violent he can receive only a short gratification with which nothing but stupidity could dispose him to be pleased the real satisfaction which praise can afford is by repeating aloud the whispers of conscience and by showing us that we have not endeavored to deserve well in vain every other encomium is to an intelligent mind satire and reproach the celebration of these virtues which we feel ourselves to want can only impress a quicker sense of our own defects and show that we have not yet satisfied the expectations of the world by forcing us to observe how much fiction must contribute to the completion of our character  yet perhaps the patron himself may have some claim to indulgence for it does not always happen that the encomiast has been much encouraged to his attempt many a hapless author when his book and perhaps his dedication was ready for the press has waited long before any one would pay the price of prostitution or consent to hear the praises destined to insure his name against the casualties of time and many a complaint has been vented against the decline of learning and neglect of genius when either parsimonious prudence had declined expense or honest indignation rejected falsehood but if at last after long enquiry and innumerable disappointments he finds a lord willing to hear of his own eloquence and taste a statesman desirous of knowing how a friendly historian will represent his conduct or a lady delighted to leave to the world some memorial of her wit and beauty such weakness cannot be censured as an instance of enormous depravity it can scarcely be expected but the wisest man may by a diligent solicitor be surprised in the hour of weakness and persuaded to solace vexation or invigorate hope with the music of flattery  to censure all dedications as adulatory and servile would discover rather envy than justice praise is the tribute of merit and he that has incontestably distinguished himself by any public performance has a right to all the honors which the public can bestow to men thus raised above the rest of the community there is no need that the book or its author should have any particular relation that the patron is known to deserve respect is sufficient to vindicate him that pays it to the same regard from particular persons private virtue and less conspicuous excellence may be sometimes entitled an author may with great propriety inscribe his work to him by whose encouragement it was undertaken or by whose liberality he has been enabled to prosecute it and may justly rejoice in his own fortitude when he dares to rescue merit from obscurity acribus exemplis videor te cludere misce ergo aliquid nostris de moribus  i know not whether greater relaxation may not be indulged and whether hope as well as gratitude may not unblameably produce a dedication but let the writer who pours out his praises only to propitiate power or attract the attention of greatness be cautious lest his desire betray him to exuberant eulogies we are naturally more apt to please ourselves with the future than the past and while we luxuriate in expectation may be easily persuaded to purchase what we yet rate only by imagination at a higher price than experience will warrant  but no private views or personal regard can discharge any man from his general obligations to virtue and to truth it may happen in the various combinations of life that a good man may receive favors from one who notwithstanding his accidental beneficence cannot be justly proposed to the imitation of others and whom therefore he must find some other way of rewarding than by public celebrations selflove has indeed many powers of seducement but it surely ought not to exalt us to equality with the collective body of mankind or persuade us that a benefit conferred on us is equivalent to every other virtue yet many upon false principles of gratitude have ventured to extol wretches whom all but their dependents numbered among the reproaches of the species and whom they would likewise have beheld with the same scorn had they not been hired to dishonest approbation  to encourage merit with praise is the great business of literature but praise must lose its influence by unjust or negligent distribution and he that impairs its value may be charged with misapplication of the power that genius puts into his hands and with squandering on guilt the recompense of virtue  end of vol iv
