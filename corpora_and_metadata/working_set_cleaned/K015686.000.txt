cursory remarks on mr gilberts last bill for the better relief and employment of the poor etc and his considerations thereon in a letter to that gentleman  errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum hor by h bate dudley clerk one of his majestys justices of the peace for the county of essex  london printed for j debrett piccadilly mdcclxxxviii  advertisement the following observations were hastily put together in consequence of mr gilberts late motion in the house of commons for a revival of his bill  the writer having seen no other pamphlet on the subject may probably have been anticipated in some of his remarks  his name would not have been prefixed to this short letter but to obviate the impropriety of opposing an avowed plan by an anonymous publication  cursory remarks etc in a letter to t gilbert esquire m p these pages are addressed to you sir as the mover of a bill in parliament  for the better relief and employment of the poor etc etc they contain objections to your plan as too speculative in its principle  and too dangerous in the experiment it proposes   the few remarks that here occur in defense of our present system of poor laws  are founded on practical observation if they contribute but in a small degree to the general information which the subject at this time requires the purpose of the writer will be completely answered   your bill is professedly designed for these important ends viz i to secure a more comfortable subsistence for the poor and indigent ii to encourage and promote industry throughout the lower classes of society and iii to alleviate the increasing burdens of parochial taxes   to effect which you require that the direction of the poor throughout the kingdom should be taken out of the hands of parish officers and justices of the peace  and the management be in future transferred to   a board of commissioners   a district committee   a district agent   subordinate overseers   a county committee   and by their endeavors you say that you expect a system of union  superintendence  control  and  permanency of office  whether this essential part of the public service may be best executed  by the old laws somewhat modified  or your plan subversive of the whole ancient code  shall be the short question between us   your plan appears to me objectionable as a machine too various and complex in the movements required  but first it would be right to examine the constituent parts i shall take them as they arise in your bill  commissioners were the principle of the bill unexceptionable  the parliamentary appointment of these commissioners merely to divide counties into districts would be liable to no material objection  district committee passing over the endless nuisances of the magistrates taking polls in the several districts  an election of this committee by ballot carries the impropriety of such an appointment upon the face of it if the office of a district committeeman prove a desirable one persons of superior influence will find no difficulty in engrossing such power within themselves  on the other hand if it turn out unprofitable and troublesome they will take care to a man not to be elected and in that case none but the ignorant and incapable will be chosen   district agent this officer to be elected by the first district comlmittee will of course be the choice of the most extensive parishes sending a plurality of voices to the said committee  the small parishes  dragged reluctantly into the corporation  must consequently be at the mercy of the larger throughout every district  notwithstanding all the parade of various committees the sole government of the district would center in this same agent he would be vested with such full and absolute authority by your bill that he is not even required to make any return of his examination of the three years accounts  unless to him there shall appear any omission or misrepresentation  in all matters of doubt and difficulty  indeed  he may consult any member or members of the district committee near him and act under his or their advice till the next committee meeting  but how few doubts a man will be troubled with possessed of such powers may readily be conceived  he is further authorized to relieve paupers at home or send them to the workhouse as he may think proper the district committee will therefore erect your workhouses at a considerable expense to little or no purpose should their agent deem it more advisable to administer relief pretty generally to paupers at their own houses  indeed the discretionary power to be vested in this man throughout may be directed by him so as to clog every wheel of your plan at his pleasure but even admitting him disposed to do what is right  in cases of difficulty  and many such must daily occur  how do you direct him to act  he must apply to the district committee for instructions  true  but such committee may not meet for a month and after this reference to them the matter must be tried further back to the county committee who will not assemble for a fortnight longer and even then a sufficient number of members may not attend to form a board  what must be the ultimatum of all this  the agent will become comptroller general of the poor throughout his district or leave the distresses of the indigent and the interests of the parishioners to the hand of chance to regulate  should any resistance be made to the authority of this officer the bill points out no mode of redress it is probable therefore that the neighboring magistrate must in this instance be called upon for his aid to enforce this novel system of jurisprudence  but after all what appeal is left to the unfortunate pauper under the probable tyranny of his new taskmaster here we are left totally in the dark  you will hardly give such appellant jurisdiction to the magistrates thus to offend the delicacy of the new created powers is the oppressed object then to search for redress perhaps for bread through the perplexing mazes of district agents  district committees  and county committees  this would amount to little short of an absolute prohibition of justice and therefore you sir can best explain by what mode you mean this appeal to be secured  overseers your idea of electing overseers with a salary i cannot deem advisable in that case it will always become an object with the most powerful parishioner to command the office either for himself or his dependent the objection to the present mode of appointment by the magistrates in parochial rotation you state to be because no regard is thus paid to the qualification of the persons nominated  do you conceive sir that your elective mode will lessen the evil  i am apprehensive it may have a contrary effect  the office of overseer you say is proverbially a burden on those who are so unfortunate as to be liable to it  it might have been so formerly but the case is materially altered at the last midsummer quarter sessions for essex a substantial farmer absurdly appealed against the justices appointment of two overseers from an extreme anxiety to serve the office himself  considerable sums are now raised by the increase of rates the expenditure of these gives a kind of local patronage which men seem every day more desirous of obtaining indeed this part of your proposition is done away in the same page of your considerations p    by your own refutation  you have no sooner stated that overseers are appointed  against their will than you thus invalidate the assertion i am afraid many of these officers  overseers are such as are studious to obtain their situations in order to convert them to their own advantage or that of their friends  be this as it may as executive instruments only under the magistracy  their proper station  the present mode of appointment is evidently the most prudent  but with what grace would the overseer elected by your plan for his extreme respectability submit to be the mere runner of the district agent few men of ordinary spirit would bend to so servile a degradation  each overseer you say is to be watchful within his parish but the district agent is to be awake to the necessities of the whole district does any one stand in need of relief does any want employment has an industrious man met with an accident that has disabled him from working are children grown too old to be any longer kept in idleness has any vagrant introduced himself into the parish and become an annoyance by begging or a cause of suspicion by appearing unemployed the overseer is to make representation to the district agent  these are supposed to be the bounden duties of the overseer according to the laws now in force except the servile part of the office  the representation to the district agent  and do you really believe sir that this reference on every circumstance that may arise occasioning endless trouble would facilitate the desired redress  supposing the agent even constantly resident within his district  what unavoidable confusion and expense must attend the repeated and often fruitless journies and enquiries by various overseers after this individual agent in order that he may investigate their respective complaints  in a word giving both overseer and agent full credit for the truest zeal and best intentions in the discharge of their duty i think it would be found impossible for them to execute what your bill seems to require at their hands  county committee this committee with qualifications equal to that of the commissioners is to be elected by ballot  and seems intended as a board of general control liable to a penalty of  0l each for nonattendance unless in cases of sickness or some unavoidable accident  you seem sir to build much on the superintendence of your plan being thus vested in the principal gentlemen of the county here likewise i fear you would experience a disappointment  you cannot but have observed with what extreme reluctance country gentlemen attach themselves to public business to make their appearance at a summer assizes or an occasional quarter sessions is generally the utmost extent of their county exertions as a proof of this i need only instance the neglected commissions of turnpikes sewers etc  under the dread therefore of being dragged into a dry detail of unintelligible accounts and complex items of parochial statements  the chief canvas of gentlemen on this occasion would be to avoid the honor of being elected to so troublesome an office which must subject them to a heavy penalty for nonattendance upon its tedious duties  hence it evidently follows that the whole controuling power of this like that of the district committees must soon fall into the hands of a few interested agents who would of course direct the whole in a manner that might best answer their own sinister views  if the errors be thus evident as i contend in the formation of the parts how will the whole of so complicated a machine be put into any effectual motion in the numberless obstructions which will arise you must explore through such a variety of illaccording movements that i fear you would often discover the cause of impediment without possessing the power of removing it  indeed if no objection lay to your plan on the score of its impracticability  a man of your acknowledged probity must be supposed to pay some consideration to the means by which it would be accomplished  and surely he must shrink from the task when he sound that it could not possibly be effected but by obtruding upon the peaceful scenes of retired life the baneful feuds of party spirit  and annually involving every countydistrict and parish in all the intrigues and riots of contested elections  those which i have concisely stated appear to me the most striking objections to which your bill is liable  summed up they amount to this  that your plan departs too widely and wildly from the simplicity of our established system of poor laws  multiplying rather than diminishing the difficulties of redress  modification and strict enforcement of the poor laws already enacted i flatter myself i shall have no great difficulty in proving that by a trifling modification and spirited enforcement of the existing laws the three great objects of our enquiry may be completely effected  to the discretionary power which overseers have too long been suffered to exercise contrary to every principle of justice and policy  the alarming increase of paupers as well as poors rates may fairly be ascribed  all the grievances on this subject now crying aloud for redress will be found to arise from some one or other of the following causes viz  from overseers permitting idle and disorderly persons to remain after they find they have illegally obtruded themselves into their several parishes  from settled inhabitants being suffered to grow slothful and live without the visible means of gaining their bread  from the neglect of overseers in not seeing the children of paupers early brought up to proper habits of industry  from the partial issuing of parish certificates  from wanton and capricious removals  from groundless appeals to the general quarter sessions  from the wanton expenditure of parish money in searching after paupers etc etc  from unfair rates of partial assessments and annexing charges thereto not connected with the accounts of the poor  in all the particulars above stated the overseer will be found almost invariably to exercise his own discretion from the present difficulty of punishing him for any malconduct in many cases overseers are enabled to set the vague authority of the magistrate at defiance a considerable share of the poor are rendered helpless and the state is deprived of their industry by the shameful negligence of parish officers it is high time therefore to dispossess them of their discretionary power and hold them up to a strict discharge of their real duty by to be paid to the informer on conviction of the offending officer fines the most exemplary  for the three first articles containing neglect of office the penalties to which an overseer might be made subject would soon operate as an effectual preventive as to the latter which constitute the heavy articles of expenditure these in my opinion might easily be guarded against  certificates contribute very much to the crossgrained disputes between different parties  they should either be granted generally or totally abolished some parishes make it a rule not to issue them this occasions many an industrious man to be removed from a place where he has long gained better wages by his labor than he could earn in his own settlement other parishes with more tenderness seldom refuse to certify their poor and therefore are disappointed when they meet not with the same treatment in return but overseers thus indemnified care not to what expense they run the parish certifying in cases of illness etc this in a great measure accounts for the reluctance often shown in granting such certificates though much may be urged on the humane side of the question the granting certificates is certainly productive of great public expense and numberless litigations and therefore the general good seems to require that they should in future be dispensed with  removals every person obtruding himself into any parish not being able to give a proper and satisfactory account of himself and not departing thence within a certain limited time after due notice given him by the overseer or constable should be deemed a vagrant and be summarily punished accordingly  every person whether single or married who has been permitted openly to reside forty days successively in any parish without receiving due notice to depart from it should be deemed a settled inhabitant thereof and the overseer be adjudged to pay a certain fine in aid of the poorrates for such neglect of his office some provision of this kind might stimulate the overseer to what is so much wanting an early discharge of this important part of his duty at present from the discretionary power which enables him to remove the intruding pauper at his leisure the place of settlement from various circumstances becomes doubtful and hence arise the charges of removal with the additional expense of defending it whether it prove well or ill founded  the baneful effects of vagrancy might in a great measure be prevented if those who received and harbored vagrants were searched out and rigorously prosecuted for such offenses from the present difficulty of punishing the neglect of it no responsibility is annexed to this essential part of the public service transfer it as an express duty to the overseer who should have the subordinate aid of the constable and the long catalogue of felonious depredations would soon be diminished privy searches to be made throughout every parish in the division on the same night as the best means of effectually correcting this evil   being vested with equal power churchwardens are too much inclined to thwart their brother overseers in their best endeavors for the good government of the parish worthless objects to whom the overseers have justly refused relief often receive the protection and support of a churchwarden merely from a parade of distinct authority this being in general their only interference parishes might be secured from the burden and inconvenience of it were churchwardens empowered in future to act but as deputies during the absence or indisposition of the regular overseers and that in cases only of particular emergency  appeals appeals from orders of removal form a very heavy part of the parochial burdens upon a moderate calculation twothirds of the appeals heard at the quarter sessions are either totally groundless or prove wanton litigations between neighboring parishes these notions of legal hostility are now so generally inculcated that no overseer thinks he makes a decent figure in the records of the parish which is honored with his mark unless his pride has been gratified with an expensive appeal though the object of such contention may never become chargeable a single sixpence it appears probable that questions of this description might either be prevented or at least be heard and decided in a more summary way for this end i would propose that no appeals whatever from orders of removal should be admitted without the previous investigation and sanction of the major part of the magistrates of the division at their petty sessions assembled in which the appellant parish is situate and where the appellant and respondent parishes both lie in the same division that such appeals should be brought to issue before the magistrates of the division aforesaid from whose adjudication no further appeal should lie to the general quarter sessions but on peril of double costs to the appellant one moiety whereof to be paid by the overseers themselves if such their appeal be adjudged vexatious by the said court of quarter sessions mr beaufoy member for yarmouth has lately presented a petition to the house of commons from mr wilkinson proprietor of a very extensive iron foundery in the parish of bradley in the county of stafford praying that his manufacturers may be deemed extraparochial in order to avoid their removal to their respective settlements or being liable to the rates of the parish where they reside and stating at the same time that he will raise the taxes necessary for the relief of his own poor within themselves and that he will be bound in his whole fortune as a security for the same  it seems impossible for parliament to comply with the prayer of so extraordinary a petition the legislature would at no rate venture to declare them extraparochial till an adequate provision was made for the relief of their poor etc and how can the security for this necessary fund be ascertained in so increasing a colony of manufacturers  where is the fortune that would be deemed equal to such a security independent of all this in passing such a law the whole doctrine of settlements must be thus overturned and a new code of poorlaws be framed for this particular occasion before mr wilkinson could possibly be gratified in so singular a requisition     rates the shameful inequality of rates has long and justly been complained of as a grievous oppression on the small occupiers in most parishes throughout the kingdom it is not a rare instance for the little farmer renting but sixty acres to pay as heavy an assessment as the wealthy yeoman possessing more than double that quantity of land an equality of rate ad valorem would be the most effectual remedy for this crying evil to this the common place argument may be objected of the impolicy of rating improvements but surely it is no less impolitic to limit them to the wealthy only but for whose grinding imposts the smaller farmers might partake of the profit as well as the credit of agricultural improvement  a parish officer before his rate is passed should be sworn that no article whatever stands charged thereon but what has been bona fide expended for the sole use of the poor  this would be the means of excluding many of those smuggled items of feasting etc etc which lead in no small measure to the enormity of parochial burdens  a certain sum per mile should be limited for the removal and bringing home of paupers for so vague and extravagant are the charges at present on this occasion that parishes in general pay from seven up to fifteen pounds for the mere incidental expense of removing two or three paupers less than fifty miles and the parishioners very rarely enquire into such shameful conduct to this we may add that those accounts are too often passed by the mere signature of the magistrate not only without a single question of enquiry but even without the attesting oath of the officer   the several duties of the overseer being once clearly and expressly declared an intermediate officer between him and the magistrate might be appointed to the great advantage of the public the inefficacy of our admirable code of poorlaws is evidently in a great measure owing to the too distant gradation between the justice and parish officer i would therefore propose for each hundred or division of a county  a comptroller with a salary adequate to his trouble who might be subject to heavy penalties for a neglect of his duty he might be empowered to summon vestry meetings of the respective parishes in order to audit their quarterly accounts  receive all parochial presentiments and other complaints against parish officers upon oath for malconduct in the discharge of their duty and make due return thereof with all other requisite matter to the petty sessions to be from thence returned to the general quarter sessions there to be duly enquired into and the offending parties prosecuted at the expense of the county i see no objection to the high constable of the division being employed herein with an additional stipend and thus raised from an useless to that of an active civil officer between the justice and overseer as abovestated   for the comfortable support of the poor the punishment of the disorderly and the economical expenditure of the parochial funds but little more would be found wanting objects of distress by the vigilance of active officers would soon be reduced in their numbers children from their earliest years would be trained in the paths of industry and in any cases of malconduct on the part of parish officers the necessary appeal through the comptroller or the neighboring magistrate would be speedy in its operation and certain in its effect not a slothful inhabitant could remain in a parish unaccounted for nor a single individual support himself therein without the visible means of procuring an honest livelihood overseers however must have a more express authority for this essential part of their duty great mischief arises from the difficulty which they conceive might attend such rigorous exertions by virtue of any law at present enacted justices of the peace should at the same time be empowered on the complaint of parish officers summarily to punish idle and disorderly persons who refuse to labor or are not able to render a good account of themselves the present and only mode of sending them to the house of correction there to await the decision of the quarterly sessions is of itself often a punishment too heavy for the offense and instead of operating toward the amendment of the culprit nine times out of ten only qualifies him by a general contamination of morals for the most desperate achievements  workhouse for the really poor and indigent a comfortable provision might be made within their own parish without resorting to those extensive hospitals which your plan sir proposes for their general reception i see no great objection to houses of industry between two or in some instances even three parishes but these i would recommend to be under the management of their respective overseers who would thus become useful cheques on each others conduct over them i would likewise place the general superintendance of the comptroller the established incorporations which you have enumerated have no doubt been productive of local benefit but this plan cannot i think be made generally advantageous how for instance will you incorporate extensive parishes rated ten shillings with neighboring ones paying only three shillings in the pound the manufacturing towns of coggeshall braintree and many others in the county where i reside would by such an union throw great part of their parochial burdens on persons deriving not the smallest advantage from the manufactures that occasion them i confess myself extremely adverse to the practice of general hospitals for the reception of great bodies of the infirm whose last resource is a workhouse the unavoidable tumult of such a mixed society is seldom sought for by declining age nor will the wretch grown gray in the scenes of retirement find this a fit asylum wherein to pass his few last moments   by some such easy plan as that i have hastily traced open to many amendments the general interests of all concerned i conceive might be effectually secured twothirds of the present rates at the utmost would thus be found adequate to the necessary expenditure the indigent would receive a comfortable provision without being exposed to the iron rod of foreign taskmasters from whose oppressions under your system there appears but little prospect of redress in a word that it will fully embrace that union superintendence control and permanency of office which your bill has proposed  having thus loosely stated my objections to your system and faintly sketched a modified plan in its stead it is due to your laborious researches to observe that your bill and considerations contain much valuable information your enquiry into the various charitable donations throughout the kingdom will probably be productive of great good by rescuing many a charitable boon from the sacrilegious gripe of the worthless on the additional bequests which you expect will be made to the poor in consequence of your plan i reckon but little the expiating offerings of superstition are no longer in fashion and good men inclined to acts of beneficence from principles of true charity will at this day seldom prefer parochial donations which they now perceive serve only to alleviate the parish taxes of the wealthy  your sunday toll on turnpike roads toward the support of a contingent fund would opperate partially and therefore oppressively i shall not notice your proposed tax on dogs  plan of friendly societies sunday schools  small debts  of hue and cry etc etc because they are subjects totally unconnected with the main question the clause in your bill respecting alehouses is however of too extraordinary a nature to be passed over without a remark  to enact that from and after the first day of september      no license shall be granted to any person for keeping an alehouse inn or victualinghouse unless it shall appear by a certificate from the commissioners or some proper officer of the excise that the person to whom such license is to be granted or the person who was licensed to the same house for the year next preceding had paid duty for or sold  barrels of ale at least etc etc  when the principal qualification for a license is excess of drinking publicans of an orderly disposition will necessarily be compelled to take down their signs but what benefit the state can derive from bartering an increase of debauchery for a diminution of alehouses remains yet to be explained  imperfect however as your system may appear to the dispassionate considerable allowance should be made for your prejudice in its favor you have so long contemplated this favorite offspring that it is no wonder if you now view it with too partial a regard or in the fixed admiration of a pleasing feature you should have totally lost sight of its most striking imperfections  your appeal to the house of commons will soon bring this national question to a parliamentary decision the event of that enquiry i may safely predict will extend no further than a general eulogy on your good intentions indeed the passing your bill into a law could yield no additional credit to your legislative character  you must soon perceive that such a compliment was an indiscreet one and lament that it had been thus overstrained at the expense of the country  i am sir with great respect your very obedient humble
