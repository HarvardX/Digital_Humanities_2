the old whig numb ii with remarks upon the plebeian no ii     eja quid statis nolunt atqui licet esse beatis quid causae est merito quin illis jupiter ambas iratus buccas inflet neque se fore posthac tam facilem dicat  hor the second edition  london printed and sold by j roberts in warwick lane and a dodd at the peacock without temple bar mdccxix price   d  the old whig with remarks upon the plebeian no ii the author of the plebeian to show himself a perfect master in the vocation of pamphlet writing begins like a son of grubstreet with declaring the great esteem he has for himself and the contempt he entertains for the scribblers of the age one would think by his way of representing it that the unexpected appearance of his pamphlet was as great a surprise upon the world as that of the late meteor or indeed something more terrible if you will believe the authors magnificent description of his own performance the plebeian page   says he starting forth unexpectedly they were forced like people in a surprise or on an invasion to march immediately any troops they had if cardinal alberonis attempt which furnishes the allusion succeeds no better than that of his friend the pamphleteer he will not have much to boast of  our author in his triumphant progress first animadverts on a writer whom he says he never read which being my own case i shall leave that writer to defend himself the second he mentions considering the strength of his arguments and the closeness of his reasoning deserved a little more regard from the plebeian who it seems with much ado went through the performance this would certainly have been true had he gone through it with a design to answer it  having routed baronius and confounded bellarmine pass we on to the next said the country curate to his admiring audience our author pursues his conquests with the same satisfaction and intrepidity in the first place he is angry with a writer for assuming the name of the old whig who may more justly recriminate upon this author for taking that of the plebeian a title which he is by no means fond of retaining if we may give credit to many shrewd guessers but he tells the old whig that he expected from that title no less than the utmost wrath and indignation against the house of lords    and  how does this agree with the censure he passes upon him afterward for treating that species in such a manner as he dares not venture to repeat i must however remind this author of the milk with which he nurses our nobles not to omit his stagnated pool passages of such a nature that in imitation of the author i shall dispatch them with an horresco referens  the author in the next paragraph gives us a definition of the point in debate viz that it is a jumble and a hodgepodge a most clear comprehensive and elegant account of the matter  the author then continues his animosities against the ephori of lacedaemon but this passage i shall wave for two reasons first because it is nothing to the purpose secondly because i am informed there are two or three keen disputants who will return a proper answer to it when they have discovered the author  the plebeian proceeds to detect an imaginary mistake in the old whig for having asserted that there has been as great an alteration in one branch of the legislature as is now proposed to be made in another a fact immediately puts an end to a dispute and in the case before us stands thus king henry viii added to the house of commons    members king edward vi    queen mary    queen elizabeth    king james i      the question now is whether the restraining the number of the house of commons to what it is at present was not as great an alteration in that branch of the legislature as the restriction now proposed would be to the other branch of the legislature should it take place in it to which i shall add the following question whether the inconveniences arising from that continual increase in the house of commons did not make the restraint upon it prudent and necessary and whether if the like inconveniences arise from this perpetually increasing house of lords it is not as necessary and as prudent to put a stop to it as for the little towns of watchet and dunster our author can draw nothing from them to the advantage of his cause if he can bestow labor and time enough of which he finds it necessary to be very sparing in this argument to peruse the printed list of counties and boroughs to whom the privilege of sending representatives to parliament was granted or restored by the several princes abovementioned and to answer the short query proposed to him at the end of it with relation to queen elizabeth  after having proposed these questions in plain terms i come in the next place to one of the plebeians which is carried on in metaphor till it ends in something that is past my understanding but these retrenchments being now made the question says he p   at present is whether the commons ought to go on stripping the crown of every jewel till it becomes less resplendent than the doge of venice s coronet or less comfortable than the swordbearers cap of maintenance i shall only confront this metaphorical query with one that is adapted to men of ordinary capacities these retrenchments being made whether the commons ought to accept the offer of the crown to part with a prerogative that is still exorbitant and dangerous to the community  but our authors chief concern is for the poor house of commons whom he represents as naked and defenseless p   when the crown by losing this prerogative would be less able to protect them against the power of a house of lords who forbears laughing when the spanish friar represents little dickey under the person of gomez insulting the colonel that was able to fright him out of his wits with a single frown this gomez says he flew upon him like a dragon got him down the devil being strong in him and gave him bastinado on bastinado and buffet upon buffet which the poor meek colonel being prostrate suffered with a most christian patience the improbability of the fact never fails to raise mirth in the audience and one may venture to answer for a british house of commons if we may guess from it is conduct hitherto that it will scarce be either so tame or so weak as our author supposes  the plebeian to turn off the force of the remark upon another paragraph has recourse to a shift that is of great use to controversial writers by affirming that his antagonist mistakes his meaning let the impartial reader judge whether an answer that proves this alteration would not be detrimental to the house of peers is not suited to an objection which says in so many words p   that it would be detrimental to the house of peers it self but says the plebeian in this his reply to the old whig it will not be detrimental to them in point of power but it will be detrimental on account of those talents which ought to accompany power the want of which the commons will feel in their judicature which is in other words i do not mean when i say that it will be detrimental to the house of peers it self that it will be detrimental to the peers but that it will be detrimental to the commons i appeal to any man whether the old whig ignorantly mistook the natural sense of those words or whether the plebeian ignorantly expressed that which he now says was his meaning in those words the plebeian having in his former paper represented that this old standing body of peers without receiving numerous additions from time to time would become corrupt and offensive like a stagnated pool tells us here in excuse for em p   that they will be offensive to others but not perceive it themselves if i could suppose with the author that they would ever be in this lamentable pickle i should be of his opinion that they ought to be sweetened by such wholesome pure and fresh streams as are continually passing into them  the plebeian next objects to the old whigs calculation of the probable extinction of two titles taking one year with another by the calculation generally received says this author i suppose he means the list published by way of prelude to this project whereas the old whig could not take that list for his calculation but formed his calculation from that list and from the nature of the alteration which is proposed this objection will immediately vanish upon discovering the fallacy of the plebeians argument he supposes no greater number of extinctions would happen among the english lords were their numbers settled at     than happened in that body when they were only    0            or     at this rate of calculating the plebeian will be sure of gaining his point and affirms very truly that the extinctions by a just medium amount to no more than a peer and a half for every year but i appeal to honest mr wingate who was never looked upon as a partywriter whether my calculation will not appear very just if examined by his golden rule and other curious operations of arithmetic which are to be met with in his works especially when the bill as it evidently tends to multiply extinctions by preventing the peerage from running into collateral lines or descending to females will more than answer my computation if i should have the misfortune to disagree with the plebeian about some very minute fraction of a lord that might happen in the space of     years as for those contingent vacancies which may be made by the edge of the law our author regards the uncertainty of them as a very uncomfortable prospect to the candidates for patrician honors since they may have time enough to try all their patience if they live in hopes of such a expedient for their promotion the ascertaining of this point is indeed what i am not equal to and must therefore leave it to the masters of political calculation but our author is afraid that if such lucky opportunities of extinction should happen lords may still sit with their heads on unless a seasonable increase may be made to em in such critical junctures this i must confess is to me one very great reason for the alteration proposed being fully of opinion with the old whig as expressed in the following words whig    is this inconvenience better prevented in a house of peers on the bottom it now stands can any who has been a good minister be secure if the crown should add a sufficient number of his enemies to those who sit in judgment upon him or is a bad minister in any danger when he may be sheltered by the addition of a sufficient number of his friends the plebeians answer to this passage is highly satisfactory p   in either of these cases says he the utmost iniquity must be supposed in the crown which i must confess i cannot bring my self to do and therefore my argument remains entire i very much approve of the authors dutiful and submissive behavior to the crown which puts one in mind of the worthy alderman who upon hearing a member of the common council call the emperor nero a monster of cruelty told him he ought not to speak disrespectfully of a crowned head but if the author will only go such lengths with me as to allow there ever has been a bad sovereign or not to shock him with such a supposition that there has ever been a wicked ministry and that it is not utterly impossible but there may be such in times to come my argument stands entire god be thanked we are now blessed with a good king and with the prospect of such for our days but cannot answer for those who are yet unborn since they will still be men and therefore liable to imperfection  the plebeian was hard set by the answer of the old whig to his arguments that the limitation of the number of the lords would run the constitution into an aristocracy and has therefore very prudently shuffled the consideration of that point under another head where he forgets the old whigs reply to what was urged against his opinion in that case so that he has visibly given up the point which was most material in his first plebeian the old whigs remark therefore still stands out against him unanswered and plainly turns his own ill consequence upon him by showing there is a visible tendency to an aristocracy as the constitution now stands which would be taken away by the alteration proposed but it is ungenerous to insult a baffled adversary i shall therefore proceed to the next particular in dispute  the old whig affirms that the power of giving money and raising taxes is confined to the body of the commons and that all the privileges together of the lords are not equal to that one of commanding the purse of the community the plebeian allows the consequence but cavils at the position which is a received maxim among the commons of england the doctrine of the house of commons in particular and established by the practice of every parliament in the memory of man let us now see what the plebeian affirms in contradiction to it and by the way observe whether he personates his part well and speaks the language of one who writes himself a member of the house of commons the author asserts that whether a moneybill may not originally take its rise in the house of lords is a point never yet clearly given up by their lordships if he is not very much misinformed this point if i am not very much misinformed was never claimed by the house of lords and has not a single precedent in the practice of that body in the legislature p    he afterward asserts that the commons have no more power over their fellow subjects estates than the lords is not the power of granting a supply fixing the quantum of that supply appropriating every part of it to particular uses and settling the ways and means for raising it is not this power over their fellow subjects estates much greater than that of the lords who can neither add to diminish nor after any one of these particulars and if the power of the commons extends it self to all these points how can the author further affirm that all which is peculiar to the commons in this matter is that they have hitherto been allowed to choose what tax they judged easiest for the people but what shadow of reason is there for him to proceed in asserting that every days experience shows us that if the lords differ in opinion from the commons their power is at an end since on the contrary experience shows us that whenever the lords have pretended to such a power they have always been overruled by the commons p   our author tells us the concurrence of the lords is as necessary to a moneybill as to any other bill that is not denied but he must allow that the lords concurrence to a moneybill is not of the same nature with their concurrence to any other bill which they may undoubtedly change amend and return upon the hands of the house of commons for their concurrence in such amendments as the lords shall think proper besides to show the plebeian how much the purse of the community is at the command of the commons let him consider the case of a vote of credit which is transacted wholly between the sovereign and the lower house to this we may add that the sovereign himself in his speeches to parliament applies that part which relates to money to the house of commons distinct from that of the lords by which method it is plain the crown supposes those privileges are vested in the house of commons to which every member of that house has always pretended excepting the present author  the plebeian in the next paragraph makes use of a very sure and wise method of confounding his antagonist by putting his own sense upon a passage in that authors pamphlet the old whig represents how dangerous it would be to our constitution if the crown which is already possessed of a certain means to overruled one branch of the legislature should ever be able to influence the elections of a house of commons so as to gain one to its measures in which case if liberty was endangered in the lower house it could not make a stand in the other the plebeian perverts this meaning after the following manner this author says he assures us p  0 that the crown has power enough to gain a house of commons of what complexion it pleases and after puzzling himself in his own voluntary blunder is displeased with the old whig for not proposing to cure an inconvenience which he never affirmed to be in the house of commons as well as that which he proves to be in the house of lords so that he would have had him quit the subject which he had undertaken to speak of one which he had nothing to do with but supposing the plebeian had rightly stated the sense of the author the inconvenience in the house of lords is that which is woven into its very constitution and therefore at all times exposes us to its ill consequences whereas what the plebeian suggests with regard to the house of commons is only extrinsick and accidental to that body if it ever happens in it  it is not probable that this dispute between the plebeian and the old whig will last many weeks but if there was time to discuss the whole point i think it may be shown to a demonstration that the check of the crown upon the house of commons which is the power of dissolution is by infinite degrees a weaker check than that it has in the present constitution upon the house of lords which is the power of adding to it what number at what time and for what purpose it pleases nay that the power of dissolution is also in its nature a check upon the house of lords as it dissolves them in a legislative capacity and may break the most dangerous cabals against the crown which are such as may be formed between the leaders of the two houses these two points if drawn out into such considerations as naturally rise from them would fully establish the necessity of three branches in a perfect legislature and demonstrate that they should be so far separate and distinct from each other as is essential to legislative bodies or as the old whig has before explained it if one part of the legislature may any ways be invested with a power to force either of the other two to concur with it the legislative power is in reality whatever it may pretend to divided into no more than two branches  i have hitherto followed the plebeian in his own method by examining first his replies to the objections made by the old whig and come now to his second general head wherein he formally proposes to consider the argument as the old whig states it himself and here i was not a little surprised to find that instead of answering the several distinct arguments urged by that author in defense of the bill as drawn from the nature of government in general from the british constitution from its effects on the crown on the house of commons on the whole body of the english commonalty and from the ill consequences it would remedy in the present constitution the plebeian contents himself with attacking but one single argument of his antagonist till the plebeian shall have answered those other points i shall take it for granted that he gives them up not to multiply words i believe every reader will allow me that an author is not to be much regarded who writes professedly in answer to a discourse which proceeds on many arguments when he singles out the argument only which he thinks is the weakest especially when he fails in his answer even to that single argument a famous french author compares the imaginary triumphs of such a kind of disputant whom he was then dealing with to those of claudius which instead of being represented by the strong towns he had taken and the armies he had defeated were testified to the people of rome by a present of cockleshells that he had gathered up on the seashore  but to come to the matter before us the old whig after having considered it in several views examines it with regard to the whole bulk of the british commons under this head he has the following words but the great point and which ought to carry the chief weight with us in this case is that the alteration now proposed will give such a mighty power to the bulk of the english commons as can be never counterbalancd by the body of the nobility now what the old whig here calls the great point with regard to the commonalty of england the plebeian insinuates he calls the great point with regard to the whole controversy and descants upon it accordingly whereas it is evident the author insists upon many points as great as this in other views of the question the old whig affirms that the commonalty has infinitely more wealth than the nobility which was the proper consideration of this place the plebeian returns for answer that the commonalty is indeed much richer than the nobility but that the house of commons is not so rich which was not the proper consideration of this place it is impossible for a disputant to lose the cause who is a master of such distinctions i remember i was once present at an university disputation which was managed on the one side by a notable peripatetick the question which he defended in the negative was whether comets are above the moon the sophister being pressed very hard by the force of demonstration very gravely extricated himself out of it by the following distinction comets said he are twofold supralunar and sublunar that supralunar comets are above the moon i do allow but that sublunar comets are above the moon i utterly deny and it is of this latter kind of comets that the question is to be understood  the fallacy of the plebeians answer being thus far discovered all that he further adds in his own way of arguing will be easily confuted by unravelling the matter which he has very artificially perplexed the old whig supposes that every lord in the legislature taken one with another may be worth  000 l a year in which for arguments sake every one knows his concession has been vastly too liberal the plebeian values every member of the house of commons at  00 l per annum one with another in which it is plain he has been exceeding scanty nay many are of opinion that upon casting up the whole sum of property that now resides in the house of lords it would not exceed that which is in the house of commons if this particular approaches to the truth all the arguments of a superior power arising from its greater property fall to the ground of themselves as being raised on a false foundation to which i must further add that if this increasing power still continues in the crown the property of the house of peers will indisputably surmount that of the house of commons and that on the contrary if the bill passes it visibly tends to prevent the impoverishment of the house of commons in point of property and to fill it with men of such estates as in a few years will be more than a counterbalance to the house of lords even under this view  but further to show the weakness of the plebeians reasonings upon this head i will allow that the house of lords enjoy at present and may still continue to enjoy a greater share of property than the house of commons but notwithstanding this concession to which the nature of the thing does not oblige me it is still evident that the immense property which subsists in the bulk of the english commons will render their representatives more powerful than the body of the lords this will plainly appear from considering the very nature of representatives from those junctures which can possibly give them an occasion of exerting their power and from matter of fact  it is implied in the very nature of representatives that they are backed with the power of those whom they represent as the demands of a plenipotentiary let his personal wealth or power be as little as you please have the same weight with them as if they were made by the person of his principal i will beg leave to borrow from the plebeian an example of the bank of england which as he makes use of it has no manner of analogy with the subject of the dispute is not the whole stock of that numerous community under the guidance of a few directors and will any one say that these directors have no other influence on the public than what arises to them from the share which they personally enjoy in that stock the author urges that the peers are principals which in reality is the reason why their power is not to be apprehended in opposition to that of the commons whereas were they only representatives of a body immensely rich and numerous they would beside their own personal property have such a support as would make them truly formidable the whole commons of england are the principals on one side as the lords are the principals on the other and which of these principals are armed with most power and property  to consider in the next place those junctures that can possibly give them an occasion of exerting their power it is on both sides supposed to be in such cases as will affect the rights of the english commonalty in which case every commoner of england is as much concerned as any of their representatives thus if four london citizens to make the case exactly parallel were deputed to maintain the rights of their principals as citizens who can imagine that they would not be supported by the whole power and property of the city and not be too hard for any two or three great men who had ten times their personal estates now as the plebeians supposition reduces things to the last extremity it can only take place in a rupture which is never likely to happen and in that case as these two great bodies must act separately there is no room for considering how far the concurrence of the house of lords is necessary in a money bill which entirely takes away the authors reasoning in his   th page  but matters of fact are the best arguments we both agree that power arises out of property and the author himself has given an instance of the power of the house of commons in having been able to effect the ruin of the monarchy and peerage whence had the commons this power but from being supported by their principals  the plebeian thinks he strengthens his point by adding that the lords are a fixed body to this i might reply that the principals of the house of commons are as fixed a body as the lords and therefore however their representatives may vary they will continue intent from age to age to assert and vindicate their peculiar rights and privileges unless we can believe that any body of men will act against those two strong motives of selfinterest and selfpreservation i might further venture to say that men of the greatest wealth and weight in the house of commons are almost as sure of a seat there as if it came to em by inheritance but supposing the house of lords never so much fixed and so manageable by two or three great men for which very reason additions are very often made to em which the alteration would prevent we have seen that their united power if their number is limited can never be a match for that of the house of commons supposing still such a rupture as the plebeian all along imagines in which each body is to act separately for it self  the author in the remaining part of his pamphlet appears like every writer that is driven out of all his holds he endeavors to set the crown and the whole body of peers upon his adversary accuses him in effect of scandalum magnatum nay and gives very broad intimations that he ought to be indicted for high treason  i should not have given my self or the public all this trouble had i not been so peremptorily called to it by the last plebeian i do assure him my silence hitherto was not the effect of old age as it has made me slow but to tell him the truth as it has made me a little testy and consequently impatient of contradiction when i find my self in the right i must own however that the writer of the plebeian has made the most of a weak cause and do believe that a good one would shine in his hands for which reason i shall advise him as a friend if he goes on in his new vocation to take care that he be as happy in the choice of his subject as he is in the talents of a pamphleteer  finis
