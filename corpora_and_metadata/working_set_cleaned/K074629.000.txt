the land of the muses a poem in the manner of spenser  with poems on several occasions  by hugh downman ab  edinburgh printed for the author sold by a kincaid and j bell edinburgh and by r baldwin and richardson and urquhart london mdcclxviii  the land of the muses a poem in the manner of spenser  to dr thomas blacklock to thee to whom the equal hand of heaven though it deprived thee of external sight the better graces of the mind has given genius and learnings thews and judgements light and fortitude mid undeserved ills and wideembracing liberality each thought humane which the sweet bosom fills and decks the form of saintly charity these rhymes all roughly woven do i bear which thee alone to amuse first framed were flattery pursues the great when thee i praise who naught but thy good spirit have timpart while truth approves deny not of my lays the guerdon thy esteem and friendly heart preface if the author should say he did not heartily approve of compositions of this kind or admire the construction of the stanza or think the more highly of any person for clothing his thoughts in the phraseology of spenser it might be asked what induced him to write the following poem and how he came to lay it before the public as to the first question it owes its birth to accident alone as to the second he frankly owns that he flattered himself some merit would be found in it independent of the uncouth manner and antiquated dress in which it was to appear and this only he is sensible can justify the publication of it to a reader of taste and discernment  it may be proper perhaps just to mention the prior part of the fable of which this is to be supposed a consequence in the  th canto of the  d book of the fairy queen guyon and arthur journeying together arrive at the castle of alma which they find besieged by malaeger and his crew whom they engage and put to the rout they are courteously received by alma who shows them her castle in the chamber of memory they find two books one called the briton moniments the other the antiquity of fairy land an account of these takes up the  0th canto in the   th guyon departs on his adventures against the bower of bliss upon which the enemies of alma being emboldened return to the siege arthur sallies out against them and after a severe engagement overcomes their chief by squeezing him to death his squire brings him back to the castle covered with wounds  where many grooms and squires ready were to take him from his steed full tenderly and eke the fairest alma met him there with balm and wine and costly spicerie to comfort him in his infirmity eftsoons she caused him up to be conveyed and of his arms despoiled easily in sumptuous bed she made him to be laid and all the while his wounds were dressing by him staid the land of the muses a poem in the manner of spenser as if to be inserted in the  d book of the fairy queen between the   th and   th cantos argument the prince nigh cured of mortal stowers alma to entertain shows him dan phoebus magic bowers where the nine ladies reign i fools they who vainly ween that temperaunce her joyous sweet amenities denies to human kind or looks with sight ascaunce when they with liberal delights devise their ears to feed or gratify their eyes nothing she bids witholden that behooves him to ensue who nould be dempt unwise all sports and rational pleasaunce she loves but hates idle lust who ay at random roves ii when as the prince by fairest almas care was nigh recured of his woundez sore which he in hardy conflict had whileeer endured as against thilke felon arms he bare but him subdued withouten sword or spear as prudent leaches all in this agree that mind and body are conjoined near ne one without the other can be free she bent her thought to keep his mind in goodly gree iii so seated by his side unto his ear she framed her discourse in words most meet at times of chevisaunce and warlike geer and warrior knights who underneath their feet did trample death immortal fame to greet tho sagely would she change her talk and ply his listening sense with speech so honeyd sweet and moral thews of wise philosophy that he was rapt and inly ravished thereby iv and ever and anon would praisedesire open her rubin lips and featly sing her pensive notes but such as might inspire calm moods of tranquil stedfastness and bring to truest test and justest tempering ye would have sworn one of the heavenly throng was slid to earth upon melodious wing sich silver sounds weft the mild air along and sich the blandishment of her slowditted song v and eke shamesacedness with mellow lute her strains harmonious accompanied for she her instrument full well could suit new wanted in welldoing comely pride the prince his secret pleasure ne might hide but smit with love of glorious emprise felt his spright moved past utterance and fighd the living fire flasht from his gazing eyes and drenched in bliss unknown to vulgar soul he lies vi it chanced out one evening as these four did walk by thilke same rivers winding side from whence sir guyon launched which there did pour his bounteous stream watering the country wide the prince the coast which them opposed spied woods and fair hills in beautiful array and lawns which now the setting phoebus eyed beaming the last remains of golden day he saw and asked what land that was which yonder lay vii that is the land the gentlest alma said in which apollo and the muses dwell on which their blessings with great bountihed they cast abroad there by the living well of hippocrene they fix their happy sell there won at distaunce from the profane world with whose assairs they never mind to mell als jovisaunce is there with face unfurled and care and grief and carking pain far off are hurled viii and thousand dainty shapes inhabit there and unimagind forms by common mind to every single one of which a peer in other place on earth may no man find of purest nature and ethereal kind by the three graces seemingly bedight for in that realm their girdes the graces bind and liberty ay sporteth in their sight and there the virtues stray yrobd in stoles of white ix how may said then the prince a stranger gain thilke place which thou descriven have to see perdy most rarely brave is that domain ne speak i out of vaunting susquedry and losty vain conceit yet is in me a heart in which good nurture fixed the thew and love of seemly liberality not as a faytour false or spy i sue these bonnibels and fair depeinten imps to view x to me o briton prince she said is given  alma then smiled and smiled those other twain free enteraunce into that earthly heaven by young apollos self who there does reign als he to me has ordered to restrain and keepen back by force the rascal rout of noisy riotise his drunken train but never the ingenuous mind to flout ne wight of fair demeanor ever shutten out xi but now is well nigh time hence to be gone and supper ended take ourselves to rest now wakeful man wends by himself alone for bird and beast by somnus are yblest all but the beast of prey which is addressed to cruel slaughter on the helpless crew and philomela who with woe impressed her dolorous fate wails in sad measure due but softer than descent of nights fastfalling dew xii early the morn we will forth yede yfere and in a gondelay to yonder shore across the intervening ferry steer there on the many delices to pore of which twere tedious to recount the store thanks rendered tho the prince in mannerd wise for he was skilled in every courtly lore that night did sleep seant close his wakeful eyes and in the morn he rose with the bright suns uprise xiii alma prepared he already found for never she indulged in slothful bed but when the lark soared upward from the ground she ay would bid adieu to drowsihed tho forth they issued from that goodly sted and in due season to the ferry came fast by its brink the gondelay moored they see and eke the wight who steered the same of most welllooked mien goodculture was his name xiv the knight and lady he with joy on board did take then pushed with strong arm away and launched the vessel far into the ford tho he his painted canvas did display while kind gales in its swelling bosom play with speed they cut the stream as crystal clear or as the brighteyed titans piercing ray for not the smallest stain of spot was there but though the waves were deep the bottom did appear xv when as they did that shore approachen near girt with the cestus of eternal spring its evervirid banks the ambrosial air odours most exquisitely sweet did bring for zephyrus there ever fanned his wing and there did flora plentifully strew the ground with flowers which fragrance round them fling sweetscented flowers of every various hue that whilom in adonis happy gardens grew xvi how bin they landed in that pleasant place and now along the lilied shore proceed far as their eyne the widestretchd coast can trace the blithsome scenery they in silence read the prince in wonder lost gave fixed heed at every turn at every turn amaze sat on his cheek delightsome awe and dreed well might that prospect frailer wight have dazd he gazed and thought that there he could for ay have gazed xvii his fair conductress bade him cast his eyes to waken him from out his rapturous trance to where before the path they took crosswise over a velvet meadow did advaunce two beings of most pleasing amenaunce upon their foreheads gayety did sit their joyous girlonds in the wind did dance their cheeks were blooming red their feet were flit and treading the soft turf did leave no print on it xviii the one yclepd was youth the down began his features to aguise with decent pride ne might he older wax ne grow to man yet was that other given him for his bride of whom he got a son who by his side renning in merry mood for ay did smile hygeia did his spouse the name betide with her he took no note of time the while it passed by so well each hour she could beguile xix that tender imp he guided by the hand with face speaking his heart so airy light he has benempt content though he be scanned a boy great power dwells with that wight for whomsoeer he looks on his spright is with complacence filled and jocund glee an infant babe simplicity behight the mother bore of lovely hue to see stretching his little arms and telling his cale free xx them alma gracefully ybording said tell me ye gentle pair if ye have seen where widely your enchaunted feet have strayed among the mazes of this flowery green where fancy wonneth now for well i ween she has no certain bidingplace of rest but now the shade she seeks now the sheen now flitteth north now south now east now west all pleasure she does love variety the best xxi to her with countenance blithe did youth reply the words from his quick tongue ydropping fast if fancy you do seek fair dame perdy in yonder glen with high rocks overcast from whence a tumbling torrent froth has brast i saw her even now so louting low he with his bellamour away did haste right onward alma and the prince did go then why she fancy sought he fain of her would know xxii without her aid o prince said alma fair to travel through this coast were endless stower ne without her direction would i dare convoy thee as behooves a single hour besides she builded has a wondrous tower which hence thou see high in the air ypight from whence is viewed distinctly dell and bower and rock and stream and every living wight and every goodly thing with which these realms are dight xxiii unto the which if thee she will convey in portion small of time she can unfold what else would take up many a weary day and many a sleepless night for to behold ne ever so at last you prosper would but after muchell labor and sojourn some forest dark your wilderd feet would hold or ye would sink crossing some roaring bourn or to the whence ye came ye idly would return xxiv soon might they now behold that maid divine upon a craggy cliff she took her stand above her head spread a broad branching pine which sent a dark shade round on either hand down many a thousand yard of rising land from rock to rock a strong stream forced its way which there was blent in one accoiled band she joyant stood over the foaming bay and bathed her forehead in the floating dewy spray xxv when as the tread of stranger feet she heard eftsoons her eyes she thitherwards enhauncd which as the glitterand sunbeam bright appeared and quicker than the quivering levin glauncd and strait toward them with light step advauncd her goldentendrilld locks down from her head hung loosely wavering as to them bechauncd she never them confined in tie or bread but they most comely seemed when most dishevelled xxvi in thin habiliment she was bedight of cunningly inwoven gossmer twined most curious was that garment to the sight and on the lap of the soft dalliaunt wind which it sustained disported far behind its color was of every various dye which in the glorious bow of heaven we find and every intermingled shade the eye could ever ken was there in vast complexity xxvii in that retired vale oftimes she sat where nature strayed wild by art not found but not therein immewed was her state nor yet ypent in any fixed bound free and at large she raungd creation round or breaking through the brazen gyre would steer her flight with cheek not blanched nor heart astound the din of chaos and confusion hear ne all the everbickering elements would fear xxviii there if she willed new worlds of her own she would create and them impeople too and in the midst upbuild her splendent throne exacting from her subjects homage due tho in a moments space these worlds new and each thing in them would annihilate her pregnant will she ever would pursue for she alone most wondrous to relate except highreigning god was uncontrolled by fate xxix often to the heaven of heavens she would ascend and through the impenetrable blaze would try boldly her peering vision to extend and into the mysterious godhead pry where far above the staryflaming sky his seat is circled deep with glory bright  in his trinal triplicity on high but never could she pass that lustrous light highreigning god alone escaped her thrillant sight xxx yet sich her sway that she to earth could bring from their eternal steds angelic quires who round about her gently hovering tuned at her will their goldenstringed lyres or maugre dernful plutos grisly fires would cleave the earth and rowse to upper air the furies with their whips of iron wires and snakes loud hissing in their troubled hair and hecate at her call would her dread front uprear xxxi with them all ills would rise that shun the light sternlookd revenge hate by wild frenzy torn and each abhorred child of ugly night lust ever restless jealousy oerworn mean murder of each generous mind the scorn and pining care which in her sickly plume inshrouds while yet alive the wretch forlorn and woe whose heart by inches does consume hanging with face all pale over her dead lovers tomb xxxii and she would call the unbodied ghosts around with shrieking note uttring their dolorous wail and witchcraft mumbling forth her rites profound might make the stoutest living wight to quail and conscious fear who secretly does steal keeping close watch beside the murderers bed and when sleep gins his tired lids to veil and wrap the poppied purfle over his head rings her alarm wild and rends his soul with dread xxxiii yet nothing was there fearful in her face or terrible to the beholders view but in her was an amiable grace a lovely and a modest blushing hue which mingled with respect loves passion drew and winning smiles her features freed from scorn and ye might read her straying veins quite through her alabaster skin and so adorn she looked like the eldest daughter of the morn xxxiv now she the gentlest alma first addressed welcome fair virgin to these blissful bowers then tenderly did clasp her to her breast and hail to thee sir knight can aught the powers who here inherit aught the winged hours the graces and the virtues thee to please for thee to please beloved of heaven no stowrs they would refuse apollos self would seize the occasion and myself thy servant am always xxxv o passing fair alma to her replied this gentle knight the knight full low did bend no impe of riotise or boastful pride i to thy favor strenuously commend my strong deliverer and steadfast friend o bear him to thy tower ypight on high or with him through these dainty regions wend that he the deft inhabitants may spy and feed with wonderment his knowledgesearching eye xxxvi she answered not but with most sweet aspect taking the prince and lady by the hand eftsoons she did them from the ground erect and through the air swift as the levinbronde or if than it can swifter thing be connd darted upright ne did she stop ne stay till on her lofty espial they did stand whence they the girding heavens might survey and earth and ocean wide which low unneath them lay xxxvii it was a noble work for to behold for neither was it built of stone ne lime ne was there irn ne brass ne lead ne gold ne roman cement ne asphaltile slime to bind the parts and knit withouten rhyme but it was all one piece of lucent glass and edifyed by her in shortest time yet though both thin and seeming frail it was no work on earth could it in lastingness surpass xxxviii with rare imagined portraicts it was strowd landscapes and histories by her designed for what she saw when raunging far abroad she took her flight and left thilke tower behind that from the storehouse of her heedful mind she would display before a painter fair who every form with skilful hand defined and fetisely bedight with colors rare description was her name a virgin debonair xxxix her pencil was most delicately fine and light and strong the sketches which it drew and beautifully did her colors shine for the clouds checkered tints she in them threw and the first drops of pearly morning dew auroras blush too when she first did wake from venus smiles from cynthias silver hue from floras mantle from the greensea lake and all dame natures works she did her colors take xl a reverend eld the palate there did hold and every color set in proper place his piersent eye his perfect senses told the wrinkles did become his ancient face and eke his hoary beard hung down with grace judgment he hight his precept she obeyed for he could teach her every stroke to trace full many a time her youthful hand he stayed when wantonly or when through carelessness it strayed xli the briton prince with curious regard the labors of these busied twain did see till fancy calling him away debarred his eyne intent on that imagery forthwith to her his step he hasted free tho he and alma seated by her side on a high battlements extremity she waved her hand then bid them thrown wide their looks toward the right and see the countrys pride xlii they looked and beheld a country rare the laughing meadows were with flowers bespread the rose their shining queen the lily fair the cowslip drooping down his fainting head the pink and tulip gay embroidered daisies and violets and all the crew which sweet impunging smells odorous bred or nature with bright stains did imbrue there sdaining touch of art uncultivated grew xliii and here and there did murmuring rivers stray flowing entrailed in meanders clear now all so smoothly making gentle way with dimpling surface that though placed near the swain their progress onward ne might hear now broke by mossy stones did hoarsly brawl and prisoner took the willing thralled ear or bounding over a ragged rocky wall from rift to rift in many a cascade did fall xliv and up and down were many tufty groves lifting their heads in glory flourishing around whose trunks the honeysuckle roves and scented jessamine is wandering and purple grapes hung thickly clustering and thousand thousand feathered songsters lay concealed and melodiously did sing while every bough and every treeen spray waved their consenting leaves and gladlier seemed to play xlv and on the flowery meads and plains they spy fair flocks of sheep nibbling the tender green or ruminating as adown they lie or wanton sporting in the sunny sheen and where or rock or rising hill is seen the frisking goats their antic gambols made and jolly keepers both did keep from teen who in the open sun or secret shade tuning uneven pipes their amorous descants played xlvi soon did they see where from a grove issued the goatfoot pan playing a merry fit pleasant it was but rather rustic rude him followed dancing trimly to that dit a crowd of fawns and satyrs who with flit and active giambeaux beat the hollow ground while with them hand in hand their partners knit the looselyrobed dryades rebound their hair with oaken wreaths and palm and ivy crowned xlvii they passed on and next most pleasing sight the god of love borne on a gentle lamb not he who armed dire by savage spite and taught those cursed arts which sure i am have with disgraces shent his cruel dam and als himself and crowds of wretches slain with whose sad carcases the grave to cram and crowds of wretches who alive remain have murd up with despair and evergnarring pain xlviii this winged boy a gentle mind did bear as gentle as the beast which him upbore ne could he see the unhappy drop a tear but it would make his breast with pity sore and he himself would weep and grieve therefore he was not blind and from his looks did fly the horrid face of lust embossed with gore and grovelling mean deceit and calumny and by his side did won the maid sincerity xlix before her breast she bore a crystal vase in which her inmost thoughts were all portrayed that ye each hidden sentiment might trace with this she often has villainy warrayd and made him stooping hide his felon head guarded with this she fears no secret harms but walks secure as tho she were arrayed in strong defense by force of magic charms or girded firm with coat of mail and scaled arms l on the other side holding a rosy band with which that lamb she guided in the way or when his rider list him still to stand did softly check his pace and mildly sway wended fair innocence her to survey the angels would from heaven on balmy wing gliding in mortal air their limbs embay in the other hand a serpent with fell sting she held which licked her face ne any scathe did bring li the next a nymph her countenance displayed blithe was her look unequal was her air her lineaments might no one ever read ne yet the color of her garb declare both of them every moment changing were that fickle nymph had novelty to name of admiration she the loved fear her frequent change did his light heart inflame and looking on her greedily he onward came lii behind them one twisting with all his might a skein of silk which in his hand he bore yet tho he always strained it full tight no single thread would yield or break therefore a swain who friendship hight in human lore and by his side another goodly swain called sansselflove of mind most firm and sure for he that other to secure from pain would naked rush on spears or plunge into the main liii and now advanced the wight whom first they met and with her babe that spouse so fair to see to him full firmly bound in wedlocks net and eke that other pledge of mutual gree and close behind was virgin chastity bearing in her cold hands a lump of snow which though the warm west winds around her flee received no impuritie or flaw ne ever lost its white ne ever would it thaw live long time she had betrothed bin i ween unto a comely youth of mickle praise fidelity full steady was his mien his eyes on her engrafted were always yet sich their look they ne might her displease this hand a golden sunflower did sustain still turning to the sun her constant rays that a cameleon in a diamond chain which him ins native hue for ever did restrain lv and many more whom time to tell would fail the prince and alma from their airy height might see with thilke same bevy fair to sail there passed by the sister graces bright and liberty unveiled her peerless light benevolence and gratitude yfere beauty all over lovely to the sight there heartfelt ease and leisure ever dear and happy indolence and peace brought up the rear lvi then fancy waved her hand but oh how strange what at that potent motion ensued alack a day how sudden was the change black was the sky the blustering wind blew rude instead of company was solitude instead of gladsome sights a doleful glade in which no cheerful vision might intrude for luckless plaint as it beseemed made ah woe is me so soon all human glories fade lvii forth came an hundred nymphs with solemn tread and flaming tedes in hand and then a queen as seemed by the crown upon her head of beaten gold and her right royal mien her eyes with aweful dignity gave sheen her crimson vestment flowed in stately pride which likest scythian tomyris was seen when stained with persian blood she cyrus eyed or bold bonduca when in roman slaughter died lviii her left hand held a bowl with poison fraught which working quick dispatch was sure to kill her right a dreadful dagger sharply wrought which to the wight who list his blood to spill she gave and bade him execute his will or if the bowl he chose to end his days she stooped it down and told him drink his fill impurpled buskins on her legs she wore which with a golden clasp yclasped were before lix behind her was a wretch with garments rent hollow his cheeks and pale his dreary face he moved as tho with weakness all forespent yet not uncomely was his weary pace and his eyes gleamed with a languid grace misfortune hight him in a brazen chain adversity most cruelly did brace and tho he seemed faint and well nigh slain she nould him ever spare but dragged him on amain lx and ever and anon her arm on high she would uplift which with an iron whip adawd and scowl on him with threatening eye and oftimes would his clothes with fury strip and to the bones the skin therewith would rip that he poor man would miserably groan yet not an evil word would he let slip his virtue she not heeded nor his moan her heart had long ygo transmewed bin to stone lxi behind him came with sweet aspect and bland the fairest and the loveliest maid i ween that ever yet on earthly mold did stand or ever was by mortal eyesight seen when as she viewed that misers doleful teen o god how did she lift the heavy sigh what would she give he might relieved been for him she could almost with pity die so feeling was the soul of tender sympathy lxii her beauty showed more lovely for the tears which all besprinkled had her face most meek as for that wight beset with cruel fears in vain they ren down over her heavenly cheek and blushing pudency sat mantling there darting her beams the pearled moisture through so seemingly enshrined as does appear through a thin cloud aurora to the view or a sweet rosy bud through the clear ambient dew lxiii two little cherubs did before her fly one in his hand a golden censer bare which underneath her face he did apply and therein latched every precious tear which filled he gave up to the others care who to the throne of all oerswaying jove plying his purple plumes aloft did steer he thilke same offering received with love and shook with gracious sign his nectard locks above lxiv next came remorse his haggard eyes down bent in ghastly silence glard upon the ground but soon inflected inwardly were sent as if to perse into his breast profound there as tho tenting to the quick a wound would wring his hands in agony of pain or wildly toss them in the air around ah foredone wight thou but turmoilst in vain the sore full deep has fret and ever shall remain lxv now indignation with his eyes on fire welding a glitterand faulchion over his head his red cheeks blushing with becoming ire his stern brow frowning with a comely dread for ay he was by reason maistered he with that faulchion fain would do to die a snaky monster foul illfavored guilt who distraught with fear away did fly nor tho at distaunce got dared turn her craven eye lxvi next horror harrows in his hand he bore with which he felly harrowed up the soul and all her finer senses rent and tore so that his ravin she might not control but he there reigned king and kesar sole and hopeless love a shaft quite through her heart had passed the wound she wrapped in her stole still struggling to conceal her deadly smart and like a stricken deer pined away apart lxvii and many more attendant on that queen their resience in thilke dark glade did keep there wonnd suspect her face all sickly green excess of grief from whom no tears could creep vengeance who both his hands in blood did steep envy to her own mind the kestrel slave dissemblaunce who like crocodile could weep madness as wild as the enchauffed wave and melancholy silent as the midnight grave lxviii there too was brave disdain of deed that is base and there of tried spirit conscious pride and emulation which no second place would grant and mercy to the gods allied and stoic rigor which all vice defied and seemly zeal by true religion dressed and wedded love which death cannot divide and justice wellspring pure of public rest and filial piety with heavens first promise blessed lxix all that might rowse the soul of man was there all that to goodness might his bosom sway and rescue him from vices perlous meir for virtue marshalled all in just array that queen herself does her behests obey to her from first her origin she owes ne without her could reign a single day by her she order from confusion draws and all that diverse crowd acts as she gives them laws lxx and now at fancys bid began disappear the darksome dreriness which erst had blent the sun of heaven and hid his beamez clear and with it all that foreseen many went while he his chearing rays more clear outsent and now a public road before them lay it seemed as there was some city near for many a goodly troop passed by that way some rode some laughing walked some sung and some did play lxxi close by the road an archer took his stand his lowering brow announced vengeful ire two female forms were seen on either hand who him restrained within a certain gyre with sober counsel smothering his fire candor and truth but he was satire hight they taught him against whom he war should stire and when they pointed out the destined wight he drew his bow and him imperst with arrow bright lxxii those whom he so amercd with rigorous wound by an old beldam had been bred a pest ycleped vice some in disguises found others more openly that road to infest and unsuspecting passengers molest but now did halt with limping pace along while infamy sat grinning on their crest they joined not in dance or jovial song but shunned and hated skulkd at distaunce from the throng lxxiii nathless when as his two companions cast their eyne aside he would with motion sly a shaft from forth his quiver snatch in haste and with insatiable cruelty at travelers of goodly grace let fly which rueful scathe when as the virgins scanned to their assistance renning hastily they poured in oil and balm with healing hand but him with threats affrayd and bitter reprimand lxxiv onward a little space there wonnd a dame behind a vizor she aguisd her face socks on her feet she had as her became and her loose garb fell down with easy grace always attending constant on her pace a selcouth hag a flaming brond who bore her name was secret knowledge of disgrace a dwarf hight ridicule was placed before who a large burnished mirror stead of target wore lxxv into thilke mirror led by vanity and folly vain their semblaunces to view most of the silly crowd who passed by with idle mirth and wantonness nigh drew but so deformed did they therein show they nould confess themselves to be the same until that hag sprung from her hidden mew who dashed into their cheeks her brond of flame and they retreated thence all covered with shame lxxvi but oh what tongue what language may suffice with ample spirit fitly to express the scenes that potent queen now bid arise my simple numbers cannot aptly dress in meet array ne yet their glory guess when she the briton prince and eke his guide with liberal kindness bounteously to bless unfolded to their sight ne yet envied the regions where the lofty epic does reside lxxvii as though by power past human from his bed in nightly sleep a wight should snatched be and cross the sounding seas be hurried then waking in the morn with wonder see himself in an unknown and strange country before the amazons huge flood latefound beyond an open realm uprising free by the vast towering cordilleras bound and on the other side the atlantic waste profound lxxviii so in amaze the briton prince was lost for now down deepsunk valleys rough and steep huge rapid streams rolling his vision crossed now without meir an ocean wide and deep on which the lingering winds did seem to sleep but soon with angry mood a whirlwind blew no longer might it now its calmness keep but all with foamy wrath enraged grew and from the fouldring clouds the levin gaunt outslew lxxix now on the champion ground he might behold castles which seated were in pleasant site and single knights armed in glistring gold with ladies by their sides of beauty bright to whom they told fair tales of loves delight or else for their protection combating with monsters fell courageously did fight or in round lists each other conquering to them the trophies of their victory did bring lxxx now heard he braying trumpets numberless the martial blast did his bold bosom thrill eftsoons two large enraunged armies press the plain they shout they join they fight they kill and the engorged earth with carnage fill tho saw he where the mountains rose on high striding from rock to rock from hill to hill a giant form whose head arraught the sky among the stars empight his name sublimity lxxxi these done away a cloud of blazing sheen floating upon a forked hill appeared the brightness well nigh blent his feeble eyes and from behind sich music was there heard he thought himself to heavens height upreard and the great weight of pleasure scarce could bear ne wonder was it that he sich rapture shared when jove himself would often stoop his ear from high olympus top thilke harmony to hear lxxxii where the thin edges of that cloud did reach he might as twere part of a temple see but though he strained his eyes to the utmost stretch they nould its shape distinguish perfectly yet it most gorgeous seemed for to be but through the middle of that cloud so bright from whence issued the dulcet melody he could by no means cast at all his sight the oftener he looked the stronger blazed the light lxxxiii and now said she o prince what to thy view i might disclose thine eyes have briefly seen so much was to thy fair conductress due to perse that dazzling cloud thou see i ween thou must all over have besprinkled been when thou were born with dews of castaly and thrice three times been dipped in hippocrene there on his throne apollo now i see and there the muses sit each in their just degree lxxxiv yet even these thou shall behold in time but first thou many hardy fights must wage and travel over many various clime and with thy countrys deadly foes engage and curb the saxons haught with strong menage tho they themselves shall take thee by the hand and to that building with safe tutelage conducted thou in glorys fane shall stand and thy renowned name be read in every land lxxxv this saying she a privy door unbarrd which led a winding passage to the ground for though to climb up to that tower was hard down to descend was always easy found when they now touched the bottom of the mound many great thanks gave alma to that dame and eke the prince with humbless most profound she

darkness braid still rest in silence if the lust of fame entice thy voice to sing the meanest of mankind a king whom vice and tyranny inspire i   the worthless great to praise befits the hirelings prostituted pen who sells for fordid gold his venal lays though often along the winding seine though often in days of elder date on the green margin of the tuscan stream dazzled by pomps external state the ignoble bard has strung the glozing lyre of specious falsehood yet the british muse freeborn should spurn the illusive theme and fraught with conscious dignity refuse on follys sons to waste her sacred fire or soothing regal grandeur weave for undeserving pride her everblooming wreathe ii   such caution here is vain those fabling strains nor george requires neither art thou inclined to spare where truth shall point the way thy progress he desires and thou secure from harm shall onward fly directed by her steady ray should meager envy scowl thy steps before and grimlythreatning lance keen arrows from her poisonous eye unmoved thou shall advance smile in her face without a wound hear her fierce serpents hiss around and all her illshapd monsters howl ii   chaste virgin say where shall begin the song before my eyes so various are the forms which stray that all confused my mind and smit with wild surprise scarce keeps its proper function here behold upon a craggy rock reclined high stretched out over the main despair and horror on her faded brow sits gallia while her arms enfold the anguish of her breast as now wide over the deep she looks now over the exhausted land her humbled power she weeps thick falls the briny rain ii   changed is the scene and here suppliant the savage chiefs of indian race in lowly guise with aspect meek appear the rugged features of their face no more with death and terror clad often wont with wild foot through the dreary shade to range with slaughter often when mad with rage and hot revenge and fierce desire of blood and prey in the dead silent night for still repose and slumber made have raised the awakening yell of dread affright have basely slain the unresisting sire the babe from its fond mother tore soon weltring in her own

  say will the lyric muse the themes of tender love refuse though she with haughty state presides over the big tumultuous tides which down the sacred mountain pour and stun the ear with deafening roar yet where more gentle currents stray and through the slowery valleys play laughing with transport as they flow where roses and where myrtles grow she has ever now been often found to scatter her enchanting blessings round     long in the grecian isles retained by cytheraeas smiles enamored of her rosy hue while frolic pleasures round her flew stole from her lips the nectard kiss and bathed their lightplumd wings in bliss while hebe danced with graceful tread and the soft airs and passions led while sallying from her temples porch young love waved high his magic torch thou too with sweetest look appeared and often thy melodious voice was heard     have thou forgot the melting strain which taught by thee thy sappho sung when stretched upon the lesbian plain over her the form of tender pity hung did thou not bountifully shed thy visions over anacreons head and even the frozen breast of age in amorous nets and toils engage while all the virgins wondering stood and laughed yet found themselves subdued and when he immaturely died say did not grief thy heavenly beauties hide ii   on what wideseated shore do mortals now thy name adore celestial love thy haunts of old what clouds of darkness now enfold instead of the pure incense bright which then diffused a genial light within thincircled haram reign tyrannic lust and jealous pain bitter constraint internal fears lean anguish and corroding cares unknown are there the mutual sighs which from the sympathetic breast arise ii   thy more than human mien by tiber has of yore been seen and ere the roman eagle flew the sons of britain to subdue with native innocence allied happily thy power did there reside but big with plentitude of woes from the rank earth a pest arose nature his shape with grief espied and for her deathdoomd offspring sighed they sunk beneath an easy prey and love fled far from avarice away ii   did thou then seek columbias strand there thy propitious forehead show while raised by thy creative hand the blooming flowers of social rapture grew too short a time alas from thence did thou thy radiant gifts dispense behold the impetuous monster haste rapine and violence and waste follow attendant on his flight and lo before thy pitying sight weltring in blood thy people lies to cursed gold the fated sacrifice iii   by force exiled ah where did thy insulted steps repair some island in the southern main perhaps enjoyed thy bounteous reign or did thou steer thy vagrant course to orellanas distant source there while in artlessness arrayed the youth beholds his sunburned maid there while of every wish possessed he leans with fondness on her breast thou see them in the palmy grove and over their heads thy purple pinions move iii   there too the heavenly muse showers perchance her kindly dews while thus some indian horace sings as to his love he strikes the strings  ah when you praise my rivals charms  his jetty neck and sable arms  with passion swells my fervid breast  with passion hard to be suppressed  my senses float in terrors vain  my blood retreats and comes again  the tears steal down my cheeks and say  with what slow fires i totally decay iii   oh if with me ye gentle powers ye sometimes would but deign to dwell born by the quicklycircling hours if ye would visit my sequestered cell one who with purest passion glows who not the face of avarice knows nor by ambition drawn aside but owning nature for his guide who from his earliest day of youth confessed her charms and worshipped truth ye in that secret cell should find and subject to your laws a willing mind ode i   who with ungoverned tongue will blame the verse the eternal muse inspires the soulilluminating flame kindled at heavens own sacred fires who but the wretch of narrow mind whose sentiments were never refined from the vile dross whose base alloy condemns him still to plod along but one degree above the bestial throng unconscious of each nobler source of joy i   yet though unto the srigid ear of native dallness every strain of melody uncouth appear and all the gists of science vain though dazzled by the blaze of light vice starting turns away her sight from where the muses fix their sway though cruelty revenge and strife and all the plagues which harrass human life keep far aloof and tread a distant way i   thy sons o virtue with respect sincere bend lowly down before their holy shrine to them they offer up the spotless prayer and bless the influence of the powers divine all who with more exalted thought have wisdoms valued precepts sought all who with pure emotions blessed love beauty by the graces dressed all who to bounteous nature just dare her instinctive feelings trust the muses hallowed votary approve enjoy his considence and share his love ii   hence then away ye vulgar crew such would i have condemn my lays but hither turn ye worthier few emboldned by whose genuine praise let the halfsould coldblooded friend sneer while assecting to commend let the unfeeling fool laugh loud to you alone the bard his lyre shall strike and quitting every mean desire soar far beyond the falselyjudging crowd ii   unhappy is the poets fate the intrinsic value of whose name all will pretend to estimate and at their will commend or blame empty deceit as if their eye could trace the lightning through the sky pursue the comets devious maze or looking on the blue profound where not the fathomline could ever sound pierce to the bottom with a single gaze ii   ah wretch to whom it is given to possess superior strength and energy of mind unless he is planted in a sphere to bless even against their wills perverse mankind else mingling with the common train full of themselves he speaks in vain of if they hear his voice is styled extravagant excentric wild because his reason does not lie level with their capacity because his active sense springs tward the goal and dwelling not on parts takes in the whole iii   or if their weakness to befriend over his own thoughts he cast a veil reflections serious brow unbend and her intenser rays conceal they view him with familiar eyes and being like themselves despise  o contradicting law the chain of nature draws with all its power to mix in life and seek the social hour indignant reason goads us thence again iii   she proves how vague the hope how blind which on external good relies which seeks for aught among mankind to gratify the just and wise ah where then should the bard remove whose song the choral nine approve or where the sage whose breast disdains the holy jugglers wily cheats where but to those retired and still retreats where solitude close leagued with virtue reigns iii   hers are the graces hers the winning charms which the fixed bosom from conviction please from necessary choice within her arms we wish to spend the remnant of our days not so in our first greener years new to this world of vice and cares by flattery taught for what is fame but a delusive idle name fading before the living breath  though having passed the vale of death she may with vain solicitude return and deck with fruitless wreathes the funeral urn ode i how lives the man whose thoughts have broke imperious customs servile yoke him nature guiding by the hand leads on where truth and reason stand virtue her mantle round him flings and honor waves her silver wings he does not yield to foreign laws but wisely courts his own applause health sits inthroned in his eye and innocence walks smiling by ii when sunk into the vale of years his head the hoary foliage bears he backward casts his tranquil sight and views each scene reflected bright no sullen damps his joy infest no plagues of avarice tear his breast him willing duty hastes to serve and strains with zeal each laboring nerve while love sits gazing on his face intent the latent wish to trace sonnets wrote at inversnaid in scotland in the year      sonnet i hence sickness nor about my weary head thy languid vapors wrap and drooping wings better would

chills though born far off under a milder sky the northern blast even through my marrow thrills and freezes up the lifeblood in my veins the hardy natives over the mountains high trace out the step of health amid the snow or where over the gray moss her bare feet stray hence active nerves and scorn of danger flow hence when of late called forth to mortal fray at their approach revenge more furious grew war smiled while triple rage new steeled his heart pale bloodless fear turned to a ghastlier hue and death more dreadful shook his pointed dart sonnet iii when recollection stirs up in the mind

the haughty thane his subject train held at his will and in consinement strong fettered the servile crew and with stern reign led them in in shackles like brute beasts along no will they ever of their own enjoyed but bent implicitly to his control now by degrees they find that liberty opens the narrow foldings of the soul and they too dare to boast that they are free no more with rapine they the fields infest or seek out slaughter in her secret den but by the laws of equal justice blessed humanely think and feel that they are men a picture of human life elate with hope and her enlivening fires i rushed impetuous over the fields of youth i gave up all my soul to gay desires and fancys dazzling form mistook for truth she held her magic glass and strait i saw a youth with rare accomplishments endued perfect he seemed nor quickly did i know that struck with wonder of myself i stood when known a transient blush overspread my face selflove soon took the sanguine stain away increased each mental visionary grace and decked each feature with a brighter ray wellpleased the treacherous nymph o youth she cried point thy ideas to the highest aim why are superior virtues still untried why does not worth its lawful honors claim inactive rise lift thy aspiring brow thine be the joys of wealth of power of fame let thy young breast with emulation glow behold the noblest and be thou the same fool that i was with giddy transport blind i swallowed the sweet sound with eager ear my eyes the latent poison could not find nor heart think evil of a shape so fair drunk as with wine methought i could attain to be of each admiring tongue the theme whether i willed the heroic palm to gain or haunt the laurelld shade of academe whether with love to waste the smiling hours to melt the captived virgins icy breast or wander in the muses roseate bowers weave the proud wreathe and dignify my crest methought my penetrating eye could dart through the black plots and mysteries of state pierce the thick foldings of the human heart and rule with judgements voice the deep debate wildly fantastic the fierce northern blast i might as soon with guiding rein have taught or dryshod over the billowy sea have past as into form have changed unbodied thought ye gay delusions whither are ye fled begot by health on fictions lovely form will ye never gently hover over my head with rapture never again my bosom warm say can thou bid old time with stealthy pace retread the paths his feet have trod before the sun mete backward his celestial race and well again our pleasing dreams restore again from the full fount of life thy blood swift bursting forth shall swell each turgid vein the enthusiastic spirits in a flood from each strong nerve shall fire thy kindling brain this fate withstands  and reason sternest guide contracts in narrower bounds the excursive view she plainly shows throughout the fleeting tide of life what airy bubbles we pursue by her does conscious diffidence and fear ambitions rage and fancys whims control the flighty purposes to youth so dear and that wild elasticity of soul hence then ye vain ye unsubstantial joys able the selfdeluded soul to bless  yet when alas among lifes real toys shall i such soothing happiness possess ode i put on o vice thy proper hue in thy own native likeness stand soon shall thou find thy subjects few thy throne upreard on sand abhorrent nature with surprise would turn away her loathing eyes ingenuous youth with pain thy monstrous shape would see covered with each toadspotted stain while writhing anguish and pale infamy stalk close behind too desperate to complain ii but cunning as thou art well do thou know the human heart its intimate recesses lie open to thy wily eye hence thou with many a mimick grace stolen from the virtues as of old unconscious of an enemy so near always open and sincere they stripped themselves to lave beneath a grot in the translucent wave have decked thy odious face iii thy unsuspecting lover thinks them true of cloudy vapors made a thousand dazzling forms parade before his cheated view a thousand pleasures move breathing mirth and social love some with quickdoubling feet and winning smiles advance in the mazy circling dance and then with more alluring step retreat iv others on waving wing such notes of lively transport sing or varying now their strain with such dying melody complain that guided by the enchanting sound and swallowed up in hearing every sense the cheated victim over the magic ground straying without defense his careless progress takes till lost among inextricable brakes or in the midst of some wild heath forlorn he finds himself at last hears nothing but the wintry blast which all his idle moanings flouts with scorn v fatigued and spiritless he lies nor dares from the cold earth to rise night closes in  ah where art thou celestial hope thy face the darkness shrouds  oh through the quickdisparting clouds appear and by the moons clear ray let him behold thy placid brow faithful companion of thy way by his golden lance well known and firmingirding adamantine zone bring resolution in a purple vest by the young unfledged moments dressed vi o raise him in your arms and while his veins yet flow with life while any strength remains bear him away with swiftest course for should sleep on him steal and with its dew his eyelids seal not even an immortal force could open them again no more shall he behold the sun of virtue pour its radiance from the morningsky black mists shall round him ever fly or he shall fall from some steep mountains brow overwhelmed by the deep flood that roars below the madness of aspasia curse on the wretch whoever he be that the fond maid betrays blasts unsuspecting innocence and snares for virtue lays who works upon an easy mind causes of anger feigns and to the fair who loves him well of cold disdain complains and when she opens all her soul seizes the unguarded time the sudden start of generous love and glories in his crime such cynthio such aspasia was in prime of earliest youth she a devoted victim fell to his pretended truth palled by possession though her soul was worth a kingdoms price yet all its charms could not retain the hardened slave of vice he gave her up to all the pangs which delicacy knows which conscious of reproach and shame from nicest feeling flows yet shall avengement sure though slow harass his guilty mind that pity he denied to her will be from him confined the grief the unutterable grief which to her sire befell no pen no other tongue but that of a fond sire can tell let us my friends says he find out where the afflicted strays let us if possible at least give her some little ease her bosom with the lenient balm of tender pity fill or sit in silent woe around as the mute mourner still but stay she comes along this path oh thou heartbreaking sight before my eyes this hour had seen would they would been steeped in night she is mad my friends i see it well i read it in her eye that wild glance thrown around bespeaks the extreme of misery she opes her pallid lips to speak o ruined excellence pour forth thy unconnected thoughts and reave me of my sense i have been to yonder wood to gather flowers there on a bank so steep i saw him lying fast asleep i stole on softly to the bowers no ear my silent step could hear for why should i awake or cause him from his sleep to start but a fierce snake my footsteps did pursue i nothing of it knew and springing on me eat out all my heart see what a frightful wound ah no it cannot now be found so i snatched up my flowers in haste and round my head have traced but they are too bright and gay as i wear them in my hair they make my complexion more faded appear away away away yet i have been as fair as they  but should they be betrayed  deprived of their bloom they would sink down to the tomb and be pale and wan like me be sure with them let my hearse be dressed and strew them over my earthly bed where i shall shortly lie when the cold turf supports my head i will take my fill of rest the worm shant hear me sigh but i pray you secret prove tell it not to my love nor let him that way go  for should he come in and see me look so thin his heart would burst in two no  he has quite forgot he says he knows me not now in my misery and will you believe him too has madness seized your mind though you may think him true the faithless seas and wind are not more false than he methinks i cannot but smile that he should you beguile  i heed not what he says but stop up my ears and am deaf to his prayers in vain his slatteries he displays and tells me i am fair as the newfallen snow that my keen eyes have pierced him through that me alone he loves  no no when once deceived beware fool that i was i thought him true  oh snatch him snatch him from my view  yet ye tormentors set him free give him his liberty the pain his conscience brings is worse than all your racks of steel your whips and cruel stings i know what he must feel  he swore so holy was his flame that i should never know a pleasure or a woe but he should feel the same so bid the bridemaids come i will be dressed all in white  well take the damask room  it is long before it is night  what say you lost it is all a jest it is not yet quite dark he stays till i am undrest  is that the morning lark not yet returned where fled where fled alas i knew it well i knew that he was dead although you would not tell i am wondrous cold my hands are clay  my blood in frost is bound  yet force me not away well lie in the same spot of ground under this marble stone i shall enjoy him all alone oh help my friends her shuddering limbs her interrupted breath and those convulsive strugglings speak the quick approach of death and are there powers in heaven above will they this sight behold then virtue droop thy fearful head exulting vice be bold oh take her gently from the ground alas she moves no more her mortal pilgrimage is past and mine will soon be over an elegy transposed from spenser when first before my youthful eyes i saw the form of sylvia move i gazed upon her with surprise but not one thought had i of love my soul grew fond of fancies vain tetchy and froward naught could please yet knew i not what gave me pain nor thought it love but some disease soon as the beauty of the sky night had defaced with pallid hue striving to sleep i down should lie but sleep away far from me flew instead thereof sad sighs and fears about me cruel watch maintained forth gushed the involuntary tears and sorrow then triumphant reigned if any drop of slumbering rest into my weary soul distilled what frightful dreams would then infest what horror through my bosom thrilled then up i from my bed should start and all my former grief renew think on that image in my heart and all its heavenly charms review all night a stranger to repose to ease a stranger all the day no sports no company i chose to solitude a willing prey thus cared i not abroad to spread youths plant when in its fairest prime but let it all neglected shed both fruit and flower before its time alas should this be love i cried too late the fatal cause i found in vain each lenient art i tried too deep had pierced the rankling wound nor other cure had i for grief but my hard fortune to deplore to languish like the fallen leaf and feed with plaints the impoisond sore thus tward the silent grave i paced thus by degrees decayed my frame till by the long and lingering waste i like a pined ghost became inscription for an arbor enter of welcome sure beneath this shade ye sacred few whose eyes can see with scorn the pomp of luxury who unseducd can leave behind the citys noisy hum and smitten with the charms of innocence pleased with

the dead sparrow of lesbia from catullus o venus o ye loves bewail and all who finer passions feel dead is the sparrow of my fair the sparrow who her tender care who her excess of fondness proved whom dearer than her eyes she loved for he the sweetest mind possessed conscious by whom he was caressed he never from her endearments flew not she her mother better knew but leaping round in wanton play twitterd to her the livelong day now goes he to the gloomy bourn whence no one ever may return perish ye fatal shades who spare nothing that is either good or fair now have ye snatched with ruthless mind the best and fairest of his kind o impious deed from cheerful day to force the little wretch away for whom my girl finds no relief her swelling eyes are red with grief to sleep where are the downy slumbers fled which hovered nightly over my head and soon as i my pillow pressed closed my eyes in sweetest rest by wakeful love forbid to stay alas too long ye keep away o come ye vagrant slumbers spread again your pinions over my head o long uncheard by sweet repose again my fainting eyelids close elegy the truest love is still reserved and shy no look of confidence or boldness wears known by the humble brow and softened eye and full of wavering doubts and anxious fears when i perceived that thespia had overcome my yielding heart and fixed her empire there that from her hands i must receive my doom and all my future weal must flow from her what dreadful strugglings did i undergo twixt native bashfulness and strong desire how did my senses fluctuate to and fro twixt soft respectful love and passions fire often did i wish the secret to have told but awe and modest dread too much prevailed her presence all my faculties controlled and every settled resolution failed at length with firm intent i sought the fair with firm intent to pour out all my heart to let her know the story of my care and the long misery of consuming smart her steps i to a secret garden drew she without guile went innocently free no ill suspecting for no ill she knew nor feared to trust herself alone with me at first to talk as usual i assayed hoping thereby to gain a tranquil air and as along the walk we slowly strayed plucked frequent flowers and stuck them in her hair but still my shortened breath fast went and came over my embarrassd limbs a stiffness hung my heart throbbd strong and shook my laboring frame and fears i know not how unnervd my tongue resolved to speak some secret power restrained ashamed and angry with myself i grew with crimson consciousness my cheeks were stained and quick again the conscious stains withdrew she whether unobservant all the while or else my strange confusion to relieve indifferently talked with careless smile but i to what she said no heed could give then changed my sickle mind its first design determined sudden on some future day then would i each perplexity untwine and every ardent with before her lay a transient calm succeeded in my breast yet sure thought i i have not so concealed but she the emotions of my soul has guessed perhaps she wishes too they were revealed though now my faultering tongue its aid denies she must have read the language of my soul nor have i marked displeasure in her eyes when forth from mine the glance of love has stole then turning round in haste as if afraid lest diffidence again might intervene not daring to erect my timid head my hesitating lips disclosed my pain elegy in nothing was i learned but only how to pen my flocks and drive them to the field in the strait furrow how to guide my plough and how my hoe and pruninghook to wield uncultivated was my mind and mean my abject thoughts low fastened to the earth till love with hand benign broke customs chain and bade me soar beyond my humble birth with beauty fired i looked around and saw the charms of nature never seen before o love a willing vassal to thy law i bend i feel thy blessings and adore prompted by thee as yet with trembling tongue i called the muses and desired their aid my woodnotes in the hazel copse i sung and caught the attention of the listening maid she listened to my strains she heard my tale while deepening blushes over her cheeks arise the soft consenting sigh my lips inhale i see the yielding languor of her eyes no true to love if ever i estrange for any other fair my thoughts from thee  why utter needless vows i cannot change it is impossible nor ever will be o love i own thy sway by thee my mind the face of lowlivd avarice disdains the common vice of passion unrefind the common vice among our country swains hence cares and troubles hence do they behold the state of riches with an envious eye they think not aught beyond the power of gold nor know how love can lift the soul on high o come my fairone i have thatched above and whitened all around my little cot i have shorn the hedges leading to the grove nor is the seat and willow bower forgot low is the path of life in which i move thou might perhaps have reached the higher sphere of wealth and noisy pride but faithful love and innocence and sweet content are here elegy still blooming health upon my thespias face through the clear surface let thy tints appear over every feature shed thy modest grace and let thy balmy smiles be ever there protect her where she goes ye gentle powers pure denizons of undulating air whether from glowing noontides sultry hours or evenings dewy shades protect the fair it is true my thespia i indeed confess that selfish are the prayers and vows i pay with no disinterested voice i bless the gods or pour the supplicating lay for ah from thee and from thy looks i find warm to my heart each cordial joy must flow sweetning the ills of life from thee my mind must taste its keenest sense of piercing woe thine is the masterkey each spring to rule each hidden movement of my secret thought sure thou were bred in some enchanters school who all his spells and mystic charms has taught yet then would holy truth with thee reside truth which unbounded confidence may trust yet then would mean deceit fly far aside and wild caprice confounding false and just would thou have said as i struck dumb with fear tremblingly pointed out my humble bower happily tranquillity and peace are there for them i scorn the gaudy farce of power o thou sincerest how shall i repay the endless debt of gratitude i owe quickly my fair point out to me the way and show the path for thou alone can show though silent is thy tongue thy speaking eye the modest blushes over thy cheeks which rove that deepdrawn breath that panting breast reply the sole return is tenderness and love and is that all and do thou ask no more whether i will or no i needs must give that gift nay lavish on thee all my store nor cease to love thee till i cease to live for ever rivetted within my heart thy loved thy dearest image shall remain whenever from thence i bid it to depart may i by some tremendous stroke be slain no common death i shall deserve to die to pine by inches on a barren strand scorched by the vengeful suns severest eye nor by one sportive wandering zephyr fanned to freeze on some bleak rock to glut the rage of howling beasts within the dreary waste or live in youth despised in helpless age the extremities of want and woe to taste to walk a moving plague among mankind shunned hated and refused the alms i crave the only thing i wish for not to find a still retirement in the peaceful grave in that fond hope to be deceived to hear with soul yet conscious in the churchyard way the fierce invective cast upon my bier and scornful laughter dancing over my clay all this and more i shall deserve to prove when led by changesul fancys wanton eye i turn a faithless truant to thy love and on the wings of vagrant falsehood fly elegy ah whence my thespia can that anguish flow that silent anguish of expressive woe that sigh which from thy struggling bosom stole that look which pierces to my inmost soul ah say my thespia i conjure thee say to me the hidden cause thou may display half of thyself i claim my lawful share yet would to heaven that i the whole might bear pour out thy thoughts in confidence to me thou must not hide from me thy misery from thee would i my laboring heart confine and are not all its deepest secrets thine wretch that i am am i who thee from pain to shield would pour out life at every vein am i the cause and could thou ever spy a look of coldness glancing from my eye to thee a cold blank look o too refined and subtle error of thy feeling mind a delicacy apt too deep to dive to each nice touch too tenderly alive though i esteem it as a blessing sent as the more polished minds chief ornament a sacred spark kindled by heavens own ray yet let not sensibility betray thou weepst where did my tongue profanely rove how could i blame thee twas excess of love o let me circle thee with strict embrace warm breast to breast and glowing face to face my fixed lips while speechless rapture ties imbibe the lucid moisture of thine eyes thy melting spirit in each breath inhale gaze on thee till my cracking eyestrings fail and quite oerpowerd by loves imperious sway feel all my fainting soul dissolve away elegy what have i done what crime in me is found what secret evil lurking in my breast that while all nature else is smiling round heaven has on me its heaviest stroke impressed have i ever dropped a wish of others harm or done an ill though never to be revealed have i not always breathed the emotion warm on the chaste lip of social virtue sealed ah is it not enough that far away from my own native happy fields i rove far from each friendly name condemned to stray and torn by cruel force from her i love but must through her the barbed steel be sent which piercing with severest torture wounds must she i love convey the punishment which justice self must own exceeds its bounds on me rain all your woes ye righteous powers though hard i will strive the misery to bear view sickness steal away my lingering hours on tainted wing nor drop a pining tear but ah the gentle virgins tender frame  o brighthaird chastity o angel truth if ye are aught beyond an empty name save save in pity innocence and youth shield shield me from the racking thought i spy from her cold cheeks the bland suffusion fled dead is the piercing magic of her eye the lustredarting beam of sense is dead she calls on me  oh snatch the last embrace woods rivers mountains countries intervene oh curse of curses never that lovely face again shall i behold even the last scene some dreary satisfaction might afford some solace to the madness of despair gloating in secret on his gloomy hoard with eye intorted viewing what is there finis
