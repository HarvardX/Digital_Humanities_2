the lady of the manor  a comic opera  price one shilling and sixpence  the lady of the manor a comic opera as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  written by dr kenrick  the songs set to music by mr hook  london printed for e and c dilly in the poultry j wilkie in st pauls churchyard t davies in great russel street covent garden and j walter charing cross mdcclxxviii  preface the outline of the following opera written about ten years ago by way of relaxation from severer studies was taken from the country lasses of mr charles johnson particularly the pleasing and romantic episode borrowed from the custom of the country of beaumont and fletcher  the author in accommodating his plan to the present taste was led of course to reject the revolting absurdity of supposing the custom in question still to subsist  the considerable alterations and additions also which he found it expedient to make both in the plot and dialogue have so much diversified the whole that it has been as truly as illnaturedly observed the piece resembles a coat stolen a second time from a thief so metamorphosed that the very tailor who first cut it out would not know the handiwork of his own shears  it is no wonder that in this age of originality so many trulyoriginal critics who never play at robthief themselves should sufficiently rally him on so artful and complete a transformation he cannot help thinking however that these very honest gentlemen are a little unreasonable in expecting him to do such great things merely for his amusement as are done by those who make playwriting their serious occupation  if therefore this opera has hitherto met with an approbation if it afford any consolation to the professional dramatists who envy him this approbation they may rest satisfied he is by no means disposed even to amuse himself any more the same way as general as even the best of their most elaborate productions the author cannot but impute it to the excellent acting of the theatrical performers and the elegant taste of the musical composer  the persons of the drama men sir wilful wildman mr quick young wildman his nephew mr vernon sir john manly mr mattocks farmer sternold mr wilson clodden mr doyle women lady lucy otherwise flora mrs mattocks mrs townly otherwise laura miss brown cicely the dairy maid mrs farrel the lady of the manor act i scene a fertile country a gentlemans seat at the top of a hill and a farmhouse in the center of the scene at the bottom the scene rises and discovers lady lucy and mrs townly dressed like country lasses accompanied

happy britons etc  exeunt sheepshearers singing and dancing lady lucy so you are heartily tired of your frolic i see    mrs town indeed i am my dear  they come forward lady lucy and was this fatiguing amusement all the pleasure you promised yourself from this wild project of our leaving the manorhouse and passing in this disguise under the names of flora and laura for relations of farmer sternold i hope you do not intend to romp about with these good folks again tomorrow   mrs town no child i was only willing to have another taste of your rural diversions before i left the country and i promise you i am fully satisfied of their rusticity i wish i could prevail on you to accompany me to london   lady lucy what to do there   mrs town to see and converse with human creatures my dear for i cannot look upon the things that have just parted from us in any other light than as a kind of intermediate beings between men and brutes they are certainly of an inferior nature to people who live in london   lady lucy and yet in the metropolis every thing is false frivolous and artificial while here all things appear in the plain and unaffected dress of nature   lady lucy simplicity daughter of truth in modestys vesture arrayed here breathes the fond hope of the youth and whispers the wish of the maid there artifice son of deceit in impudent foppery dressed with innocence playing the cheat still makes of true passion a jest  mrs town and yet my dear lucy people bred in society are as preferable to these clowns as angels are to mere mortals  how long do you think to live in this wilderness before you get a husband as i did by accident   lady lucy i should hope never were i so soon to lose him again as you did by accident   mrs town why not my dear if like mine he were as well lost as found the man dropped from the clouds to please my papa and taking pet at the world returned back again  to please me   lady lucy they say indeed that marriages are made in heaven   mrs town yes but they say too they are strangely broke in coming down   lady lucy in london perhaps where the multiplicity of objects puzzles the choice but out of the few that drop here in the country we may soon resolve to catch one and be assured my dear townly that when the right man comes i shall not let him slip through my fingers   mrs townly nay there is not much choice in the whole sex a mans but a man make the most of him mine they say was one of the best of them and you see i survived his loss   lady lucy you are too young and giddy to take any thing to heart   mrs town true cousin i wore the willow only with my weeds and that not a weeping willow neither   lady lucy you are a wild rake townly   mrs town we widows have a privilege child  but women are all rakes at heart so at least the poet says nay i will answer for it that with all your simplicity you have your female rakes in the country as well as we in town   mrs townly delightful is a rural life where peace and plenty reign where faithful every man and wife and true each nymph and swain the plain of plains the rural plain where such pure raptures flow but may i never see town again if such a plain i know believe me false the country clown as any london beau the rustic lass like miss in town can favors too bestow the town of towns dear london town thy pleasures then be mine deceit may dress in linen gown and truth in diamonds shine  mrs town to be serious my dear lady lucy i cannot conceive how any woman who has youth beauty and fortune at command as you have can take delight in wandering like a wild thing about the woods in gloomy groves and dismal shades when she might display her charms to so much greater advantage in the glittering circle of the pantheon or the brilliant vistas of vauxhall   lady lucy and i can as little conceive how any woman of sense or taste can be taken with the artificial amusements of the town when she might enjoy the pleasure of breathing the fresh air and contemplating the beauties of nature in the country   mrs townly and you do really prefer the pitiful employment of dangling after a flock of simple sheep to the superlative delight of having a flock of simple admirers dangling after you  as i live here they are   lady lucy who what   mrs town men men my dear social beings  see they are coming over the style my heart flutters at the sight of them does not yours

consequence of this visit to my whimsical uncle you should approve of his niece get into her good graces and marry her you will advance me a moiety of that ladys portion to be repaid on the death of

you farmer so much against london   stern the insolence and impertinence of its inhabitants  prodigal as i was i could not bear to be fleeced by a set of moneymaking sharpers who differed from coiners clippers and cutpurses only in being greater criminals with greater security  i could not endure the haughtiness of scoundrel upstarts who by taking advantage of the weakness or administering to the wickedness of mankind were enabled to assume the appearance of gentlemen and lolled at ease in the carriages which honester men were forced to drive   manly yet thus will it ever be sir while men are men and live in a state of society   stern no sir it is because men are not men that such pitiful doings disgrace society  it is because so many mean animals are ever ready to bend the knee and crawl
