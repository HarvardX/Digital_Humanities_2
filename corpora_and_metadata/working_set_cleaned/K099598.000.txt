great cardinal wolsey  i was conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity anno    0 so that i am double the age of my cousin stephen duck and have therefore you may rationally suppose ploughed harrowed and threshed twice as long and all to no purpose unless the good earl of macclesfield will likewise read some of my parnassianlabours to our most gracious queen but i live in hopes that his lordship will grant me this humble boon and that my kinsman and i may share one equal fate  as to my education the most learned dr arthur duck being my godfather i was by his interest got upon the foundation of etoncollege and having gone through my schoolstudies i was as well as my countryman thomas tusser for sometime a student in the university of cambridge in this seminary of the muses our almamater being peevish fretful and generally out of humor i could not so much as rhyme my self into a collegefellowship this i took as hudibras says in great dudgeon more especially since it is well known that the whole race of the ducks were born poets  i left kingscollege and came to assist my parents in their farmingbusiness at ipswich where i soon found that corn and hops came to a much better market than greek and latin though in this first part of my rusticmiscellany i hope the impartial reader will discern i never invoked the muses in a barn   upon the death of my intestate parents being an only child there fell to me by right of inheritance a very decent countrylegacy viz good store of grain the pastures well stockt with cattle provender for their wintersustenance and a round sum of money but as horace says my wayward wandering mind did not approve my happy state i was inclined to rove   and soon experienced the fatal consequences attending such a temper in short i had no notion of foreign travel nothing would serve me but making the tour of changealley where in that memorable year of chronology    0 i fell a victim on the altar which made a daily sacrifice both of cit and bumpkin  thus having sunk the scholar in the farmer and the farmer having undergone a south sea ship wreck i am now reduced to my kinsmans pristine vocation of god speed the plough  my wages are indeed five shillings and sixpence per week our county of suffolk giving one shilling more than they do in wiltshire though alas at this price it is with great difficulty that buckle and throng as we say are brought together however i am in hopes of seeing better days redeunt saturnia regna  to conclude in one word my sole trust is in my noble patron therefore whatever through carolinas hand is sent i will praise earl macclesfield and be content   arthur duck p s i intend god willing to publish a second part of this miscellany before the meeting of the parliament by way of newyearsgift    roger and ursula or love in a hogsty i gaffer and gammer were fast in their nest and all the young fry of their cribs were possessed spott whitefoot and puss in the ashes were laid and a blinking rushcandle burnt over their head and a blinking rush etc ii ursla was washing her dishes and platter preparing to make her good friend the hog satter greased up to the elbows as much to the eye till her broidered clothes were even ready to fry till her broidered etc iii close by her roger the plowman lay snoring cupid being vexed at his clownish adoring did straightway convey to the great loggerhead the whispering news that they all were in bed the whispering etc iv upstarted roger and rubbing his eyes to his dearest sweet ursla in a passion he flies then leaning his elbows on urslas broad back he complained that his heart was even ready to crack he complained etc v ursla being vexed at the weight of her love cried cupid why do thou thus treacherous prove in an angry mood she then turned her about and the dish clout lappd over the face of the lout and the etc vi roger being angry at such an affront and not at all minding what would come on it he gave her a kick with such wondrous mettle as tumbled poor ursla quite over the kettle as tumbled etc vii at the noise of this rumbling the gaffer awaken and fearing lest thieves had been stealing his bacon with a pur in his hand down stairs he comes stumbling where he found roger gaping whilst ursla lay tumbling where he found etc viii pox take ye quoth he for a rogue and a whore so he turned these poor lovers quite out of the door never minding the rain nor the cold windy weather to finish their loves in a hogsty together to finish etc the milkmaid a song to the tune of when bright aurelia etc i maria when the paps you press each morn beneath the cow do not the secret thoughts of bliss your mind with fancied joys possess and make you long to know ii see then the gentle curling stream that fills your pail so full it is turned to floods of luscious cream whenever the milkmaid chance to dream she is stroaking of a bull iii let easier work your arms employ take better things in hand since heaven has made you fit for joy have pity on the amorous boy nor let him weeping stand iv then leave off making threemeal cheese for every plowmans turn the softer curds of beauty squeeze and make lovesbutter come with ease by jumbling natures churn the plowmans wish to his friend votatus brevit etc mart since you whom all the world admires would know what your poor friend requires some little spot of earth he prays to pass incognito his days whod venture conscience ease and health for empty pleasures useless wealth whod be the tawdry fool of war or the more noisy knave at bar that might in his own fields and wood find his diversion and his food his ponds with various fishes stored the bees for him their honey hoard a nutbrown lass both kind and neat to make his bed and dress his meat he that hates me or likes not this may he never know so sweet a bliss but fooled with riches or renown still stay behind and rot in town now or never or the maids counselor i consult dear nymph your faithful glass the crystal streams the bordring grass then think how youth and beauty pass ii maria once so fair and young no mores the burden of our song since cruel time has done her wrong iii his scythe has mown her rosy cheek cut down the lillies of her neck and cropd the flowers which maids bedeck iv her eyes that pierced the yielding soul the toast to every shepherds bowl shall now no more our hearts control v her voice so sweet she use to rear as brought the listening birds to hear no longer charms the attentive ear vi her lips like comb for honey pressed like balls of snow her melting breast by envious age she is all undrest vii every rose with drooping leaves an emblem of the virgin gives whose foolish pride herself deceives viii then damsels mark the fading flower presume no longer in your power blossoms vanish every hour ix let then the youth no longer mourn nor by destructive passion burn for charms once gone can never return epitaph on my uncles ape under this slate do lie the last remains of one whom selfconceited man disdains and scoffing calls an ape but man was he if tumblers or if dancingmasters be he did alive in either art excel and now is gallanted by oldmaids in hell damon or the shepherds paradise i where pines and cedars form a wood on either side a crystal flood where cupid makes his chief abode and softest scenes of love where innocence adorns the swain where flora crowns the verdant plain and philomela tunes a main the bounties of great jove ii where plenty crowns each smiling brow without the toilsome help of plow the flocks do bleat and oxen low while birds melodious sing and warble forth dame natures praise where phoebus sheds his brightest rays bestowing on those happy days an everlasting spring iii here would i choose some rural fair the only object of my care nor be forsworn nor yet despair by modern arts betrayed her choice should fix her love on me her words and actions all be free if gratiana such would be my happiness were made iv her eyes would give a cheerful day her smiles make every shade look gay while at her sight the flocks would play and linnets stretch their voice and sure wherever my venus moves the shrubs should rise to myrtle groves and i would supply a train of loves and get a race of boys caroletta or the shepperdess menalcas sure deserves the bays who aims at carolettas praise an airy gay and frisking she not fond but without coyness free her pretty freedoms please the wise and none are jealous who have eyes none can suspect the lovely fair or think hypocrisy dwells there trace her through every part and grace through every lineament of face a living miracle you will find of body blended with the mind a humor debonair and fit to match her beauty and her wit by beauty formed to charm mankind to conquer all our sex designed for wit and repartee renowned with words that cure as well as wound as when they cut a brilliantstone such as with pit of late was known at every chip a jewel flies and sparkles after sparkles rise so when you once this nymph provoke to raillery or cheerful joke new beauties in each notion shine new turns of thought with thought combine wit uncontrolled which naught can stem and every sentence is a gem phillis a song i let fops of vain happiness proud delight in appearance and noise their pleasures divide with the crowd the wise are more nice in their joys ii my phillis is charming alone and all that behold her adore then if i would keep her my own no rival must know of my store iii adieu to the rest of mankind to deserts i fain would retire in phillis alone i shall find whatever i want or desire iv for soon as her beauties appear new brightness enlightens the plain and only attended by her i will envy no monarch his train polyphemus to his mistress from ovid o galatea you are the flower of may tall as a poplar as a meadow gay splendid as glass gamesome as any kid airy as cockles tossed by every tide grateful as summers shade or winters shine sweet as an apple sightly as a pine smoother than mellow grapes whiter than snow soft as a swan or stroakings from the cow and if you did not shun my fond embrace fair as a garden where a fountain plays again you are wild as any colt unbroke false as the waves obdurate as an oak weaker than sallow twigs or than the vine harder than rocks more headstrong than the rhine proud as a peacock when we him admire sharper than thorns and hotter than the fire deaf as the seas cruel as bears at rut fierce as an adder trodden under foot and what the greatest plague of all i find you fly the lover like the hunted hind fleeting as air and volatile as wind verses writ upon a glass it is generous wine refines our clay and makes our souls outshine the day it is bacchus guards our health and truth inspires our wit preserves our youth enobles friendship downs deceit and smooths the rugged brow of fate the only cure of gloomy spleen the shower that makes our sky serene then since the god has crowned our cup twere folly not to drink it up the sparrow from catullus humbly inscribed to my much respected and honored kinswoman mrs grace howard mourn all ye cupids mourn ye little loves mourn ye fair maids and mourn

may boast its flowery valleys and its fruitful coast mild are the seasons fragrant is the air large are her harvests and her product fair but far above the rest her vines produce the loveliest figure and the kindest juice fruits fine as these could never be designed for creatures of a base and vulgar kind no they are designed to entertain the fair and such as heaven makes its peculiar care for them the ambitious grove attempts the sky the fountains murmur and the breezes sigh for them the lilly paints the violet blows and modest blushes tinge the fragrant rose for them the citron loads its boughs anew and the glad orange takes a golden hue for them gay flowers enamel all the mead and other olives to the last succeed for them our sun the clustered grape refines for them our elms are

extent of this auspicious reign and never let us pay our vws in vain so when of old the farmers toil was over and all his barns were crowded with his store to that indulgent power that gave him peace and to his corn and to his herds increase he paid the noblest profits of the year with rigid justice and religious fear epigrams you have often averred i am the persectest wit that ever you saw or conversed withal yet and i in return have has often professed that of all womankind youre the fairest and best the assertions of both are equally true for as you laugh at me so do i laugh at you

times to trim from martial as oaks in stormy seasons shed the treacherous leaves they bear so calvus did but shake his head and off he shook his hair another on mr priors tomb in westminsterabby this busto lewis gave our bard his strains at least the best are borrowed from fontaines then what would prior be should gallia claim her gifted monument and borrowed fame an imitation of ovid in distress ille ego qui fneram tenerorum lusoramorum i am he who once indulged an amorous vein and thought all poets of a heavenly strain my easy heart each puny girl subdued coquets i flattered and adored the prude thanks to my muse for she those joys refined dissolved my cares and made corinna kind without restraint i passed my youths best hours in easy studies or in soft amors you father bacchus now extend your aid remember i was once a roaring blade the gods themselves have festivals of mirth it is then they shower their blessings down on earth and you dear friends and brothers of the quill remember me and each his bumper fill when you the name of honest naso hear set down the glass and drop a friendly tear look round about and with a tender voice cry where is the faithful partner of our joys whilst i alone beguile the tedious day with books and strive to read my cares away i banish fates unkindness from my mind and fancy over the joys i left behind my muse to me is all the world
