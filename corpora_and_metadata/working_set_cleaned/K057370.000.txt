conscience an ethical essay  by the reverend j brand  london printed for t becket in the strand w woodyer at cambridge and w chase at norwich  mdcclxxiii  advertisement the subject of this piece is the same with that proposed the two last years for seatons prize poem on which account it was originally written an accidental delay it met with upon the road occasioned its being presented to the vice chancellor two days after the time appointed by the will of mr seaton who therefore found himself obliged not to receive it  conscience the argument i the subject proposed  ii     0 the invocation addressed to the spirit of song as   alleviating the sufferings of mankind   inspiring virtue   and the piety of men and angels   iii        the definition of conscience see note to v    the sense of pleasure or pain arising from a perception of the agreement or disagreement of our actions with the rules of virtue  iv      0  the sources of conscience or this moral sense of pleasure and pain   st sympathy  see note to v     d pride and shame   d selflove    st      0 from sympathy we rejoice in the pleasures of others and our affection is conciliated to their author relation to him heightens that pleasure consequently its greatest strength is when that happiness springs from ourselves and our own virtue         the converse true of vice   d        from pride the natural excellencies of the body or mind when surveyed necessarily give a species of pleasure which we call selfcomplacency or pride this emotion is stronger on the perception of those degrees of perfection which we give birth to in ourselves by acts of the will and is still augmented in proportion of the dignity of the end by which it is put in action the highest gratification of this instinct is therefore the contemplation of those of our own actions to which some virtue was the end         from shame the converse of the former argument holds good as vice is attended with the greatest degree of shame   d      0  from selflove selflove actuates our hopes and fears from a consideration of   st our present and   dly our future state          from the present state  those actions which promote the felicity of society or the moral virtues naturally bring their own rewards with them those which obstruct it or vices their respective punishments whence according to the nature of our actions we are filled with the hopes of these rewards or the fear of these punishments and as the mind is always more employed in considering the future than either the present or the past these future expectations which contribute to compose that moral sense named conscience form the greater part of our present happiness or misery        0  from a future state  our hopes are strongly excited by the views of that eternal happiness our fears by the representation of the divine justice revelation has given us digression description of the divine justice her infinity her almighty power to protect  or punish she descends upon earth to chastise the sins of men the effects of her vengeance the terror a consideration of this must inspire in the breast of the wicked and more particularly on the point of death  v  0       the final causes of conscience   st to excite repentance   dly to counterpoise the passions   dly to render the happiness of individuals more proportioned to their moral merits   st        0 conscience excites us by repentance to appease the divine justice   dly          it counterpoizes the passions by making them subservient to the general good which otherwise would engage us in excesses the most destructive to society it introduces the finest moral harmony in the mind and reconciles all the various pursuits of life to universal happiness   dly          vice is frequently successful and virtue deprest in the world conscience by being the secret punishment of the former and the support of the latter renders the happiness of each more proportioned to the moral merit of individuals and thus forms a necessary supplement to the external administration of providence           hence unrestrained avarice ambition sensuality and other crimes derive their secret punishment         0 and from hence the man of virtue when distressed experiences a support enabling him to triumph over or despise the afflictions of life           while its influence gives new pleasure to all its finer enjoyments and exalts prosperity into happiness  conscience conscience i sing her nature source and power her secret scourge and selfapproving hour oh thou whose sway subdues the willing soul and charms each passion to thy mild control  wakes round afflictions couch and sooths despair parent of virtue thou whose breath inspires the good the wise and fans their noblest fires excites the high resolve the godlike deed  or taught the voice of piety to raise the pealing anthems deep majestic lays where through the solemn isles and vaulted choir with choral sound her hallowed strains aspire  where throned thou sitst in realms of living light crowned with celestial wreaths and flowers that blow fast by the streams of life and as they flow drink immortality while on thy state  to lead the eternal paean of the skies at once from twice ten thousand harps arise their golden symphonies and taught by thee rolls the full tide of heavenly harmony  and more than rapture fires the sacred notes spirit of immortal song the verse inspire assist the strain and kindle all its fire to sing what peace what joy what soft content  the keen the secret grief the heartfelt woe the fears the shame the pang the guilty know the breathing grace the glowing thought impart to beam conviction on the enlightned heart  or form that virtue which they fail to find to wipe the tear from virtues radiant eye spare vice one crime prevent one rising sigh bid peace and hope on pale dejection shine  when man compares his actions with the rule of moral life deduced from virtues school with joy their just conformity we see and mark with grief wherever they disagree v    conscience is defined to be a sense of pleasure or pain not a bare abstract perception of the mind exclusive of an operation on the passions because such a perception must terminate in itself and can never become a source of action any more than the abstract deductions of geometry or any other science and conscience is an active principle this moral sense of pleasure and of pain of conscience forms the wide extended reign from three great principles by heaven impressed she holds her empire over the human breast mild sympathy with prides more ardent sway v    the term pride must be understood in a philosophical sense as a natural pleasure arising from the view of its object not as opposed to the virtue of humility in which sense it is a vice the advantages of life are surveyed with pleasure the means by which these are procured are therefore pleasing by the operation of the mind associating the pleasure arising from the contemplation of the end with the idea of the means the foremost among these we reckon the natural excellencies of the body or mind thus it is proved there must exist such a pleasure as selfcomplacence or pride from a view of our natural perfections if nature has not given us an original primary instinct which makes the natural advantages necessarily and per se give pleasure to their possessors ours is not the only language which wants a term which may express selfcomplacency without the danger of being misunderstood without some explanation since the writing the above i have happened of the following observation on the word orgueil which one of the best modern french poets wanted to have introduced in the sense i have used the term pride  jaurois substitue le mot dorgueil a ces mots sentiment de nos forces de nos qualites etc mais dans notre langue le mot dorgueil se prend toujours en mauvaise part les saisons note p      when virtue wakes felicity around and blessed with calm content gay transport crowned that peace the good man spreads we mark the few each social passion kindles at the view  transfers the pleasure to its active cause the liberal heart which showers such bliss approves and glows expanded over the worth it loves each slight connection can new force impart  but livelier joy more homefelt raptures bless the godlike mind which showers such happiness sweet springs favonian airs and blushing flowers sweet to the thirsty earth descending showers  and sweet the tuneful lyres melodious sounds yet sweeter far the joys which virtue warm to view that smiling scene she loves to form sooth pain and care repress afflictions stings  when vice her dark vile industry employs to waste the happy field of human joys even there shall sympathy assert her laws and teach the vile to feel the pain they cause  of strength of form of mind we boast our own this by implanted instinct given to please the soul with pride and selfcomplacence sees that excellence from active will which flows  but when great ends the kindling soul inspire when virtue animates her sacred fire then glows serene the purest bliss on earth the large the liberal sense of manly worth  a virtue still to virtue where allied superior to each low each selfish aim and all the vulgar thirst of vulgar fame hence in the breast where vice maintains her throne  shame from himself retiring lurks unseen stables at large and desolates his den with lenient hand to give each pain relief by every care to soften every grief  pitys mild dew and bountys

robs the present and the past fond to embrace that future hope and fear  while on the ideal landskips varying ray depends the color of our present day hence glows the heart as summer skies serene where cheerful hope irradiates all the scene  enjoys the present yet can wish the last but vice in vain shall seek her secret shade dark conscious fears her pensive walk invade paint each vile art each deed of secret night  the scorn of virtues keen indignant eye inflicted pain and galling infamy his present lot all grief his past all care his future torment and his end despair  by pain and pleasure pride and shame combined would conscience thus maintain her heaventaught sway and bend reluctant passion to obey to nobler ends religion bids us rise  with every hope the soul of virtue warms

splendid misery or fired with the delirious dream of fame  she wildly burns to dare each arduous deed forms the deep phalanx bids the battle bleed bids rapine lust and death with lawless sway range

which pleasure brings heal the sick breast or sooth its conscious stings together let us trace her flattering maze  see the gay scene its shining skirts unfold emblazed with purple elephant and gold the lessening columns graceful ranks extend from fretted roofs the starry lamps depend  inlaid with every gem from every mine the sculptured marbles breathe in living rows with thought with soul the speaking canvass glows the courtly youth and virgin train advance  through the high dome the sprightly pipe resounds the clear recorder wakes her dulcet sounds the cittern silver voice the living lyre

propitious over the genial hour come with thy sportive train and bring along the jest ambiguous and the festive song lifes brightest sunshine and her vernal air  wits laughing front and humours grave pretense and all the gay debauch of taste and sense they cease alternate then the virgin train wake into rapture the symphonious strain  with new born odours lade their downy wings soft as the tear which streams from beautys eye soft as the lovelorn virgins softest sigh whose breast new hopes new fears alternate move  the breathing airs in tuneful descant flow now lightly gay now musically slow or circling wheel their wildly warbling round silence hangs over enamored of the sound  his downy pinions in the listening air not to dissolve the charm with varied notes thus over the soul the smooth enchantment floats in beauty robbed now comes the jolly spring  he comes and with him leads the laughing hours the vernal gales the mildlygenial showers earth courts his warm approach wherever he treads luxuriant all her wanton pride she spreads  and newborn odours breathe through every grove spontaneous tribes their beauteous forms unfold the flaming lotus kindling into gold gay amaranth the jasmines virgin white  myrtle and asphodell and iris rise the race of brighter suns and genial skies for spring thus nature pants with kind alarms for youth thus beauty puts on all her charms  which half conceals and half betrays the breast soft speech the fond repulse the tender tear the trembling wishing kind reluctant fear the blushing ardors warm contagious fire  attend her call and pass not unpossest the roseat joys which court thee to be blessed yet melancholy yet the bitter scourge of sad reflection the tumultuous surge  by guilt by anguish by despair deprest the pang for ever new for ever keen haunt the sad master of the guilty scene while down his cheek the tear incessant stole  not the gay feast not musics sprightly sound the blameless dance the bowl with roses crowned sweet song loves gentle joy the endeared embrace not every art refined by every grace  and to her pain speak peace my god my god it is sharp it is terrible to breathe to be but to converse with ceaseless misery the cool the fragrant morn returns again  but not to me comes joy his chearing ray never gilds one dark hour of my gloomy day night shades the world beneath her sombre wings silence and peace and balmy sleep she brings  nor balmy sleep ever visits these sad eyes tomorrow dawns as wretched as today thus wear my years of misery away yet ah might allinvolving time consign   vain is the promise of it is soothing power thus some fond infant on the seabeat shore when waves on waves move on their marshalled bands in silent eager expectation stands  now this now that he fondly hopes the last still surge on surge on billows billows hurled to the vexed shore rolls all the watery world now reigns the stilly hour when night had driven  spangled with stars and from her utmost height surveys this nether world in chaster light over the calm scene the virgin moon presides her pale ray trembling over old oceans tides  a wavy sea of mist without a shore above emerging from the fleecy plain the peasants humble roof the solemn fane the silent groves with trembling light overspread  around she views kind sleeps fraternal power through her still reign his balmy blessings shower and drooping worth by frustrate hope pursued and toil whose pain but ends to be renewed  forget their sorrows and absolve the day yet all the splendid scenes illusion fled no soft sleep hovers over its masters head gaunt terror pictures in the midnight shade  exposed to piercing want afflictive pain faint sickening agony and deaths dread reign a weeping father impotent to save by frantic sorrow urged to seek a grave  a new succeeds with deeper anguish fraught and memory to wound his inmost heart steeps in her bitterest gall her sharpest dart now here now there he turns to seek repose  till sickening nature by fatigue oppressed sinks down in torturing dreams of feverish rest forsaken chearless desolate dismayed he seems to wander in the midnight shade  chill horror broods through all the hallowed domes in awful shades half veiled from mortal sight the flitting melancholy forms of night through the long gloom in solemn silence sweep  loudrushing roars a hollow blast around and from its womb with more than thunders sound a voice thus breaks on his astonished sense mortal it is past and vengeance sweeps thee hence  and bursting into light a dread form stands shrouded in terrors his grim bosom gored still freshly streamed beneath the gleaming sword corruptions loathsome bane had half destroyed  together with him bursts deaths horrid king whose mortal dart he seizes bent to spring upon his trembling prey in vain you fly vengeance demands her victim and you dye  her tears her shame her agonies her death my frantic breast with every pang to tear against my soul my madding sword to bare in all my crimes to meet my doom hurled down  astonished nerveless impotent he stands fear chains his feet and binds his trembling hands he strives he toils yet wants the power to fly and seems transfixt to fall to writhe to dye  while anxious terror steeps his couch with tears to court sleeps balmy gifts again he tries and other shapes and other forms arise he strays by sober evenings grateful shades  glittering by moon a solemn silence reigns save in some bourne that skirts the dewy plains the sweetest warbler of the feathered throng wakes to soft rapture her lovelabourd song  his loved his loveliest charmer weeps his stay thus some fair lily on the mountains side with rain surcharged declines her silver pride till young hyperion from his gorgeous height  then cheered to life in virgin state arrayed half her retreating elegance displayed while halfconceald her modest form she veils and streams fresh odor to the passing gales  to lend new luster to the vernal year hope gleams a moment over his deep distress and bids him thus his raptured sense express dear as soft showers when gasping nature mourns  dear as the vital air as balmy rest dear as the last best hope that warms my breast often fancy saw thee mingled with the dead and over the thought my heart with anguish bled  save happily when remembrance to my view the wretched scenes of other days retracd in fond idea thy past griefs i chased repulsed no more with stern averting eye  but wiped thy tears bad all thy sorrows cease and smiled thy fond subsiding fears to peace then fled the fancied scenes and as they fled i wept no cares could reach the silent dead  to bless the friend thy gentler virtues loved thus have i said to my expanding heart had she now lived some joy it might impart to that mild breast where softness fixed her throne  while soothed affections tear and pleasing grief through my sick breast diffused severe relief god of my soul be all her future blessed and let her closing day be peace and rest  let justice or let mercy fix my lot then ardent he extends his longing arms intent to grasp her visionary charms when lo that instant in his fond embrace  and pangs and terror in her meager eyes expiring prostrate at his feet she lies convulst with madding agonising pain while death and torture burns in every vein  now nature laboring in her last sad strife frantic with shrilling shrieks she rends the air then sinks exhausted down in mute despair yet turns on him her fond forgiving eye  his boiling brain with frantic passion burns he rages loves and weeps and storms by turns now deems arrayed in terrors and the night the kindred shades pursue his trembling flight  the unutterable fury forms of hell till flying from some dread tremendous steep headlong he sinks ten thousand fathoms deep down down the eternal precipice he goes  with fears and stern conflicting pangs possessed thus conscience agitates the guilty breast hence lust that can the golden bands despise of nature and her dearest charities  to bid it pierce a friends a parents heart and midnight murder and relentless hate transfixt with horror feel their future fate yet hence the firm support of godlike minds  she smooths the good mans path serenes his way and on his thickest gloom pours light and day if on the sea of life indulgent gales aid all his course and fill his swelling sails  with sober hand her destined course he guides if blackning clouds the face of heaven deform he all collected dares the rising storm marks one fixed star and by her guiding ray  darkness in vain the face of heaven oershrowds storms swell on storms and clouds are rolled on clouds the afflicting hail descends the driving rain sweeps over the surge and blackens all the main  roaring immense foamy abrupt arise over the tall mast their raging tops aspire and wrathful lightnings robe the main in fire one wide incessant blaze loud thunders roll  and he the angel of destruction forms their mustring ire and drives on all their storms and deep retired in clouds and tenfold night full on the bark impells their raging flight  and hurls it flaming over his sacred head serene the good man steers his constant way while frustrate lightnings innocently play and sees their baffled rage with generous scorn  it is conscious worth alone can form our bliss exalt prosperity to happiness aid lifes best joys illume her brightest day and gild her prospects with distinguished ray  her feast her song her treasures and her plume and dear the warriors wreath the patriots fame the poets bay the sages deathless name sweet friendships tie the mutual heart that binds  soft loves endearing joy and golden dart the gentle wish fond cares and pleasing smart yet wealths enchanting scene the boast of fame loves gentle wish and friendships sacred flame  on conscious worth their choicest blessings shower and every joy of every appetite her secret power refines to true delight thus when the dew of heaven pervades unseen  then beams the liberal luster of the year the hills the plains spontaneous herbage rear intenser beauty robes the laughing spring the herds rejoice the exulting valleys ring  eyes its great source and pours his soul in praise in bright succession year thus leads on year till having finished all his full career she sinks mature upon the lap of earth  no guilty fear disturbs her closing eyes but hope serenes her passage to the skies points to the reign of peace and hope and joy there where no pains torment no cares annoy  the eternal throne the flood of living light and virtues highest brightest best reward the applauding smile of heavens almighty lord the end
