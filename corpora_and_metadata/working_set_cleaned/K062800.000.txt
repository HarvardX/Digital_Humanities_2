verse   i that of late  rle ego qui quondam etc virgil or somebody for him i that of late sir williams bard and squire marched with his helm and buckler on my lyre what time the knight pricked forth in illstarrd haste verse   works of taste  put synonimously for his majestys works  see sir williams title page   comptroller general of the works of taste now to the public tune my grateful lays warmed with the sunshine of the public praise warmed too with memory of that golden time when almon gave me reason for my rhyme  glittering orbs and what endeared them more each glittering orb the sacred features bore of george the good the gracious and the great unfild unsweated all of sterling weight or were they not they passed with current ease good seemings then were good realities no senate had conveyed by smuggling art verse    cadogans part master of the mint   power to the mob to play cadogans part now through the land that impious power prevails all weigh their sovereign in their private scales verse    and find him wanting thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting daniel chap   v      and find him wanting all save me alone for sad to say my glittering orbs are gone but ill beseems a poet to repent lightly they came and full as lightly went peace to their manes may they never feel some keen scotch bankers unrelenting steel while i again the muses sickle bring to cut down dunces wheresoeer they spring bind in poetic sheaves the plenteous crop and stack my fulleard load in almons shop for now my muse thy fame is fixed as fate tremble ye fools i scorn ye knaves i hate i know the vigor of thy eagle wings i know thy strains can pierce the ear of kings did chinas monarch here in britain doze verse    a king of prose kienlong the present emperor of china is a poet m de voltaire did him the honor to treat him as a brother above two years ago and my late patron sir william chambers has given a fine and most intelligible prose version of an ode of his majesty upon tea in his postscript to his dissertation i am however vain enough to think that the emperors composition would have appeared still better in my heroic verse but sir william forestalled it on which account i have entirely broke with him   and was like western kings a king of prose thy song could cure his asiatic spleen and make him wish to see and to be seen verse    that solemn vein of irony a sine vein of solemn irony runs through this piece see monthly review under the article of the heroic epistle to sir william chambers   that solemn vein of irony so fine which even reviewers own adorns thy line would make him soon against his greatness sin desert his sofa mount his palanquin and post wherever the goddess led the way perchance to proud spitheads imperial bay verse    there should he see a certain naval event happened just about two calendar months after the publication of the heroic epistle twas impossible considering the necessary preparations it could have been sooner facts are stubborn things   there should he see as other folks have seen that ships have anchors and that seas are green should own the tackling trim the streamers fine with sandwich prattle and with bradshaw dine and then sail back amid the cannons roar as safe as sage as when he left the shore such is thy power o goddess of the song come then and guide my careless pen along yet keep it in the bounds of sense and verse verse    nor like machomer see if the reader thinks it worth while a late translation of the iliad   nor like machomer make me gabble erse no let the flow of these spontaneous rhymes so truly touch the temper of the times that he who runs may read while well he knows i write in meter what he thinks in prose so shall my song undisciplined by art find a sure patron in each english heart if this it is fate let all the frippery things beplacd bepensiond and bestarrd by kings verse    like old young fannius the noble personage here alluded to being asked to read the heroic epistle said no it was as bad as blasphemy  verse    fannius before i sent the m s to the press i discovered that an accidental blot had made all but the first syllable of this name illegible i was doubtful therefore whether to print it fannius or fannia after much deliberation i thought it best to use the masculine termination if i have done wrong i ask pardon not only of the author but the lady the editor   frown on the page and with fastidious eye like old young fannius call it blasphemy let these prefer a levees harmless talk be asked how often and how far they walk proud of a single word nor hope for more though jenkinson is blessed with many a score for other ears my honest number sound with other praise those numbers shall be crowned praise that shall spread no power can make it less while britain boasts the bulwark of her press yes sons of freedom yes to whom i pay warm from the heart this tributary lay that lay shall live though court and grubstreet sigh your young marcellus was not born to die the muse shall nurse him up to mans estate verse    and break the black asperity of fate   si qua fata aspera rumpas tu marcellus eris virgil and break the black asperity of fate  admit him then your candidate for fame pleased if in your review he read his name though not with mason and with goldsmith put yet cheek by jowl with garrick colman foot but if with higher bards that name you range his modesty must think your judgment strange  so when over cranecourts philosophic gods the jovelike majesty of pringle nods if ever he chance to wake on newtons chair he wonders how the devil he came there whatever his fame or fate on this depend he is and means to be his countrys friend it is but to try his strength that now he sports with chinese gardens and with chinese courts but if that country claim a graver strain if real danger threat fair freedoms reign if hireling prs in prostitution bold sell her as cheaply as themselves they sold or they who honored by the peoples choice against that people lift their rebel voice and basely crouching for their paltry pay vote the best birthright of her sons away permit a nations inborn wealth to fly in mean unkingly prodigality nor ever they give ask how the sums were spent so quickly squandered though so lately lent  if this they dare the thunder of his song rolling in deeptond energy along shall strike with truths dread bolt each miscreants name who dead to duty senseless even to shame betrayed his country yes ye faithless crew his muses vengeance shall your crimes pursue stretch you on
