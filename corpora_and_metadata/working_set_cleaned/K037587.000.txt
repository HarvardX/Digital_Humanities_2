a good hack with a coat of five capes that quite covers my back and my wife keeps a sausageshop not many miles from the narrowest alley in all broad st giles though poor we are honest and very content we pay as we go for meat drink and for rent to work all the week i am able and willing i never get drunk and i waste not a shilling iii what though at a tavern my gentleman tarries why the coachman grows richer than he whom he carries and i would rather say i since it saves me from sin be the driver without than the toper within iv for the dramshop i hate and the dramdrinking friend yet i am not quite so good but i wish i may mend i repent of my sins since we all are depraved for a coachman i hold has a soul to be saved v when a riotous multitude fills up a street and the greater part know not boys wherefore they meet if i see there is mischief i never go there let others get tipsy so i get my fare vi now to church if i take some good lady to pray it grieves me full sore to be kept quite away so i step through the doorway for here it is the sin to loiter without when one might enter in vii then my glasses are whole and my coach is so neat i am always the first to be called in the street and i am known by the name it is a name rather rare of the coachman that never asks more than his fare viii though my beasts should be dull yet i dont use them ill though they stumble i swear not nor cut them up hill for i firmly believe there is no charm in an oath that can make a nag trot when to walk he is loath ix and though i am a coachman i will freely confess i beg of my maker my labors to bless i praise him each morning and pray every night and it is this makes my heart feel so cheerful and light x when i drive to a funeral i care not for drink that is not the moment to guzzle but think and i wish i could add both of coachman and master that both of us strove to amend a bit faster z  the end this day are published price  d each or  s  d per  00   0 for  s  d    for
