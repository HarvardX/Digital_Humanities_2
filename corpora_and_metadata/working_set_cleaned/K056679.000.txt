a brief survey of the legal liberties of the dissenters and how far the bill now depending consists with preserving the toleration inviolably wherein the present bill is published and also the toleration act at large that they may be compared with one another  edinbvrgh reprinted in the year       a brief survey of the legal liberties of the dissenters etc it is no time now to make flourishes and lay down aphorisms to debate upon matters of fact must speak themselves and that they may do so let us bringthem together  the toleration was granted to the dissenters at the beginning of the revolution he that told us it was not a courtesy but a capitulation the performance of an agreement not an act of mere tenderness and charity said true or he said false for my part i never heard him confuted or much said to contradict it  if the toleration of dissenters was a grant of mere charity and mercy yet it was no other charity and mercy than the church of england as christians were obliged to show persecution for conscience being contrary to the principles of the christian religion and if they were obliged to grant it they are equally obliged to continue it unless they can allege the dissenters have done any thing to forfeit it which we challenge all the tories in england to prove  if the toleration of dissenters was a capitulation all capitulations ought to be performed all agreements ought to be executed and it is as much their right to demand the preserving of it as it was to demand the enacting it  but the queen besides all this has promised to continue it and to preserve it inviolably we doubt not her majesty meant to do so when she said it and means so still but what mean they who would oblige her or persuade her to break her word  we do not say the parliament offer this and we doubt not but some people flatter themselves that all these things are not only consistent with but will be effectual for the inviolable preservation of the toleration we shall see presently how it will be proved  the managers of persecuting principles have very pretty ways with them to cover and guild over the most effectual measures of destroying us with fair pretenses of preserving us perhaps this taking away the schools and academies of the dissenters is done the better to preserve etc inviolably  we find in the first section of the last occasional bill the enacting clauses thus introduced now for the better securing the said church so far is good and quieting the minds of her majestys protestant and dissenting subjects and rendering them secure in the exercise of their religious worship etc  be it enacted  i do not say that the bill following those words did abridge the said dissenters of any of their liberties in the exercise of their religious worship but this i will say that if the dissenters were so abridgd by that act then joining the words together it will follow that their said liberties were so abridgd the better to quiet their minds and for the securing them in the exercise of their religious worship perhaps other laws may be blessed with the like congruity  before we go on to examine what may or not be deemed an attempt upon and inconsistent with the religious liberties of the dissenters it may be very useful for us to enquire what those liberties really are to which purpose and that the dissenters may know how far those liberties do or do not extend and when they are or are not invaded i believe it very much to the present purpose to publish the said toleration act at large which although it be put at the end of this tract the reader is desired to turn to it and peruse it before he goes on any farther  having now supposed that the readers of this tract have perused the act of toleration deliberately and have thereby a clear account of what the dissenters liberties really are it will be also necessary to let them see what it is that the present depending bill is to enact against them and so we shall presently judge about the word inviolably etc  it is true and this is the great pretense of those who promote this matter that the keeping of schools and academies for the instructing and educating our children is not expressly a part of the toleration bill and therefore say they the toleration may be inviolably preserved notwithstanding the passing the present bill  but the dissenters will refute this by alleging that the liberty of teaching and instructing our children is such an essential in the meaning of a toleration that it needs no more to be expressed therein than a liberty of going out of our own houses or rising out of our beds and putting on our clothes in order to a religious assembly need to be expressed in that part of the act which allows places to be appointed for that worship  if any essential part of the toleration be taken away although not expressed how is the toleration then preserved inviolably  farther the educating of children is a part of the religious duties of a christian and among these of the protestant religion more especially regarded as such if the dissenters are abridgd of what is their indispensible duty they are persecuted in the most extreme sense of persecution for the consequence is they must offend against this law because they are bound to obey god rather than man in offending this law they must incur a penalty not being able to pay the penalty they must go to prison and in prison they must perish so that in consequence of this law the dissenters will suffer death for their religion and and yet the toleration be preserved inviolable  i think the plainness of this case is not to be found fault with religion is nothing more or less than a serving or worshipping god our maker and lawgiver the method is prescribed by his word conscience is to every man the judge of his own duty and the manner of performing is this conscience is a sovereign dictator in the mind of men and it must be obeyed so it is not meet to make laws to restrain it human power having no judicial right over it  as then conscience must be obeyed in which the scripture is clear whether it be lawful to obey god rather than man judge ye when laws are made restraining us to such things as conscience forbids to do or commands not to omit what must we do  the answer is plain we must suffer true but then we must say that this is persecution if then persecution is contrary to the principles of the christian religion as we have the authority of parliament in the preamble to the first occasional bill to prove what follows but that every persecuting act is an unchristian act  whether the present depending bill be a persecuting and consequently an unchristian still let others judge this deponent faith not  it may however be of some use to enquire into some of the consequences which the dissenters may expect from this law that those who are to suffer by it may prepare their minds for martyrdom and they who are to pass it may consider what ruin of families what blood of conscientious sufferers what increase of ignorance and consequently of error they are going to be the cause of and what terrible havoc they are going to make in the reformation which has enemies enough and wounds enough already perhaps when these things come to be seriously reflected upon they may consider  since then the persecution is thus revived what must the dissenters do negatively i will tell you what they cannot do    they cannot say their toleration is inviolably preserved they that think this bill does not interfere with the toleration may here compare them together the one says ease is to be given to tender consciences the other says the tenderest consciences shall be oppressed one says the dissenters shall have liberty to assemble and their children may worship god with them the other says they shall not have schoolmasters to instruct them how to worship one gives them a liberty of professing their dissent the other denies them the liberty of being taught to know why they dissent this is the ready way indeed to make dissenting be a faction in the next age as they pretend it is now not a religious principle thus the toleration is preserved and not preserved at the same time the letter of the toleration is preserved in deed but the substance and essential parts are destroyed    they cannot say they are kindly treated by the church and when they look back upon their own conduct to the church they tell them plainly they have not deserved this usage at their hands when they rescued the church from an evident ruin in king jamess time mighty promises of temper and tenderness were made them let us suppose now the dissenters parting with them at that time in this manner  yes yes gentlemen you promise us fair now while you are under apprehensions of the popish party now you call us brethren and talk well of the small differences between us and how charity ought to bury what is past and to bind us closser for the time to come that you find now you have been mistaken and that we are as faithful to the protestant interest as your selves and you will for ever esteem us the same christians as your selves allowing us a legal established liberty and living in love and charity with us will never more suffer the indifferent things which are in dispute among us to divide us but when by our assistance you are established again you will forget all these things when a generation rises up that knows not joseph they will call us all schismatics and recusants again couple us with papists say we are dangerous to the church and enemies to monarchy and make new laws against us destroy the toleration you now offer us and persecute us as bad as ever  when the dissenter says thus to them suppose a certain grave divine stands up and quotes the words of hasael the king of assyria is thy servant a dog that be should do this thing what now would that grave divine say for the passage is not a fable if he were to see this bill passing the house would he plead that this is not persecution  the question is not only upon the word persecution though that is answered plain enough too but is it just is it kind is it grateful is it agreeable to former pretenses is it what was solemnly promised when the church stood in need of the assistance and support of the dissenters in the time of their extremity is this the performance of solemn engagement to the dissenters is this the temper you promised to come to is this the love and charity you resolved to live in monstrous perfidious    they cannot say they are not persecuted persecution is the constraining and restraining conscience by force and punishment to restrain from what we dare not omit is as much persecution as to constrain to what we dare not comply with can any christian omit instructing his children in the christian religion dare any dissenter educate his child in that way which he dares not conform to himself is not that condemning himself and abandoning his child does he not by that single act either declare that he dissents without any foundation or that he values not the salvation of his child  conscientious dissenters have never yet shown such an indifferency in the matter of conformity if they had they could not have been supposed to suffer such hardships as they now do to be expelled any share either in the trust honor or profits of their countrys service    they cannot say that they are at all obliged by this to farther and future services and although it is true that the dissenters may not withdraw their hands from the necessary services of their country as english men yet all those voluntary services which upon all occasions they have appeared freely and generously to join in they must now restrain in order to carry on the more needful expense of educating and instructing their children abroad and keeping tutors for them in their own houses and in assisting poor families to do the same  there are affirmative consequences of their persecution which it is not so proper to mention only i take the freedom to tell these warm people that there will not one dissenters child the more be brought up in the church of england by this persecuting act neither will this lessen but increase the schism and the number of dissenters in england it is true it will straiten the dissenters in their educating their children put them to difficulties and expense as to the first they must suffer it as an effect of persecution and as to the last the money which the dissenters now freely contribute to the church over and above what the law demands viz on subscription to charities to lecturers to poor clergy to briefs etc which it would be the greatest madness in the dissenters not to restrain these i say will pay all the difference in the expense of the education of their children and assist them to educate the poor that cannot do it themselves  again seeing the clergy of the church are so sensible of the effect of our schoolmasters teaching the dissenters children the assemblies catechism that they should make a law that they shall not be instructed in that manner at school it is a warm admonition to the dissenters to revive the ancient family discipline and instruction which was the original method by which the reformation was begun in this nation and by duly catechizing their own children and servants and giving catechises to the poor families that want them effectually supply the deffect and thus the end of these church christians viz to lessen christian knowledge instead of increasing it shall be defeated till they think fit to make another bill to take the disscurers children away from them as the papists did to the protestants in france or as the mahometans do now to the armenian christians gergia and moldavia to make janissaries  besides this the inhumanity of this law which admits of a large description and which has many branches tending to cruelty cannot but fill the minds of our posterity with abhorrence of the church it self and so make the breach wider than ever it was before as all the sangninary laws against the reformation and against the primitive church could never stop the progress either of the christian religion at first or of the protestant religion afterward so neither will this but will confirm establish and increase the body of the dissenters in this nation to conclude all  the methods which will also be still less to the dissenters to evade this act will of course have one of these two effects either which we earnestly wish it will cause the church to see the mistake and repeal the rigorous law or as those who run into many evils to support and rather than recant the first it will oblige them to such other and farther steps of this kind as must revive the severest persecutions even to death and torture the consequences we may reasonably expect will end in judgment from heaven and the confusion of the nation  we cannot but hope that these things may prevail with our legislators to consider what is before them and to examine as well the political as the christian arguments which may be offered to them against this bill  particularly how it strikes at the foundation of religion as christian and tends to the destroying the light and knowledge of divine things in the world which is the honor of the reformation whereas if the instruction of children in the knowledge of religion is restrained loaded with difficulties or limited it is thereby discouraged lessened and put backward which is contrary to the practice of all the protestant nations in the world  neither is it enough to say that the dissenters are the cause of such discouragement for that they may send their children to learn the church catechism and to church tutors and schoolmasters for if the dissenters cannot in conscience conform neither can they in conscience teach their children to conform and if that principle conscience obliges them to keep their children without any degree of learning and instruction which they would otherwise have had the law that limits their education to terms which their parents cannot comply with is the unrighteous cause of that defect and thus ignorance flows in of course it is to be hoped the church of england will not be thought to plant it self best in the ignorance of the people christian knowledge is the fountain of the reformation of the christian religion popery indeed may be said to be founded in ignorance and propagated in superstition which is the child of stupidity and blindness but knowledge and the light of the scriptures were the nurses and founders of the reformation and woe be to that nation or people or body of men who pretend to propagate the christian religion by restraining the knowledge of religion in the minds of the younger part of the nation who it is their duty by all possible means to instruct  we find in the heads of the bill now depending some things also more particularly tending to persecution than is yet mentioned viz the engaging every one who shall have a license to teach school never to be present at a meeting this is restraining the said teacher or schoolmaster from his liberty of conscience to preserve his livelihood and making the salary or gain of his employment to be a snare to his principles  what the fines and penalties are how rigorous the prosecution how the dissenters are debarred from their liberty of appeal to her majestys superior courts of justice and left to the mercy of the justices of the peace without appeal and how to be prosecuted in ecclesiastical courts where the churchmen who in this cause are parties are made judges as these things are apparent in the bill so are they the height of persecution unprecedented and in their nature an oppression of our civil rights as englishmen  to close all how these things agree with the toleration is a mystery i can by no means reconcile perhaps those who read the bills both together and see how and where the clauses join and where they part may see less of persecution than i can and that all men may do so and judge for themselves therefore are the copies published in this manner  the bill against schism that whereas by an act of parliament in the thirteenth and fourteenth years of his late majesty king charles the second entitled an act for the uniformity of public prayers and the administration of the sacrament and other rites and ceremonies and for establishing the form of making ordaining and consecrating bishops priests and deacons in the church of england it is among other things enacted that every schoolmaster keeping any public or private school and every person instructing and teaching any youth or private family as a tutor or schoolmaster should subscribe before his or their respective bishop or archbishop or ordinary of the diocese a declaration or acknowledgment in which among other things is contained as follows  viz i a b do declare that i will conform to the liturgy of the church of england as it is now by law established  and if any schoolmaster or other person instructing or teaching youth in any private school or family as a tutor or schoolmaster before license obtained from the respective arch bishop or ordinary of the diocese according to the laws and statutes if this realm for which he should pay    d only and before subscription and acknowledgment make as aforesaid then every such schoolmaster or other instructing or teaching as aforesaid should for the first offense suffer three months imprisonment without bail and for every second and other such offense should suffer three months imprisonment without bail or mainprize and also forfeit to his majesty the sum of   l  and whereas notwithstanding the said act sundry papists and other persons dissenting from the church of england have taken upon them to instruct and teach youth as tutors and schoolmasters and have set up schools and seminaries for the education of several persons in reading scholastic academical or other literature  whereby if due and speedy remedy be not had great danger might ensue to this church and state for the making the said recited act more effectual and for preventing the danger aforesaid  be it enacted by the queens most excellent etc that every person or persons who shall from

whereof respectively is hereby required to register the same and to give certificate thereof to such person as shall demand the same for which there shall be none greater fee nor reward taken than the sum of six pence  queries humbly proposed to my lords the bishops upon occasion of the bill now depending in the house of peers to prevent as is pleaded the growth of schism query i how schism can be prevented before it is clearly determined what it is and whether those men canjustly be charged with it who are united to the common head of the christian church by faith and to all its members by an hearty love and whether dissenters are not within the church as it is defined by the   th article of the church of england having the pure word of god preached amongst them and the sacraments duly administered according to christs ordinance in all things that of necessity are requisite to the same  ii how any national church as far as it is favored or warranted by the holy scriptures which all protestants own for their rule can be in any real danger from such persons as those described or from their being left at liberty to educate their children in their own way  iii whether it be not a piece of wisdom to learn from our enemies and when even in the romish communion notwithstanding their high pretensions to unity and uniformity there is yet a great diversity admitted amongst their religious orders why should not protestants enlarge and strengthen themselves by enclosing all they can in a way of forbearance especially when they heartily fall in with the same civil government  iv are not the french and dutch protestant churches to our great satisfaction allowed to educate their own children without dishonor or damage to the church or state and shall this privilege be denied to natives that are faithful and peaceable merely because they are dissenters  v whether the treating such as schismatics in the reign of king charles ii to look no farther back was not sensibly found to promote the growth of popery and whether it may not reasonably be expected that a like cause should have a like effect  vi whether in the reign that succeeded it was not owned by some eminent prelates of the church with archbishop sancroft at their head as well as by the noble marquess of halifax in his letter to the dissenters in which so many eminent persons concurred and which all at that time applauded that too much rigor had been used toward persons of the same religion for differing in smaller matters and whether promises were not then freely made of a different treatment and a better temper for the future from the pulpit and the press and in all conversation  vii whether the bishops that have been advanced to that honor since the revolution who have generally been persons of the greatest eminence for their worth and moderation have not met with more respect from the dissenters than from many who pretended to be zealous members of their own church and whether it is a suitable return for persons of their lordships candor to deal more hardly by us as to our children than their predecessors ever attempted to do by our fathers as to their descendants  viii whether any thing more tenderly affected the protestants in france than the denying them liberty to educate their children in their own principles and whether that method which has all along been represented as so severe in a popish prince can never be fit to be countenanced by protestant bishops in a protestant country  ix whether if popery should once more prevail among us which some who are ornaments to the bench of bishops have owned to be no very remote supposition it would be a most grating reflection when the legislators should demand the education of the children of all protestants to hear them insinuate that their lordships had set them the pattern by demanding the education of the children of dissenters  x whether it can reasonably be expected that they should ever have the courage to endure the fiery trial which is what according to the foregoing supposition they may be called to who by any political considerations should be kept from sheltring the innocent and whether upon supposition any members of their own church should threaten them if they acted according to the principles by which they obtained their preferments it would not be more becoming to inform them better and yield more comfort to set them an example of steadiness than to harden and embolden them by yielding to them in a method of treating brethren that is neither scriptural nor rational  xi whether it be seemly for guides of the church to pass such a censure upon the assemblies catechism as if it were not fit to be taught when there is nothing to be found in it but what agrees with the doctrine and nothing that is opposite to the government of their own church and how it can be reconciled with the honor and veracity of their lordships to allow no other catechism than that which cannot be answered to with truth by the children of dissenters who had no godfathers or godmothers to give them their names or promise for them  xii whether the ecclesiastical courts have not from the first reformation been owned a great grievance by the best prelates and members of the church of england whether they have not upon occasion been freely inveighed against by many who are at present on the bishops bench and whether there be any such evidence of their amendment as can justify their now concurring to support and in courage them  and lastly whether the passing such a bill into a law be not more likely to spread animosity increase uncharitableness and perpetuate division than prevent the growth of what is called schism and whether this be not as evident as that publicly branding a body of men will inflame the populace against them and that severity on the other hand tends to exasperate the sufferers  my lords the bishops are earnestly requested to take these things into their serious consideration by several of the descendants of those very presbyterians who earnestly  though invain implored the compassion of their predecessors in      and by many that have joined with them in waiting for the fulfilling their promises in      and      and who most heartily beg of almighty god they may never fall into the same extremities or worse by having our common hopes which depend upon the protestant succession in the illustrious house of hanover defeated according to some mens desires and wishes which we pray may never take effect  finis
