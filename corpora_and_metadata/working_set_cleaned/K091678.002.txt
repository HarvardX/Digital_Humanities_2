place but swarm in the hotter parts of america and are found in the islands where they are said to be far inferior in size to those of north america  in the warm climates they keep in vast flocks manners perch at night on rocks or trees sitting with dishevelled wings to purify their bodies which are most offensively fetid toward morning they take flight soaring at a vast height with the gentle motion of a kite expecting notice of their banquet by the tainted effluvia of carrion excrements or any filth they have most sagacious nostrils and smell their prey at a vast distance to which they resort from all quarters wheeling about and making a gradual descent till they reach the ground they do not confine themselves to dead animals but feed on snakes and sometimes on lambs they are very tame and while they are at their meals will suffer a very near approach  in the torrid zone particularly about carthagena they haunt inhabited places and are seen in numbers sitting on the roofs of the houses or walking along the streets with a sluggish pace in those parts they are useful as the ibis in egypt devouring the noisome subjects which would otherwise by the intolerable stench render the climate still more unwholesome than it is  when these birds find no food in the cities they are driven by hunger among the cattle of the neighboring pastures if they see a beast with a sore on the back they instantly alight on it and attack the part affected the poor animal attempts in vain to free itself from the devourers rolling on the ground with hideous cries but in vain for the vultures never quit hold till they have effected its destruction sometimes an eagle presides at the banquet and keeps these cowardly birds at a distance until it has finished its repast  uses mischievous as they are in a few instances yet by the wise and beneficent dispensations of providence they make in the hot climates full recompense by lessening the number of those destructive animals the alligators which would otherwise become intolerable by their multitudes during the season in which these reptiles lay their eggs in the sand the vultures will sit hid in the leaves of the trees watching the coming of the female alligator to deposit its eggs who then covers them with sand to secure them as she imagines from all danger but no sooner does she retire into the water than the birds dart on the spot and with claws wings and beak tear away the sand and devour the whole contents of the depository  no birds of this genus are found in northern regions of europe or asia at lest in those latitudes

du pratz ii    latham i     the natives of louisiana set a high value on the feathers and give a large price for those of the wings with them they adorn the calumet or pipe of peace different nations make use of the wings or feathers of different birds but according to hennepin always decorate it with the most beautiful  the calumet is an instrument of the first importance among the americans it is nothing more than a pipe calumet whose bowl is generally made of a soft red marble du pratz i     kalm iii   0  the tube of a very long reed ornamented with the wings and feathers of birds no affair of consequence is transacted without the calumet it ever appears in meetings of commerce or exchanges in congresses for determining of peace or war and even in the very fury of a battle the acceptance of the calumet is a mark of concurrence with the terms proposed as the refusal is a certain mark of rejection even in the rage of a conflict this pipe is sometimes offered and if accepted the weapons of destruction instantly drop from their hands and a truce ensues it seems the sacrament of the savages for no compact is ever violated which is confirmed by a whiff from this holy reed the dance of the calumet is a solemn rite which always confirms a peace or precedes a war it is divided into three parts the first appears an act of devotion danced in measured time the second is a true representation of the pyrrhic dance strabo lib x p     edit amstel   0   the third is attended with songs expressive of the victories they had obtained the nations they had conquered and the captives they had made  from the winged ornaments of the calumet and its conciliating uses writers compare it to the caduceus of mercury which was carried by the caduceatores or messengers of peace with terms to the hostile states it is singular that the most remote nations and the most opposite in their other customs and manners should in some things have as it were a certain consent of thought the greeks and the americans had the same idea in the invention of the caduceus of the one and the calumet of the other some authors imagine that among the greeks the wings were meant as a symbol of eloquence i rather think that the twisted serpents expressed that insinuating faculty and that the emblem was originally taken from the fatal effect the rhetoric of satan had on our great mother when he assumed the form of that reptile which the highest authority represents as more subtle than any beast of the field on this the heathen mythology formed their tale of jupiter taking the figure of a serpent to insinuate himself into the good graces of olympias who like eve fell a victim to his persuasive tongue as to the wings it is most probable that they were to show the flight of discord which the reconciled parties gave with all the horrors of war to the air and sport of the winds  the oole or eagle is a sacred bird among the americans in case of sickness they invoke this bird to descend from heaven which in its exalted flight it approaches nearer than any other and bring down refreshing things as it can dart down on its rapid wing quick as a flash of lightning adairs hist am indians

hundred yards long which is fastened to the net in order to pull it down and another is fastened to the upper part of the hoop and goes through the post to which the bait is tied as soon as the falcon sees the fowl flutter on the ground he takes a few circles in the air to see if there is any danger then darts on its prey with such violence as to strike off the head as nicely as if it was done with a razor he then usually rises again and takes another circle to explore the place a second time after which it makes another stoop when at the instant of its descending the man pulls the dead bird

falconry the passage in aristotle and the epigram in martial do by no means fix it to the periods in which they wrote the philosopher arist de mirabil auscult informs us that there was a district in thrace in which the boys used to assemble at a certain time of the year for the sake of birdcatching that the spot was much frequented by hawks which were wont to appear on hearing themselves called and would drive the little birds into the bushes where they were caught by the children and that the hawks would even sometimes take the birds and fling them to these young sportsmen who after finishing their diversion gratefully bestowed on their assistants part of their prey this tale may have some truth at the bottom it being notorious that larks and even partridges will by the terror of a hawk passing over them lie so still as to suffer themselves to be taken by any passenger here seems to have been no training of these thracian hawks but a mere casual concurrence of hawks and small birds which afforded now and then an amusement to the youth of the country the thought expressed on the ancient gem of little genii engaged in the chase of deer assisted by an eagle may have originated from this story  the poet only describes another kind of birdcatching in the following epigram on the fate of a hawk praedo fuit volucrum famulus nunc aucupis idem decipit et captas non sibi moeret aves lib xiv ep      by the word decipit it is plain that the hawk was not trained but was merely used as a stale either to entice small birds under a net or to the limed twigs the last is a method still in use in italy the italians call it uccellare con la civetta for instead of a hawk they place a small species of owl on a pole in the middle of a field and surround it at various distances with limetwigs the small birds from their strange propensity to approach rapacious fowls fly around perch on the rods and are taken in great numbers olina     a hawk would serve the purpose full as well pliny mentions the use of birdlime hist not lib xci c     and longus in his elegant romance of daphnis and chloe employs the latter to catch little birds for his beloved fr ed octavo      i cannot find any certainty of hawks being trained for diversion before the time of king ethelbert the saxon monarch who died in the year   0 saxon chr  0  he wrote into germany for a brace of falcons which would fly at cranes and bring them to the ground quoted by mr whitaker in hist manchester from max bibliotheca patrum xiii p    ep  0  as there were very few such in kent this shows how erroneous the opinion was of those who place it in the reign of the emperor frederic barbarossa barossa spelmans gloss  who was drowned in      by the application of ethelbert to boniface archbishop of mentz for the brace of falcons it is evident that the diversion was in perfection in germany before the year     the time in which that prelate was martyred by the pagans it seems to me highly probable that falconry was invented in scythia and passed from thence into the northern parts of europe tartary is even at present celebrated for its fine breed of falcons and the sport is in such general esteem that according to olearius there was no hut but what had its eagle or falcon oleariuss travels      the boundless plains of that country are as finely adapted to the diversion as the wooded or mountanous nature of most part of europe is ill calculated for that rapid amusement  the antiquity of falconry in tartary is evinced by the exhibition of the sport on the very ancient tombs strahlenberg tab a b found in that country in which are figured horsemen at full speed with hawks on their hands others again in the same attitude discharging their arrows at their game in the very manner of the ancient scythians  from germany falconry got footing in england and became so favored a diversion that even sanguinary laws were enacted for the preservation of rapacious fowls edward iii made it death for the stealing of a hawk and to take its eggs even in a persons own ground was punishable with a fine at the kings pleasure and imprisonment for a year and a day in the reign of james i the amusement was carried to such an extravagant pitch that sir thomas monson is said to have given a thousand pounds for a cast of hawks  e dusky falco fuscus faun groen    no    b gray

obscuring at times the very sky with their multitudes they were esteemed the pest of the colonies making most dreadful havoc among the maize and other grain both when new sown and when ripe they are very bold and not to be terrified with a gun for notwithstanding the sportsman makes slaughter in a flock the remainder will take a short flight and settle again in the same field the farmers sometimes attempt their destruction by steeping the maize in a decoction of white hellebore before they plant it the birds which eat this prepared corn are seized with a vertigo and fall down which sometimes drives the rest away this potion is particularly aimed against the purple grakles or purple jackdaw which consorts in myriads with this species as if in conspiracy against the labors of the

bestowed on it titles expressive of its resplendent colors some nations called it ourissia and guaracyaba or the sunbeam others guanaeygaba or hairs of the sun others again named it huitzitzil or vicililin or the regenerated because they believed it died annually and was reanimated at the return of the flowers it fed on that it stuck its bill into the trunk of a tree and remained lifeless for six months when the vital powers remigrated and restored to nature one of its most brilliant wonders  it flies with a swiftness which the eye is incapable of following swiftness the motion of the wings is so rapid as to be imperceptible to the nicest observer lightning is scarcely more transient than its flight nor the glare more bright than its colors food it never feeds but upon wing suspended over the flower it extracts nourishment from for its only food is the honied juice lodged in the nectarium which it sucks through the tubes of its curious tongue like the be having exhausted the honey of one flower it wanders to the next in search of new sweets it admires most those flowers which have the deepest tubes thus the female balsamine and the scarlet monarda are particular favorites whosoever sets those plants before the window is sure to be visited by multitudes of these diminutive birds it is a most entertaining sight to see them swarming around the flowers and trying every tube of verticillated plants by putting their bills into every one which encircles the stalk if they find that their brethren have been beforehand and robbed the flower of the honey they will in rage pluck off and throw it on the ground  the most violent passions animate at times their little bodies rage they have often dreadful contests when numbers happen to dispute possession of the same flower they will tilt against one another with such fury as if they meant to transfix their antagonists with their long bills during the fight they frequently pursue the conquered into the apartments of those houses whose windows are left open take a turn round the room as flies do in england and then suddenly regain the open air they are fearless of mankind and in feeding will suffer people to come within two yards of them but on a nearer approach dart away with admirable swiftness  fernandez oviedo an author of great repute speaks from his own knowledge of the spirited instinct even of this diminutive bird in defense of its young so that when they see a man clime ye tree where they have their nests they flee at his face and stryke him in the eyes coming goying and returnyng with such swyftness that no man would lightly believe it that has not seen it hist of west indies translated by richard eden p       father charlevoix gives a more apocryphal instance of the courage of this bird in its attack on its disproportioned enemy the raven as soon as the last appears the honeysucker flies up like lightning beds itself beneath the ravens wing and piercing him with his needlelike bill till the bird is heard to croak with agony at length tumbles to the ground dead either from the fall or the wound this relation seems of a piece with the combat of the wren with the eagle mentioned by aristotle hist an lib ix c    vol i      charlevoix v      but to do justice both to the french voyager and grecian philosopher i must add that each of them delivered their reports from oral evidence  many fables have been related of the melody of the song of these birds note in fact their only note is screep screep screep but the noise which they make with their wings especially in the morning when numbers are in motion is a sort of buzz or sound resembling that of a spinningwheel their note is chiefly emitted when they happen to strike against each other in their flight  nests their nests are found with great difficulty being built in the branch of a tree amidst the thick foliage it is of elegance suitable to the architects formed on the outside with moss in the inside lined with the down or gossamer collected from the great mullein or verbascum thapsus but it is also sometimes made of flax hemp hair and other soft materials it is of an hemispherical shape its inner diameter an inch its depth half an inch the female is said to be the builder the male supplying her with materials each assists in the labor of incubation which continues during twelve days they lay only two eggs white and as small as pease the first is very singular and contrary to the general rule of nature which makes in all other instances the smallest and most defenseless birds the most prolific the reasons of the exception in this case are double the smallness of their bodies causes them commonly to escape the eyes of birds of prey or if seen their rapid flight eludes pursuit so that the species is preserved as fully as if they had been the most numerous breeders  the indians of mexico peru and maynas make most exquisite pictures of the feathers of birds but those of the honeysuckers form the most brilliant part some use them as ornaments and hang them as pendants in their ears which give a blaze emulous of the ruby and emerald in order to compose pictures the indians draw off the feathers with small pincers and with fine paste most artfully join them together they dispose them with such skill as to give the true lights and shade to the performance and imitate nature with the greatest fidelity these were meant to decorate the idols and temples for before the depression of the indian spirit by the tyranny of the spaniards religion was highly

blue and yellowish as they happen to be affected the sight of any thing red excites their choler greatly  they are polygamous one cock serving or hens polygamous they lay in the spring and will lay a great number of eggs they will persist in laying for a great while they retire to some obscure place to sit the cock through rage at loss of its mate being very apt to break the eggs the females are very affectionate to the young and make great moan on the loss of them they sit on their eggs with such perseverance that if they are not taken away when addle the hens will almost perish with hunger before they will quit the nest  turkies greatly delight in the seeds of nettles but those of the purple foxglove prove fatal to them de buffon   they are very stupid birds quarrelsome and cowardly it is diverting to see a whole flock attack the common cock who will for a long time keep a great number at bay  they are very swift runners in the tame as well as the wild state swift they are but indifferent flyers they love to perch on trees perch high and gain the height they wish by rising from bough to bough in a wild state they get to the very summit of the loftiest trees even so high as to be beyond the reach of the musket lawson      in the state of nature they go in flocks even of five hundred lawson      gregarious feed much on the small red acorns and grow so fat in march that

be superior in goodness to the tame but redder eggs of the former have been taken from the nest and hatched under tame turkies the young will still prove wild perch separate yet mix and breed together

opinion that these birds were natives of the old world founds his notion on the description of the guinea fowl the meleagrides of strabo athenaeus pliny and others of the ancients i rest the refutation on the excellent account given by athenaeus taken from clytus milesius a disciple of aristotle which can suit no other than that fowl they want says he natural affection toward their young their head is naked and on the top is a hard round body like a peg or nail from their cheeks hangs a red piece of flesh like a beard it has no wattles like the common poultry the feathers are black spotted with white they have no spurs and both sexes are so like as not to be distinguished by the sight varro lib iii c   and pliny lib x c    take notice of the spotted plumage and the gibbous substance on the head athenaeus is more minute and contradicts every character of the turkey whose females are remarkable for their natural affection which differ materially in form from the males whose heads are destitute of the callous substance and whose heels in the male are armed with spurs  aldrovandus who died in   0  aldrovandus draws his arguments from the same source as belon i therefore pass him by and take notice of the greatest of our naturalists gesner av      and gesner who falls into a mistake of another kind and wishes the turkey to be thought a native of india he quotes aelian for that purpose who tells us that in india are very large poultry not with combs but with variouscolored crests interwoven like flowers with broad tails neither bending nor displayed in a circular form which they draw along the ground as peacocks do when they do not erect them and that the feathers are partly of a gold color partly blue and of an emerald color de anim lib xvi c     this in all probability was the same bird with the peacock pheasant of mr edwards le paon de tibet of m brisson and the pavo bicalcaratus of linnaeus i have seen this bird living it has a crest but not so conspicuous as that described by aelian but it has those striking colors in form of eyes neither does it erect its tail like the peacock edw ii    brisson i     lin syst      the catreus of strabo lib xv p  0   seems to be the same bird he describes it as uncommonly beautiful and spotted and very like a peacock the former author de anim lib xvii c    gives a more minute account of this species and under the same name he borrows it from clitarchus an attendant of alexander the great in all his conquests it is evident from his description that it was of this kind and it is likewise probable that it was the same with his large indian poultry before cited he celebrates it also for its fine note but allowance must be made for the credulity of aelian the catreus or peacock pheasant is a native of tibet and in all probability of the north of india where clitarchus might have observed it for the march of alexander was through that part of india which borders on tibet and now known by the name of penjab or five rivers  not natives of europe i shall now collect from authors the several parts of the world where turkies are unknown in the state of nature europe has no share in the question it being generally agreed that they are exotic in respect to our continent  nor of asia neither are they found in any part of asia minor or the asiatic turkey notwithstanding ignorance of

mentioned in the northumberland household book in the beginning of the reign of henry viii  neither do we find the turkey which last argument amounts to almost a certainty that such a hardy and princely bird had not found its way to us the other likewise was then known here by its classical name for that judicious writer dr caius caii opusc     describes in the beginning of the reign of elizabeth the guinea fowl for the benefit of his friend gesner under the name of meleagris bestowed on it by aristotle hist an lib vi c     having denied on the very best authorities that the turkey ever existed as a native of the old world i must now bring my proofs of its being only a native of the new and of the period in which it first made its appearance in europe  but of america the first precise description of these birds is given by oviedo who in      drew up a summary of his greater work the history of the indies for the use of his monarch charles v this learned man had visited the west indies and its islands in person and paid particular regard to the natural history it appears from him that the turkey was in his days an inhabitant of the greater islands and of the main land he speaks of them as peacocks for being a new bird to him he adopts that name from the resemblance he thought they bore to the former but says he the neck is bare of feathers but covered with a skin which they change after their fantasy into diverse colors they have a horn as it were on their front and hairs on the breast in purchase iii      he describes other birds which he also calls peacocks they are of the gallinaceous genus and known by the name of curassao birds the male of which is black the female ferruginous  the next who speaks of them as natives of the main land of the warmer parts of america is francisco fernandez sent there by philip ii to whom he was physician this naturalist observed them in mexico mexico we find by him that the indian name of the male was huexolofl of the female cihuatotolin he gives them the title of gallus indicus and gallopavo as the indians as well as spaniards domesticated these useful birds he speaks of the size by comparison saying that the wild were twice the magnitude of the tame and that they were shot with arrows or guns hist av nov hisp     i cannot learn the time when fernandez wrote it must be between the years      and      the period of philips reign  pedro de ciesa mentions turkies on the isthmus of darien seventeen years travels  0  darien lery a portuguese author asserts that they are found in brasil and gives them an indian name in de laets descr des indes      but since i can discover no traces of them in that diligent and excellent naturalist marcgrave who resided long in that country i must deny my assent but

du pratz ii are too flight for us to determine the species they mean charlevoix in his account of canada vol v describes it very well   manners the history of this species is very curious all which i beg leave to transcribe from mr edwards according to the accounts given him by mr bartram and mr brook who had frequent opportunity of observing its manners to which i shall add another borrowed from the travels of the baron la hontan  from mr bartram he is says mr bartram a fine bird when his gaiety is displayed that is when he spreads his tail like that of a turkeycock and erects a circle of feathers round his neck like a ruff walking very stately with an even pace and making a noise something like a turkey at which time the hunter must fire immediately at him or he flies away directly two or three hundred yards before he settles on the ground there is something very remarkable in what we call their thumping which they do with their wings by clapping them against their sides as the hunters say they stand upon an old fallen tree that has lain many years on the ground where they begin their strokes gradually at about two seconds of time distant from one another and repeat them quicker and quicker until they make a noise like thunder at a distance which continues from the beginning about a minute then cease for about six or eight minutes before it begins again the sound is heard near half a mile by which means they are discovered by the hunters and many of them killed i have shot many of them in this position but never saw them thump they mostly seeing me first and so left off they commonly exercise in thumping spring and fall at about nine or ten in the morning and four or five in the afternoon their food is chiefly berries and seeds of the country their flesh is white and choice food i believe they breed but once a year in the spring and hatch twelve or fourteen at a brood which keep in a company till the following spring many have attempted to raise the young ones and to tame them but to no purpose when hatched under a hen they escape into the woods soon after they are hatched where they either find means to subsist or perish  the history of this bird is thus further illustrated by mr brook of maryland in north america the ruffed grous or pheasant mr brook breeds in all parts of maryland some countries on the eastern shore excepted they lay their eggs in nests they make in the leaves either by the side of fallen trees or the roots of standing ones they lay from twelve to sixteen eggs the time of incubation is in the spring but how long their eggs are hatching i cannot say but probably it is three weeks the time that a dunghill hen sits i have found their nests when a boy and have endeavored to take the old pheasant but never could succeed she would almost let me put my hand upon her before she would quit her nest then by artifice she would draw me off from her eggs by fluttering just before me for a hundred paces or more so that i have been in constant hopes of taking her they leave their nests as soon as they are hatched and i believe they live at first on ants small worms etc when they are a few days old they hide themselves so artfully among the leaves that it is difficult to find them as they grow up they feed on various berries fruits and grain of the country grapes they likewise are fond of in the season but the pheasant is more particularly fond of the ivyberry i do not know any other animal that feeds on this berry i know it is poison to many though the pheasant hatches many young at a time and often sits twice a year the great number and variety of hawks in maryland feeding on them prevents their increasing fast the beating of the pheasant as we term it is a noise chiefly made in the spring of the year by the cockbird it may be distinctly heard a mile in a calm day they swell their breasts like the powting pigeon and heat with their wings which make a noise not unlike a drum in sound but the pheasant shortens each sounding note till they run one into another undistinguishably like striking two empty bottles together  la hontan in order to perfect as far as i am able the history of this bird i shall give a quotation from baron la hontans voyages to north america published in english vol i p    where he speaks of a bird found near the lakes of canada which i think can be no other than the abovedescribed though the names given them disagree  la hontan says i went in company with some canadese on purpose to see that fowl flap with its wings believe me this sight is one of the greatest curiosities in the world for their flapping makes a noise much like a drum for about the space of a minute then the noise ceases for half a quarter of an hour after which it begins again by this noise we were directed to the place where the unfortunate morehen sat and found them upon rotten mossy trees by flapping one wing against the other they mean to call their mates and the humming noise that ensues thereupon may be heard half a quarter of a league this they do in the months of april may september and october and which is very remarkable the morehen never flaps in this manner but upon one tree it begins at break of day and gives over at nine oclock in the morning till about an hour before sunset then it flutters again and continues so to do till night  mr graham to these accounts i beg leave to add the following out of the philosophical transactions which informs us that this species of grous bears the indian name of puskee or puspuskee at hudsons bay on account of the leanness and dryness of their flesh which is extremely white and of a very close texture but when well prepared is excellent eating they are pretty common at moose fort and henly house but are seldom seen at albany fort or to the northward of the above places in winter they feed upon junipertops in summer on gooseberries raspberries currants cranberries etc they are not migratory staying all the year at moose fort they build their nest on dry ground hatch nine young at a time to which the mother clucks as our common hens do and on the lest appearance of danger or in order to enjoy an agreeable degree of warmth the young ones retire under the wings of their parent    0 pinnated urogallus minor fuscus cervice plumis alas imitantibus donata catesby app tab i tetrao cupido lin syst

all parts along the coasts make their nests on dry ridges on the ground and lay from nine to eleven eggs powdered with black  this is the only species of grous in n america to which providence has given that warm protection to its feet evidently to secure them against the cold of their winter lodgings and as they are greatly sought after by eagles owls and other birds of prey a fine provision is made for their safety by the change of color which renders them not to be distinguished from the snow they lie on  every morning they take a flight into the air directly upwards to shake the snow from their wings and bodies they feed in the mornings and evenings and in the middle of the day bask in the sun in the morning they call to one another with a loud note interrupted feeding in the intervals and calling again  in the beginning of october they assemble in flocks of two hundred and live much among the willows the tops of which they eat whence they are called willow partridges

searched after by the europeans in hudsons bay they are generally as tame as chickens especially in a mild day sometimes they are rather wild but by being driven about or shot at with powder they grow so weary by the short flights they take as soon to become very tame again sometimes the hunters when they see the birds likely to take a long flight imitate the crying of a hawk which intimidates them

lesser numbers according to the mildness or severity of season for when the weather proves mild few or none are seen in the southern parts necessity alone obliges them to change their quarters in search of acorns food mast and berries which the warmer provinces yield in vast abundance when they alight the ground is soon cleared of all esculent fruits to the great loss of the hog and other masteating animals when they have devoured every thing which has fallen on the surface they form themselves into a great perpendical column and by rotation keep flying among the boughs of the trees from top to bottom beating down the acorns with their wings and some or other in succession alight on the earth and eat du pratz  the species of food they are fondest of is the small acorn called the turkey acorn it being also a favorite food of those birds in canada they do vast damage in autumn by devouring the corn before they begin their southern flight the same   they build their nests in

december and when the ground is covered with snow feed on the buds of juniper  as soon as these birds find a want of food migrations they collect in vast flocks and migrate to such places as are likely to supply them with subsistence vast numbers the multitudes which appear during the rigorous seasons are so immense that the mention of them unless supported by good authority would seem incredible they fly by millions in a flock and in their passage literally intercept the light of the sun for a considerable space as soon as one flock has passed another succeeds each taking a quarter of an hour before the whole flock is gone this continues in some seasons for three days without any intermission catesby   the inhabitants of new york and pennsylvania are frequent witnesses of the phenomenon and kill numbers of these migrants from their balconies and the roofs of their houses when they alight on trees to roost they often break the limbs of stout oaks unable to support the weight of the crowds which perch on them the ground beneath the trees on which they have lodged a night is covered with their dung to a considerable depth lawson     the rev mr burnaby relates the prodigious flights he saw passing in september southerly over new england he adds he scarcely met with any other food in the inns he was at p       josselyn who observed these pigeons in      in new england before they were disturbed by population says he has seen flights of them moving at michaelmas to the southward four or five miles long so thick that he lost sight of the sun he adds that they return in spring return and that they join nest to nest and tree to tree by their nests for many miles together in the woods voy     kalm mentions their passage through jersey in march  the inhabitants of north america profit by this kind gift of providence and shoot them in their passage for they are very fat and excellent meat the indians watch the roostingplaces go in the night and knocking them down with long poles bring away thousands formerly you could not go into a little indian town in the interior parts of carolina their oil but you would find a hundred gallons of pigeons oil or fat which they use with their mayz as we do butter lawson     they scorn to obtain that useful article from the quiet employ of the dairy but are fond of the similitude provided it could be obtained by any means suitable to their active spirit  m du pratz hit upon an ingenious expedient of taking them on roost by placing under the trees vessels filled with flaming sulphur the fumes of which ascending brought them senseless to the ground in perfect showers  i shall conclude this account with what was communicated to me by the late mr ashton blackburne from his own observations or those of his friends who were eyewitnesses to the wondrous facts related of these birds  new york june       0 i think says mr blackburne this as remarkable a bird as any in america they are in vast numbers in all parts and have been of great service at particular times to our garrisons in supplying them with fresh meat especially at the outposts a friend told me that in the year in which quebec was taken the whole army was supplied with them if they chose it the way was this every man took his club for they were forbid to use their firelocks when they flew as it was termed in such quantities that each person could kill as many as he wanted they in general begin to fly soon after daybreak and continue till nine or ten oclock and again about three in the afternoon and continue till five or six but what is very remarkable they always fly westerly the times of flying here are in the spring about the latter end of february or the beginning of march and continue every day for eight or ten days and again in the fall when they begin the latter end of july or the beginning of august they catch vast quantities of them in clapnets with stale pigeons i have seen them brought to this market by sacksfull people in general are very fond of them and i have heard many say they think them as good as our common blue pigeon but i cannot agree with them by any means they taste more like our queest or wild pigeon but are better meat they have another way of killing them  they make a hut of boughs of trees and six stale pigeons on the ground at a small distance from the hut they plant poles for the wild pigeons to light on when they come a salting as they term it which they do every morning in the season repairing to the marshes near the seaside then the persons in the hut pull the stale pigeon when the birds will alight in vast numbers on the poles and great multitudes are shot sir william johnson told me that he killed at one shot with a blunderbuss a hundred and twenty or thirty some years past they have not been in such plenty as they used to be this spring i saw them fly one morning as i thought in great abundance but every body was amazed how few there were and wondered at the reason  i must remark one very singular fact that notwithstanding the whole people of a town go out a pigeoning as they call it they will not on some days kill a single hen bird and on the very next day not a single cock and yet both sexes always fly westerly and when this is the case the people are always assured that there will be great plenty of them that season i have been at niagara when the sentinel has given the word that the pigeons were flying and the whole garrison were ready to run over one another so eager were they to get fresh meat       carolina picacuroba

that come near his station from the smallest to the largest none escaping his fury nor did i ever see any that dared to oppose him while flying for he does not offer to attack them when sitting i have seen one of them fix on the back of an eagle and persecute him so that he has turned on his back into various postures in the air in order to get rid of him and at last was forced to alight on the top of the next tree from whence he dared not to move till the little tyrant was tired or thought fit to leave him this is the constant practice of the cock while the hen is brooding he sits on the top of a bush or small tree not far from her nest near which if any small birds approach he drives them away but the great ones as crows hawks and eagles he will not suffer to come within a quarter of a mile of him without attacking them they have only a chattering note which they utter with great vehemence all the time they are fighting  when their young are flown they are as peaceable as other birds it

on high trees but on bushes rails or the steps of houses which they frequent as insects swarm more near to habitations than other places they give their note sitting if they see an insect pass they fly up catch it and then settle again and renew their song ofttimes numbers perch near one another make a vast noise repeating their song as if in emulation they continue their call till it is quite

pretty much like the sound of the pronunciation of the words whip poor will with a kind of a chucking between every other or every two or three cries and they lay the accent upon the last word will

preparing to depart from his long confinement after the shipwreck of his illustrious commander he sailed from thence on the  0th of august this coincides with the remigration of these birds who retire from the former places about the end of july or the middle of august their arrival is the certain forerunner of fish it is probable that they pursue their prey northward as they do not return the same

distant places they are the most voracious of birds and will so fill themselves with fish that sometimes a large one will hang half out of their mouths till those in their stomach are digested they will be at times so laden with food as to become incapable of flying and even so stupefied as to be readily hunted down by boats or transfixed in the water by darts neither can they arise till they have vomited up their prey which they strive to do with all their might  the kamtschatkans are very solicitous about the capture of these birds capture not so much for the sake of their flesh which is very tough and dry and never eaten unless hunger compels but on account of the intestines which they blow into bladders in order to form floats for their nets they angle for the albatrosses as they do

and a half long white with some small obscure spots at the thicker end they are constantly watched while on their nests by multitudes of hawks who no sooner see the albatross quit its nest but they instantly dart down and carry off the egg this obliges them to lay another and prolong the season of incubation  the remaining part of the summer they wander over all parts of the antarctic seas and

kamtschatka      this species has several distinctions from the species which we specific distinctions in england call the tame swan in russia this species more fitly clames the name it being the kind most commonly tamed in that empire the whistling swan carries its neck quite erect the other swims with it arched this is far inferior in size this has twelve ribs on a side the mute we change the name of the tame swan into mute as the former name is equivocal and this species emitsno sound only eleven but the most remarkable is the strange figure of the windpipe which falls into the chest then turns back like a trumpet and afterward makes a second bend to join the lungs thus it is enabled to utter a loud and shrill note the other swan on the contrary is the most silent of birds it can do nothing more than hiss which it does on receiving any provocation the vocal kind emits its loud notes only when flying or calling its sound is whoogh whoogh very loud and shrill but not disagreeable when heard far above ones head and modulated by the winds the natives of iceland compare it to the notes of a violin in fact they hear it at the end of their long and gloomy winter when the return of the swans announces the return of summer every note must be therefore melodious which presages the speedy thaw and the release from their tedious confinement  it is from this species alone that the ancients have given the fable of the swan being endued with the powers of melody vocal swan of the poets embracing the pythagorean doctrine they made the body of this bird the mansion of the souls of departed poets and after that attributed to the birds the same faculty of harmony which their inmates possessed in a preexistent state the vulgar not distinguishing between sweetness of numbers and melody of voice thought that real which was only intended figuratively the mute swan never frequents the padus and i am almost equally certain that it never is seen on the cayster in lydia each of

his knees with his gun cocked the whole time and never fires till he has seen the eyes of the geese he fires as they are going from him then picks up another gun that lies by him and discharges that the geese which he has killed he sets up on sticks as if alive to decoy others he also makes artificial birds for the same purpose in a good day for they fly in very uncertain and unequal numbers a

and such good diverse as not to be shot without difficulty in vast flocks food and feed on the roots of sedge and grass which they tear up like hogs it used to be a common practice in that country to burn a piece of a marsh which enticed the geese to come there as they could then more readily get at the roots which gave the sportsman opportunity of killing as many as he pleased in hudsons bay thousands are annually shot by the indians for the use of the settlement and are esteemed excellent meat  they arrive in the earliest spring migrations before any other species of waterfowl in immense flights first about the river kolyma their course is from the east tending to the frozen ocean and spreading to the estuaries of the jana and lena before the ice is broken up finding the want of subsistence they bend their journey a little southward in search of the insects and plants which abound in the inland lakes and moors in this manner they penetrate as low as jakut and very rarely farther except in very small detachments which stray toward the olecma and sometimes by accident to the junction of the witim with the lena they make very little stay in those parts but again tend directly to the arctic coasts of sibiria where they breed but they do not take the same route keeping more easterly toward the jana and indigirka it is observable that they never migrate westward

subsist they are annually guilty of the same mistake and annually compelled to make a new migration to the south in quest of food where they pass their time till the northern estuaries are freed from the bonds of ice  manner of taking they have so little of the shyness of other geese that they are taken in the most ridiculous manner imaginable about jakut and the other parts of sibiria which they frequent the inhabitants first place near the banks of the rivers a great net in a strait line or else form a hovel of skins sewed together this done one of the company dresses himself in the skin of a white reindeer advances toward the flock of geese and then turns back toward the net or the hovel and his companions go behind the flock and by making a noise drive them forward the simple birds mistake the man in white for their leader and follow him within reach of the net which is suddenly pulled down and captivates the whole when he chooses to conduct them to the hovel they follow in the same manner he creeps in at a hole left for that purpose and out at another on the opposite side which he closes up the geese follow him through the first and as soon as they are got in he passes round and secures every one the kamtschatkans use the same method in taking geese descr kamtschatka      in that frozen clime they afford great subsistence to the natives and the feathers are an

england the geese in the daytime repair to the cornfieldsd and meadows in the evening resort to the lakes to wash themselves and pass the night the sibirians generally fix on a place where there are two or three lakes near each other and out between each an avenue through the thick birch woods of the country if there is not the advantage of adjacent lakes the avenue is made through the woods which border the sides of any which the birds frequent at the entrance of the glades on each side a tall birchtree is left standing and all their branches stripped away from the tops of these naked trees is placed a strong net which fills the breadth of the avenue this net is capable of being dropped or raised at pleasure by means of certain long cords which run along the top and the ends of which are held by a man who conceals himself in the high grass the geese commonly leave the lakes an hour before sunrise and as they do not choose to fly high at that season prefer going through the avenues and with their long extended necks strike into the nets which are suddenly dropped and twenty and often more of the geese are taken at a time all sorts of ducks and other waterfowl are taken

the fowlers creep quietly toward the birds and fling it round their necks and draw them up the rock the rest of the flock are so stupid that notwithstanding they see the fate of their companions they remain shaking their heads on the same spot till they are all taken the flesh is excessively hard and sinewy the kamtschatkans cook it after their fashion by putting the bird without plucking or gutting into a hole filled with fire and when it is done enough draw off the skin and make on it a savory repast  having gone through the class of birds let me remark that there is the greatest probability that numbers of those of kamtschatka are common to north america and that they pass there the seasons of migration but not having actual proof of their being found on the new continent i

southern retreat and stock japan and china with their periodical flocks i have done as much as the lights of my days have furnished me with in some remote age when the british offspring will have pervaded the whole of their vast continent or the descendants of the hardy russians colonized the western parts from their distant kamtschatka the road in future time to new conquests after perhaps bloody contests between the progeny of britons and russians about countries to which neither have any right after the deaths of thousands of clamants and the extirpation of the poor natives by the sword and newimported diseases a quiet settlement may take place civilization ensue and the arts of peace be cultivated learning the luxury of the soul diffuse itself through the nation and some naturalist arise who with spirit and abilities may explore each boundary of the ocean which separates the asiatic and american continents may render certain what i can only suspect and by his observations on the feathered tribe their flights and migrations give utility to mankind in naval and oeconomical operations by auguries which the ancients knew well to apply to the benefit of their fellow creatures he may perhaps smile on the labors of the arctic zoologist if by that time they are not quite obsolete and as the animate creation never changes her course he may find much right and
