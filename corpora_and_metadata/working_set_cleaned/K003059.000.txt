the country girl a comedy altered from wycherley as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane  dublin printed for w and w smith j hoey sen j murphy w whitestone h saunders d chamberlain j potts j hoey jun j williams o adams and t ryder and w colles  mdcclxvi  advertisement the desire of showing miss reynolds to advantage was the first motive for attempting an alteration of wycherleys country wife though near half of the following play is new written the alterer claims no merit but his endeavor to clear one of our most celebrated comedies from immorality and obscenity he thought himself bound to preserve as much of the original as could be presented to an audience of these times without offense and if this wanton of charless days is now so reclaimed as to become innocent without being insiped the present editor will not think his time ill employed which has enabled him to add some little variety to the entertainments of the public there seems indeed an absolute necessity for reforming many plays of our most eminent writers for no kind of wit ought to be received as an excuse for for immorality nay it becomes still more dangerous in proportion as it is more witty  without such a reformation our english comedies must be reduced to a very small number and would pall by a too frequent repetition or what is worse continue shameless in spite of public disapprobation  whatever fate this play may have in the closet it is much indebted to the preformers for its favorable reception upon the stage  dramatis personae moody mr holland harcourt mr palmer sparkish mr dodd

three years at college and half a one at paris methinks should have cured you of that unfashionable weakness  modesty   belv could i have released myself from that i had perhaps been at this instant happy in the possession of what i must despair now ever to obtain  heigho   harc ha ha ha very foolish indeed   belv dont laugh at me uncle i am foolish i know but like other fools i deserve to be pitied   harc prithee dont talk of pity how can i help you  for this country girl of yours is certainly married   belv no no  i will not believe it she is not married nor she shall not if i can help

lady that is going to be married to another as well as you sir   belv but sparkish is your friend   harc prithee dont call him my friend he can be nobodys friend not even his own  he would thrust himself into my acquaintance would introduce me to his mistress though i have told him again and again that i was in love with her which instead of ridding me of him has made him only ten times more troublesome  and me really in love  he should suffer for his selfsufficiency   belv it is a conceited puppy  and what success with the lady   harc no great hopes  and yet if i could defer the marriage a few days i should not despair  her honor i am confident is her only attachment to my rival  she cannot like sparkish and if i can work upon his credulity a credulity which even popery would be ashamed of i may yet have the chance of throwing sixes upon the dice to save me   belv nothing can save me   harc no not if you whine and sigh when you should be exerting every thing that is man about

for him  tell me all you know of this ward of his this peggy  peggy what is her name   belv thrift thrift uncle   harc ay ay sir thomas thrifts daughter of hampshire and left very young under the guardianship of my old companion and acquaintance jack moody   belv your companion  he is old enough to be your father   harc thank you nephew  he has greatly the advantage of me in years as well as wisdom  when i first launched from the university into this ocean of london  he was the greatest rake in it i knew him well for near two years but all of a sudden he tooka freak a very prudent one of retiring wholly into the country   belv there he gained such an ascendency over the odd disposition of his neighbor sir thomas that he left him sole guardian to his daughter who forfeits half her fortune if she does not marry with his consent  there is the devil uncle   harc and are you so young so foolish and so much in love that you would take her with half her value ha nephew   belv i will take her with any thing  with nothing   harc what such an unaccomplishd awkward silly creature  he has scarce taught her to write  she has seen nobody to converse with but the country people about em so she can do nothing but dangle her arms look gawky turn her toes in and talk broad hampshire   belv dont abuse her sweet simplicity  had you but heard her talk as i have done from the gardenwall in the country by moonlight   harc romeo and juliet i protest ha ha ha arise fair sun and kill the envious  ha ha ha how often have you seen this fair capulet   belv i saw her three times in the country and spoke to her twice i have leaped an orchardwall like romeo to come at her played the balconyscene from an old summer house in the garden and if i lose her i will find out an apothecary and play the tombscene too for i cannot bear to be crossed in love   harc well said dick  this spirit must produce something  but has the old dragon ever caught you sighing at her   belv never in the country he saw me yesterday kissing my hand to her from the new tavernwindow that looks upon the back of his house and immediately drove her from it and fastened up the windowshutters   sparkish without spark very well will i will go up to em   harc i hear sparkish coming up  take care of what i told you  not a word of peggy  hear his intelligence and make use of it without seeming to mind it   belv mum mum uncle   enter sparkish spar o my dear harcourt i shall die with laughing  i have such news for thee  ha ha ha  what your nephew too and a little dumpish or so  you have been giving him a lecture upon economy i suppose  you who never had any can best describe the evils that arise from the want of it  i never mind my own affairs not i  i hear mr belville you have got a pretty snug house with a bowwindow that looks into the park and a backdoor that goes out into it  very convenient and well imagined  no young handsome fellow should be without one  you may be always ready there like a spider in his web to seize upon strayed women of quality   harc as you used to do  you vain fellow you  prithee dont teach my nephew your abandoned tricks  he is a modest young man and you must not spoil him    spark may be so but his modesty has done some mischief at our house  my surly jealous brotherinlaw saw that modest young gentleman casting a wishful eye at his forbidden fruit from the new tavern window   belv you mistake the person mr sparkish i dont know what young lady you mean   harc explain yourself sparkish you must mistake  dick has never seen the girl   spar i dont say he has i only tell you what moody says besides he went to the tavern himself and inquired of the waiter who dined in the backroom  no    and they told him it was mr belville your nephew  that is all i know of the matter or desire to know of it  faith   harc he kissed his hand indeed to your lady alithea and is more in love with her than you are and very near as much as i am so look about you such a youth may be dangerous   spar the more danger the more honor i defy you both  win her and wear her if you can  dolus an virtus in love as well as in war  though you must be expeditious faith for i believe if i dont change my mind i shall marry her tomorrow or the day after  have you no honest clergyman harcourt no fellowcollegian to recommend to me to do the business   harc nothing ever sure was so lucky aside why faith i have sparkish  my brother a twinbrother ned harcourt will be in town to day and proud to attend your commands  i am a very generous rival you see to lend my brother to marry the woman i love   spar and so am i too to let your brother come so near us  but ned shall be the man poor alithea grows impatient  i cannot put off the evil day any longer  i fancy the brute her brother has a mind to marry his country idiot at the same time   belv how country idiot sir   harc taisez vous beat aside to belv i thought he had been married already   spar no no he is not married that is the joke of it   belv no no he is not married   harc hold your tongue  elbowing belville   spark not he  i have the finest story to tell you  by the by he intends calling upon you for he asked me where you lived to complain of modesty there  he picked up an old raking acquaintance of his as we came along together  will frankly who saw him with his girl sculking and muled up at the play last night  he plagued him much about matrimony and his being ashamed to show himself swore he was in love with his wife and intended to cuckold him do you cried moody folding his arms and scouling with his eyes thus  you must have more wit than you used to have  besides if you have as much as you think you have i shall be out of your reach and this profligate metropolis in less than a week  moody would feign have got rid of him but the other held him by the sleeve so i left em rejoiced most luxuriously to see the poor devil tormented   belv i thought you said just now that he was not married  is not that a contradiction sir   harcourt still makes signs to belville spark why it is a kind of a one  but considering your modesty and your ignorance of the young lady you are pretty tolerably inquisitive methinks ha harcourt ha ha ha   harc pooh pooh dont talk to that baby tell me all you know   spark you must know my boody of a brotherinlaw has brought up this ward of his a good fortune let me tell you as he coops up and fattens his chickens for his own eating  he is plaguey jealous of her and was very sorry that he could not marry her in the country without coming up to town which he could not do on account of some writings or other so what does my gentleman he persuades that poor silly girl by breaking a sixpence or some nonsense or another that they are to all intents married in heaven but that the laws require the signing of articles and the church service to complete their union  so he has made her call him husband and bud which she constantly does and he calls her wife and gives out she is married that she may not look after younger fellows nor younger fellows after her egad ha ha ha and all will not do   belv thank you sir  what heavenly news uncle   harc what an idiot you are nephew and so then you make but one trouble of it and are both to be tacked together the same day   spark no no he cant be married this week he damns the lawyers for keeping him in town  besides i am out of favor and he is continually snarling at me and abusing me for not being jealous knocking at the door there he is  i must not be seen with you for he will suspect something i will go with your nephew to his house and well wait for you and make a visit to my wife that is to be and perhaps we shall show young modesty here a sight of peggy too   enter servant serve sir here is the strange odd sort of a gentleman come again and i have shown him into the foreparlour   spark that must he moody well said will an odd sort of a strange gentleman indeed well step into the next room till he comes into this and then you may have him all to yourself  much good may do you  sparkish going returns remember that he is married or he will suspect me of betraying him  exit sparkish and belville harc show him up will now must i prepare myself to see a very strange though a very natural metamorphosis  a once highspirited handsome welldressd raking prodigal of the town sunk into a surly suspicious oeconomical country sloven  le voila   enter moody moody mr harcourt your humble servant  have you forgot me   harc what my old friend jack moody by thy long absence from the town the grumness of thy countenance and the slovenlyness of thy habit i should give thee joy  you are certainly married   moody my long stay in the country will excuse my dress and i have a suit of law that brings me up to town and puts me out of humor  besides i must give sparkish ten thousand pounds tomorrow to take my sister off my hands   harc your sister is very much obliged to you  being so much older than her you have taken upon you the authority of a father and have engaged her to a coxcomb   moody i have and to oblige her  nothing but coxcombs or debauchees are the favorites nowadays and a coxcomb is rather the more innocent animal of the two   harc she has sense and taste and cannot like him so you must answer for the consequences   moody when she is out of my hands her husband must look to consequences he is a fashionable fool and will cut his horns kindly   harc and what is to secure your worship from consequences  i did not expect marriage from such a rake  one that knew the town so well fie fie jack   moody i will tell you my security  i have married no london wife   harc that is all one  that grave circumspection in marrying a country wife is like refusing a deceitful pampered smithfieldjade to go and be cheated by a friend in the country   moody i wish the devil had both him and his simile aside   harc well never grumble about it what is done cannot be undone is your wife handsome and young   moody she has little beauty but her youth nothing to brag of but her health and no attraction but her modesty  wholesome homely and housewifely  that is all   harc you talk as like a grazier as you look jack  why did you not bring her to town before to be taught something   moody which something i might repent as long as i live  no no women and private soldiers should beignorant   harc but prithee why would thou marry her if she be ugly illbred and silly she must be rich then   moody as rich as if she had the wealth of the mogul  she will not ruin her husband like a london baggage with a million of vices she never heard of  then because she is ugly she is the likelier to be my own and being illbred she will hate conversation and since silly and innocent will not know the difference between me and you that is between a man of thirty and one of forty   harc fifty to my knowledge   moody turns off and grumbles but see how you and i differ jack  wit to me is more necessary than beauty i think no young woman ugly that has it and no handsome woman agreeable without it   moody it is my maxim  he is a fool that marries but he is a greater that does not marry a fool  i know the town mr harcourt and my wife shall be virtuous in spite of you or your nephew   harc my nephew  poor sheepish lad  he runs away from every woman he sees  he saw your sister alithea at the opera and was much smitten with her  he always toasts her  and hates the very name of sparkish i will bring him to your house  and you shall see what a formidable tarquin he is   moody i have no curiosity so give yourself no trouble  you have heard of a wolf in sheeps clothing and i have seen your innocent nephew kissing his hands at my windows   harc at your sister i suppose nor at her unless he was tipsy  how can you jack be so outragiously suspicious sparkish has promised to introduce him to his mistress   moody sparkish is a fool and may be what i will take care not to be  i confess my visit to you mr harcourt was partly for old acquaintance sake but chiefly to desire your nephew to confine his gallantries to the tavern and not send em in looks signs or tokens on the other side the way  i keep no brothel  so pray tell your nephew going   harc nay prithee jack leave me in better humor  well i will tell him ha ha ha poor dick how he will stare this will give him a reputation and the girls will not laugh at him any longer shall we dine together at the tavern and send for my nephew to chide him for his gallantry ha ha ha we shall have fine sport   moody i am not to be laughed out of my senses mr harcourt  i was once a modest meek young gentleman myself and i never have been half so mischievous before or since as i was in that state of innocence  and so old friend make no ceremony with me  i have much business and you have much pleasure and therefore as i hate forms i will excuse your returning my visit or sending your nephew to satisfy me of his modesty  and so your servant  exit harc alone ha ha ha poor jack what a life of suspicion does he lead i pity the poor fellow though he ought and will suffer for his folly  folly it is treason murder sacrilege when persons of a certain age will indulge their false ungenerous appetites at the expense of a young creatures happiness dame nature will revenge herself upon them for thwarting her most

is you are an enemy to marriage the common butt of every railer   harc truly madam i was never an enemy to marriage till now because marriage was never an enemy to me before   alith but why sir is marriage an enemy to you now because it robs you of your friend here for you look upon a friend married as one gone into a monastery that is dead to the world   harc it is indeed because you marry him

my virtue besides he loves me or he would not marry me   harc marrying you is no more a sign of his lo ve than bribing your woman that he may marry you is a sign of his generosity but if you take marriage for a sign of lo ve take it from me immediately   alith no now you have put a scruple in my head but in short sir to end our dispute i must marry him my reputation would suffer in the world

honor and would scorn to betray a friend who means you well and is above being mercenary   belv as you are not mercenary mrs lucy i ought to be the more generous  give me leave to present you with this trifle gives a ring not as a reward for services but as a small token of friendship   lucy though i scorn to be bribed in any cause yet i am proud to accept it as a mark of your regard and as such shall keep it for your sake  and now to business   belv you flatter me then that miss peggy has the most rooted aversion for her guardian and some prejudices in my favor   lucy she has entrusted me with her very thoughts  and i have raised her disobedience to such a pitch that she would have opened her whole heart to you in a letter had we not been interrupted by her brutal guardian   belv she told me in the park that you had convinced her she was not married to him   lucy there was not much difficulty in that but if any thing could have frightened her into that belief her filthy guardian had done it  he made her almost believe that the saving her soul depended upon marrying him  did you ever hear of such a reprobate   belv how i adore her bewitching simplicity   lucy simplicity sir she is able to make a fool of any of us  if i had half her wit i would not continue long in service as well as i love my mistress   belv but dear lucy what can miss peggy propose   lucy to run away from her guardian and marry you   belv she might have done both and lost the opportunity   lucy she will do both and make an opportunity if it does not come of itself the thought of running away or of being married when taken separately will put any maiden of us into great confusion but when they come both together are too much for the boldest of us  miss peggy was overpowered with your proposal and no wonder she could not determine for the best i should have been a little frightened myself   belv but has the dear creature resolved   lucy has she  why she will run away and marry you in spite of your teeth the first moment she can break prison  so you in your turn must take care not to have your qualms  i have known several bold gentlemen not able to draw their swords

contains aside   moody come never wonder at it so much   belv faith i cannot help it   moody now i think i have deserved your infinite friendship and kindness and have showed myself sufficiently an obliging kind friend and husband  am i not so to bring a letter from my wife to her gallant   belv ay indeed you are the most obliging kind friend and husband in the world ha ha ha pray however present my humble service to her and tell her i will obey her letter to a tittle and fulfill her desires be what they will or with what difficulty soever i do it and you shall be no more jealous of me

it  exit miss peggy moody my case is something better  for suppose the worst  should belville use her ill  i had rather fight him for not marrying my sister than for debauching my wife for i will make her mine absolutely tomorrow and of the two i had rather find my sister too forward than my wife i expected no other from her free education as she calls it and her passion for the town  well wife and sister are names which make us expect love and duty pleasure and comfort but we find em plagues and torments and are equally though differently troublesome to their keeper but here she comes steps on

gunpowder  the mine is sprung and the poor devils are tossed heels uppermost in an instant i was right to consult my friends and they all agree with moody that i make a damned ridiculous figure as matters stand at present i will consult belville  this is his house he is my friend too  and no fool  it shall be so  damn it i must not be ridiculous going to the door sees peggy coming hold hold if the champagne does not hurt my eyesight while it sharpens my wit the enemy is marching up this way  come on madam alithea now for a smart fire and then let us see who will be ridiculous   enter miss

she stands at bay a little  she dont much relish the engagement  the first blow is half the battle  i will be a little figurative with her approaching her i find madam you like a solo better than a duet you need not have been walking alone this evening if you had been wiser yesterday  what nothing to say for yourself  repentance i suppose makes you as awkward and as foolish as the poor country girl your brother has locked up in pall mall   peg i am frightened out of my wits tries to pass by him   spark not a step farther shall you go till you give me an account of your behavior and make me reparation for being ridiculous what dumb still  then if you will not by fair means i must squeeze you to a confession as he goes to seize her she slips by him  but he catches hold of her before she reaches belvilles door not quite so fast if you please  come come  let me see your modest face and hear your soft tongue  or i shall be tempted to use you ill   enter moody moody hands off you ruffian
