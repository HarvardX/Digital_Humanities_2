humanity  price five shillings  humanity or the rights of nature a poem in two books by the author of sympathy  london printed for t cadell strand        preface the reader is requested to consider this performance as a general outline with here and there some sketched features of a work the nature of which is frequently alluded to in different parts of the poem and the title is specified on a separate leaf at the end  what i ventured abroad some years since under the title of sympathy  a poem which on account of the interests created in the heart by the subject itself was received by the public with so much generous warmth  was intended to serve as a preliminary to what i had farther to observe on society or a prospect of the human race under the combined influences of clime and government religions laws and liberties  from these the transition to tyranny was natural and strongly in connection and from tyranny i felt myself called upon by all the awakened emotions of humanity to consider slavery but not only that species of it which consists in buying and selling our fellow creatures in africa  but every other kind in every other place views therefore of freedom and bondage throughout the different parts of the globe have been taken as well from experience as the best historical evidence  in the order of my poem on society perhaps the part which relates to the inhuman treatment of negroes for the treatment appears to me more criminal than the traffic might not have taken the lead not from any idea that these unhappy beings are less entitled to the rights of nature or the regulations of society then any other parts of the human species but because according to the series i meant to observe the prospect of the quarter of the globe where this trade principally subsists would have been out of time and place this objection being done away by the emulative benevolence which is now excited in the empire on this subject it affords me the greatest pleasure that by an anticipation of so much of what i had to remark on africa as is confined to the slave trade which however by no means exhausts what remains yet to be said in that division of my future work i have a fair opportunity and at a seasonable moment to enforce the appeals of those who have the strongest claims on humanity in a performance devoted to its general interests  how far the entire abolition so warmly contended for by the supporters of this measure may be consistent with human policy it is not my purpose particularly to enquire it is not the name of slave in itself which produces the great mischief an hired servant in euope may be as little at his own command and destined to as hard labor as a purchased negro in africa but the essential difference consists in the one being guarded by the laws of the land which spread before his person and his property a shield that defends him from every abuse of power and the other is left naked and defenceles to the insolence of office  humanity requires that the rights of nature should be enjoyed by every human being it is therefore against the shocking barbarity i am glad however to have it in my power to observe that we have not suffered the humanity of the french and other nations to surpass our own at least in one of our islands a the following authentic extract from the jamaica councils will attest dated november  0th       this day the house of assembly went into a committee on the consolidated slave bill and continued sitting upwards of three hours we understand that by this bill the whole system of the law respecting negroes is entirely changed a council of protection is established in each parish and many humane provisions are introduced for rendering their condition easy and happy it is also made felony without benefit of clergy to murder a slave a clause which to the great honor of the house passed without a single dissenting voice   the unquestionable cruelty and the too wellattested horror growing out of these that i contend  an abolition of these enormities is absolutely necessary for the rest whether the commerce flourishes or falls is a matter of no moment to the philanthropist without engaging in the heats of political controversy without attending to the pleas of interest on the one side or the sallies of enthusiastic zeal though generous in its excesses on the other it is sufficient to him that the happiness of the species in general is made independent on the tyranny of particular individuals  that the laws of subordination in the different classes of society should not violate the laws of humanity  and that so much of liberty should be allowed to every man a to feel a consciousness of his being a link in the great chain of the community and that till by some act of his own it is necessary for the good of the whole that he should be considered as an outcast of society he is by the rights of nature and of reason entitled to protection from insult misery and death  so far as the wealth can be reconciled to the happiness of nations and the establishments of civil society to the rights of nature every lover of his country must subscribe at the fame time as the wealth of worlds cannot justify the least wanton infraction of the laws of humanity whoever vainly attempts to support an argument for the one at the expense of the other erects a building which has its foundation in the sands and which must tumble into ruins at the slightest touch of reason and of truth  under this plain conviction i have felt and written and shall continue to feel and write upon liberty and slavery humanity and nature and i now submit my sentiments to the candid consideration of the public without any undue considence of success or unmanly dread of miscarriage  i have not thrust upon the world what i wish it to honor with notice without the previous approbation of some great and good minds but very contrary to the case with which in earlier life i used to reconcile myself to hasty publication were i not now to go to press till i was satisfied with my own performance those whose partiality disposes them to praise would blame me for unreasonable delay and those who are more prone to censure would no more be indebted to me for furnishing them with subject for the exercise of their favorite talent on every great and national occasion however our country has a claim on the best services we have to offer and wherever they fall short of our wishes or even of our own conceptions the proverbial apology that the intention sanctifies the deed ought to operate in our favor should the deed in any measure do justice to the intentions in the present instance applause will not be withheld but it will only serve to animate my future exertions to prove more deserving of it  for the eratta see last page  humanity book i from vernal blooms and many a fragrant bower the redning blossom and unfolding flower from breezy mountains and the covert vale the gliding water and the whispering gale from gayer scenes where careless fancy strayed baskd in the sun or frolickd in the shade ambitious grown and touched by generous praise now turns the muse to more adventurous lays no more she paints the tints of blushing morn nor hangs the dewdrop on the trembling thorn no more the brook runs murmuring in her line no more fair spring her florid verse is thine farewell a long farewell to founts and flowers far loftier themes demand her thoughtful powers wherever sublime society expands by art or nature formed thy potent bands through realms of heat where faints the expiring breeze or piercing climes where the sun seems to freeze in darksome caverns on tremendous steeps the embowring forest or the billowy deeps where

compassions shrine her opening lay humanity be thine for thou her guardian patroness and guide she owns with rapture and obeys with pride thee she invokes oh soother of distress who with our kindness wove our happiness for as thy circling virtues round us move from their best deeds thy brightest joys we prove often as our neighbor sinks in sudden grief thou wakst as sudden to afford relief often as the strangers bosom heaves with sighs the soft responses in our bosoms rise the cries of terror and the throes of care the groan of misery and distractions glare sickness that droops disease that gasps for breath the howl of madness and the shrieks of death deep sounds of agony that most affright dread views of horror that most blast the sight dire as they are like wondrous magnets draw and own humanity thy sacred law and oh it is thine when vital breath seems fled to seek the awful confines of the dead drag the pale victim from the whelming wave and snatch the body from the floating grave beneath the billow though entombed it lies thy dauntless zeal the roaring main defies inspired by him whose hallowed touch restored the darling babe the widows soul deplored her matron bosom eased of dire alarms and gave the child to her despairing arms it is thine to plunge into the bloating flood clasp the swoln frame and thaw the frozen blood breathe in the lips reanimating fire till warmed to second life the drowned respire hark as those lips once more begin to move what sounds ascend of gratitude and love now with the great redeemers praise they glow then bless the promoters of

fairer than paradise the wreaths they bring the blissful homage rescued friends impart the enraptured incense of a parents heart oerawd and wondering at themselves they see and feel the power of soft humanity when sovereign reason from her throne is hurled and with her all the subject senses whirled from sweet humanity the nurse of grief even thy deep woes o phrenzy find relief for though the tresses loose and bosom bare and maniac glance thy hapless state declare with gentle hand she still supports thy head beguiles thy wandering wit and smoothes thy bed assists thy roving fancy in its flight to crown thy airy sallies with delight an healing balm to thy warped sense she brings till from her softness magic comfort springs and joys which reason with a frown denies her tender pity with a smile supplies even in thy prisonhouse she bids thee draw from the rush scepter and the crown of straw the mimic truncheon and the loveknot true full many a transport reason never knew and at thy grated cell she often appears she culls thee flowers and bathes them with her tears the perfumed violet and the blooming rose on thy hurt mind a transient bliss bestows into a thousand shapes the garlands change as fairy fancy takes its antic range then as thy brows the fragrant wreaths adorn the roses seem to bloom without a thorn yet not to woes confined for pleasures song the reckless frolics of the village throng even as we pass them by in distant lands thou make our own and often we join the bands the sudden sounds of happiness we hail and swell the chorus echoing in the gale gladly we pause then blythe pursue our way while brighter sunshine seems to gild the day for from the jovial groupe as we depart thy richer sunshine beams upon the heart thus bliss is doubled and thus pain can warm from thee humanity both boast a charm we cheer are cheered now grant and now receive and need in turn the comfort which we give thus thy fair streams spread plenty where they run yet bless the fountains whence those streams begun like the rich nile thy sources never are dry although a thousand channels they supply but thou from whom these bosomed comforts flow humanity thou friend

beauty sheds her fairest blooms and lovliest feature loveliest grace assumes darts strongest magic from the potent eye breaks in the blush and shoots along the sigh where every scene is prodigal of

breath thy godlike spirit in my lyre for all accustomed as thou art to see the direst scenes of human misery to go where nature scourges with disease  the lines with inverted commas are from the triumph of benevolence written by the author of this poem in honor of howard and spotted deaths load every tainted breeze where even the strong antipathies assail haunts of the filthfed toad and slimy snail the noxious caverns and abhorrent caves where wretches pace alive around their graves while hollow echoes ring their endless knells through deepscoopd vaults and slowconsuming cells never did thy eyes such marks of horror trace as hourly agonize the negro race prove then the prisoner and the mourners friend and once again thy virtuous influence lend so raptured notes as if by angles given

joy to cries of blood succed howards unnumberd shall the truth embrace and feel akin to all the human race again shall avarice suspend his art and feel again subdued his rugged heart his bosom loosened from the sullen ore the rock shall gush in blessings to the poor would thou the map of slavery survey and the dire circuit of the trade display dart thy astonished eye over distant lands from senegal to gambias burning sands pursue the blushing lines to congos shore then traverse many a league benguela over career immense over which the merchant reigns and drags reluctant millions in his chains commerce thou sailest on a sanguine flood on a red sea of mans devoted blood thy pompous robe though gemmd as indias store proud though it flows is died in human gore the tears of millions bathe thy fatal cane and half thy treasure springs from human pain and not an idol on thy altars shine but human victims stain the crimson shrine and thou o interest dark insidious power whose sanctiond arts waste nations in an hour whose mining frauds more fatal still destroy hopes tender blossom and the fruits of joy thou to whom all the coward slights belong thy heart too cruel for a generous wrong for fierce revenge that fever of the soul hate that defies and love that spurns control or madning jealousy when reason bends or zeal extravagant to liberal ends thou who for noble faults like these too cold whose vices never aspire but stoop to gold that grovelling passion of the sordid breast like aarons serpent swallowing up the rest theft rapine plunder fraud and murder stand fell ministers to wait thy dire command yes thou the founder of this impious trade made him a slave that nature never made tore the poor indian from his native soil and chained him down to neverending toil ah luscious mischief slavecreating cane of every soft humanity the bane thy venomed sweet whose soulpolluting art like some masked poison eats into the heart sweet though thou art an aspic sting is thine and into shambles christians turn thy shrine thou like vile gold from the emboweld earth by avarice dragged reluctantly to birth to taste thy charm are groaning nations bound and half mankind in kindred blood are drowned say muse from whence the unnatural mart began the sordid merchandise and sale of man from egypt first the ethiop traffic came but dawned so mild that slavery was not shame while nature yet preserved some generous right the yoke was easy and the burden light and here the patriarch law each wrong restrained and eye for eye and tooth for tooth ordained soon over the aegean waves the trade was brought traveled to greece till rome the infection caught yet temperate still no tyranny arose till baneful luxury marshalled all her woes conquerors their captives with a smile received and whom the brave embraced they never deceived the battle over they bade contention cease and foes in war were humble friends in peace the pledge was solemn and the vow sincere the union sacred and the compact dear but oh fair athens when the commerce drew to thy loved shore the bonds yet gentler grew the slave could boast a guardian in thy laws and summon justice to support his cause even to thy holy altars might repair assert his claims and find them honored there in rosy fetters were thy prisoners bound and in captivity with freedom crowned wisdom in peace or valor in the war the faithful counsel or the glorious scar attachment proved and servitude sustained with manly zeal their liberty regained with his own hand the master loosed the yoke but the slave scarce perceived the bonds were broke so soft the texture he never felt their weight nor changed his master though he changed his state captive no more he still pursued his toil and grateful vowed allegiance to the soil yes classic athens nurse of generous arts thine was the throb humanity imparts to freemen rose thy slaves and then aspired to all thy sons to all thy state required even to athenian loyalty they grew till scarce thy citizens a difference knew while shameless sparta butchered half her slaves convulsive shook and dug untimely graves despised abhorred and dreaded was their sway to all a tyrants guilt and fears a prey thou too lost rome how galling was thy chain in those dire times when mercy sud in vain when cut to atoms was the debtors heart that each hard creditor might claim his part and oh degraded greece how fallen thy state once like thy splendid rival wise and great nor less her rival in thy vices found both soaring now now sinking to the ground how dimmed thy orb when sages could ordain the sanguine whip and vindicate the chain when thy grave plutarch wise discreet and brave stern in philosophy could stab his slave and thy demosthenes in thunders urge the sovereign virtues of the mangling scourge o blind to think where smiles and kindness fail to touch the soul that frowns and stripes prevail hail tender adrian first on romes record who drew distinct the line twixt slave and lord who with sweet mercy tempered awful power while pitys angel hailed the auspicious hour thou christian emperor in whose generous breast the light of pure devotion shone impressed that sacred light descending from above an emanation of celestial love with speed of lightning spread the lambent ray till realms of darkness kindled into day from god himself the spark etherial came and man adored the soulilluming flame thou too just constantine with gentle sway bade all be free and all that god obey the fire from heaven a general luster shed and the foul mists of superstition fled fair faith was crowned her banner was displayed sunk was the crosier and the cross prevailed but ah once more to stain the bloody shrine and sell mankind o portugal was thine to thee illfated afric owes her pain the scourge fresh pointed and the new forged chain thine the base arts the sons of gold applaud the smile deceptive and the snare of fraud the extended hand that chases fear away the embrace that wins affection to betray the league of peace in policy devised the compact broken and the oath despised to lure the heart all smooth seductions tried and the heart gained disguises thrown aside the plot avowed the promise boldly broke by the harsh driver and the galling yoke accursed gonzales taught thee first the art to six this stigma on his countrys heart the dire example spread with barbarous rage thrift was the vice and spared nor sex nor age at length the traffic into system came the infection flew till britain caught the flame detested hawkins armed his pirate host and wolfelike prowld on guineas fated coast force bribry stratagem were all employed o shame till twice ten millions were destroyed the work of christians this whose lawless rage taught milder savages foul wars to wage christians taught savages new modes of strife and burst asunder all the ties of life christians taught savages to worship gold till for their idol sons and sires were sold till sleeping tribes at midnights hour were caught and seized as prey to public market brought till from the breast the babe was stolen away and children kidnappd in the face of day next tawny spain the shameful trade pursued theft grew familiar tyranny ensued the tawny slave on his oppressor poured and mad with smart his haughty lord devoured insidious spain still vanity thy guide thou mixture loathed of penury and pride slothful in dignity supine in state active alone in cruelty and hate commerce like this might well command thy zeal o patron of the agonizing wheel from where wild biscay throws its foam around and aids the deafning tempests frantic sound even to the steeps where pyrenees ascend and like a rocky chain their links extend the nations shuddered as it sprang to birth and throes unwonted shook the laboring earth thou torquemada thy assistance gave to fix this engine which the thoughts enslave sedately savage thou could calm behold men scattered piecemeal though thy rage was cold quaffd the warm blood enforced the torturing power and viewed with horrid joy the flames devour schooled in thy climes demoniac arts could bear to see the cord inflict the pincers tear arrayed thy victims in the rich attire and danced like satan round thy feast of fire ah well might slavery thrive in such a hand for all are slaves in a despotic land precarious life is passed in trembling awe and the proud tyrant owns the breath they draw power like a miser spreads the greedy hand still stepping onward never at a stand a subtle miner working still his way in avarice of accumulating sway tools would be statesmen statesmen would be kings and they would mount upon the angels wings power first advances with a modest air but born a tyrant quickly learns to dare by due degrees he throws each barrier down thinks strength is right and calls the world his own at length grown absolute assumes the god and proves at once a pestilence and rod till grown incautious some rash point he tries and in the ruin of his project lies behold where fated florida extends his bloodtrackd course the fell velasquez bends launches his guilty bark upon the waves to kidnap freeborn men and make them slaves see as he gains the chaindevoted land the sable natives hurry to the strand his sailing castle on the waves they view and gazed with wonder as it near them drew but on the deck when human forms appeared and peaceful signals smiled no more they feared twas man they trusted man who spoke them fair cajoled their faith and lured them to the snare and now as guests they land as guests are led through palmy groves to every indian shed the spaniards there their glittering stores unfold the shining mirror and the toy of gold each gaudy bauble cheats the indians eyes and tricks his passions into fond surprise teaches new luxuries and wants unknown till europes vice and folly is his own the useless ornaments his senses fire and each fresh gewgaw kindles fresh desire fair in the glass another self he sees till harmless wonder swells to vanities from lures like these the baneful passions grow and what began in pleasure ends in woe frauds heaped on frauds to purchase these were taught and every trinket was with bloodshed bought but soon as guests in turn the indian bands condemned alas to quit their native lands no fraud suspecting mount the treacherous ship where as in ambush lie the chains and whip like nested snakes whose poisons are enrolled midst wreaths of flowers in many a shining fold the faithless spaniard leaves the plundered shore his fraud succeeds and freedom is no more then over the affrighted waves is heard the yell of mingled thousands in their watery hell shut from the light unknowing yet their doom the vessel proves a prison and a tomb in the dark caverns of the bark they lie live to fresh horrors or in bondage die while the base tyrant glorying in his snare mocks at the loud rebuke and dumb despair soon as the vessel bore the tribes away what horrors seized upon the trembling prey ah hear the shrieks of kindred left behind roll to the wave and gather in the wind matrons with orphans sons with sires appear but vain affections shriek and natures tear the spainsh pirate ploughs the watry plains and plants his cannon at the thin remains the flaming balls the wailing natives reach and added slaughter stains the crimson beach all all is lost but with a generous pride even slaves spurn life when freedom is denied free still be free loud echoes to the sky dare not to live in bondage dare to die but oh ye christian savages declare on what unknown prerogative ye dare peaceful and blessed where rich bananas grew and nature freshend as the seabreeze blew where harvests smiled without the aid of toil and verdure gladdend the exuberant soil where summer held so bountiful a sway scarce claimed their year the culture of a day the plants at twilight trusted to the earth the following morn sprang blooming into birth graced with the bow the indians harmless ran and undisturbed enjoyed the rights of man the rights of man by nature still are due to men of every clime and every hue their arrows sought the monsters of the wood the chase at once their pastime and their food bowerd by the umbrageous vine they thought no wrong now wreathed the dance and carold now the song and often some sable mistress of the soul prepared the banquet and partook the bowl shared every bliss that genuine nature gave and often owned the vanquished heart a slave the willing captive wore fair beautys chain and pleased submitted to the tender pain if giant power confers this wanton sway subdues the strong and makes the weak obey does power give right beware that dangerous plea perchance its tendency thou do not see the slave once stronger than thyself shall stand and seize intripid on thy stern command armed with thy iron scepter bid thee toil scar thy white skin and chain thee to the soil thy spirit fainting in the glare of day shall bid thee naked brave the torrid ray retort thy scorn retaliate all thy rage wear out thy youth and murder thee in age tear from thy fettered arms thy child and wife and blast the budding promises of life repay in turn each stroke thy baseness gave and make thee feel what it is to be a slave ah false as fatal to the weak and strong thinherent rights of nature still belong no partial principles the just impel to thinking wisely or to acting well for liberty of all mankind the cause becomes a forfeit only to the laws those sacred compacts which like links sustain connecting parts of the great social chain and while with these no member is at strife as full the right to liberty as life alike the boon of heaven and never ends from sire to son from son to sire descends avaunt assertors of superior right and vain distinctions betwixt black and white firm and immovable on natures base stands the grand charter of the human race for he who gave us life bade life be free and to enhance his gift sent liberty then whence this wondrous difference in our race come crested pride and the distinction trace lo from the equator to the northern pole though colors change unchangeable the soul if justly bought the man of deepest die by equal laws the next in shade we buy so softening on till scarce a tint between the haughty lord and humble slave is seen springs the vain boast from thy superior white vain prepossession of thy partial sight beware fallacious reasner lest the north his whiter rival sends indignant forth ah rather blushing hide thy snowy skin for know thy slave paints white the sire of sin and darker than himself he draws the power which as his sovereign good his race adore thy cruelty has taught him to despise like hell thy hue his own like heaven to prize nature and habit human kind control the needle one and one the attractive pole and what in europe we a grace may call is found in africa no grace at all and what abhorred deformity we name in many a climate dignifies with fame survey the various globe from shore to shore weigh manners customs and be proud no more thou who would fix her to the palest face see how for these even beauty shifts her place all all to nature or opinion bow or fond caprices which from habit flow here beauty proudly boasts the lengthening head there on the shoulders bids it broadly spread here smalest gems must grace the fair ones ear and there the pendents large as logs appear here see her ask the locks of snowy white yet beg the charm of teeth more dark than night here must the broadend eyebrow shade the face there softly curvd must crescent archings grace while here those crescent archings must depart stubbd from the root for painted brows of art here beauty loves the cheek supremely fair there boasts the gash and cherishes the scar in britain rose and lilly must unite while damians isthmus claims the milky white the beard must here even to the girdle flow there not a bristle must presume to grow here the swollen body there the slender waist this wrapped in silk and that in dogskin graced here beauty triumphs in her wooly hair but waves in wreaths her auburn tresses there to grace the dames of europe fair they flow long and profuse upon a neck of snow in every curl a cupid seems to lie to aid the conquests of the sparkling eye the thickest lip here beauty makes her care more softly swelled like dewy rosebuds there the dazzling white is in this clime admired in that the glossy black is more desired feel humbly then nor deem all grace thy own nor think that nature charms in thee alone the poorest native of the poorest coast has still his beauty still his good to boast from earths beginning to its utmost ends proportioned charm proportioned bliss she sends exact division but adapted still to what in different climes her children feel to what when undebauchd by mans desires or fancied wants necessity requires nor sparing nor yet prodigal her plan with poised equality she blesses man on the worst soil some heartfelt joy bestows which the glad son she there has stationd knows and what from us extorts the taunting sneer may to his sense an happiness appear as the fond gifts which we indulgent deem to him an aggravated curse may seem thus kind is nature in her zone serene but not more kind than in her torrid scene not less a parent where the frozen power resides for centuries in his icy tower where the hoar monarch in his vest of snow ascends the hills where suns refuse to glow vain all dispute of color form or size in pride in reasoning pride our error lies pope in pride in pride alone the difference lies whence then presumptous man proceeds thy right and by what law does olive yield to white why has not brown black copper equal claim their nature origin and end the same all of one species all of equal birth though shifting colors like their parent earth if not in color then perchance in sense in the souls power may lie the proud pretense ah no from natures hand all equal came through every clime an helpless babes the same the same frail emblem of our state appears a weak and helpless being born in tears if cultured climes refine on natures plan they change the mode but never change the man the human passions strongly are impressed in the untutored as the polished breast in the swarth african that is bought and sold as the fair plunderer that steals his gold heaven formed his eyes to love his native hue and pointed all his appetites as true those sable tints at which with fear we start are the loved colors that attract his heart our polished arts refinement may bestow but often enfeeble natures genuine glow in polished arts unnumberd virtues lie but ah unnumberd vices they supply here if they bloom with every gentler good there are they steeped with more than savage blood here with refinement if sweet pity stands there luxury round them musters all her bands it is not enough that daily slaughter feeds that the fish leaves its stream the lamb its meads that the reluctant ox is dragged along and the bird ravished from its tender song that in reward of all her music given the lark is murdered as she soars to heaven it is not enough our appetites require that on their altars hecatombs expire but cruel man a savage in his power must heap fresh horrors on lifes parting hour full many a being that bestows its breath must prove the pang that waits a lingering death here close pent up must gorge unwholesome food there render drop by drop the smoking blood the quivering flesh improves as slow it dies and luxry sees the augmented whiteness rise some creatures gashd must feel the torturers art writhe in their wounds though saved each vital part from the hard bruise the food more tender grows and callous luxry triumphs in the blows some yet alive to raging flames consigned by piercing shrieks must sooth our taste refined o power of mercy that suspends the rod o shame to man impiety to god thou polished christian in the untutored see the sacred rights of sweet humanity thine is the world thy crimson spoils enjoy but let no wanton arts thy soul employ live though thou do on blood ah still refrain to load thy victims with superfluous pain even the gaunt tiger though no life he saves in generous haste devours what famine craves the bestial paw may check thy human hands and teach dispatch to what thy want demands abridge thy sacrifice and bid thy knife for hunger kill but never sport with life relief appears as the muse shifts her place to where pure manners bless the gentlest race lo where the bramins pass their blameless life free from proud culture free from polished strife to man brute insect natures constant friends the heart embraces and the hands extends see the meek tribe refuse the worm to kill no murder feeds them and no blood they spill but crop the living herbage as it grows and quaff the living water as it flows from the full herds the milky banquet bear and the kind herds repay with pastures fair from sanguine man they drive the game away from sanguine man they save the sinny prey the copious grain they scatter over the mead the bird to nourish and the beast to feed the flowers their couch their roof the arching trees and peaceful nights succeed to days of ease o thou proud christian aid fair natures grace and catch compassion from the bramin race their kind extremes and vegetable fare their tender maxims all that breathe to spare suit not thy cultured state but all should know like them to save unnecessary woe like them to give each generous feeling birth and prove the friends not tyrants of the earth o sweet humanity might pity sway all all like bramins would thy voice obey for ah to heighten joy and solace woe all need alas thy tender aid below one leans on all for help not all on one what worm so feeble as proud man alone the veriest giant by himself is found frail as the reed that every breeze can wound but even the pigmy with associates joined strong as the oak can brave the rudest wind the social passion opens with our breath pursues through life and follows us to death see as yon infant lulled in slumber lies how the fond mother to its cradle flies soft on her faithful breast reclines its head her faithful breast its banquet and its bed though many a suffering for its sake she bore they all but serve to make her love it more for soon a kindred passion equal burns the parents tenderness the child returns runs by her side or struggles to her knee and owns the touch of fair humanity the child arrived at man the parent lies sickening at life in haste her offspring flies explores the chamber though disease be there and hangs with catching deaths the putrid air and when at length the mother yields to fate stretched round her breathless form the affections wait in mute distress and with uplifted hands the child she cradled at her coffin stands invokes her spirit to assuage the woe and teach meek patience to endure the blow blesses the holy shade which gave him birth moves to the grave and views the opening earth a filial shudder through his frame he proves as the dust falls upon the dust he loves then as the time steals on with thieflike power and brings to him the allsubduing hour himself ere this a parent soon shall prove the softening offices of filial love for those who owe him life

such hard control in lifes fresh morn if chance they dare to shoot the bud scarce peeps ever power destroys the root nothing can prosper in a slavish soil save stinted shrubs unworthy of the toil like

while with glad heart the briton sees it rise uninjurd there for ages shall it stand nor ever quit it but to guard the land then on the deep in gallant pomp it moves to serve that freedom which its country loves oh ever sail fair bark upon thy waves still guard thy england from a realm of slaves oh ever flow fair sea to guide our coast still to divide us from yon abject host and swell ye cliffs that canopy our strand to frown indignant on that servile land that land of mutes of one proud lord the prey a clime where to be dumb is to obey unheard unseen where wretches meet their dooms for whom no tear must ever bathe their tombs concealed the parents pangs the lovers sighs bastiles for ever frown before their eyes like those they mourn down precipices thrown are all that dare the ties of nature own buried alive from youth to age they lie and even at last in agonies they die oh hailed by men and angels be the hour which clipped even britons wing outstretchd for power which taught the monarch where his rights should end and to what point the subjects should extend bade the encroacher know his proper sphere or for each wrong the meanest subject fear once kings controlled the law in infant times plundered at will nor answered for their crimes our juster system snaps the tyrants chains curbs his proud nature and his rage restrains mark by what gradual steps britannia rose as the small acorn to a forest grows by what variety of adverse fate terrors of war and anarchies of state what direful griefs by foreign fury bred rivers of blood and mountains of the dead she past adventurous ere her wrongs were over complete her triumphs and confirmed her power when but to look was treason to the state and the kings nod like thundering joves was fate not now as in our scribbling jamess days plain truth is tortured in the statesmans maze then twas that thus the royal nonsense run our word is law who murmurs is undone behold the painted natives of the isle rough as the coast unculturd as the soil halfnaked and halfcoverd see them go for sport or war accouterd with the bow the plumy helmet nodding on the head and the loose skin across the shoulders spread a rude society without a plan above the brute yet scarce arrived at man but even here was felt the patriot flame and from these sparks our noontide radiance came to guard the huts that stretch along the strand armed with the scythe and wicker shield they stand the chariot mount or leap upon the ground and shout victorious to the trumpets sound chains wounds and death the hardy chiefs defy for britain conquer or for britain die the brave caractacus his squadrons brought and with inferior force undaunted fought though rude the race and savage though the scene freedom called forth icenis warlike queen a martial band great boadicia led and even a woman for her country bled revenge and liberty inspired the fair and poison saved her in the last despair this from ignoble bondage set her free and all the shame of roman slavery thus in the earliest hour of britains morn a britons haste of tyrrany was born abhorrence sacred to repel the hand that dares to wrong the charter of the land our sturdy ancestors though often subdued but breathed from war and strait the charge renewed now dressed as victims now as prisoners bound the blood of heroes deluging the ground in each extreme our brave forefathers prove their native courage and their countrys love fierce for hereditary claims they fight and even till death maintains a britons right hence rose our liberties a common cause to these succeed their best support the laws bonds conflicts murders massacres ensued and many a saxon danish sword embrued in english blood and many a monarchs life and many a monks submitted to the strife

ignorance resind away like mists dispersing at the dawn of day the sword hung up the trumpet heard no more the lyre essayed its humanizing power religion came with meekness to explode the heathen idol and the saxon god in place of deities with frowns portrayed mild christianity in smiles arrayed where stood the claybuilt hut see cities rise where altars blazed with human sacrifice where pagan superstition horror spread and even where piety misguided led in later times her victims to the flame in bloody memory of our marys name now see our country share an happier fate discreetly strong and equitably great her power supreme and yet her reason clear in skilful balance holding hope and fear her force lawgovernd knows its proper fence distinct from tyrrany and impotence not fierce to punish

multitude they spread dead the fierce war thy enmity was dead now bloomed the arts of peace the powers of trade and towering cities towering fleets were made neglected science reared again her head

lay once more o muse to gallia bend thy way explore yon cavern frowning on the sight when one faint lamp sends forth a sickly light through folds of darkness where yon wicket glooms perfidious power has scoopd the living tombs along the filth that oozes from the walls the slimy snail with track abhorent crawls and often augmenting poisons from the top with sullen sound falls slow the withering drop the pestilential toad that squats below gathers fresh venom as those poisons flow here many a fathom down despotic rage hung human victims in the dreadful cage here the poor captive torn from child and wife from youth to age groaned out detested life nor natures sun nor arts supplying blaze ere stole one beam of comfort on his days nor human form nor human hand was nigh to sooth the grief that gathered in his eye save one brief glance of man as through the hole his daily bread the silent jailer stole no human voice beguiled the endless night that cruel shut him from creations light to sooth a mistress wanton louis gave to one who dared be just this lingering grave to one who dare a prostitute pourtray and bring his honest satire into day how sinks the heart to pace this gloomy round how pants the muse to leave this tyrant ground but ere she turn to afric let her fly where slavery blooms beneath the fairest sky thee desolated asia once the blessed in every charm of lavish nature dressed where favored paradise heavnplanted stood a scene of wonders rising from the flood the holy spot by all the prophets trod seat of the saints and sojourn of the god where faith her christian temples reared around and blood of martyrs sanctified the ground where even redemption like a cherub came and revelation spread the enlightning flame but oh thou land of heaven itself beloved what dire events what changes have thou proved how has time altered every charm of youth since first thou heardst the oracles of truth forgot the heavenly claims that once were thine forgot the precepts breathed from lips divine vain all the fathers all a savior taught and god expelled for what the imposter brought a sensual creed by a mock prophet praised the sacred bible sunk the koran raised disgraced the truths which all the apostles gave thy prince a tyrant and thyself a slave ah what avails thy medicinal floods thy citron breezes and thy palmy woods what though the cassia breathes along thy shore and trickling manner adds its essencd store though gums balsamic in thy valleys grow and both the indias in thy region glow thine though olympus dear from classic fame and honored hermon a more holy name though the tall cedar decks thy fragrant shrine and lofty lebanon himself be thine from fair euphrates even to jordans wave though thy rich coast the hallowed waters lave and though thy fruits voluptuously dispense a keener relish to the invited sense though on thy flowers a bolder bloom prevail and send more piercing odor to the gale and though thy skies yet salient and serene call fair hygea to the tempting scene all all these blessings a strong balance find in one broad curse that seizes on thy kind nor this the pest that often has thinnd thy plains a plague more fatal in thy tyrant reigns fierce through the east see despotism run more fell more fatal than the torrid sun frantic before him move a sanguine band the ruthless agents of his murderous hand skulking behind in dumb allegiance wait nursed up in blood his various tools of fate to torture life and hideous deaths devise in varied shapes of cruelty they rise dey sultan signior emperor and king chief vizier cailif each inferior thing some do his bidding in the noon of day and some at midnight seize upon their prey submission terror chastisement combine to sink the abject vassal to the swine reason below degraded instinct falls and man is bound like herds within the stalls his spirit dies subdued by hard control the useless body moves without a soul no spark of heavenly fire the mass can warm nor public virtue touch nor private charm but general cowardice by horror bred courage unstrung and manly honor dead for oh the dart the gibbet and the wheel are the least terrors that a slave can feel of these the anguish scarce can rage its hour ere death appears in soft relief of power death a kind refuge in the last despair but long a life of slavery who can bear lo persias tyrant with unnatural strife to please a minion robs a child of life with savage rage can blind the firstborn son and partial lift a second to the throne when the proud sopha has consigned to death it is treason but to beg a parents breath the sentence past the look that aims to save condemns to equal fate the pitying slave sensual religion aids the tyrants will and blood for ever reeks along the steel in dire suspense like damocless sword by a slight thread hangs life  a tyrants word imposts and edict vex the groaning land and even the fountain flows but at command in dread mogul the laws must all be bought ere the case opens must a gift be brought the greedy emperor opes his craving hand and justice driven by avarice quits the land nay yet more brief the turkish powers decide for there the judge condemns the accused untried there turns the suit as wills the proud bashaw who holds the place of destiny and law this god of earth and brother of the sun breaks up the court before the case be known or strikes the head from some officious slave who at the bloody verdict dares be grave yet here the tyrants self is insecure for no succession to the crown is sure a race of strangled kindred pave the way and often the sceptered slave is made a prey o hapless asia whilst such horror reigns what british muse will rest upon thy plains yet should she steer again to africs sand there too she sees oppression lifts his hand within the tropics fiercer than the blaze that fires the earth with iron rod he sways even from the fertile nile to nigers waves it is but a change of tyrants and of slaves o pride enormous impudence of man but let not britons imitate the plan frame no false systems and then call them wise or make distinctions where no difference lies alas full often the european face masks a mind darker than the darkest race the negros heart may be a purer shrine for thoughts devout o haughty white than thine acceptance find more gracious from its god than the proud master who uplifts the rod his prayer to holy kanno more prevail to the great spirit whispering in the gale his pious vows to quoja midst the trees or high bassefo walking in the breeze these may more virtue and more truth impart than christian incense from a savage heart and his wild tambour beat to idol shouts to heaven ascend before the organs notes say what the pomps of science or of prayer if the poor indians fervor glows not there in different forms though men the god adore shaped as the brute or painted as the flower as marble here and there as feathers seen there the birds bone and here the fishes fin each as it marks sincerity shall rise and welcome find in the recording skies shall more be cherished by the powers of heaven than less true worship where more aids are given than the mock homage of the enlightened train for whom a savior lived and died in vain a doctrine this too harsh for human pride resort to facts and be the doctrine tried with faithful hand culled from the historic page proofs throng to proofs might vanquish christian rage oh tyrant white forget awhile thy gold and every virtue in thy black behold all that is honored loved or prized in thee in thy scourged negro blushing shall thou see lo as the muse to anticosta steers midst the wild waves humanity appears escaped the wreck although their barks were lost whole crews were dashed upon a savage coast the coast though savage there the christians find each godlike feeling in an indian mind for touched by cries that pierced the piny wood the natives sought the margin of the flood then as the expiring christians caught their view to human grief the generous indians flew the social passion glowing in his face thus spoke a chieftain of the sable race haste children haste behold where brothers lie  rise strangers rise the hand of help is nigh men like ourselves throughout the globe command the sheltering bosom and the aiding hand all all are kinsimen of a different hue our faces vary but our hearts are true ye poor white wanderers on our bounty thrown your griefs are sacred and your wants our own this said he gently to his cottage led smiled on his guests and yielded up his bed then watched till morn a guardian at the door blessed and was blessed  could a christian more to trace each virtue through the sultry sands next negro honor all thy praise demands in cujoes generous soul it meets the view and darts a glory through his tawny hue a band of christian pirates sought the shore and many an indian from their forests bore one so to cujoes cot was seen to fly pierced by a dart he begged in peace to die but soon the tribes pursue demand their prey scalp scalp that wretch they cry in open day cujoe conceals the man whose blood is ours it is not our rage it is justice that devours mean time the exhausted christian gaspd for breath when cujoe rose and stopped the impending death my friends forbear the guilty seek and slay pursue the race that stole our tribes away may ocean whelm them in the deepest wave the guilty punish but the blameless save of guest and friend ah reverence the ties lo this sick christian on my faith relies here in the rights of friendship shall he rest my arm his buckler and his shield my breast this cot his citadel and ere he die here must your hatchets fall your arrows fly honor prevailed their passions died away and safe in cujoes hut the christian lay next let us speed to yonder sainted plains by mountains screend and crowned with dulcet canes where the mad ouragan in phrenzy roars affrights the isle and desolates the shores while many a rill and flowery vale between smile in the storm and reconcile the scene see there an hero of the negro line boasts an high feeling briton proud as thine the faithful quashi with his master bred the same their mansion and the same their bed together used in infant times to play their friendship strengthened in lifes riper day the slave was trusty and the lord was kind to quashis care the property assigned his labors closed he took the transient rest then chid the sun yet loitring in the east ere peeped the dawn his daily toils he sought and daily wealth to his loved lord he brought envy at length a poisoned arrow drew which winged with mischief to the master flew of dire neglect the accusation came and lo the sentence past for quashis shame a public punishment was now decreed and the next morn was quashi doomed to bleed the injured slave with shuddring horror heard and at deep midnight sought his barbarous lord then wrought to agony these words addressed the poignard trembling at his masters breast o thou whom no rememberance can move nor cradled tenderness nor boyish love dare not to think that quashis soul will bear the public insults which thy hands prepare think not the bloody morn these eyes shall view nor think for pardon that these lips shall sue no monster no my souls above my fate scorns thy proud mercy as it braves thy hate thus tyrant thus thy fury i defy live thou to shame while i in honor die he spoke  the poignard sluicd the crimson flood and bathed the master in the servants blood if thou would negro tenderness behold seek with the muse the coast where broods the gold a snelgrave briton there  immortal be his name by pitys angel marked with endless fame a briton there an indian infant found for savage rites by superstition bound the negro king amidst the crowd he sought and at the sacrifice the victim bought then to the ship his trembling charge conveyed while all the sable train with awe surveyed but scarce the babe was placed upon the deck than loud was heard a females piercing shriek it is he it is he it is the babe i bore whom savage acqua from this bosom tore ah come my own  resume thy couch of rest and cling once more to this maternal breast blessed be the hand by egho formed to save thrice blessed the hand that led me here a slave blessed be the author of these transports wild and blessed the hand which has restored my child she could no more but still the speaking eye owned the rich gift of sweet humanity but when she heard her infant had been bought even as the flame its tender limbs had caught o indian god oh godlike white she said while over her sable cheek the crimson spread all that a parent all a slave can give o godlike white o indian god receive kneeling she wept then kissed her rescued child while in her jetty arms the infant smiled dances and songs of praise now struck the waves and one strong charm like magic touched the slaves through the long voyage obedient they remain nor sounding whip was heard nor clanking chain touched is thy heart o merchant of thy kind does human softness steal into thy mind roused is the spark too long repressed by gold then bend thy heart to what we next unfold now while perchance the human passions move o view the force of friendship and of love in negro bosoms see those powers at strife which form the bliss and agony of life zebron and zabor of the jetty race were first in feature and proportioned grace bright as the antelope their radiant eyes as the proud palm tree towerd their equal size both wore alike the tygers speckled spoil brothers in dress in pastime and in toil slaves though they were even slavery had its charms for zebrons comfort was in zabors arms and zabor fainting on the arid sand was reared to joy by gentle zebrons hand by bliss united much by sorrow more a negros fate they softened while they bore but love at last a keener pang imparts for sable zelia triumphed over their hearts her skin of ebony bestowed a grace that far outshone an alabaster face so thought the youths with equal truth inspired with all their passion all their climate fired each scorned to ravish each refused to yield and love and friendship both maintained the field devouring torments spread the mutual flame but still their friendship still their love the same when beauteous zelia in their view appears zebron and zabor melt in mutul tears often both embracing to renounce her swear and friendship seems to link them in despair at length their conflicts big with every grief and every passion sought a dire relief at close of day as zelia traced the wood the lovers followed and before her stood the wandering maid too fatal in her charms now snatched to zebrons now to zabors arms the fondest vows that ever lovers swore the deepest groans that ever heaved they pour then with closed eyes and heads declined they dart the mutual daggers in her bounding heart speechless she fell her sobs their shrieks confound they clasp the victim and they kiss the wound then raise the poignards streaming in her blood and with their own augment the crimson flood thus negro virtues negro frailties shine say fairer savage do they yield to thine their ardent virtues emulate thy own their errors are the errors of their zone art thou then still supreme of human race still boasts thy nature the superior grace ah no without thy cultivating arts worth greatness goodness elevates their hearts the towering spirit in their bosoms move they hate with vigor as with force they love together leagued till death they faithful toil and smooth the wrong that chains them to the soil still hand in hand their direful loads they bear divide each joy and mitigate despair vivid as thine the sense of joy and pain thrills in each pulse and vibrates in each vein when hope inspires behold as bright a ray illumes their eyes and over their features play when grief assails the tears as copious flow to mark the soft or agonizing woe when the lash scourges or the pincers rend a shriek as piercing from the heart they send ere the brave spirit of the man is broke even with a britons scorn they spurn the yoke love of their native land that magic charm against an host has made an handful arm they love like thee the soil that gave them birth and treasure up each particle of earth fondly embosomd ere they leave the shore and kiss the sacred relic over and over muscians poets too by nature taught a song spontaneous bursting from a thought swift into measure subjects seem to fly as transient objects transient themes supply nature to harmony attunes the ear and her nice touches over their limbs appear each nerve extatic springs to the rebound and every motion seems to paint a sound the sweet enthusiasm every grief beguiles and the scourged captive even in anguish smiles with thrilling passion every feature glows so strong the charm it cheats awhile their woes their woes how countless  ah illfated race how shall i paint thy anguish and disgrace ah think not white the muse from fancy brings those woes which history sanctions what she sings her bloody annals still does truth unfold stained with the victims of soulspotting gold yet who the negros sufferings can relate or mark the varied horrors of their fate where blushing truth shall we their griefs begin or how commence the catalogue of sin demons of torture ye who mock at woe and smile to see the crimson bloodtrack flow in horrid triumph rise from central hell the inventive pangs of christian growth to tell oh aid the shuddering muse to paint the grief which calls on death for pity and relief oh powers of mercy loose that massy yoke oh hold that arm for murders in the stroke behold that axe the quivering limb assails behold that body weltering in its wails ah hear that bludgeon fall that lash resound ah see those wretches writhing on the ground see yonder mangled mass of atoms lie behold that christians hands the flames apply at the bare feet is laid the sulphurous train climbs to the heart and burns into the brain survey the triple horrors of their state doomed in each change to be the sport of fate torn from their native land at first they come and then are thrown into the sailing tomb in watery dens like coupled beasts they lie and beg the mournful privilege to die than man more kind but death often brings relief releases one while one survives to grief the living wretch his dead associate sees the body clasps and drinks the putrid breeze chained to the noxious corpse till rudely thrown in the vexed sea then left a slave alone ah wretch forlorn thy lot the most severe assassination would be mercy here methinks i hear thee cry ah give me death give the last blow and stop this hated breath to arm this hand were holy innocence i call on suicide as self defense oh for a sword to waft me to the shore where never christian white may torture more curse curse me not with being instant throw this loathsome body to the waves below his prayer denied condemned midst slaves to groan the cruel merchant marks him for his own the scar by christian cruelty impressed smoaks on his arm or blackens on his breast the wattled oziers form his rugged bed and daily anguish earns his daily bread short food and shorter rest and endless toil above the scourge below the burning soil soon with his sable brothers must he go doomed to a sad variety of woe like harnessed mules over africs dreadful sand in slow progression moves the mournful band the lengthening files begin their circuit wide while on their limbs are galling braces tied fraught with coarse viands see the straining throng drag the oppressive caravan along the massy iron and the direful log their naked bodies even in slumber clog an iron collar over each neck is past and iron rivets hold the collar fast a tightend chain across each shoulder goes while the dark driver takes his own repose at length arrived the miserable band like the stalld oxen pass from hand to hand ye friends of man whose souls with mercy glow swell not your bosoms with this weight of woe fires not the social blood within your veins to make the white man feel the negros pains beat not your hearts the miscreant arms to bind of the proud christian with a savage mind do thou not pant to snap the impious chain and rush to succor the insulted train from servile bondage to free the hapless race and fix the haughty tyrants in their place make them the weight of slavery to know till their hard natures melt at social woe nor till they humanize to social men would ye restore them to their rights again but heaven is just each tyrant in his turn is taught the rashness of his pride to mourn often spreads his tortured slave the secret snare and hurls his master in the last despair far from his couch the balmy slumber flies and from his slave unnumberd poisons rise he knows to pest the herd to blast the soil perish the blossom and the harvest spoil to mix the baneful juice the fatal flower this sudden kills that boasts a mining power he knows to scatter unsuspected fate while circling mischiefs on his vengeance wait at length he makes the tyrants self his prey and rushes on him in the face of day or desperate seizes on the child and wife mad with his wrongs and takes their forfeit life that thus the white mans progeny may groan the tyrants lot to balance with his own often from the cradle and the breast will tear even his own babes in phrenzy of despair with mingled rage and fondness stop their breath and give them freedom in the arms of death oh freedom sacred goodess who inspires the untutored savage with sublimest fires he though untutored rushes to the fray combats for passion and never fights for pay while the bought soldier bargains for his breath a mercenary in the trade of death the generous indian from his fetters broke braves every peril to escape the yoke freedoms worst wants prefers to slaverys food and feeds from principle on christian blood often have the chiefs over listed troops prevailed and natures warriors sped where armies failed the difference mark twixt those who sight for hire and those whom freedoms genuine passions sire nay more when victors in the hardy sight restored by conquest to then native right their wrongs are buried when the battles over and so mer injuries are heard no more yet taught distrust ere they consent again with tried deceivers commerce to sustain the appointed leader of the sable band requires a pledge ere he extends the hand the blood must flow from either warriors arm and earth and water blend to form the charm a vase receives the mixture  who disdains to taste the potion no alliance gains both parties drink in sign of mutual trust and the proud tyrants humbled to the dust a stipulation vile is forced to crave and own perforce a master in the slave what will not freedoms heavndescended fire in cultured or in savage souls inspire the rights of nature and of god to save men

fragrance of perpetual may like the coy sensitive each lovely flower still seems to tremble at the touch of power blessed be the good dalmatians generous earth which boasts oh rome than thine a nobler birth thou but the refuge of a robber band but there devotion raised the folded hand and many a century this little state has stood the storms of fortune and of fate whilst thy sunk cities once the boast of fame have naught to mark them but an empty name what though no streams here lave the scant domain but melting snows and reservoirs of rain though hillocks scattered round the parent hill at

for sport or food armed simply with the bow save the thin buffalo over their shoulders crossed their hardy bosoms meet unfencd the frost the casual chase their banquet and their toil they asked no bounty from the sullen soil if to their prayer to range at large was given they thought unbounded liberty was heaven the gods invoked their sylvan wars to aid the stag was slain the board a captive made the female hunters journeyd with the men and fearless trackd the monster to his den and when at eve the warm pursuit was over nor twangd the bow nor sped the arrow more they sprung from light repose ere peep of day and through the humid deserts took their way of forest growth their pampered sloth might view natures brave caesars and wise tullys too active ferocious bold unawed they stood

scene of all his pride of all his spoil no artificial mockery of woe or taught his cheek to change his tears to flow with pious awe he kneeled to kiss the ground and fondly pressed his sorrowing

entombed they lay some wretch unhallowed may usurp as prey leave leave not thus our sires to christian rage but ah with filial wrath the conflict wage thus through the globe in natures earliest dawn for freedom only was the arrow drawn the plain rough ancient at his threshold stood and held that freedom dearer than his blood whatever the forest or the lakes bestow fruits of his lance his angle and his bow the fur that warms him or the hut that shields the scanty harvest which his culture yields earned by his strength was by his strength maintained he felt his own what honest labor gained part of himself his liberty he thought and reason sanctified what nature taught nor force of bribes nor frauds of gold he knew for life and liberty the sword he drew corruption was the growth of later times when avarice reconciled the polished crimes a gentle modern of the christian kind that rose and flourished as vice grew refined an european which in search of grain taught freeborn men to bear and hug the chain see freedom smiling through the realms of frost and glow on labradores inclement coast though darkness sheds deep night through half the year and snow invests the clime  that clime is dear for there fair liberty resides and there at large the native breasts the searching air where blows the arctic tempests icy gale and famine seizes on the spermy whale the bearded esquimaux half robbed of sight roves uncontrolled content with freedoms light his country loves to all its ills conforms endures its caverns and accepts its storms for the huge seadog spreads the nimble oar nor sighs for blessings of a softer shore no languid suns unnerve his hardy race which blessed with freedom range from place to place such too britannia were thy savage sons through all thy tribes the dread of slavery runs the mild heroic honest without laws they braved each peril in fair freedoms cause but ah full many an age in gothic night was veiled the effulgence of their native right though like the rocky barrier of their coast that freedom now is her sublimest boast full many an age dissension shook her fane from romes fierce caesar to the stormy dane in whelming tides poured in the saxon clan and normans finished what their rage began the savage briton to his mountains fled alternate triumphed and alternate bled war upon wars on conquest conquests throng vandal drove goth and goth urged gaul along on human flesh the savage victors eat and mistic druids shared the sanguine treat these to their altars even while truth they taught the trembling sacrifice rapacious brought impostorpriests before their idols stood and talked of heaven with hands embrud in blood before their eyes imagined specter glare spirits were heard and fancied ghosts were there religion law and government their own bloody their altars bloody was their throne through the vexed isle the sanguine edict spread that heaven demanded mountains of the dead in the dark grove which superstition trod priests hid their spoils yet commund with their god and muttering rights within the fearful gloom stab a fresh victim and the feast resume unfelt as yet the softening ties of life deep in the prisoners breast the ruthless knife the female plunged  could savage man do more then idly prophesied as flowed the gore a rage of slaughter then that sex possessed now with each grace of melting pity blessed but soon the tyrants sought themselves to save for soon invaders pierced the druid cave forth from the baltic poured the deathful host and trained to havoc crimsoned all the coast the northern hive swarmed terrible around and every altar smoked upon the ground fire sword and carnage spotted every hand swelled the gorged tomb and deluged all the land different in mind and manners as in face the normans came an innovating race their power their passions and their pride they brought fierce bold and bloody and with conquest fraught from the forced mixture of a foreign breed unnatural customs laws and wars succeed the saxon superstition weak as dire in two extremes of water and of fire the burning ploughshare and the cauldron hot to prove the culprit innocent or not were lenient mercies to the cruel strife that then with horror hung a cloud on life then by no ties of law or nature bound assassination took its deathful round in every grove the lurking stabber lay and human bloodshed clotted all the way in every street the mangled corpse appeared and mutual hate the sanguine standard reared in slavish homage to an haughty lord all social joy was broken at the board from house to house the tyrants edict ran and the feast ended ere the mirth began at the eighth hour tolled out by dread command the dreary knell that darkened all the land wisdom her lessons could no more impart nor friendship gladden or improve the heart ere to their bliss the genial hours invite oppression shed impenetrable night the friendly faggot cheered the heart no more and all the softening blooms of life were over to ruined juries the dire sword succeeds and at each pore insulted justice bleeds even rural pastime in that iron age no more to jovial sports the youth engage the savage beasts which nature gave to all to glut the insatiate pride of one must fall no more the chase no more the woods were free all all was hate  for all was slavery the lawyer clergy too and baron proud aping their prince struck terror through the crowd next bigot priests the imposing mandate bring and yoke the neck of each succeeding king rome sent her monks and superstition reigned freedom in bonds and even conscience chained impious as vain the pope his terrors laid ignorance was awed and folly was afraid fair truth in fetters was like reason bound and dread anathemas were peald around pomp of procession and parade of prayer pardon and curse dealt mercy or despair the heart was tainted and the head confused and all the attributes of god abused people and prince were in one chaos hurled law justice order virtue left the world eventful britain should the muse display the various bloodtracks which then marked thy way should she pursue the havoc of the sword that gashd thee first then crouching called thee lord or trace the deluges of foreign gore that ran in purple torrents through thy shore as conquest often her crimson pinion spread and different victors different mischiefs bred thy hardiest sons would tremble but to view the fearful picture that her pencil drew then let her pause ere she these deeds rehearse a subject sacred to her future verse last and what greater proofs can now remain touch we the border of surinams plain lo there the purchased negroes may thou see bursting their bonds and daring to be free in daring bands from caves and rocks they come and wrought to blood like trooping panthers roam the swart mulattoes to the forests fly resolved to live in freedom or to die blessed be the man and worthy to be blessed friend of the wretched guardian of the oppressed blessed be the man  ye negroes bow the knee and bless him thou oh sweet humanity  who scorning interest thus portrayed the plan that gave to men the awful rights of man awake my friends at mercys call awake haste haste the chains of slavery to break oh race dishonored whose sad forms we tear nor heed our species heed our kindred there too long on sordid altars have ye bled from christian hearts too long has mercy fled at length returned the goddess brings relief from heaven she comes to sooth the captives grief my brethren rise the galling chains unbind and give the generous model to mankind what avarice seized let justice now restore let negroes serve but serve as slaves no more this the new law  let each a shackle rend  till freedom reigns and slavery shall end  or if the name of slave must yet remain  strive not for words so we remove the pain   strive not for words so we the rights supply  the ravished rights of sweet humantiy the good man spoke applauding thousands bowed the hero triumphed and the christian glowed unnumberd hearts by great example fired bent to the law humanity required unnumberd manacles that moment broke unnumberd slaves were loosened from the yoke unnumberd hands were folded up in air unnumberd voices breathed a grateful prayer unnumberd eyes so lately bathed in woe ah blissful change with tears of joy overflow from god the spark began to man it came till all perceiving all partook the flame heavens fire electric as one touched the ball it struck a second till it spread to all soon generous england shall thou catch the flame and added laurels shall adorn thy fame soon shall humanity assert her cause soon shall the slave find shelter in thy laws those equal laws that grace thy pregnant isle where all the bounties and the blessings smile where rich and poor and high and low obey their gentle rule and amicable sway where sovereigns view their lofty roofs ascend while law and liberty the throne defend where subjects see their mansions firmly stand nor fear the rapine of the strongest hand where the poor peasant knows his cot secure humble in size but on foundations sure where boldly fenced his little garden grows and not a king can rob him of a rose thus in the crowded hive though all agree to choose a monarch all the rest are free plebeian cells as sacred as the great and both contribute honey to the state oh launch the bark unfurl the impatient sails swell ye kind seas and blow ye fostering gales oh haste some angel through the realms of air to africs sons the rapturous tidings bear thrice happy he who first shall reach the strand and spread the joys of freedom through the land his the glad welcome of an heavenly guest his the rich bliss to see his fellows blessed and lo methinks on fancys wing conveyed the muse already gains the palmy shade herself the messenger to africs plains ardent she flies to break the tyrantchains her voice already hails the liftning crowd and thus she speaks her embassy aloud i come i come from sweet humanity to sooth the sad and set the captive free heirs as ye are to all that nature gave congenial nature who never made a slave whose minds can reason and whose hearts can move with all the joys and agonies of love sublime on natures scale ye beings rise equals on earth as equals in the skies all all are men in life and death the same and virtue only can distinction claim where freedom bids now take your blithsome way yours the fair morn and yours the closing day yours is the jocund eve its sports command or on the cooling wave or barren sand if in your breasts the patriot passions burn to your loved country to your homes return free unconfined wherever your course ye bend still still shall liberty your steps attend they hear with dumb surprise till raptures rise and these blessed sounds reecho to the skies negroes are men and men are slaves no more fair freedom reigns and tyranny is over and now they trace each scene of former love explore each favored haunt hill vale and grove and soon the wellrememberd huts they find where faithful friends and loves were left behind sudden before her sable lord appears the enfranchised wife adorned with faithful tears mothers again their kidnapped babes behold sons clasp their sires in slavery grown old here their own niger rises to the sight and there their niles prolific banks invite far as extend these parent floods they range feel all at large and triumph in the change yet moved by generous deeds their bosoms burn to merit freedom by a kind return methinks i see them leave their native plain and touched by honor seek their lords again methinks i see them now no scourge is there in willing tribes to scenes once cursed repair led on by gratitude they stoop to toil double their industry and bless the soil they quit the whizzing dart and twanging bow collect the grass and reassume the hoe even troops of sable children brave the sea to kiss the hands which set their fathers free blessed expectation here the muse shall pause and watch humanity thy righteous cause but soon again shall she the globe survey and dare the dangers of her promised lay while in procession pass the human race shall boldly view each tinge of mind as face with curious eye the gradual change shall mark as wondrous nature shifts from light to dark shall visit tribes beneath the polar skies of shape uncouth diminutive of size pass to the tartar of an olive shade untamed untutored and robustly made next move to asias duskytincturd race of foster form nor destitute of grace then the swarth african and yellow moor which spread their sable hues along the shore last wild americas eventful clan and european cultured into man these to descry the muse her course shall bend far as discovered earth and seas extend through the wide universe shall venurous roam nor till the globe be measured seek her home but not content the surface to display hues habits manners customs to pourtray her future song a bolder flight shall try and trace the magic powers of clime and sky track education and religions hand and note the law that governs every land observe if elements that cloud with strife or smile in peace most rule the springs of life see how from each at work upon the mind springs the diversity of human kind next varying modes of liberty survey from where she thrives to where she melts away now proud to claim the independent soul now her tame spirit passive to control for ever weak where tyranny assails for ever strong where milder rule prevails there like vile oxen stooping to the yoke here gaining sudden freedom at a stroke still will she find compact in every part is formed the chain that fastens heart to heart millions of links but all arrangd are seen the rivets closed and not a chasm between and where they disproportioned meet our eyes or seem of different form or different size here if more polished there more rude they show or colored various as the showry bow still one bright zone girds ocean earth and sky thy beauteous zone oh sweet humanity lo the chain lengthens as the links are placed amidst the flowery dale or barren waste some with the whitning billows froth around some bathe in streams that never pass their bound some reddning flame on aetnas burning brow and some are covered with siberian snow some with the brooding mine in darkness hide and some in dazzling floods of light reside some reach the clouded regions of the north where tawny zembla pours her children forth some where keen lapland bids the freezing train chase the fleet reindeer over the icy plain some stretch to milder climes remote from storms where nature rises in her gentler forms still still through every clime may we behold the chain but brightens as the links unfold wherever dispersed they spread to every soul and god it is god alone that links the whole these shall the muse with ardent wing explore nor give at fears vain threat the enquiry over an awful task yet hope the lyre shall string and aid the muse to spread the daring wing ye silken bards repose in beds of flowers and in soft sonnets court the sylvan powers neptune diana wave or woodnymph woo bid thrushes sweeter sing doves fonder coo the lazy poppy nodding over your brows while at your feet the languid water flows silent along as if afraid to creep lest its unguarded lapse should rouse from sleep ah sweetly slumber undisturbed by sense then gently wake to tuneful indolence crop the pale shrub that even in plucking dies but leave the plant that blossoms in the skies nor rash nor diffident the muse shall sweep from clime to clime and dare the giddy steep still to the sun aspiring try the height cleave the dense air and hope to gain the light mean time to soothe her speeds a generous throng to cheer her labor and assist her song these while she tries the unattempted way shall bid her soar and animate her lay and though the fiends who dread the muse should rise with serpent malice hiss her as she flies full many a laurelld bard to science dear compose her terrors and her spirits cheer and while she droops beneath the growing toil her song approve and give the inspiring smile finis errata book i page  0 l    for hands read hand p    l   for haste read hate p    l    for maintains read maintain p    l    a mark of admiration after a
