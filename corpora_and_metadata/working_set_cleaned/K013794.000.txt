the prince of wales   london printed for the author and sold at the british library in the strand mdcclxxxvi price sixpence  preface in this age of theatric change when tragedies have found themselves to be comedies and comedies have bordered upon pantomime nothing has changed so little as pantomime itself harlequin skips away his passion  colombine foots it to the same tune  the chosen lover slides across the stage melancholy and gentlemanlike  the clown breaks his head pleasantly against the scene and the father tumbles over him in the same way and fortunately with the same merriment he has done any time these hundred years  these witticisms are certainly good ones for they are undoubtedly the oldest and of the longest standing of any in christendom  but one jest cannot unfortunately live for ever in the east indies the same joke lasts only a twelvemonth and is terminated by the arrival of the next ships  for this reason the author of the pantomime in which the following songs bear a part has attempted to stray from the beaten road but it is requested the audience will not be alarmed the hero of to night is not about to be a man of sentiment though othello might be such with a black face he had not the good or the ill fortune to have a partycolored jacket which cuts short all sentiment at once  the novelty attempted to be dramatized tonight takes its rise from the writings of miss aikin and the hon horace walpole the castle of otranto and the fragment of sir bertrand form the basis of an endeavor to bring upon the stage somewhat of the effects which may be produced by midnight horror and agency supernatural what may be the result of this experiment tonight must determine for hitherto the experiment has not been made  the ghost of hamlet and the witches of macbeth do not militate against this assertion their appearance though out of nature was simple and not combined the clank of chains the whistling of hollow winds the clapping of doors gigantic forms and visionary gleams of light attended not their effects upon the stage the firm mind certainly may laugh at all this but if ever on a late winter evening at a welltold story of an apparition the company have found themselves unusually attentive and sometimes unwittingly looked back  if they have felt no wish to part  if imperceptibly they have sat more closely together and heard the summons to rest and separation  the retiring to a lone chamber with reluctance not to say disquietude  if all this has happened then are we right in thinking there is somewhat of enthusiasm or superstition in these matters which reason smiles at but cannot prevail over   if this is a weakness the greatest and the best of all times have felt its force  henry the fourth the great duke of marlborough  and a family of rank in this country with whom the author has had the honor of being intimate were remarkable instances of this truth  mixed up with lighter things to counteract the gloom some grains of this species of composition will form the potion of the pantomime in question in other matters the author humbly hopes he shall not be more dull than his neighbors have been before him perhaps quite as nonsensical and sometimes more absurd  he trusts however the audience will not be displeased with him for having substituted a talkative attendant upon harlequin in the room of the usual dumb grimace of the clown or having given them the youthful accomplishments of miss wilkinson as a colombine in the place of a figurante  vocal characters necromancer first magician second
