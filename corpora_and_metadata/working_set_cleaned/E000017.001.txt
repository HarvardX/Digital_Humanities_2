satisfactory to the feelings of the benevolent reader than by giving an account of those humane and worthy persons who have endeavoured to draw upon it that share of the publick attention which it has obtained among the well disposed individuals of different nations and ages who have humanely exerted themselves to suppress the abject personal slavery introduced in the original cultivation of the european colonies in the western world bartholomew de las casas the pious bishop of chiapa in the fifteenth century seems to have been the first this amiable man during his residence in spanish america was so sensibly affected at the treatment which the miserable indians underwent that he returned to spain to make a vi publick remonstrance before the celebrated emperor charles the fifth declaring that heaven would one day call him to an account for those cruelties which he then had it in his power to prevent the speech which he made on the occasion is now extant and is a most perfect picture of benevolence and piety but his intreaties by the opposition of avarice were rendered ineffectual and i do not find by any books which i have read upon the subject that any other person interfered till the last century when morgan godwyn a british clergyman distinguished himself in the cause the present age has also produced some zealous and able opposers of the colonial slavery for about the middle of the present century john woolman and anthony benezet two respectable members of the religious society called quakers devoted much of their time to the subject the former travelled through most parts of north america on foot to hold conversations with the members of his own sect on the impiety of retaining those in a state of involuntary servitude who had never given them offence the latter kept a free school at philadelphia vii for the education of black people he took every opportunity of pleading in their behalf he published several treatises against slavery and gave an hearty proof of his attachment to the cause by leaving the whole of his fortune in support of that school to which he had so generously devoted his time and attention when alive till this time it does not appear that any bodies of men had collectively interested themselves in endeavouring to remedy the evil but in the year      the religious society called quakers publickly testified their sentiments upon the subject∥ declaring that to live in ease and plenty by the toil of those whom fraud and violence had put into their power was neither consistent with christianity nor common justice impressed with these sentiments many of this society immediately liberated their slaves and though such a measure appeared to be viii attended with considerable loss to the benevolent individuals who unconditionally presented them with their freedom yet they adopted it with pleasure nobly considering that to possess a little in an honourable way was better than to possess much through the medium of injustice their example was gradually followed by the rest a general emancipation of the slaves in the possession of quakers at length took place and so effectually did they serve the cause which they had undertaken that they denied the claim of membership in their religious community to all such as should hereafter oppose the suggestions of justice in this particular either by retaining slaves in their possession or by being in any manner concerned in the slave trade and it is a fact that through the vast tract of north america there is not at this day a single slave in the possession of an acknowledged quaker but though this measure appeared as has been observed before to be attended with considerable loss to the benevolent individuals who adopted it yet as virtue seldom fails of obtaining its reward it became ultimately beneficial most of the slaves who ix were thus unconditionally freed returned without any solicitation to their former masters to serve them at stated wages as free men the work which they now did was found to be better done than before it was found also that a greater quantity was done in the same time hence less than the former number of labourers was sufficient from these and a variety of other circumstances it appeared that their plantations were considerably more profitable when worked by free men than when worked as before by slaves and that they derived therefore contrary to their expectations a considerable advantage from their benevolence animated by the example of the quakers the members of other sects began to deliberate about adopting the same measure some of those of the church of england of the roman catholicks and of the presbyterians and independants freed their slaves and there happened but one instance where the matter was debated where it was not immediately put in force this was in pennsylvania it was agitated in the synod of the presbyterians x there to oblige their members to liberate their slaves the question was negatived by a majority of but one person and this opposition seemed to arise rather from a dislike to the attempt of forcing such a measure upon the members of that community than from any other consideration i have the pleasure of being credibly informed that the manumission of slaves or the employment of free men in the plantations is now daily gaining ground in north america should slavery be abolished there and it is an event which from these circumstances we may reasonably expect to be produced in time let it be remembered that the quakers will have had the merit of its abolition nor have their brethren here been less assiduous in the cause as there are happily no slaves in this country so they have not had the same opportunity of shewing their benevolence by a general emancipation they have not however omitted to shew it as far as they have been able at their religious meetings they have regularly inquired if any of their members are concerned in the iniquitous african trade they have xi appointed a committee for obtaining every kind of information on the subject with a view to its suppression and about three or four years ago petitioned parliament on the occasion for their interference and support i am sorry to add that their benevolent application was ineffectual and that the reformation of an evil productive of consequences equally impolitick and immoral and generally acknowledged to have long disgraced our national character is yet left to the unsupported efforts of piety morality and justice against interest violence and oppression and these i blush to acknowledge too strongly countenanced by the legislative authority of a country the basis of whose government is liberty nothing can be more clearly shewn than that an inexhaustible mine of wealth is neglected in africa for the prosecution of this impious traffick that if proper measures were taken the revenue of this country might be greatly improved its naval strength increased its colonies in a more flourishing situation the planters richer and a trade which is now a scene of blood and xii desolation converted into one which might be prosecuted with advantage and honour such have been the exertions of the quakers in the cause of humanity and virtue they are still prosecuting as far as they are able their benevolent design and i should stop here and praise them for thus continuing their humane endeavours but that i conceive it to be unnecessary they are acting consistently with the principles of religion they will find a reward in their own consciences and they will receive more real pleasure from a single reflection on their conduct than they can possibly experience from the praises of an host of writers in giving this short account of those humane and worthy persons who have endeavoured to restore to their fellow creatures the rights of nature of which they had been unjustly deprived i should feel myself unjust were i to omit two zealous opposers of the colonial tyranny conspicuous at the present day the first is mr granville sharp this gentleman has particularly distinguished himself in the cause of freedom it is a xiii notorious fact that but a few years since many of the unfortunate black people who had been brought from the colonies into this country were sold in the metropolis to merchants and others when their masters had no farther occasion for their services though it was always understood that every person was free as soon as he landed on the british shore in consequence of this notion these unfortunate black people refused to go to the new masters to whom they were consigned they were however seized and forcibly conveyed under cover of the night to ships then lying in the thames to be retransported to the colonies and to be delivered again to the planters as merchantable goods the humane mr sharpe was the means of putting a stop to this iniquitous traffick whenever he gained information of people in such a situation he caused them to be brought on shore at a considerable expence he undertook their cause and was instrumental in obtaining the famous decree in the case of somersett that as soon as any person whatever set his foot in this country xiv he came under the protection of the british laws and was consequently free nor did he interfere less honourably in that cruel and disgraceful case in the summer of the year      when an hundred and thirty two negroes in their passage to the colonies were thrown into the sea alive to defraud the underwriters but his pious endeavours were by no means attended with the same success to enumerate his many laudable endeavours in the extirpation of tyranny and oppression would be to swell the preface into a volume suffice it to say that he has written several books on the subject and one particularly which he distinguishes by the title of a limitation of slavery the second is the rev james ramsay this gentleman resided for many years in the westindies in the clerical office he perused all the colonial codes of law with a view to find if there were any favourable clauses by which the grievances of slaves could be redressed but he was severely disappointed in his pursuits he published a treatise since his return to england called an essay on the treatment and conversion of xv african slaves in the british sugar colonies which i recommend to the perusal of the humane reader this work reflects great praise upon the author since in order to be of service to this singularly oppressed part of the human species he compiled it at the expence of forfeiting that friendship which he had contracted with many in those parts during a series of years and at the hazard as i am credibly informed of suffering much in his private property as well as of subjecting himself to the ill will and persecution of numerous individuals this essay on the treatment and conversion of african slaves contains so many important truths on the colonial slavery and has come so home to the planters being written by a person who has a thorough knowledge of the subject as to have occasioned a considerable alarm within the last eight months two publications have expressly appeared against it one of them is intitled cursory remarks on mr ramsays essay the other an apology for negroe slavery on each of these i am xvi bound as writing on the subject to make a few remarks the cursory remarker insinuates that mr ramsays account of the treatment is greatly exaggerated if not wholly false to this i shall make the following reply i have the honour of knowing several disinterested gentlemen who have been acquainted with the west indian islands for years i call them disinterested because they have neither had a concern in the african trade nor in the colonial slavery and i have heard these unanimously assert that mr ramsays account is so far from being exaggerated or taken from the most dreary pictures that he could find that it is absolutely below the truth that he must have omitted many instances of cruelty which he had seen himself and that they only wondered how he could have written with so much moderation upon the subject they allow the cursory remarks to be excellent as a composition but declare that it is perfectly devoid of truth but the cursory remarker does not depend so much on the circumstances which he has advanced nor can he since they xvii have no other existence than in his own brain as on the instrument detraction this he has used with the utmost virulence through the whole of his publication artfully supposing that if he could bring mr ramsays reputation into dispute his work would fall of course as of no authenticity i submit this simple question to the reader when a writer in attempting to silence a publication attacks the character of its author rather than the principles of the work itself is it not a proof that the work itself is unquestionable and that this writer is at a loss to find an argument against it but there is something so very ungenerous in this mode of replication as to require farther notice for if this is the mode to be adopted in literary disputes what writer can be safe or who is there that will not be deterred from taking up his pen in the cause of virtue there are circumstances in every persons life which if given to the publick in a malevolent manner and without explanation might essentially injure him in the eyes of the world xviii though were they explained they would be even reputable the cursory remarker has adopted this method of dispute but mr ramsay has explained himself to the satisfaction of all parties and has refuted him in every point the name of this cursory remarker is tobin a name which i feel myself obliged to hand down with detestation as far as i am able and with an hint to future writers that they will do themselves more credit and serve more effectually the cause which they undertake if on such occasions they attack the work rather than the character of the writer who affords them a subject for their lucubrations nor is this the only circumstance which induces me to take such particular notice of the cursory remarks i feel it incumbent upon me to rescue an injured person from the cruel aspersions that have been thrown upon him as i have been repeatedly informed by those who have the pleasure of his acquaintance that his character is irreproachable i am also interested myself for if such detraction is passed over in silence my own reputation and not my xix work may be attacked by an anonymous hireling in the cause of slavery the apology for negroe slavery is almost too despicable a composition to merit a reply i have only therefore to observe as is frequently the case in a bad cause or where writers do not confine themselves to truth that the work refutes itself this writer speaking of the slavetrade asserts that people are never kidnapped on the coast of africa in speaking of the treatment of slaves he asserts again that it is of the very mildest nature and that they live in the most comfortable and happy manner imaginable to prove each of his assertions he proposes the following regulations that the stealing of slaves from africa should be felony that the premeditated murder of a slave by any person on board should come under the same denomination that when slaves arrive in the colonies lands should be allotted for their provisions in proportion to their number or commissioners should see that a sufficient quantity of sound wholesome provisions is purchased that they should not work on sundays and other holydays that extra xx labour or nightwork out of crop should be prohibited that a limited number of stripes should be inflicted upon them that they should have annually a suit of clothes that old infirm slaves should be properly cared for c —now it can hardly be conceived that if this author had tried to injure his cause or contradict himself he could not have done it in a more effectual manner than by this proposal of these salutary regulations for to say that slaves are honourably obtained on the coast to say that their treatment is of the mildest nature and yet to propose the abovementioned regulations as necessary is to refute himself more clearly than i confess myself to be able to do it and i have only to request that the regulations proposed by this writer in the defence of slavery may be considered as so many proofs of the assertions contained in my own work i shall close my account with an observation which is of great importance in the present case of all the publications in favour of the slavetrade or the subsequent slavery in the colonies there is not one xxi which has not been written either by a chaplain to the african factories or by a merchant or by a planter or by a person whose interest has been connected in the cause which he has taken upon him to defend of this description are mr tobin and the apologist for negroe slavery while on the other hand those who have had as competent a knowledge of the subject but not the same interest as themselves have unanimously condemned it and many of them have written their sentiments upon it at the hazard of creating an innumerable host of enemies and of being subjected to the most malignant opposition now which of these are we to believe on the occasion are we to believe those who are parties concerned who are interested in the practice—but the question does not admit of a dispute concerning my own work it seems proper to observe that when the original latin dissertation as the title page expresses was honoured by the university of cambridge with the first of their annual prizes for the year      i was waited xxii upon by some gentlemen of respectability and consequence who requested me to publish it in english the only objection which occurred to me was this that having been prevented by an attention to other studies from obtaining that critical knowledge of my own language which was necessary for an english composition i was fearful of appearing before the publick eye but that as they flattered me with the hope that the publication of it might be of use i would certainly engage to publish it if they would allow me to postpone it for a little time till i was more in the habit of writing they replied that as the publick attention was now excited to the case of the unfortunate africans it would be serving the cause with double the effect if it were to be published within a few months this argument prevailed nothing but this circumstance could have induced me to offer an english composition to the inspection of an host of criticks and i trust therefore that this circumstance will plead much with the benevolent reader in favour of those faults which he may find in the present work xxiii having thus promised to publish it i was for some time doubtful from which of the copies to translate there were two the original and an abridgement the latter as these academical compositions are generally of a certain length was that which was sent down to cambridge and honoured with the prize i was determined however upon consulting with my friends to translate from the former this has been faithfully done with but few additions the reader will probably perceive the latin idiom in several passages of the work though i have endeavoured as far as i have been able to avoid it and i am so sensible of the disadvantages under which it must yet lie as a translation that i wish i had written upon the subject without any reference at all to the original copy it will perhaps be asked from what authority i have collected those facts which xxiv relate to the colonial slavery i reply that i have had the means of the very best of information on the subject having the pleasure of being acquainted with many both in the naval and military departments as well as with several others who have been long acquainted with america and the westindian islands the facts therefore which i have related are compiled from the disinterested accounts of these gentlemen all of whom i have the happiness to say have coincided in the minutest manner in their descriptions it must be remarked too that they were compiled not from what these gentlemen heard while they were resident in those parts but from what they actually saw nor has a single instance been taken from any book whatever upon the subject except that which is mentioned in the    th page and this book was published in france in the year      by authority i have now the pleasure to say that the accounts of these disinterested gentlemen whom i consulted on the occasion are confirmed by all the books which i have ever perused upon slavery except those which xxv have been written by merchants planters c they are confirmed by sir hans sloanes voyage to barbadoes griffith hughess history of the same island printed    0 an account of north america by thomas jefferies      all benezets works c c and particularly by mr ramsays essay on the treatment and conversion of the african slaves in the british sugar colonies a work which is now firmly established and i may add in a very extraordinary manner in consequence of the controversy which this gentleman has sustained with the cursory remarker by which several facts which were mentioned in the original copy of my own work before the controversy began and which had never appeared in any work upon the subject have been brought to light nor has it received less support from a letter published only last week from capt j s smith of the royal navy to the rev mr hill on the former of whom too high encomiums cannot be bestowed for standing forth in that noble and disinterested manner in behalf of an injured character xxvi i have now only to solicit the reader again that he will make a favourable allowance for the present work not only from those circumstances which i have mentioned but from the consideration that only two months are allowed by the university for these their annual compositions should he however be unpropitious to my request i must console myself with the reflection a reflection that will always afford me pleasure even amidst the censures of the great that by undertaking the cause of the unfortunate africans i have undertaken as far as my abilities would permit the cause of injured innocence london june  st      xxvii xxxii errata for dominique page     read domingue n b in page    a latin note has been inserted by mistake under the quotation of diodorus siculus the reader will find the original greek of the same signification in the same author at page    editio stephani   an essay on the slavery and commerce of the human species in three parts part i the history of slavery chap i when civilized as well as barbarous nations have been found through a long succession of ages uniformly to concur in the same customs there seems to arise a presumption that such customs are not only eminently useful but   are founded also on the principles of justice such is the case with respect to slavery it has had the concurrence of all the nations which history has recorded and the repeated practice of ages from the remotest antiquity in its favour here then is an argument deduced from the general consent and argreement of mankind in favour of the proposed subject but alas when we reflect that the people thus reduced to a state of servitude have had the same feelings with ourselves when we reflect that they have had the same propensities to pleasure and the same aversions from pain another argument seems immediately to arise in opposition to the former deduced from our own feelings and that divine sympathy which nature has implanted in our breasts for the most useful and generous of purposes to ascertain the truth therefore where two such opposite sources of argument occur where the force of custom pleads strongly on the one hand and the feelings of humanity on the other is a matter of much importance as the dignity of human nature is concerned and the rights and liberties of mankind will be involved in its discussion   it will be necessary before this point can be determined to consult the history of slavery and to lay before the reader in as concise a manner as possible a general view of it from its earliest appearance to the present day the first whom we shall mention here to have been reduced to a state of servitude may be comprehended in that class which is usually denominated the mercenary it consisted of freeborn citizens who from the various contingencies of fortune had become so poor as to have recourse for their support to the service of the rich of this kind were those both among the egyptians and the jews who are recorded in the sacred writings †the grecian thetes also were of this description as well as those among the romans from whom the   class receives its appellation the ∥mercenarii we may observe of the abovementioned that their situation was in many instances similar to that of our own servants there was an express contract between the parties they could most of them demand their discharge if they were ill used by their respective masters and they were treated therefore with more humanity than those whom we usually distinguish in our language by the appellation of slaves as this class of servants was composed of men who had been reduced to such a situation by the contingencies of fortune and not by their own misconduct so there was another among the ancients composed entirely of those who had suffered the loss of liberty from their own imprudence to this class may be reduced the grecian prodigals   who were detained in the service of their creditors till the fruits of their labour were equivalent to their debts the delinquents who were sentenced to the oar and the german enthusiasts as mentioned by tacitus who were so immoderately charmed with gaming as when every thing else was gone to have staked their liberty and their very selves the loser says he goes into a voluntary servitude and though younger and stronger than the person with whom he played patiently suffers himself to be bound and sold their perseverance in so bad a custom is stiled honour the slaves thus obtained are immediately exchanged away in commerce that the winner may get rid of the scandal of his victory to enumerate other instances would be unnecessary it will be sufficient to observe that the servants of this class were in a far more wretched situation than those of the former their drudgery was more intense their treatment more severe and there was no retreat at pleasure from the frowns and lashes of their despotick masters   having premised this we may now proceed to a general division of slavery into voluntary and involuntary the voluntary will comprehend the two classes which we have already mentioned for in the first instance there was a contract founded on consent and in the second there was a choice of engaging or not in those practices the known consequences of which were servitude the involuntary on the other hand will comprehend those who were forced without any such condition or choice into a situation which as it tended to degrade a part of the human species and to class it with the brutal must have been of all human situations the most wretched and insupportable these are they whom we shall consider solely in the present work we shall therefore take our leave of the former as they were mentioned only that we might state the question with greater accuracy and be the better enabled to reduce it to its proper limits   chap ii the first that will be mentioned of the involuntary were prisoners of war it was a law established from time immemorial among the nations of antiquity to oblige those to undergo the severities of servitude whom victory had thrown into their hands conformably with this we find all the eastern nations unanimous in the practice the same custom prevailed among the people of the west for as the helots became the slaves of the spartans from the right of conquest only so prisoners of war were reduced to the same situation by the rest of the inhabitants of greece by the same principles that actuated these were the romans also influenced their history will confirm the fact for how many cities are recorded to have been taken how many armies to have been vanquished in the field and the wretched survivors in both instances to have been doomed to servitude   it remains only now to observe in shewing this custom to have been universal that all those nations which assisted in overturning the roman empire though many and various adopted the same measures for we find it a general maxim in their polity that whoever should fall into their hands as a prisoner of war should immediately be reduced to the condition of a slave it may here perhaps be not unworthy of remark that the involuntary were of greater antiquity than the voluntary slaves the latter are first mentioned in the time of pharaoh they could have arisen only in a state of society when property after its division had become so unequal as to multiply the wants of individuals and when government after its establishment had given security to the possessor by the punishment of crimes whereas the former seem to be dated with more propriety from the days of nimrod who gave rise probably to that inseparable idea of victory and servitude which we find among the nations of antiquity and which has existed uniformly since   in one country or another to the present day add to this that they might have arisen even in a state of nature and have been coeval with the quarrels of mankind chap iii but it was not victory alone or any presupposed right founded in the damages of war that afforded a pretence for invading the liberties of mankind the honourable light in which piracy was considered in the uncivilized ages of the world contributed not a little to the slavery of the human species piracy had a very early beginning the grecians †says thucydides in their primitive state as well as the contemporary barbarians who inhabited the sea coasts and islands gave themselves wholly to it it was in short their only profession and support the writings  0 of homer are sufficient of themselves to establish this account they shew it to have been a common practice at so early a period as that of the trojan war and abound with many lively descriptions of it which had they been as groundless as they are beautiful would have frequently spared the sigh of the reader of sensibility and reflection the piracies which were thus practised in the early ages may be considered as publick or private in the former whole crews embarked for the †benefit of their respective tribes they made descents on the sea coasts carried off cattle surprized whole villages put many of the inhabitants to the sword and carried others into slavery in the latter individuals only were concerned and the emolument was their own these landed from their ships and going up into the country concealed themselves in the woods and thickets where they waited every opportunity of catching the    unfortunate shepherd or husbandman alone in this situation they sallied out upon him dragged him on board conveyed him to a foreign market and sold him for a slave to this kind of piracy ulysses alludes in opposition to the former which he had been just before mentioning in his question to eumœus   did pirates wait till all thy friends were gone   to catch thee singly with thy flocks alone   say did they force thee from thy fleecy care   and from thy fields transport and sell thee here but no picture perhaps of this mode of depredation is equal to that with which‡ xenophon presents us in the simple narrative of a dance he informs us that the grecian army had concluded a peace with the paphlagonians and that they entertained their embassadors in consequence with a banquet and the exhibition of various feats of activity when the thracians says he had performed the parts allotted them in this entertainment some ænianian and magnetian soldiers rose up and accoutred    in their proper arms exhibited that dance which is called karpæa the figure of it is thus one of them in the character of an husbandman is seen to till his land and is observed as he drives his plough to look frequently behind him as if apprehensive of danger another immediately appears in sight in the character of a robber the husbandman having seen him previously advancing snatches up his arms a battle ensues before the plough the whole of this performance is kept in perfect time with the musick of the flute at length the robber having got the better of the husbandman binds him and drives him off with his team sometimes it happens that the husbandman subdues the robber in this case the scene is only reversed as the latter is then bound and driven off by the former it is scarcely necessary to observe that this dance was a representation of the general manners of men in the more uncivilized ages of the world shewing that the husbandman and shepherd lived in continual    alarm and that there were people in those ages who derived their pleasures and fortunes from kidnapping and enslaving their fellow creatures we may now take notice of a circumstance in this narration which will lead us to a review of our first assertion on this point that the honourable light in which piracy was considered in the times of barbarism contributed not a little to the slavery of the human species the robber is represented here as frequently defeated in his attempts and as reduced to that deplorable situation to which he was endeavouring to bring another this shews the frequent difficulty and danger of his undertakings people would not tamely resign their lives or liberties without a struggle they were sometimes prepared were superior often in many points of view to these invaders of their liberty there were an hundred accidental circumstances frequently in their favour these adventures therefore required all the skill strength agility valour and every thing in short that may be supposed to constitute heroism    to conduct them with success upon this idea piratical expeditions first came into repute and their frequency afterwards together with the danger and fortitude that were inseparably connected with them brought them into such credit among the barbarous nations of antiquity that of all human professions piracy was the most honourable the notions then which were thus annexed to piratical expeditions did not fail to produce those consequences which we have mentioned before they afforded an opportunity to the views of avarice and ambition to conceal themselves under the mask of virtue they excited a spirit of enterprize of all others the most irresistible as it subsisted on the strongest principles of action emolument and honour thus could the vilest of passions be gratified with impunity people were robbed stolen murdered under the pretended idea that these were    reputable adventures every enormity in short was committed and dressed up in the habiliments of honour but as the notions of men in the less barbarous ages which followed became more corrected and refined the practice of piracy began gradually to disappear it had hitherto been supported on the grand columns of emolument and honour when the latter therefore was removed it received a considerable shock but alas it had still a pillar for its support avarice which exists in all states and which is ready to turn every invention to its own ends strained hard for its preservation it had been produced in the ages of barbarism it had been pointed out in those ages as lucrative and under this notion it was continued people were still stolen many were intercepted some in their pursuits of pleasure others in the discharge of their several occupations by their own countrymen who previously laid in wait for them and sold them afterwards for slaves while others seized by merchants who traded on the different coasts were torn from their friends    and connections and carried into slavery the merchants of thessaly if we can credit aristophanes who never spared the vices of the times were particularly infamous for the latter kind of depredation the athenians were notorious for the former for they had practised these robberies to such an alarming degree of danger to individuals that it was found necessary to enact a ‡law which punished kidnappers with death—but this is sufficient for our present purpose it will enable us to assert that there were two classes of involuntary slaves among the ancients of those who were taken publickly in a state of war and of those who were privately stolen in a state of innocence and peace we may now add that the children and descendents of these composed a third chap iv it will be proper to say something here concerning the situation of the unfortunate    men who were thus doomed to a life of servitude to enumerate their various employments and to describe the miseries which they endured in consequence either from the severity or the long and constant application of their labour would exceed the bounds we have proposed to the present work we shall confine ourselves to their personal treatment as depending on the power of their masters and the protection of the law their treatment if considered in this light will equally excite our pity and abhorrence they were beaten starved tortured murdered at discretion they were dead in a civil sense they had neither name nor tribe were incapable of a judicial process were in short without appeal poor unfortunate men to be deprived of all possible protection to suffer the bitterest of injuries without the possibility of redress to be condemned unheard to be murdered with impunity to be considered as dead in that state the very members of which they were supporting by their labours yet such was their general situation there were two places however where their    condition if considered in this point of view was more tolerable the ægyptian slave though perhaps of all others the greatest drudge yet if he had time to reach the temple of hercules found a certain retreat from the persecution of his master and he received additional comfort from the reflection that his life whether he could reach it or not could not be taken with impunity wise and salutary †law how often must it have curbed the insolence of power and stopped those passions in their progress which had otherwise been destructive to the slave but though the persons of slaves were thus greatly secured in ægypt yet there was no place so favourable to them as athens they were allowed a greater liberty of speech‡ they had their convivial meetings their amours their hours of relaxation    pleasantry and mirth they were treated in short with so much humanity in general as to occasion that observation of demosthenes in his second philippick that the condition of a slave at athens was preferable to that of a free citizen in many other countries but if any exception happened which was sometimes the case from the general treatment described if persecution took the place of lenity and made the fangs of servitude more pointed than before they had then their temple like the ægyptian for refuge where the legislature was so attentive as to examine their complaints and to order them if they were founded in justice to be sold to another master nor was this all they had a privilege infinitely greater than the whole of these they were allowed an opportunity of working for themselves and if their diligence had procured them a sum equivalent with their ransom they could  0 immediately on paying it down‡ demand their freedom for ever this law was of all others the most important as the prospect of liberty which it afforded must have been a continual source of the most pleasing reflections and have greatly sweetened the draught even of the most bitter slavery thus then to the eternal honour of ægypt and athens they were the only places that we can find where slaves were considered with any humanity at all the rest of the world seemed to vie with each other in the debasement and oppression of these unfortunate people they used them with as much severity as they chose they measured their treatment only by their own passion and caprice and by leaving them on every occasion without the possibility of an appeal they rendered their situation    the most melancholy and intolerable that can possibly be conceived chap v as we have mentioned the barbarous and inhuman treatment that generallly fell to the lot of slaves it may not be amiss to inquire into the various circumstances by which it was produced the first circumstance from whence it originated was the commerce for if men could be considered as possessions if like cattle they could be bought and sold it will not be difficult to suppose that they could be held in the same consideration or treated in the same manner the commerce therefore which was begun in the primitive ages of the world by classing them with the brutal species and by habituating the mind to consider the terms of brute and slave as synonimous soon caused them to be viewed in a low and despicable light and as greatly inferiour to the human species hence proceeded that treatment which might not unreasonably be supposed to arise    from so low an estimation they were tamed like beasts by the stings of hunger and the lash and their education was directed to the same end to make them commodious instruments of labour for their possessors this treatment which thus proceeded in the ages of barbarism from the low estimation in which slaves were unfortunately held from the circumstances of the commerce did not fail of producing in the same instant its own effect it depressed their minds it numbed their faculties and by preventing those sparks of genius from blazing forth which had otherwise been conspicuous it gave them the appearance of being endued with inferiour capacities than the rest of mankind this effect of the treatment had made so considerable a progress as to have been a matter of observation in the days of homer   for half his senses jove conveys away   whom once he dooms to see the servile day    thus then did the commerce by classing them originally with brutes and the consequent treatment by cramping their abilities and hindering them from becoming conspicuous give to these unfortunate people at a very early period the most unfavourable appearance the rising generations who received both the commerce and treatment from their ancestors and who had always been accustomed to behold their effects did not consider these effects as incidental they judged only from what they saw they believed the appearances to be real and hence arose the combined principle that slaves were an inferiour order of men and perfectly void of understanding upon this principle it was that the former treatment began to be fully confirmed and established and as this principle was handed down and disseminated so it became in succeeding ages an excuse for any severity that despotism might suggest we may observe here that as all nations had this excuse in common as arising from the circumstances abovementioned so the greeks first and the romans afterwards    had an additional excuse as arising from their own vanity the former having conquered troy and having united themselves under one common name and interest began from that period to distinguish the rest of the world by the title of barbarians inferring by such an appellation that they were men who were only noble in their own country that they had no right from their nature to authority or command that on the contrary so low were their capacities they were destined by nature to obey and to live in a state of perpetual drudgery and subjugation conformable with this opinion was the treatment which was accordingly prescribed to a barbarian the philosopher aristotle himself in the advice which he gave to his pupil alexander before he went upon his asiatick expedition †intreated him to use the greeks as it became a general    but the barbarians as it became a master consider says he the former as friends and domesticks but the latter as brutes and plants inferring that the greeks from the superiority of their capacities had a natural right to dominion and that the rest of the world from the inferiority of their own were to be considered and treated as the irrational part of the creation now if we consider that this was the treatment which they judged to be absolutely proper for people of this description and that their slaves were uniformly those whom they termed barbarians being generally such as were either kidnapped from barbary or purchased from the barbarian conquerors in their wars with one another we shall immediately see with what an additional excuse their own vanity had furnished them for the sallies of caprice and passion to refute these cruel sentiments of the ancients and to shew that their slaves were by no means an inferiour order of beings than themselves may perhaps be considered as an unnecessary task particularly as having    shewn that the causes of this inferiour appearance were incidental arising on the one hand from the combined effects of the treatment and commerce and on the other from vanity and pride we seem to have refuted them already but we trust that some few observations in vindication of these unfortunate people will neither be unacceptable nor improper how then shall we begin the refutation shall we say with seneca who saw many of the slaves in question what is a knight or a libertine or a slave are they not names assumed either from injury or ambition or shall we say with him on another occasion let us consider that he whom we call our slave is born in the same manner as ourselves that he enjoys the same sky with all its heavenly luminaries that he breathes that he lives in the same manner as ourselves and in the same manner that he expires these considerations we confess would furnish us with a plentiful source of arguments in the case before us but we decline their assistance how then shall we begin shall    we enumerate the many instances of fidelity patience or valour that are recorded of the servile race shall we enumerate the many important services that they rendered both to the individuals and the community under whom they lived here would be a second source from whence we could collect sufficient materials to shew that there was no inferiority in their nature but we decline to use them we shall content onrselves with some few instances that relate to the genius only we shall mention the names of those of a servile condition whose writings having escaped the wreck of time and having been handed down even to the present age are now to be seen as so many living monuments that neither the grecian nor roman genius was superiour to their own the first whom we shall mention here is the famous æsop he was a phrygian by birth and lived in the time of crœsus king of lydia to whom he dedicated his fables the writings of this great man in whatever light we consider them will be equally entitled to our admiration but we    are well aware that the very mention of him as a writer of fables may depreciate him in the eyes of some to such we shall propose a question whether this species of writing has not been more beneficial to mankind or whether it has not produced more important events than any other with respect to the first consideration it is evident that these fables as consisting of plain and simple transactions are particularly easy to be understood as conveyed in images they please and seduce the mind and as containing a moral easily deducible on the side of virtue that they afford at the same time the most weighty precepts of philosophy here then are the two grand points of composition a manner of expression to be apprehened by the lowest capacities and what is considered as a victory in the art an happy conjunction of utility and pleasure hence quintilian recommends them as singularly useful and as admirably adapted to the puerile age as a just gradation between    the language of the nurse and the preceptor and as furnishing maxims of prudence and virtue at a time when the speculative principles of philosophy are too difficult to be understood hence also having been introduced by most civilized nations into their system of education they have produced that general benefit to which we at first alluded nor have they been of less consequence in maturity but particularly to those of inferiour capacities or little erudition whom they have frequently served as a guide to conduct them in life and as a medium through which an explanation might be made on many and important occasions with respect to the latter consideration which is easily deducible from hence we shall only appeal to the wonderful effect which the fable pronounced by demosthenes against philip of macedon produced among his hearers or to the fable which was spoken by menenius agrippa to the roman populace by which an illiterate multitude were brought back to their duty  0 as citizens when no other species of oratory could prevail to these truly ingenious and philosophical works of æsop we shall add those of his imitator phœdrus which in purity and elegance of style are inferiour to none we shall add also the lyrick poetry of alcman which is no servile composition the sublime morals of epictetus and the incomparable comedies of terence thus then does it appear that the excuse which was uniformly started in defence of the treatment of slaves had no foundation whatever either in truth or justice the instances that we have mentioned above are sufficient to shew that there was no inferiority either in their nature or their understandings and at the same time that they refute the principles of the ancients they afford a valuable lesson to those who have been accustomed to form too precipitate a judgment on the abilities of men for alas how often has secret anguish depressed the spirits of those whom they have frequently censured from their gloomy and dejected appearance and how often on the other    hand has their judgment resulted from their own vanity and pride chap vi we proceed now to the consideration of the commerce in consequence of which people endued with the same feelings and faculties as ourselves were made subject to the laws and limitations of possession this commerce of the human species was of a very early date it was founded on the idea that men were property and as this idea was coeval with the first order of involuntary slaves it must have arisen if the date which we previously affixed to that order be right in the first practices of barter the story of joseph as recorded in the sacred writings whom his brothers sold from an envious suspicion of his future greatness is an ample testimony of the truth of this conjecture it shews that there were men even at that early period who travelled up and down as merchants collecting not only balm myrrh spicery and other wares but the human species also for the    purposes of traffick the instant determination of the brothers on the first sight of the merchants to sell him and the immediate acquiescence of these who purchased him for a foreign market prove that this commerce had been then established not only in that part of the country where this transaction happened but in that also whither the merchants were then travelling with their camels namely ægypt and they shew farther that as all customs require time for their establishment so it must have existed in the ages previous to that of pharaoh that is in those ages in which we fixed the first date of involuntary servitude this commerce then as appears by the present instance existed in the earliest practices of barter and had descended to the ægyptians through as long a period of time as was sufficient to have made it in the times alluded to an established custom thus was ægypt in those days the place of the greatest resort the grand emporium of trade to which people were driving their merchandize as to a centre and thus did it afford among other opportunities of traffick    the first market that is recorded for the sale of the human species this market which was thus supplied by the constant concourse of merchants who resorted to it from various parts could not fail by these means to have been considerable it received afterwards an additional supply from those piracies which we mentioned to have existed in the uncivilized ages of the world and which in fact it greatly promoted and encouraged and it became from these united circumstances so famous as to have been known within a few centuries from the time of pharaoh both to the grecian colonies in asia and the grecian islands homer mentions cyprus and ægypt as the common markets for slaves about the times of the trojan war thus antinous offended with ulysses threatens to send him to one of these places if he does not instantly depart from his table the same poet also in his‡ hymn to bacchus mentions them    again but in a more unequivocal manner as the common markets for slaves he takes occasion in that hymn to describe the pirates method of scouring the coast from the circumstance of their having kidnapped bacchus as a noble youth for whom they expected an immense ransom the captain of the vessel having dragged him on board is represented as addressing himself thus to the steersman   haul in the tackle hoist alost the sail   then take your helm and watch the doubtful gale   to mind the captive prey be ours the care   while you to ægypt or to cyprus steer   there shall he go unless his friends hell tell   whose ransomgifts will pay us full as well it may not perhaps be considered as a digression to mention in few words by itself the wonderful concordance of the writings of moses and homer with the case before us not that the former from their divine authority want additional support but because it cannot be unpleasant to see them confirmed by a person who being one of the earliest writers and living in a very remote age was the first that could afford us any additional proof of the circumstances    abovementioned ægypt is represented in the first book of the sacred writings as a market for slaves and in the second as famous for the severity of its servitude ‡the same line which we have already cited from homer conveys to us the same ideas it points it out as a market for the human species and by the epithet of bitter ægypt †which epithet is peculiarly annexed to it on this occasion alludes in the strongest manner to that severity and rigour of which the sacred historian transmitted us the first account but to return though ægypt was the first market recorded for this species of traffick and though ægypt and cyprus afterwards were particularly distinguished for it in the times of the trojan war yet they were not the only places even at that period where men were bought and sold the odyssey of homer shews that it was then practised in many of the islands of the    ægœan sea and the iliad that it had taken place among those grecians on the continent of europe who had embarked from thence on the trojan expedition this appears particularly at the end of the seventh book a fleet is described there as having just arrived from lemnos with a supply of wine for the grecian camp the merchants are described also as immediately exposing it to sale and as receiving in exchange among other articles of barter a number of slaves it will now be sufficient to observe that as other states arose and as circumstances contributed to make them known this custom is discovered to have existed among them that it travelled over all asia that it spread through the grecian and roman world was in use among the barbarous nations which overturned the roman empire and was practised therefore at the same period throughout all europe chap vii this slavery and commerce which had continued for so long a time and which was    thus practised in europe at so late a period as that which succeeded the grand revolutions in the western world began as the northern nations were settled in their conquests to decline and on their full establishment were abolished a difference of opinion has arisen respecting the cause of their abolition some having asserted that they were the necessary consequences of the feudal system while others superiour both in number and in argument have maintained that they were the natural effects of christianity the mode of argument which the former adopt on this occasion is as follows the multitude of little states which sprang up from one great one at this æra occasioned infinite bickerings and matter for contention there was not a state or seignory which did not want all the hands they could muster either to defend their own right or to dispute that of their neighbours thus every man was taken into the service whom they armed they must trust and there could be no trust but in free men    thus the barrier between the two natures was thrown down and slavery was no more heard of in the west that this was not the necessary consequence of such a situation is apparent the political state of greece in its early history was the same as that of europe when divided by the feudal system into an infinite number of small and independent kingdoms there was the same matter therefore for contention and the same call for all the hands that could be mustered the grecians in short in the heroick were in the same situation in these respects as the feudal barons in the gothick times had this therefore been a necessary effect there had been a cessation of servitude in greece in those ages in which we have already shewn that it existed but with respect to christianity many and great are the arguments that it occasioned so desirable an event it taught that all men were originally equal that the deity was no respecter of persons and that as all men were to give an account of their actions hereafter it was necessary    that they should be free these doctrines could not fail of having their proper influence on those who first embraced christianity from a conviction of its truth and on those of their descendants afterwards who by engaging in the crusades and hazarding their lives and fortunes there shewed at least an attachment to that religion we find them accordingly actuated by these principles we have a positive proof that the feudal system had no share in the honour of suppressing slavery but that christianity was the only cause for the greatest part of the charters which were granted for the freedom of slaves in those times many of which are still extant were granted pro amore dei pro mercede animæ they were founded in short on religious considerations that they might procure the favour of the deity which they conceived themselves to have forfeited by the subjugation of those whom they found to be the objects of the divine benevolence and attention equally with themselves these considerations which had thus their first origin in christianity began to  0 produce their effects as the different nations were converted and procured that general liberty at last which at the close of the twelfth century was conspicuous in the west of europe what a glorious and important change those who would have had otherwise no hopes but that their miseries would be terminated by death were then freed from their servile condition those who by the laws of war would have had otherwise an immediate prospect of servitude from the hands of their imperious conquerors were then exchanged a custom which has happily descended to the present day thus a numerous class of men who formerly had no political existence and were employed merely as instruments of labour became useful citizens and contributed towards augmenting the force or riches of the society which adopted them as members and thus did the greater part of the europeans by their conduct on this occasion assert not only liberty for themselves but for their fellowcreatures also    chap viii but if men therefore at a time when under the influence of religion they exercised their serious thoughts abolished slavery how impious must they appear who revived it and what arguments will not present themselves against their conduct the portugueze within two centuries after its suppression in europe in imitation of those piracies which we have shewn to have existed in the uncivilized ages of the world made their descents on africa and committing depredations on the coast‡    first carried the wretched inhabitants into slavery this practice however trifling and partial it might appear at first soon became serious and general a melancholy instance of the depravity of human nature as it shews that neither the laws nor religion of any country however excellent the forms of each are sufficient to bind the consciences of some but that there are always men of every age country and persuasion who are ready to sacrifice their dearest principles at the shrine of gain our own ancestors together with the spaniards french and most of the maritime powers of europe soon followed the piratical example and thus did the europeans to their eternal infamy renew a custom which their own ancestors had so lately exploded from a conscientiousness of its impiety    the unfortunate africans terrified at these repeated depredations fled in confusion from the coast and sought in the interiour parts of the country a retreat from the persecution of their invaders but alas they were miserably disappointed there are few retreats that can escape the penetrating eye of avarice the europeans still pursued them they entered their rivers sailed up into the heart of the country surprized the unfortunate africans again and carried them into slavery but this conduct though successful at first defeated afterwards its own ends it created a more general alarm and pointed out at the same instant the best method of security from future depredations the banks of the rivers were accordingly deserted as the coasts had been before and thus were the christian invaders left without a prospect of their prey in this situation however expedients were not wanting they now formed to themselves the resolution of settling in the country    of securing themselves by fortified posts of changing their system of force into that of pretended liberality and of opening by every species of bribery and corruption a communication with the natives these plans were put into immediate execution the europeans erected their forts landed their merchandize and endeavoured by a peaceable deportment by presents and by every appearance of munificence to seduce the attachment and confidence of the africans these schemes had the desired effect the gaudy trappings of european art not only caught their attention but excited their curiosity they dazzled the eyes and bewitched the senses not only of those to whom they were given but of those to whom they were shewn thus followed a speedy intercourse with each other and a confidence highly favourable to the views of avarice or ambition it was now time for the europeans to embrace the opportunity which this intercourse    had thus afforded them of carrying their schemes into execution and of fixing them on such a permanent foundation as should secure them future success they had already discovered in the different interviews obtained the chiefs of the african tribes they paid their court therefore to these and so compleatly intoxicated their senses with the luxuries which they brought from home as to be able to seduce them to their designs a treaty of peace and commerce was immediately concluded it was agreed that the kings on their part should from this period sentence prisoners of war and convicts to european servitude and that the europeans should supply them in return with the luxuries of the north this agreement immediately took place and thus begun that commerce which makes so considerable a figure at the present day but happy had the africans been if those only who had been justly convicted of crimes or taken in a just war had been sentenced to the severities of servitude how many of those miseries which afterwards    attended them had been never known and how would their history have saved those sighs and emotions of pity which must now ever accompany its perusal the europeans on the establishment of their western colonies required a greater number of slaves than a strict adherence to the treaty could produce the princes therefore had only the choice of relinquishing the commerce or of consenting to become unjust they had long experienced the emoluments of the trade they had acquired a taste for the luxuries it afforded and they now beheld an opportunity of gratifying it but in a more extensive manner avarice therefore which was too powerful for justice on this occasion immediately turned the scale not only those who were fairly convicted of offences were now sentenced to servitude but even those who were suspected new crimes were invented that new punishments might succeed thus was every appearance soon construed into reality every shadow into a substance and often virtue into a crime such also was the case with respect to prisoners of war not only those were now    delivered into slavery who were taken in a state of publick enmity and injustice but those also who conscious of no injury whatever were taken in the arbitrary skirmishes of these venal sovereigns war was now made not as formerly from the motives of retaliation and defence but for the sake of obtaining prisoners alone and the advantages resulting from their sale if a ship from europe came but into sight it was now considered as a sufficient motive for a war and as a signal only for an instantaneous commencement of hostilities but if the african kings could be capable of such injustice what vices are there that their consciences would restrain or what enormities that we might not expect to be committed when men once consent to be unjust they lose at the same instant with their virtue a considerable portion of that sense of shame which till then had been found a successful protector against the sallies of vice from that awful period almost every expectation is forlorn the heart is left unguarded its great protector is no more the vices therefore which so long    encompassed it in vain obtain an easy victory in crouds they pour into the defenceless avenues and take possession of the soul there is nothing now too vile for them to meditate too impious to perform such was the situation of the despotick sovereigns of africa they had once ventured to pass the bounds of virtue and they soon proceeded to enormity this was particularly conspicuous in that general conduct which they uniformly observed after any unsuccesful conflict influenced only by the venal motives of european traffick they first made war upon the neighbouring tribes contrary to every principle of justice and if by the flight of the enemy or by other contingencies they were disappointed of their prey they made no hesitation of immediately turning their arms against their own subjects the first villages they came to were always marked on this occasion as the first objects of their avarice they were immediately surrounded were afterwards set on fire and the wretched inhabitants seized as they were escaping from the flames these consisting of whole families    fathers brothers husbands wives and children were instantly driven in chains to the merchants and consigned to slavery to these calamities which thus arose from the tyranny of the kings we may now subjoin those which arose from the avarice of private persons many were kidnapped by their own countrymen who encouraged by the merchants of europe previously lay in wait for them and sold them afterwards for slaves while the seamen of the different ships by every possible artifice enticed others on board and transported them to the regions of servitude as these practices are in full force at the present day it appears that there are four orders of involuntary slaves on the african continent of convicts of prisoners of war of those who are publickly seized by virtue of the authority of their prince and  0 of those who are privately kidnapped by individuals it remains only to observe on this head that in the sale and purchase of these the african commerce or slave trade consists that they are delivered to the merchants of europe in exchange for their various commodities that these transport them to their colonies in the west where their slavery takes place and that a fifth order arises there composed of all such as are born to the native africans after their transportation and slavery have commenced having thus explained as much of the history of modern servitude as is sufficient for the prosecution of our design we should have closed our account here but that a work just published has furnished us with a singular anecdote of the colonists of a neighbouring nation which we cannot but relate the learned author having described    the method which the dutch colonists at the cape make use of to take the hottentots and enslave them takes occasion in many subsequent parts of the work to mention the dreadful effects of the practice of slavery which as he justly remarks leads to all manner of misdemeanours and wickedness pregnant women says he and children in their tenderest years were not at this time neither indeed are they ever exempt from the effects of the hatred and spirit of vengeance constantly harboured by the colonists with respect to the †boshiesman nation excepting such indeed as are marked out to be carried away into bondage does a colonist at any time get sight of a boshiesman he takes fire immediately and spirits up his horse and dogs in order to hunt him with more ardour and fury than he would a wolf or any other wild beast on an open plain a few colonists on horseback are always sure to get the better of the    greatest number of boshiesmen that can be brought together as the former always keep at the distance of about an hundred or an hundred and fifty paces just as they find it convenient and charging their heavy firearms with a very large kind of shot jump off their horses and rest their pieces in their usual manner on their ramrods in order that they may shoot with the greater certainty so that the balls discharged by them will sometimes as i have been assured go through the bodies of six seven or eight of the enemy at a time especially as these latter know no better than to keep close together in a body— and not only is the capture of the hottentots considered by them merely as a party of pleasure but in cold blood they destroy the bands which nature has knit between their husbands and their wives and children c with what horrour do these passages seem to strike us what indignation do they seem to raise in our breasts when we reflect that a part of the human species are considered    as game and that parties of pleasure are made for their destruction the lion does not imbrue his claws in blood unless called upon by hunger or provoked by interruption whereas the merciless dutch more savage than the brutes themselves not only murder their fellowcreatures without any provocation or necessity but even make a diversion of their sufferings and enjoy their pain end of the first part       part ii the african commerce or slave trade chap i as we explained the history of slavery in the first part of this essay as far as it was necessary for our purpose we shall now take the question into consideration which we proposed at first as the subject of our inquiry viz how far the commerce and slavery of the human species as revived by some of the nations of europe    in the persons of the unfortunate africans and as revived in a great measure on the principles of antiquity are consistent with the laws of nature or the common notions of equity as established among men this question resolves itself into two separate parts for discussion into the african commerce as explained in the history of slavery and the subsequent slavery in the colonies as founded on the equity of the commerce the former of course will be first examined for this purpose we shall inquire into the rise nature and design of government such an inquiry will be particularly useful in the present place it will afford us that general knowledge of subordination and liberty which is necessary in the case before us and will be found as it were a source to which we may frequently refer for many and valuable arguments it appears that mankind were originally free and that they possessed an equal right to the soil and produce of the earth for proof of this we need only appeal to the divine writings to the golden age of the    poets which like other fables of the times had its origin in truth and to the institution of the saturnalia and of other similar festivals all of which are so many monuments of this original equality of men hence then there was no rank no distinction no superiour every man wandered where he chose changing his residence as a spot attracted his fancy or suited his convenience uncontrouled by his neighbour unconnected with any but his family hence also as every thing was common he collected what he chose without injury and enjoyed without injury what he had collected such was the first situation of mankind a state of dissociation and independence in this dissociated state it is impossible that men could have long continued the dangers to which they must have frequently been exposed by the attacks of fierce and rapacious beasts by the prœdatory attempts of their own species and by the disputes    of contiguous and independent families these together with their inability to defend themselves on many such occasions must have incited them to unite hence then was society formed on the grand principles of preservation and defence and as these principles began to operate in the different parts of the earth where the different families had roamed a great number of these societies began to be formed and established which taking to themselves particular names from particular occurrences began to be perfectly distinct from one another as the individuals of whom these societies were composed had associated only for their defence so they experienced at first no change in their condition they were still independent and free they were still without discipline or laws they had every thing still in common they pursued the same manner of life wandering only in herds as the earth gave them or refused them sustenance and doing as a publick body what they had been accustomed to do as individuals before this was the exact situation    of the getæ and scythians of the †lybians and gœtulians of the ‡italian aborigines and of the ∥huns and alans they had left their original state of dissociation and had stepped into that which has been just described thus was the second situation of men a state of independent society having thus joined themselves together and having formed themselves into several large and distinct bodies they could not fail of submitting soon to a more considerable change their numbers must have rapidly increased and their societies in process of time have become so populous as frequently to have experienced the want of subsistence and many of the commotions and tumults of intestine strife for these inconveniences however there were remedies to be found agriculture would furnish them with that subsistence and support which the earth from the rapid increase of its inhabitants had become unable spontaneously  0 to produce an assignation of property would not only enforce an application but excite an emulation to labour and government would at once afford a security to the acquisitions of the industrious and heal the intestine disorders of the community by the introduction of laws such then were the remedies that were gradually applied the societies which had hitherto seen their members undistinguished either by authority or rank admitted now of magistratical preeminence they were divided into tribes to every tribe was allotted a particular district for its support and to every individual his particular spot the germans who consisted of many and various nations were exactly in this situation they had advanced a step beyond the scythians gœtulians and those whom we described before and thus was the third situation of mankind a state of subordinate society    chap ii as we have thus traced the situation of man from unbounded liberty to subordination it will be proper to carry our inquiries farther and to consider who first obtained the preeminence in these primœval societies and by what particular methods it was obtained there were only two ways by which such an event could have been produced by compulsion or consent when mankind first saw the necessity of government it is probable that many had conceived the desire of ruling to be placed in a new situation to be taken from the common herd to be the first distinguished among men were thoughts that must have had their charms let us suppose then that these thoughts had worked so unusually on the passions of any particular individual as to have driven him to the extravagant design of obtaining the preeminence by force how could his design have been accomplished how could he forcibly have usurped the jurisdiction at a    time when all being equally free there was not a single person whose assistance he could command add to this that in a state of universal liberty force had been repaid by force and the attempt had been fatal to the usurper as empire then could never have been gained at first by compulsion so it could only have been obtained by consent and as men were then going to make an important sacrifice for the sake of their mutual happiness so he alone could have obtained it not whose ambition had greatly distinguished him from the rest but in whose wisdom justice prudence and virtue the whole community could confide to confirm this reasoning we shall appeal as before to facts and shall consult therefore the history of those nations which having just left their former state of independent society were the very people that established subordination and government the commentaries of cæsar afford us the following accounts of the ancient gauls when any of their kings either by death or deposition made a vacancy in the regal    office the whole nation was immediately convened for the appointment of a successor in these national conventions were the regal offices conferred every individual had a voice on the occasion and every individual was free the person upon whom the general approbation appeared to fall was immediately advanced to preeminence in the state he was uniformly one whose actions had made him eminent whose conduct had gained him previous applause whose valour the very assembly that elected him had themselves witnessed in the field whose prudence wisdom and justice having rendered him signally serviceable had endeared him to his tribe for this reason their kingdoms were not hereditary the son did not always inherit the virtues of the sire and they were determined that he alone should possess authority in whose virtues they could confide nor was this all so sensible were they of the important sacrifice they had made so extremely jealous even of the name of superiority and power that they limited by a variety of laws the authority of the very person whom they    had just elected from a confidence of his integrity ambiorix himself confessing that his people had as much power over him as he could possibly have over his people the same custom as appears from tacitus prevailed also among the germans they had their national councils like the gauls in which the regal and ducal offices were confirmed according to the majority of voices they elected also on these occasions those only whom their virtue by repeated trial had unequivocally distinguished from the rest and they limited their authority so far as neither to leave them the power of inflicting imprisonment or stripes nor of exercising any penal jurisdiction but as punishment was necessary in a state of civil society it was permitted to the priests alone that it might appear to have been inflicted by the order of the gods and not by any superiour authority in man the accounts which we have thus given of the ancient germans and gauls will be found also to be equally true of those people    which had arrived at the same state of subordinate society we might appeal for a testimony of this to the history of the goths to the history of the franks and saxons to the history in short of all those nations from which the different governments now conspicuous in europe have undeniably sprung and we might appeal as a farther proof to the americans who are represented by many of the moderns from their own ocular testimony as observing the same customs at the present day it remains only to observe that as these customs prevailed among the different nations described in their early state of subordinate society and as they were moreover the customs of their respective ancestors it appears that they must have been handed down both by tradition and use from the first introduction of government chap iii we may now deduce those general maxims concerning subordination and liberty    which we mentioned to have been essentially connected with the subject and which some from speculation only and without any allusion to facts have been bold enough to deny it appears first that liberty is a natural and government an adventitious right because all men were originally free it appears secondly that government is a contract because in these primœval subordinate    societies we have seen it voluntarily conferred on the one hand and accepted on the other we have seen it subject to various restrictions we have seen its articles which could then only be written by tradition and use as perfect and binding as those which are now committed to letters we have seen it in short partaking of the fæderal nature as much as it could in a state which wanted the means of recording its transactions    it appears thirdly that the grand object of the contract is the happiness of the people because they gave the supremacy to him alone who had been conspicuous for the splendour of his abilities or the integrity of his life that the power of the multitude being directed by the wisdom and justice of the prince they might experience the most effectual protection from injury the highest advantages of society the greatest possible happiness chap iv having now collected the materials that are necessary for the prosecution of our design we shall immediately enter upon the discussion if any man had originally been endued with power as with other faculties so that the rest of mankind had discovered in themselves an innate necessity of obeying this particular person it is evident that he and his descendants from the superiority of their nature would have had a claim upon men for obedience and a natural right to command but as the right to empire is adventitious as all were originally free as    nature made every mans body and mind his own it is evident that no just man can be consigned to slavery without his own consent neither can men by the same principles be considered as lands goods or houses among possessions it is necessary that all property should be inferiour to its possessor but how does the slave differ from his master but by chance for though the mark with which the latter is pleased to brand him shews at the first sight the difference of their fortune what mark can be found in his nature that can warrant a distinction to this consideration we shall add the following that if men can justly become the property of each other their children like the offspring of cattle must inherit their paternal lot now as the actions of the father and the child must be thus at the sole disposal of their common master it is evident that the authority of the one as a parent and the duty of the other as a child must be instantly annihilated rights and obligations which as they are founded in nature are implanted in our feelings and  0 are established by the voice of god must contain in their annihilation a solid argument to prove that there cannot be any property whatever in the human species we may consider also as a farther confirmation that it is impossible in the nature of things that liberty can be bought or sold it is neither saleable nor purchasable for if any one man can have an absolute property in the liberty of another or in other words if he who is called a master can have a just right to command the actions of him who is called a slave it is evident that the latter cannot be accountable for those crimes which the former may order him to commit now as every reasonable being is accountable for his actions it is evident that such a right cannot justly exist and that human liberty of course is beyond the possibility either of sale or purchase add to this that whenever you sell the liberty of a man you have the power only of alluding to the body the mind cannot be confined or bound it will be free though its mansion be beset with chains but if in every sale of the human species you are under the necessity of considering    your slave in this abstracted light of alluding only to the body and of making no allusion to the mind you are under the necessity also of treating him in the same moment as a brute and of abusing therefore that nature which cannot otherwise be considered than in the double capacity of soul and body but some person perhaps will make an objection to one of the former arguments if men from the superiority of their nature cannot be considered like lands goods or houses among possessions so neither can cattle for being endued with life motion and sensibility they are evidently superiour to these but this objection will receive its answer from those observations which have been already made and will discover the true reason why cattle are justly to be estimated as property for first the right to empire over brutes is natural and not adventitious like the right to empire over men there are secondly many and evident signs of the inferiority of their nature and thirdly their liberty can be bought and sold because being void of reason they cannot be accountable for their actions    we might stop here for a considerable time and deduce many valuable lessons from the remarks that have been made but that such a circumstance might be considered as a digression there is one however which as it is so intimately connected with the subject we cannot but deduce we are taught to treat men in a different manner from brutes because they are so manifestly superiour in their nature we are taught to treat brutes in a different manner from stones for the same reason and thus by giving to every created thing its due respect to answer the views of providence which did not create a variety of natures without a purpose or design but if these things are so how evidently against reason nature and every thing human and divine must they act who not only force men into slavery against their own consent but treat them altogether as brutes and make the natural liberty of man an article of publick commerce and by what arguments can they possibly defend that commerce which cannot be carried on in any single instance without a flagrant violation of the laws of nature and of god    chap v that we may the more accurately examine the arguments that are advanced on this occasion it will be proper to divide the commerce into two parts first as it relates to those who sell and secondly as it relates to those who purchase the human species into slavery to the former part of which having given every previous and necessary information in the history of servitude we shall immediately proceed let us inquire first by what particular right the liberties of the harmless people are invaded by the prince by the right of empire it will be answered because he possesses dominion and power by their own approbation and consent but subjects though under the dominion are not the property of the prince they cannot be considered as his possessions their natures are both the same they are both born in the same manner are subject to the same disorders must apply to the same remedies for a cure are equally partakers of the    grave an incidental distinction accompanies them through life and this—is all we may add to this that though the prince possesses dominion and power by the consent and approbation of his subjects he possesses it only for the most salutary ends he may tyrannize if he can he may alter the form of his government he cannot however alter its nature and end these will be immutably the same though the whole system of its administration should be changed and he will be still bound to defend the lives and properties of his subjects and to make them happy does he defend those therefore whom he invades at discretion with the sword does he protect the property of those whose houses and effects he consigns at discretion to the flames does he make those happy whom he seizes as they are trying to escape the general devastation and compels with their wives and families to a wretched servitude he acts surely as if the use of empire consisted in violence and oppression as if he that was most exalted ought of necessity to be most unjust here then the voice of nature and justice is against    him he breaks that law of nature which ordains that no just man shall be given into slavery against his own consent he violates the first law of justice as established among men that no person shall do harm to another without a previous and sufficient provocation and he violates also the sacred condition of empire made with his ancestors and necessarily understood in every species of government that the power of the multitude being given up to the wisdom and justice of the prince they may experience in return the most effectual protection from injury the highest advantages of society the greatest possible happiness but if kings then to whom their own people have granted dominion and power are unable to invade the liberties of their harmless subjects without the highest injustice how can those private persons be justified who treacherously lie in wait for their fellowcreatures and sell them into slavery what arguments can they possibly bring in in their defence what treaty of empire can they produce by which their innocent victims    ever resigned to them the least portion of their liberty in vain will they plead the antiquity of the custom in vain will the honourable light in which piracy was considered in the ages of barbarism afford them an excuse impious and abandoned men ye invade the liberties of those who with respect to your impious selves are in a state of nature in a state of original dissociation perfectly independent perfectly free it appears then that the two orders of flaves which have been mentioned in the history of the african servitude of those who are publickly seized by virtue of the authority of their prince and of those who are privately kidnapped by individuals are collected by means of violence and oppression by means repugnant to nature the principles of government and the common notions of equity as established among men chap vi we come now to the third order of involuntary slaves to convicts the only    argument that the sellers advance here is this that they have been found guilty of offences and that the punishment is just but before the equity of the sentence can be allowed two questions must be decided whether the punishment is proportioned to the offence and what is its particular object and end to decide the first we may previously observe that the african servitude comprehends banishment a deprivation of liberty and many corporal sufferings on banishment the following observations will suffice mankind have their local attachments they have a particular regard for the spot in which they were born and nurtured here it was that they first drew their infantbreath here that they were cherished and supported here that they passed those scenes of childhood which free from care and anxiety are the happiest in the life of man scenes which accompany them through life which throw themselves frequently into their thoughts and produce the most agreeable sensations these then are weighty considerations and how great    this regard is may be evidenced from our own feelings from the testimony of some who when remote from their country and in the hour of danger and distress have found their thoughts unusually directed by some impulse or other to their native spot and from the example of others who having braved the storms and adversities of life either repair to it for the remainder of their days or desire even to be conveyed to it when existence is no more but separately from these their local they have also their personal attachments their regard for particular men there are ties of blood there are ties of friendship in the former case they must of necessity be attached the constitution of their nature demands it in the latter it is impossible to be otherwise since friendship is founded on an harmony of temper on a concordance of sentiments and manners on habits of confidence and a mutual exchange of favours we may now mention as perfectly distinct both from their local and personal the national attachments of mankind their    regard for the whole body of the people among whom they were born and educated this regard is particularly conspicuous in the conduct of such as being thus nationally connected reside in foreign parts how anxiously do they meet together how much do they enjoy the sight of others of their countrymen whom fortune places in their way what an eagerness do they shew to serve them though not born on the same particular spot though not connected by consanguinity or friendship though unknown to them before neither is this affection wonderful since they are creatures of the same education of the same principles of the same manners and habits cast as it were in the same mould and marked with the same impression if men therefore are thus separately attached to the several objects described it is evident that a separate exclusion from either must afford them considerable pain what then must be their sufferings to be forced for ever from their country which includes them all which contains the spot in which they were born and nurtured which contains  0 their relations and friends which contains the whole body of the people among whom they were bred and educated in these sufferings which arise to men both in bidding and in having bid adieu to all that they esteem as dear and valuable banishment consists in part and we may agree therefore with the ancients without adding other melancholy circumstances to the account that it is no inconsiderable punishment of itself with respect to the loss of liberty which is the second consideration in the punishment it is evident that men bear nothing worse that there is nothing that they lay more at heart and that they have shewn by many and memorable instances that even death is to be preferred how many could be named here who having suffered the loss of liberty have put a period to their existence how many that have willingly undergone the hazard of their lives to destroy a tyrant how many that have even gloried to perish in the attempt how many bloody and publick wars have been undertaken not to mention the numerous servile    insurrections with which history is stained for the cause of freedom but if nothing is dearer than liberty to men with which the barren rock is able to afford its joys and without which the glorious sun shines upon them but in vain and all the sweets and delicacies of life are tasteless and unenjoyed what punishment can be more severe than the loss of so great a blessing but if to this deprivation of liberty we add the agonizing pangs of banishment and if to the complicated stings of both we add the incessant stripes wounds and miseries which are undergone by those who are sold into this horrid servitude what crime can we possibly imagine to be so enormous as to be worthy of so great a punishment how contrary then to reason justice and nature must those act who apply this the severest of human punishments to the most insignificant offence yet such is the custom with the africans for from the time in which the europeans first intoxicated the african princes with their foreign draughts    no crime has been committed no shadow of a crime devised that has not immediately been punished with servitude but for what purpose is the punishment applied is it applied to amend the manners of the criminal and thus render him a better subject no for if you banish him he can no longer be a subject and you can no longer therefore be solicitous for his morals add to this that if you banish him to a place where he is to experience the hardships of want and hunger so powerfully does hunger compel men to the perpetration of crimes you force him rather to corrupt than amend his manners and to be wicked when he might otherwise be just is it applied then that others may be deterred from the same proceedings and that crimes may become less frequent no but that avarice may be gratified that the prince may experience the emoluments of the sale for horrid and melancholy thought the more crimes his subjects commit the richer is he made the    more abandoned the subject the happier is the prince neither can we allow that the punishment thus applied tends in any degree to answer the publick happiness for if men can be sentenced to slavery right or wrong if shadows can be turned into substances and virtues into crimes it is evident that none can be happy because none can be secure but if the punishment is infinitely greater than the offence which has been shewn before and if it is inflicted neither to amend the criminal nor to deter others from the same proceedings nor to advance in any degree the happiness of the publick it is scarce necessary to observe that it is totally unjust since it is repugnant to reason the dictates of nature and the very principles of government chap vii we come now to the fourth and last order of slaves to prisoners of war as the sellers lay a particular stress on this order of men and infer much from its antiquity in support    of the justice of their cause we shall examine the principle on which it subsisted among the ancients but as this principle was the same among all nations and as a citation from many of their histories would not be less tedious than unnecessary we shall select the example of the romans for the consideration of the case the law by which prisoners of war were said to be sentenced to servitude was the law of nations it was so called from the universal concurrence of nations in the custom it had two points in view the persons of the captured and their effects both of which it immediately sentenced without any of the usual forms of law to be the property of the captors the principle on which the law was established was the right of capture when any of the contending parties had overcome their opponents and were about to destroy them the right was considered to commence a right which the victors conceived themselves to have to recall their swords    and from the consideration of having saved the lives of the vanquished when they could have taken them by the laws of war to commute blood for service hence the roman lawyer pomponius deduces the etymology of slave in the roman language they were called servi says he from the following circumstance it was usual with our commanders to take them prisoners and sell them now this circumstance implies that they must have been previously preserved and hence the name such then was the right of capture it was a right which the circumstance of taking the vanquished that is of preserving them alive gave the conquerors to their persons by this right as always including the idea of a previous preservation from death† the vanquished were said to be slaves and as all slaves says justinian are themselves in the power of others and of course can have nothing of their own    so their effects followed the condition of their persons and became the property of the captors to examine this right by which the vanquished were said to be slaves we shall use the words of a celebrated roman author and apply them to the present case if it is lawful says he to deprive a man of his life it is certainly not inconsistent with nature to rob him to rob him of his liberty we admit the conclusion to be just if the supposition be the same we allow if men have a right to commit that which is considered as a greater crime that they have a right at the same instant to commit that which is considered as a less but what shall we say to the hypothesis we deny it to be true the voice of nature is against it it is not lawful to kill but on necessity had there been a necessity where had the wretched captive survived to be broken with chains and servitude the very act of saving his life is an argument to prove that no such necessity existed the conclusion    is therefore false the captors had no right to the lives of the captured and of course none to their liberty they had no right to their blood and of course none to their service their right therefore had no foundation in justice it was founded on a principle contrary to the law of nature and of course contrary to that law which people under different governments are bound to observe to one another it is scarce necessary to observe as a farther testimony of the injustice of the measure that the europeans after the introduction of christianity exploded this principle of the ancients as frivolous and false that they spared the lives of the vanquished not from the sordid motives of avarice but from a conscientiousness that homicide could only be justified by necessity that they introduced an exchange of prisoners and by many and wise regulations deprived war of many of its former horrours but the advocates for slavery unable to defend themselves against these arguments have fled to other resources and ignorant of history have denied that the right of capture    was the true principle on which slavery subsisted among the ancients they reason thus the learned grotius and others have considered slavery as the just consequence of a private war supposing the war to be just and the opponents in a state of nature upon the principles of reparation and punishment now as the law of nature which is the rule of conduct to individuals in such a situation is applicable to members of a different community there is reason to presume that these principles were applied by the ancients to their prisoners of war that their effects were confiscated by the right of reparation and their persons by the right of punishment— but such a presumption is false the right of capture was the only argument that the ancients adduced in their defence hence polybius what must they the mantinenses suffer to receive the punishment they deserve perhaps it will be said that they must be sold when they are taken with their wives and children into slavery but this is not to be considered as a punishment since even those suffer it by the    laws of war who have done nothing that is base the truth is that both the offending and the offended parties whenever they were victorious inflicted slavery alike but if the offending party inflicted slavery on the persons of the vanquished by what right did they inflict it it must be answered from the presumption beforementioned by the right of reparation or of punishment an answer plainly absurd and contradictory as it supposes the aggressor to have a right which the injured only could possess neither is the argument less fallacious than the presumption in applying these principles which in a publick war could belong to the publick only to the persons of the individuals that were taken this calls us again to the history of the ancients and as the rights of reparation and punishment could extend to those only who had been injured to select a particular instance for the consideration of the case as the romans had been injured without a previous provocation by the conduct of hannibal at saguntum we may take the treaty into consideration which they made  0 with the carthaginians when the latter defeated at zama sued for peace it consisted of three articles by the first the carthaginians were to be free and to enjoy their own constitution and laws by the second they were to pay a considerable sum of money as a reparation for the damages and expence of war and by the third they were to deliver up their elephants and ships of war and to be subject to various restrictions as a punishment with these terms they complied and the war was finished thus then did the romans make that distinction between private and publick war which was necessary to be made and which the argument is fallacious in not supposing the treasury of the vanquished was marked as the means of reparation and as this treasury was supplied in a great measure    by the imposition of taxes and was wholly the property of the publick so the publick made the reparation that was due the elephants also and ships of war which were marked as the means of punishment were publick property and as they were considerable instruments of security and defence to their possessors and of annoyance to an enemy so their loss added to the restrictions of the treaty operated as a great and publick punishment but with respect to the carthaginian prisoners who had been taken in the war they were retained in servitude not upon the principles of reparation and punishment because the romans had already received by their own confession in the treaty a sufficient satisfaction not upon these principles because they were inapplicable to individuals the legionary soldier in the service of the injured who took his prisoner was not the person to whom the injury had been done any more than the soldier in the service of the aggressors who was taken was the person who had committed the offence but they were retained in servitude by the right of capture because    when both parties had sent their military into the field to determine the dispute it was at the private choice of the legionary soldier beforementioned whether he would spare the life of his conquered opponent when he was thought to be entitled to take it if he had chosen by the laws of war to produce more instances as an illustration of the subject or to go farther into the argument would be to trespass upon the patience as well as understanding of the reader in a state of nature where a man is supposed to commit an injury and to be unconnected with the rest of the world the act is private and the right which the injured acquires can extend only to himself but in a state of society where any member or members of a particular community give offence to those of another and they are patronized by the state to which they belong the case is altered the act becomes immediately publick and the publick alone are to experience the consequences of their injustice for as no particular member of the community if considered as an individual is guilty except the person by whom the injury was done    it would be contrary to reason and justice to apply the principles of reparation and punishment which belong to the people as a collective body to any individual of the community who should happen to be taken now as the principles of reparation and punishment are thus inapplicable to the prisoners taken in a publick war and as the right of capture as we have shewn before is insufficient to intitle the victors to the service of the vanquished it is evident that slavery cannot justly exist at all since there are no other maxims on which it can be founded even in the most equitable wars but if these things are so if slavery cannot be defended even in the most equitable wars what arguments will not be found against that servitude which arises from those that are unjust which arises from those african wars that relate to the present subject the african princes corrupted by the merchants of europe seek every opportunity of quarrelling with one another every spark is blown into a flame and war is undertaken from no other consideration than that of procuring slaves while the europeans    on the other hand happy in the quarrels which they have thus excited supply them with arms and ammunition for the accomplishment of their horrid purpose thus has africa for the space of two hundred years been the scene of the most iniquitous and bloody wars and thus have many thousands of men in the most iniquitous manner been sent into servitude chap viii we shall beg leave before we proceed to the arguments of the purchasers to add the following observations to the substance of the three preceding chapters as the two orders of men of those who are privately kidnapped by individuals and of those who are publickly seized by virtue of the authority of their prince compose together at least nine tenths of the african    slaves they cannot contain upon a moderate computation less than ninety thousand men annually transported an immense number but easily to be credited when we reflect that thousands are employed for the purpose of stealing the unwary and that these diabolical practices are in force so far    has european injustice been spread at the distance of a thousand miles from the factories on the coast the slave merchants among whom a quantity of european goods is previously divided travel into the heart of the country to this amazing distance some of them attend the various markets that are established through so large an extent of territory to purchase the kidnapped people whom the slavehunters are continually bringing in while the rest subdividing their merchandize among the petty sovereigns with whom they deal receive by an immediate exertion of fraud and violence the stipulated number now will any man assert in opposition to the arguments before advanced that out of this immense body of men thus annually collected and transported there is even one over whom the original or subsequent seller can have any power or right whoever asserts this in the first instance must contradict his own feelings and must consider himself as a just object of prey whenever any daring invader shall think it proper to attack him and in the second    instance the very idea which the african princes entertain of their villages as parks or reservoirs stocked only for their own convenience and of their subjects as wild beasts whom they may pursue and take at pleasure is so shocking that it need only be mentioned to be instantly reprobated by the reader the order of slaves which is next to the former in respect to the number of people whom it contains is that of prisoners of war this order if the former statement be true is more inconsiderable than is generally imagined but whoever reflects on the prodigious slaughter that is constantly made in every african skirmish cannot be otherwise than of this opinion he will find that where ten are taken he has every reason to presume that an hundred perish in some of these skirmishes though they have been begun for the express purpose of procuring slaves the conquerors have suffered but few of the vanquished to escape the fury of the sword and there have not been wanting instances where they have been so incensed at the resistance they have found that their    spirit of vengeance has entirely got the better of their avarice and they have murdered in cool blood every individual without discrimination either of age or sex the following is an account of one of these skirmishes as described by a person who was witness to the scene i was sent with several others in a small sloop up the river niger to purchase slaves we had some free negroes with us in the practice and as the vessels are liable to frequent attacks from the negroes on one side of the river or the moors on the other they are all armed as we rode at anchor a long way up the river we observed a large number of negroes in    huts by the rivers side and for our own safety kept a wary eye on them early next morning we saw from our masthead a numerous body approaching with apparently but little order but in close array they approached very fast and fell furiously on the inhabitants of the town who seemed to be quite surprized but nevertheless as soon as they could get together fought stoutly they had some firearms but made very little use of them as they came directly to close fighting with their spears lances and sabres many of the invaders were mounted on small horses and both parties fought for about half an hour with the fiercest animosity exerting much more courage and perseverance than i had ever before been witness to amongst them the women and children of the town clustered together to the waters edge running shrieking up and down with terrour waiting the event of the combat till their party gave way and took to the water to endeavour to swim over to the barbary side they were closely pursued  00 even into the river by the victors who though they came for the purpose of getting slaves gave no quarter their cruelty even prevailing over their avarice they made no prisoners but put all to the sword without mercy horrible indeed was the carnage of the vanquished on this occasion and as we were within two or three hundred yards of them their cries and shrieks affected us extremely we had got up our anchor at the beginning of the fray and now stood close in to the spot where the victors having followed the vanquished into the water were continually dragging out and murdering those whom by reason of their wounds they easily overtook the very children whom they took in great numbers did not escape the massacre enraged at their barbarity we fired our guns loaden with grape shot and a volley of small arms among them which effectually checked their ardour and obliged them to retire to a distance from the shore from whence a few round cannon shot soon removed them into the woods  0  the whole river was black over with the heads of the fugitives who were swimming for their lives these poor wretches fearing us as much as their conquerors dived when we fired and cried most lamentably for mercy having now effectually favoured their retreat we stood backwards and forwards and took up several that were wounded and tired all whose wounds had disabled them from swimming were either butchered or drowned before we got up to them with a justice and generosity never i believe before heard of among slavers we gave those their liberty whom we had taken up setting them on shore on the barbary side among the poor residue of their companions who had survived the slaughter of the morning we shall make but two remarks on this horrid instance of african cruelty it adds first a considerable weight to the statements that have been made and confirms secondly the conclusions that were drawn in the preceding chapter for if we even allow the right of capture to be just and the  0  principles of reparation and punishment to be applicable to the individuals of a community yet would the former be unjust and the latter inapplicable in the present case every african war is a robbery and we may add to our former expression when we said that thus have many thousands of men in the most iniquitous manner been sent into servitude that we believe there are few of this order who are not as much the examples of injustice as the people that have been kidnapped and who do not additionally convey when we consider them as prisoners of war an idea of the most complicated scene of murder the order of convicts as it exists almost solely among those princes whose dominions are contiguous to the european factories is from this circumstance so inconsiderable when compared with either of the preceding that we should not have mentioned it again but that we were unwilling to omit any additional argument that occurred against it it has been shewn already that the punishment of slavery is inflicted from no other  0  motive than that of gratifying the avarice of the prince a consideration so detestable as to be sufficient of itself to prove it to be unjust and that it is so disproportionate from its nature to the offence as to afford an additional proof of its injustice we shall add now as a second argument its disproportion from its continuance and we shall derive a third from the consideration that in civil society every violation of the laws of the community is an offence against the state‡ let us suppose then an african prince disdaining for once the idea of emolument let us suppose him for once inflamed with the love of his country and resolving to punish from this principle alone that by exhibiting an example of terrour he may preserve that happiness of the publick  0  which he is bound to secure and defend by the very nature of his contract or in other words that he may answer the end of government if actuated then by this principle he should adjudge slavery to an offender as a just punishment for his offence for whose benefit must the convict labour if it be answered for the benefit of the state we allow that the punishment in whatever light it is considered will be found to be equitable but if it be answered for the benefit of any individual whom he pleases to appoint we deny it to be just the state alone is considered to have been injured and as injuries cannot possibly be transferred the state alone can justly receive the advantages of his labour but if the african prince when he thus condemns him to labour for the benefit of an unoffended individual should at the same time sentence  0  him to become his property that is if he should make the person and life of the convict at the absolute disposal of him for whom he has sentenced him to labour it is evident that in addition to his former injustice he is usurping a power which no ruler or rulers of a state can possess and which the great creator of the universe never yet gave to any order whatever of created beings that this reasoning is true and that civilized nations have considered it as such will be best testified by their practice we may appeal here to that slavery which is now adjudged to delinquents as a punishment among many of the states of europe these delinquents are sentenced to labour at the oar to work in mines and on fortifications to cut and clear rivers to make and repair roads and to perform other works of national utility they are employed in short in the publick work because as the crimes they have committed are considered to have been crimes against the publick no individual can justly receive the emoluments of their labour and they are neither sold nor  0  made capable of being transferred because no government whatsoever is invested with such a power thus then may that slavery in which only the idea of labour in included be perfectly equitable and the delinquent will always receive his punishment as a man whereas in that which additionally includes the idea of property and to undergo which the delinquent must previously change his nature and become a brute there is an inconsistency which no arguments can reconcile and a contradiction to every principle of nature which a man need only to appeal to his own feelings immediately to evince and we will venture to assert from the united observations that have been made upon the subject in opposition to any arguments that may be advanced that there is scarcely one of those who are called african convicts on whom the prince has a right to inflict a punishment at all and that there is no one whatever whom he has a power of sentencing to labour for the benefit of an unoffended individual and much less whom he has a right to fell  0  having now fully examined the arguments of the sellers and having made such additional remarks as were necessary we have only to add that we cannot sufficiently express our detestation at their conduct were the reader coolly to reflect upon the case of but one of the unfortunate men who are annually the victims of avarice and consider his situation in life as a father an husband or a friend we are sure that even on such a partial reflection he must experience considerable pain what then must be his feelings when he is told that since the slavetrade began †nine millions of men have been torn from their dearest connections and sold into slavery if at this recital his indignation should arise let him consider it as the genuine production  0  of nature that she recoiled at the horrid thought and that she applied instantly a torch to his breast to kindle his resentment and if during his indignation she should awaken the sigh of sympathy or seduce the tear of commiseration from his eye let him consider each as an additional argument against the iniquity of the sellers chap ix it remains only now to examine by what arguments those who receive or purchase their fellowcreatures into slavery defend the commerce their first plea is that they receive those with propriety who are convicted of crimes because they are delivered into their hands by their own magistrates but what is this to you receivers have the unfortunate convicts been guilty of injury to you have they broken your treaties have they plundered your ships have they carried your wives and children into slavery that you should  0  thus retaliate have they offended you even by word or gesture but if the african convicts are innocent with respect to you if you have not even the shadow of a claim upon their persons by what right do you receive them by the laws of the africans you will say by which it is positively allowed—but can laws alter the nature of vice they may give it a sanction perhaps it will still be immutably the same and though dressed in the outward habiliments of honour will still be intrinsically base but alas you do not only attempt to defend yourselves by these arguments but even dare to give your actions the appearance of lenity and assume merit from your baseness and how first ought you particularly to blush when you assert that prisoners of war are only purchased from the hands of their conquerors to deliver them from death ridiculous defence can the most credulous believe it you entice the africans to war you foment their quarrels you supply them with arms and ammunition and all—from the motives of benevolence   0 does a man set fire to an house for the purpose of rescuing the inhabitants from the flames but if they are only purchased to deliver them from death why when they are delivered into your hands as protectors do you torture them with hunger why do you kill them with fatigue why does the whip deform their bodies or the knife their limbs why do you sentence them to death to a death infinitely more excruciating than that from which you so kindly saved them what answer do you make to this for if you had not humanely preserved them from the hands of their conquerors a quick death perhaps and that in the space of a moment had freed them from their pain but on account of your favour and benevolence it is known that they have lingered years in pain and agony and have been sentenced at last to a dreadful death for the most insignificant offence neither can we allow the other argument to be true on which you found your merit that you take them from their country for their own convenience because africa     scorched with incessant heat and subject to the most violent rains and tempests is unwholesome and unfit to be inhabited preposterous men do you thus judge from your own feelings do you thus judge from your own constitution and frame but if you suppose that the africans are incapable of enduring their own climate because you cannot endure it yourselves why do you receive them into slavery why do you not measure them here by the same standard for if you are unable to bear hunger and thirst chains and imprisonment wounds and torture why do you not suppose them incapable of enduring the same treatment thus then is your argument turned against yourselves but consider the answer which the scythians gave the ægyptians when they contended about the antiquity of their original that nature when she first distinguished countries by different degrees of heat and cold tempered the bodies of animals at the same instant to endure the different situations that     as the climate of scythia was severer than that of ægypt so were the bodies of the scythians harder and as capable of enduring the severity of their atmosphere as the ægyptians the temperateness of their own but you may say perhaps that though they are capable of enduring their own climate yet their situation is frequently uncomfortable and even wretched that africa is infested with locusts and insects of various kinds that they settle in swarms upon the trees destroy the verdure consume the fruit and deprive the inhabitants of their food but the same answer may be applied as before that the same kind providence who tempered the body of the animal tempered also the body of the tree that he gave it a quality to recover the bite of the locust which he sent and to reassume in a short interval of time its former glory and that such is the case experience has shewn for the very trees that have been infested and stripped of their bloom and verdure so surprizingly quick is vegetation     appear in a few days as if an insect had been utterly unknown we may add to these observations from the testimony of those who have written the history of africa from their own inspection that no country is more luxurious in prospects none more fruitful none more rich in herds and flocks and none where the comforts of life can be gained with so little trouble but you say again as a confirmation of these your former arguments by which you would have it understood that the africans themselves are sensible of the goodness of your intentions that they do not appear to go with you against their will impudent and base assertion why then do you load them with chains why keep you your daily and nightly watches but alas as a farther though a more melancholy proof of the falsehood of your assertions how many when on board your ships have put a period to their existence how many have leaped into the sea how many have pined to death that even at the expence of their lives they might fly from your benevolence     do you call them obstinate then because they refuse your favours do you call them ungrateful because they make you this return how much rather ought you receivers to blush how much rather ought you receivers to be considered as abandoned and execrable who when you usurp the dominion over those who are as free and independent as yourselves break the first law of justice which ordains that no person shall do harm to another without a previous provocation who offend against the dictates of nature which commands that no just man shall be given or received into slavery against his own consent and who violate the very laws of the empire that you assume by consigning your subjects to misery now as a famous heathen philosopher observes from whose mouth you shall be convicted there is a considerable difference whether an injury is done during any perturbation of mind which is generally short and momentary or whether     it is done with any previous meditation and design for those crimes which proceed from any sudden commotion of the mind are less than those which are studied and prepared how great and enormous are your crimes to be considered who plan your african voyages at a time when your reason is found and your senses are awake who coolly and deliberately equip your vessels and who spend years and even lives in the traffick of human liberty but if the arguments of those who sell or deliver men into slavery as we have shewn before and of those who receive or purchase them as we have now shewn are wholly false it is evident that this commerce is not only beyond the possibility of defence but is justly to be accounted wicked and justly impious since it is contrary to the principles of law and government the dictates of reason the common maxims of equity the laws of nature the admonitions of conscience and in short the whole doctrine of natural religion         part iii the slavery of the africans in the european colonies chap i having confined ourselves wholly in the second part of this essay to the consideration of the commerce we shall now proceed to the consideration of the slavery that is founded upon it as this slavery will be conspicuous in the treatment which the unfortunate africans uniformly undergo when they are put into the hands of the receivers we shall describe the manner in which they are accustomed to be used from this period to place this in the clearest and most conspicuous point of view we shall throw a considerable part of our information on this head into the form of a narrative we shall suppose     ourselves in short on the continent of africa and relate a scene which from its agreement with unquestionable facts might not unreasonably be presumed to have been presented to our view had we been really there and first let us turn our eyes to the cloud of dust that is before us it seems to advance rapidly and accompanied with dismal shrieks and yellings to make the very air that is above it tremble as it rolls along what can possibly be the cause let us inquire of that melancholy african who seems to walk dejected near the shore whose eyes are stedfastly fixed on the approaching object and whose heart if we can judge from the appearance of his countenance must be greatly agitated alas says the unhappy african the cloud that you see approaching is a train of wretched slaves they are going to the ships behind you they are destined for the english colonies and if you will stay here but for a little time you will see them pass they were last night drawn up upon the plain which you see before you where they were branded upon the breast with an hot iron and     when they had undergone the whole of the treatment which is customary on these occasions and which i am informed that you englishmen at home use to the cattle which you buy they were returned to their prison as i have some dealings with the members of the factory which you see at a little distance though thanks to the great spirit i never dealt in the liberty of my fellow creatures i gained admittance there i learned the history of some of the unfortunate people whom i saw confined and will explain to you if my eye should catch them as they pass the real causes of their servitude scarcely were these words spoken when they came distinctly into fight they appeared to advance in a long column but in a very irregular manner there were three only in the front and these were chained together the rest that followed seemed to be chained by pairs but by pressing forward to avoid the lash of the drivers the breadth of the column began to be greatly extended and ten or more were observed abreast   0 while we were making these remarks the intelligent african thus resumed his discourse the first three whom you observe at the head of the train to be chained together are prisoners of war as soon as the ships that are behind you arrived the news was dispatched into the inland country when one of the petty kings immediately assembled his subjects and attacked a neighbouring tribe the wretched people though they were surprized made a formidable resistance as they resolved almost all of them rather to lose their lives than survive their liberty the person whom you see in the middle is the father of the two young men who are chained to him on each side his wife and two of his children were killed in the attack and his father being wounded and on account of his age incapable of servitude was left bleeding on the spot where this transaction happened with respect to those who are now passing us and are immediately behind the former i can give you no other intelligence than that some of them to     about the number of thirty were taken in the same skirmish their tribe was said to have been numerous before the attack these however are all that are left alive but with respect to the unhappy man who is now opposite to us and whom you may distinguish as he is now looking back and wringing his hands in despair i can inform you with more precision he is an unfortunate convict he lived only about five days journey from the factory he went out with his king to hunt and was one of his train but through too great an anxiety to afford his royal master diversion he roused the game from the covert rather sooner than was expected the king exasperated at this circumstance immediately sentenced him to slavery his wife and children fearing lest the tyrant should extend the punishment to themselves which is not unusual fled directly to the woods where they were all devoured the people whom you see close behind the unhappy convict form a numerous body and reach a considerable     way they speak a language which no person in this part of africa can understand and their features as you perceive are so different from those of the rest that they almost appear a distinct race of men from this circumstance i recollect them they are the subjects of a very distant prince who agreed with the slave merchants for a quantity of spirituous liquors to furnish him with a stipulated number of slaves he accordingly surrounded and set fire to one of his own villages in the night and seized these people who were unfortunately the inhabitants as they were escaping from the flames i first saw them as the merchants were driving them in about two days ago they came in a large body and were tied together at the neck with leather thongs which permitted them to walk at the distance of about a yard from one another many of them were loaden with elephants teeth which had been purchased at the same time all of them had bags made of skin upon their shoulders for as they were to travel in their way from the     great mountains through barren sands and inhospitable woods for many days together they were obliged to carry water and provisions with them notwithstanding this many of them perished some by hunger but the greatest number by fatigue as the place from whence they came is at such an amazing distance from this and the obstacles from the nature of the country so great that the journey could scarcely be completed in seven moons when this relation was finished and we had been looking stedfastly for some time on the croud that was going by we lost sight of that peculiarity of feature which we had before remarked we then discovered that the inhabitants of the depopulated village had all of them passed us and that the part of the train to which we were now opposite was a numerous body of kidnapped people here we indulged our imagination we thought we beheld in one of them a father in another an husband and in another a son each of whom was forced from his various and tender connections     and without even the opportunity of bidding them adieu while we were engaged in these and other melancholy reflections the whole body of slaves had entirely passed us we turned almost insensibly to look at them again when we discovered an unhappy man at the end of the train who could scarcely keep pace with the rest his feet seemed to have suffered much from long and constant travelling for he was limping painfully along this man resumes the african has travelled a considerable way he lived at a great distance from hence and had a large family for whom he was daily to provide as he went out one night to a neighbouring spring to procure water for his thirsty children he was kidnapped by two slave hunters who sold him in the morning to some country merchants for a bar of iron these drove him with other slaves procured almost in the same manner to the nearest market where the english merchants to whom the train that has just now passed us belongs purchased him and two others     by means of their travelling agents for a pistol his wife and children have been long waiting for his return but he is gone for ever from their sight and they must be now disconsolate as they must be certain by his delay that he has fallen into the hands of the christians and now as i have mentioned the name of christians a name by which the europeans distinguish themselves from us i could wish to be informed of the meaning which such an appellation may convey they consider themselves as men but us unfortunate africans whom they term heathens as the beasts that serve us but ah how different is the fact what is christianity but a system of murder and oppression the cries and yells of the unfortunate people who are now soon to embark for the regions of servitude have already pierced my heart have you not heard me sigh while we have been talking do you not see the tears that now trickle down my cheeks and yet these hardened christians are unable to be moved at all nay they will     scourge them amidst their groans and even smile while they are torturing them to death happy happy heathenism which can detest the vices of christianity and feel for the distresses of mankind but we reply you are totally mistaken christianity is the most perfect and lovely of moral systems it blesses even the hand of persecution itself and returns good for evil but the people against whom you so justly declaim are not christians they are infidels they are monsters they are out of the common course of nature their countrymen at home are generous and brave they support the sick the lame and the blind they fly to the succour of the distressed they have noble and stately buildings for the sole purpose of benevolence they are in short of all nations the most remarkable for humanity and justice but why then replies the honest african do they suffer this why is africa a scene of blood and desolation why     are her children wrested from her to administer to the luxuries and greatness of those whom they never offended and why are these dismal cries in vain alas we reply again can the cries and groans with which the air now trembles be heard across this extensive continent can the southern winds convey them to the ear of britain if they could reach the generous englishman at home they would pierce his heart as they have already pierced your own he would sympathize with you in your distress he would be enraged at the conduct of his countrymen and resist their tyranny— but here a shriek unusually loud accompanied with a dreadful rattling of chains interrupted the discourse the wretched africans were just about to embark they had turned their face to their country as if to take a last adieu and with arms uplifted to the sky were making the very atmosphere resound with their prayers and imprecations     chap ii the foregoing scene though it may be said to be imaginary is strictly consistent with fact it is a scene to which the reader himself may have been witness if he has ever visited the place where it is supposed to lie as no circumstance whatever has been inserted in it for which the fullest and most undeniable evidence cannot be produced we shall proceed now to describe in general terms the treatment which the wretched africans undergo from the time of their embarkation when the african slaves who are collected from various quarters for the purposes of sale are delivered over to the receivers they are conducted in the manner above described to the ships their situation on board is beyond all description for here they are crouded hundreds of them together into such a small compass as would scarcely be thought sufficient to accommodate twenty if considered as free men this confinement soon produces an effect that     may be easily imagined it generates a pestilential air which cooperating with bad provisions occasions such a sickness and mortality among them that not less than twenty thousand are generally taken off in every yearly transportation thus confined in a pestilential prison and almost entirely excluded from the chearful face of day it remains for the sickly survivors to linger out a miserable existence till the voyage is finished but are no farther evils to be expected in the interim particularly if we add to their already wretched situation the indignities that are daily offered them and the regret which they must constantly feel at being for ever forced from their connexions these evils are but too apparent some of them have resolved and notwithstanding the threats   0 of the receivers have carried their resolves into execution to starve themselves to death others when they have been brought upon deck for air if the least opportunity has offered have leaped into the sea and terminated their miseries at once others in a fit of despair have attempted to rise and regain their liberty but here what a scene of barbarity has constantly ensued some of them have been instantly killed upon the spot some have been taken from the hold have been bruised and mutilated in the most barbarous and shocking manner and have been returned bleeding to their companions as a sad example of resistance while others tied to the ropes of the ship and mangled alternately with the whip and knife have been left in that horrid situation till they have expired but this is not the only inhuman treatment which they are frequently obliged to undergo for if there should be any necessity from tempestuous weather for lightening the ship or if it should be presumed on the voyage that the provisions will fall short before the port can be made they     are many of them thrown into the sea without any compunction of mind on the part of the receivers and without any other regret for their loss than that which avarice inspires wretched survivors what must be their feelings at such a sight how must they tremble to think of that servitude which is approaching when the very dogs of the receivers have been retained on board and preferred to their unoffending countrymen but indeed so lightly are these unhappy people esteemed that their lives have been even taken away upon speculation there has been an instance within the last five years of one hundred and thirty two of     them being thrown into the sea because it was supposed that by this trick their value could be recovered from the insurers but if the ship should arrive safe at its destined port a circumstance which does not always happen for some have been blown up and many lost the wretched africans do not find an alleviation of their sorrow here they are again exposed to sale here they are again subjected to the inspection of other brutal receivers who examine and treat them with an inhumanity at which even avarice should blush to this mortifying circumstance is added another that they are picked out as the purchaser pleases without any consideration whether the wife is separated from her husband or the mother from her son and if these cruel instances of separation should happen if relations when they find themselves about to be parted should cling together or if filial conjugal or parental affection should detain them but a moment longer in each others arms than these second receivers should think sufficient the lash instantly severs them from their embraces     we cannot close our account of the treatment which the wretched africans undergo while in the hands of the first receivers without mentioning an instance of wanton barbarity which happened some time ago particularly as it may be inserted with propriety in the present place and may give the reader a better idea of the cruelties to which they are continually exposed than any that he may have yet conceived to avoid making a mistake we shall take the liberty that has been allowed us and transcribe it from a little manuscript account with which we have been favoured by a person of the strictest integrity and who was at that time in the place where the transaction happened not long after says he continuing his account     the perpetrator of a cruel murder committed in open day light in the most publick part of a town which was the seat of government escaped every other notice than the curses of a few of the more humane witnesses of his barbarity an officer of a guinea ship who had the care of a number of new slaves and was returning from the saleyard to the vessel with such as remained unsold observed a stout fellow among them rather slow in his motions which he therefore quickened with his rattan the slave soon afterwards fell down and was raised by the same application moving forwards a few yards he fell down again and this being taken as a proof of his sullen perverse spirit the enraged officer furiously repeated his blows till he expired at his feet the brute coolly ordered some of the surviving slaves to carry the dead body to the waters side where without any ceremony or delay being thrown into the sea the tragedy was supposed to have been immediately finished by the not more inhuman sharks with which the harbour     then abounded these voracious fish were supposed to have followed the vessels from the coast of africa in which ten thousand slaves were imported in that one season being allured by the stench and daily fed by the dead carcasses thrown overboard on the voyage if the reader should observe here that cattle are better protected in this country than slaves in the colonies his observation will be just the beast which is driven to market is defended by law from the goad of the driver whereas the wretched african though an human being and whose feelings receive of course a double poignancy from the power of reflection is unnoticed in this respect in the colonial code and may be goaded and beaten till he expires we may now take our leave of the first receivers their crime has been already estimated and to reason farther upon it would be unnecessary for where the conduct of men is so manifestly impious there can be no need either of a single argument or a reflection as every reader of sensibility will anticipate them in his own feelings     chap iii when the wretched africans are thus put into the hands of the second receivers they are conveyed to the plantations where they are totally considered as cattle or beasts of labour their very children if any should be born to them in that situation being previously destined to the condition of their parents but here a question arises which will interrupt the thread of the narration for a little time viz how far their descendants who compose the fifth order of slaves are justly reduced to servitude and upon what principles the receivers defend their conduct authors have been at great pains to inquire why in the ancient servitude the child has uniformly followed the condition of the mother but we conceive that they would have saved themselves much trouble and have done themselves more credit if instead of endeavouring to reconcile the custom with heathen notions or their own laboured conjectures they had shewn its inconsistency with reason and nature and its repugnancy to common justice suffice it to say that the whole theory of the ancients with respect to the descendants     of slaves may be reduced to this principle that as the parents by becoming property were wholly considered as cattle their children like the progeny of cattle inherited their parental lot such also is the excuse of the tyrannical receivers beforementioned they allege that they have purchased the parents that they can sell and dispose of them as they please that they possess them under the same laws and limitations as their cattle and that their children like the progeny of these become their property by birth but the absurdity of the argument will immediately appear it depends wholly on the supposition that the parents are brutes if they are brutes we shall instantly cease to contend if they are men which we think it not difficult to prove the argument must immediately fall as we have already shewn that there cannot justly be any property whatever in the human species it has appeared also in the second part of this essay that as nature made every mans body and mind his own so no just person can be reduced to slavery against his own consent do the unfortunate offspring     ever consent to be slaves—they are slaves from their birth—are they guilty of crimes that they lose their freedom—they are slaves when they cannot speak—are their parents abandoned the crimes of the parents cannot justly extend to the children thus then must the tyrannical receivers who presume to sentence the children of slaves to servitude if they mean to dispute upon the justice of their cause either allow them to have been brutes from their birth or to have been guilty of crimes at a time when they were incapable of offending the very king of kings chap iv but to return to the narration when the wretched africans are conveyed to the plantations they are considered as beasts of labour and are put to their respective work having led in their own country a life of indolence and ease where the earth brings forth spontaneously the comforts of life and spares frequently the toil and trouble of cultivation they can hardly be expected to     endure the drudgeries of servitude calculations are accordingly made upon their lives it is conjectured that if three in four survive what is called the seasoning the bargain is highly favourable this seasoning is said to expire when the two first years of their servitude are completed it is the time which an african must take to be so accustomed to the colony as to be able to endure the common labour of a plantation and to be put into the gang at the end of this period the calculations become verified twenty thousand   0 of those who are annually imported dying before the seasoning is over this is surely an horrid and awful consideration and thus does it appear and let it be remembered that it is the lowest calculation that has been ever made upon the subject that out of every annual supply that is shipped from the coast of africa ‡forty thousand lives are regularly expended even before it can be said that there is really any additional stock for the colonies when the seasoning is over and the survivors are thus enabled to endure the usual task of slaves they are considered as real and substantial supplies from this period therefore we shall describe their situation     they are summoned at five in the morning to begin their work this work may be divided into two kinds the culture of the fields and the collection of grass for cattle the last is the most laborious and intolerable employment as the grass can only be collected blade by blade and is to be fetched frequently twice a day at a considerable distance from the plantation in these two occupations they are jointly taken up with no other intermission than that of taking their subsistence twice till nine at night they then separate for their respective huts when they gather sticks prepare their supper and attend their families this employs them till midnight when they go to rest such is their daily way of life for rather more than half the year they are sixteen hours including two intervals at meals in the service of their masters     they are employed three afterwards in their own necessary concerns five only remain for sleep and their day is finished during the remaining portion of the year or the time of crop the nature as well as the time of their employment is considerably changed the whole gang is generally divided into two or three bodies one of these besides the ordinary labour of the day is kept in turn at the mills that are constantly going during the whole of the night this is a dreadful encroachment upon their time of rest which was before too short to permit them perfectly to refresh their wearied limbs and actually reduces their sleep as long as this season lasts to about three hours and an half a night upon a moderate computation those who can keep their eyes open during their nightly labour and are willing to resist the drowsiness that is continually coming upon them are presently worn out while     some of those who are overcome and who feed the mill between asleep and awake suffer for thus obeying the calls of nature by the †loss of a limb in this manner they go on with little or no respite from their work till the crop season is over when the year from the time of our first description is completed to support a life of such unparalleled drudgery we should at least expect to find that they were comfortably clothed and plentifully fed but sad reverse they have scarcely a covering to defend themselves against the inclemency of the night their provisions are frequently bad and are always dealt out to them with such a sparing hand that the means of a bare livelihood are not placed within the reach of four out of five of these unhappy people it is a fact that many of the disorders of slaves are contracted from eating the vegetables which their little     spots produce before they are sufficiently ripe a clear indication that the calls of hunger are frequently so pressing as not to suffer them to wait till they can really enjoy them this situation of a want of the common necessaries of life added to that of hard and continual labour must be sufficiently painful of itself how then must the pain be sharpened if it be accompanied with severity if an unfortunate slave does not come into the field exactly at the appointed time if drooping with sickness or fatigue he appears to work unwillingly or if the bundle of grass that he has been collecting appears too small in the eye of the overseer he is equally sure of experiencing the whip this instrument erases the skin and cuts out small portions of the flesh at almost every stroke and is so frequently applied that the smack of it is all day long in the ears of those who are in the vicinity of the plantations this severity of masters or managers to their slaves which is considered only as common discipline is attended with bad effects it enables them to behold instances of cruelty     without commiseration and to be guilty of them without remorse hence those many acts of deliberate mutilation that have taken place on the slightest occasions hence those many acts of inferiour though shocking barbarity that have taken place without any occasion at all the very slitting of ears has been considered as an operation so perfectly devoid of pain as to have been performed for no other reason than that for which a brand is set upon cattle as a mark of property but this is not the only effect which this severity produces for while it hardens their hearts and makes them insensible of the     misery of their fellowcreatures it begets a turn for wanton cruelty as a proof of this we shall mention one among the many instances that occur where ingenuity has been exerted in contriving modes of torture an iron coffin with holes in it was kept by a certain colonist as an auxiliary to the lash in this the poor victim of the masters resentment was inclosed and placed sufficiently near a fire to occasion extreme pain and consequently shrieks and groans until the revenge of the master was satiated without any other inconvenience on his part than a temporary suspension of the slaves labour had he been flogged to death or his limbs mutilated the interest of the brutal tyrant would have suffered a more irreparable loss in mentioning this instance we do not mean to insinuate that it is common we know that it was reprobated by many all that we would infer from it is that where men are habituated to a system of severity they become wantonly cruel and that the mere toleration     of such an instrument of torture in any country is a clear indication that this wretched class of men do not there enjoy the protection of any laws that may be pretended to have been enacted in their favour such then is the general situation of the unfortunate africans they are beaten and tortured at discretion they are badly clothed they are miserably fed their drudgery is intense and incessant and their rest short for scarcely are their heads reclined scarcely have their bodies a respite from the labour of the day or the cruel hand of the overseer but they are summoned to renew their sorrows in this manner they go on from year to year in a state of the lowest degradation without a single law to protect them without the possibility of redress without a hope that their situation will be changed unless death should terminate the scene having described the general situation of these unfortunate people we shall now take notice of the common consequences that are found to attend it and relate them separately     as they result either from long and painful labour a want of the common necessaries of life or continual severity oppressed by a daily task of such immoderate labour as human nature is utterly unable to perform many of them run away from their masters they fly to the recesses of the mountains where they choose rather to live upon any thing that the soil affords them nay the very soil itself than return to that happy situation which is represented by the receivers as the condition of a slave it sometimes happens that the manager of a mountain plantation falls in with one of these he immediately seizes him and threatens to carry him to his former master unless he will consent to live on the mountain and cultivate his ground when his plantation is put in order he carries the delinquent home abandons him to all the suggestions of despotick rage and accepts a reward for his honesty the unhappy wretch is chained scourged tortured and all this because he obeyed the dictates of nature and wanted to be free and who is there that would not have done the     same thing in the same situation who is there that has once known the charms of liberty that would not fly from despotism and yet by the impious laws of the receivers the absence of six months from the lash of tyranny is—death but this law is even mild when compared with another against the same offence which was in force sometime ago and which we fear is even now in force in some of those colonies which this account of the treatment comprehends advertisements have frequently appeared there offering a reward for the apprehending of fugitive slaves either alive or dead the following instance was given us by a person of unquestionable veracity under whose own observation it fell as   0 he was travelling in one of the colonies alluded to he observed some people in pursuit of a poor wretch who was seeking in the wilderness an asylum from his labours he heard the discharge of a gun and soon afterwards stopping at an house for refreshment the head of the fugitive still reeking with blood was brought in and laid upon a table with exultation the production of such a trophy was the proof required by law to entitle the heroes to their reward now reader determine if you can who were the most execrable the rulers of the state in authorizing murder or the people in being bribed to commit it this is one of the common consequences of that immoderate share of labour which is imposed upon them nor is that which is the result of a scanty allowance of food less to be lamented the wretched african is often so deeply pierced by the excruciating fangs of hunger as almost to be driven to despair what is he to do in such a trying situation let him apply to the receivers alas the majesty of receivership     is too sacred for the appeal and the intrusion would be fatal thus attacked on the one hand and shut out from every possibility of relief on the other he has only the choice of being starved or of relieving his necessities by taking a small portion of the fruits of his own labour horrid crime to be found eating the cane which probably his own hands have planted and to be eating it because his necessities were pressing this crime however is of such a magnitude as always to be accompanied with the whip and so unmercifully has it been applied on such an occasion as to have been the cause in wet weather of the delinquents death but the smart of the whip has not been the only pain that the wretched africans have experienced any thing that passion could seize and convert into an instrument of punishment has been used and horrid to relate the very knife has not been overlooked in the fit of phrenzy ears have been slit eyes have been beaten out and bones have been broken and so frequently has this been the case that it has been a matter of constant lamentation with     disinterested people who out of curiosity have attended the markets to which these unhappy people weekly resort that they have not been able to turn their eyes on any group of them whatever but they have beheld these inhuman marks of passion despotism and caprice but these instances of barbarity have not been able to deter them from similar proceedings and indeed how can it be expected that they should they have still the same appetite to be satisfied as before and to drive them to desperation they creep out clandestinely by night and go in search of food into their masters or some neighbouring plantation but here they are almost equally sure of suffering the watchman who will be punished himself if he neglects his duty frequently seizes them in the fact no excuse or intreaty will avail he must punish them for an example and he must punish them not with     a stick nor with a whip but with a cutlass thus it happens that these unhappy slaves if they are taken are either sent away mangled in a barbarous manner or are killed upon the spot we may now mention the consequences of the severity the wretched africans daily subjected to the lash and unmercifully whipt and beaten on every trifling occasion have been found to resist their opposers unpardonable crime that they should have the feelings of nature that their breasts should glow with resentment on an injury that they should be so far overcome as to resist those whom they are under no obligations to obey and whose only title to their services consists in a violation of the rights of men what has been the consequence—but here let us spare the feelings of the reader we wish we could spare our own and let us only say without a recital of the cruelty that they have been murdered at the discretion of their masters for let the reader observe that the life of an african is only valued at a price that would scarcely purchase an horse that the master has a     power of murdering his slave if he pays but a trifling fine and that the murder must be attended with uncommon circumstances of horrour if it even produces an inquiry immortal alfred father of our invaluable constitution parent of the civil blessings we enjoy how ought thy laws to excite our love and veneration who hast forbidden us thy posterity to tremble at the frown of tyrants how ought they to perpetuate thy name as venerable to the remotest ages who has secured even to the meanest servant a fair and impartial trial how much does nature approve thy laws as consistent with her own feelings while she absolutely turns pale trembles and recoils at the institutions of these receivers execrable men you do not murder the horse on which you only ride you do not mutilate the cow which only affords you her milk you do not torture the dog which is but a partial servant of your pleasures but these unfortunate men from whom you derive your very pleasures and your fortunes you torture mutilate murder at discretion sleep then you receivers if you     can while you scarcely allow these unfortunate people to rest at all feast if you can and indulge your genius while you daily apply to these unfortunate people the stings of severity and hunger exult in riches at at which even avarice ought to shudder and which humanity must detest chap v some people may suppose from the melancholy account that has been given in the preceding chapter that we have been absolutely dealing in romance that the scene exhibited is rather a dreary picture of the imagination than a representation of fact would to heaven for the honour of human nature that this were really the case we wish we could say that we have no testimony to produce for any of our assertions and that our description of the general treatment of slaves has been greatly exaggerated but the receivers notwithstanding the ample and disinterested evidence that can be brought on the occasion do not admit the description to be true they say first     that if the slavery were such as has been now represented no human being could possibly support it long melancholy truth the wretched africans generally perish in their prime let them reflect upon the prodigious supplies that are annually required and their argument will be nothing less than a confession that the slavery has been justly depicted they appeal next to every mans own reason and desire him to think seriously whether selfinterest will not always restrain the master from acts of cruelty to the slave and whether such accounts therefore as the foregoing do not contain within themselves their own refutation we answer no for if this restraining principle be as powerful as it is imagined why does not the general conduct of men afford us a better picture what is imprudence or what is vice but a departure from every mans own interest and yet these are the characteristicks of more than half the world— —but to come more closely to the present case selfinterest will be found but a     weak barrier against the sallies of passion particularly where it has been daily indulged in its greatest latitude and there are no laws to restrain its calamitous effects if the observation be true that passion is a short madness then it is evident that selfinterest and every other consideration must be lost so long as it continues we cannot have a stronger instance of this than in a circumstance related in the second part of this essay that though the africans have gone to war for the express purpose of procuring slaves yet so great has been their resentment at the resistance they have frequently found that their passion has entirely got the better of their interest and they have murdered all without any discrimination either of age or sex such may be presumed to be the case with the no less savage receivers impressed with the most haughty and tyrannical notions easily provoked accustomed to indulge their anger and above all habituated to scenes of cruelty and unawed by the fear of laws they will hardly be found to be exempt from the common failings of human nature and to     spare an unlucky slave at a time when men of cooler temper and better regulated passions are so frequently blind to their own interest but if passion may be supposed to be generally more than a ballance for interest how must the scale be turned in favour of the melancholy picture exhibited when we reflect that selfpreservation additionally steps in and demands the most rigorous severity for when we consider that where there is one master there are fifty slaves that the latter have been all forcibly torn from their country and are retained in their present situation by violence that they are perpetually at war in their hearts with their oppressors and are continually cherishing the seeds of revenge it is evident that even avarice herself however cool and deliberate however free from passion and caprice must sacrifice her own sordid feelings and adopt a system of tyranny and oppression which it must be ruinous to pursue thus then if no picture had been drawn of the situation of slaves and it had been left solely to every mans sober judgment to     determine what it might probably be he would conclude that if the situation were justly described the page must be frequently stained with acts of uncommon cruelty it remains only to make a reply to an objection that is usually advanced against particular instances of cruelty to slaves as recorded by various writers it is said that some of these are so inconceivably and beyond all example inhuman that their very excess above the common measure of cruelty shews them at once exaggerated and incredible but their credibility shall be estimated by a supposition let us suppose that the following instance had been recorded by a writer of the highest reputation that the master of a ship bound to the western colonies with slaves on a presumption that many of them would die selected an hundred and thirty two of the most sickly and ordered them to be thrown into the sea to recover their value from the insurers and above all that the fatal order was put into execution what would the reader have thought on the occasion would he have   0 believed the fact it would have surely staggered his faith because he could never have heard that any one man ever was and could never have supposed that any one man ever could be guilty of the murder of such a number of his fellow creatures but when he is informed that such a fact as this came before a court of justice in this very country that it happened within the last five years that hundreds can come forwards and say that they heard the melancholy evidence with tears what bounds is he to place to his belief the great god who looks down upon all his creatures with the same impartial eye seems to have infatuated the parties concerned that they might bring the horrid circumstance to light that it might be recorded in the annals of a publick court as an authentick specimen of the treatment which the unfortunate africans undergo and at the same time as an argument to shew that there     is no species of cruelty that is recorded to have been exercised upon these wretched people so enormous that it may not readily be believed chap vi if the treatment then as before described is confirmed by reason and the great credit that is due to disinterested writers on the subject if the unfortunate africans are used as if their flesh were stone and their vitals brass by what arguments do you receivers defend your conduct you say that a great part of your savage treatment consists in punishment for real offences and frequently for such offences as all civilized nations have concurred in punishing the first charge that you exhibit against them is specifick it is that of theft but how much rather ought you receivers to blush who reduce them to such a situation who reduce them to the dreadful alternative that they must either steal or perish how much rather ought you receivers to be considered as robbers yourselves     who cause these unfortunate people to be stolen and how much greater is your crime who are robbers of human liberty the next charge which you exhibit against them is general it is that of rebellion a crime of such a latitude that you can impose it upon almost every action and of such a nature that you always annex to it the most excruciating pain but what a contradiction is this to common sense have the wretched africans formally resigned their freedom have you any other claim upon their obedience than that of force if then they are your subjects you violate the laws of government by making them unhappy but if they are not your subjects then even though they should resist your proceedings they are not rebellious but what do you say to that long catalogue of offences which you punish and of which no people but yourselves take cognizance at all you say that the wisdom of legislation has inserted it in the colonial laws and that you punish by authority but do you allude to that execrable code that authorises murder that tempts an unoffended person     to kill the slave that abhors and flies your service that delegates a power which no host of men which not all the world can possess— or—what do you say to that daily unmerited severity which you consider only as common discipline here you say that the africans are vicious that they are all of them illdisposed that you must of necessity be severe but can they be welldisposed to their oppressors in their own country they were just generous hospitable qualities which all the african historians allow them eminently to possess if then they are vicious they must have contracted many of their vices from yourselves and as to their own native vices if any have been imported with them are they not amiable when compared with yours thus then do the excuses which have been hitherto made by the receivers force a relation of such circumstances as makes their conduct totally inexcusable and instead of diminishing at all highly aggravates their guilt     chap vii we come now to that other system of reasoning which is always applied when the former is confuted that the africans are an inferiour link of the chain of nature and are made for slavery this assertion is proved by two arguments the first of which was advanced also by the ancients and is drawn from the inferiority of their capacities let us allow then for a moment that they appear to have no parts that they appear to be void of understanding and is this wonderful when you receivers depress their senses by hunger is this wonderful when by incessant labour the continual application of the lash and the most inhuman treatment that imagination can devise you overwhelm their genius and hinder it from breaking forth—no—you confound their abilities by the severity of their servitude for as a spark of fire if crushed by too great a weight of incumbent fuel cannot be blown into a flame but suddenly expires so the human mind if depressed by rigorous     servitude cannot be excited to a display of those faculties which might otherwise have shone with the brightest lustre neither is it wonderful in another point of view for what is it that awakens the abilities of men and distinguishes them from the common herd is it not often the amiable hope of becoming serviceable to individuals or the state is it not often the hope of riches or of power is it not frequently the hope of temporary honours or a lasting fame these principles have all a wonderful effect upon the mind they call upon it to exert its faculties and bring those talents to the publick view which had otherwise been concealed but the unfortunate africans have no such incitements as these that they should shew their genius they have no hope of riches power honours fame they have no hope but this that their miseries will be soon terminated by death and here we cannot but censure and expose the murmurings of the unthinking and the gay who going on in a continual round of pleasure and prosperity repine at the will of providence as exhibited in the shortness     of human duration but let a weak and infirm old age overtake them let them experience calamities let them feel but half the miseries which the wretched africans undergo and they will praise the goodness of providence who hath made them mortal who hath prescribed certain ordinary bounds to the life of man and who by such a limitation hath given all men this comfortable hope that however persecuted in life a time will come in the common course of nature when their sufferings will have an end such then is the nature of this servitude that we can hardly expect to find in those who undergo it even the glimpse of genius for if their minds are in a continual state of depression and if they have no expectations in life to awaken their abilities and make them eminent we cannot be surprized if a sullen gloomy stupidity should be the leading mark in their character or if they should appear inferiour to those who do not only enjoy the invaluable blessings of freedom but have every prospect before their eyes that can allure     them to exert their faculties now if to these considerations we add that the wretched africans are torn from their country in a state of nature and that in general as long as their slavery continues every obstacle is placed in the way of their improvement we shall have a sufficient answer to any argument that may be drawn from the inferiority of their capacities it appears then from the circumstances that have been mentioned that to form a true judgment of the abilities of these unfortunate people we must either take a general view of them before their slavery commences or confine our attention to such as after it has commenced have had any opportunity given them of shewing their genius either in arts or letters if upon such a fair and impartial view there should be any reason to suppose that they are at all inferiour to others in the same situation the argument will then gain some of that weight and importance which it wants at present in their own country where we are to see them first we must expect that the prospect     will be unfavourable they are mostly in a savage state their powers of mind are limited to few objects their ideas are consequently few it appears however that they follow the same mode of life and exercise the same arts as the ancestors of those very europeans who boast of their great superiority are described to have done in the same uncultivated state this appears from the nubians geography the writings of leo the moor and all the subsequent histories which those who have visited the african continent have written from their own inspection hence three conclusions that their abilities are sufficient for their situation—that they are as great as those of other people have been in the same stage of society—and that they are as great as those of any civilized people whatever when the degree of the barbarism of the one is drawn into a comparison with that of the civilization of the other let us now follow them to the colonies they are carried over in the unfavourable situation described it is observed here that though their abilities cannot be estimated     high from a want of cultivation they are yet various and that they vary in proportion as the nation from which they have been brought has advanced more or less in the scale of social life this observation which is so frequently made is of great importance for if their abilities expand in proportion to the improvement of their state it is a clear indication that if they were equally improved they would be equally ingenious but here before we consider any opportunities that may be afforded them let it be remembered that even their most polished situation may be called barbarous and that this circumstance should they appear less docile than others may be considered as a sufficient answer to any objection that may be made to their capacities notwithstanding this when they are put to the mechanical arts they do not discover a want of ingenuity they attain them in as short a time as the europeans and arrive at a degree of excellence equal to that of their teachers this is a fact almost universally known and affords us this proof that having learned with facility such of the mechanical arts   0 as they have been taught they are capable of attaining any other at least of the same class if they should receive but the same instruction with respect to the liberal arts their proficiency is certainly less but not less in proportion to their time and opportunity of study not less because they are less capable of attaining them but because they have seldom or ever an opportunity of learning them at all it is yet extraordinary that their talents appear even in some of these sciences in which they are totally uninstructed their abilities in musick are such as to have been generally noticed they play frequently upon a variety of instruments without any other assistance than their own ingenuity they have also tunes of their own composition some of these have been imported among us are now in use and are admired for their sprightliness and ease though the ungenerous and prejudiced importer has concealed their original neither are their talents in poetry less conspicuous every occurrence if their     spirits are not too greatly depressed is turned into a song these songs are said to be incoherent and nonsensical but this proceeds principally from two causes an improper conjunction of words arising from an ignorance of the language in which they compose and a wildness of thought arising from the different manner in which the organs of rude and civilized people will be struck by the same object and as to their want of harmony and rhyme which is the last objection the difference of pronunciation is the cause upon the whole as they are perfectly consistent with their own ideas and are strictly musical as pronounced by themselves they afford us as high a proof of their poetical powers as the works of the most acknowledged poets but where these impediments have been removed where they have received an education and have known and pronounced the language with propriety these defects have vanished and their productions have been less objectionable for a proof of this     we appeal to the writings of an african girl who made no contemptible appearance in this species of composition she was kidnapped when only eight years old and in the year      was transported to america where she was sold with other slaves she had no school education there but receiving some little instruction from the family with whom she was so fortunate as to live she obtained such a knowledge of the english language within sixteen months from the time of her arrival as to be able to speak it and read it to the astonishment of those who heard her she soon afterwards learned to write and having a great inclination to learn the latin tongue she was indulged by her master and made a progress her poetical works were published with his permission in the year      they contain thirtyeight pieces on different subjects we shall beg leave to make a short extract from two or three of them for the observation of the reader       from an hymn to the evening    filld with the praise of him who gives the light   and draws the sable curtains of the night   let placid slumbers sooth each weary mind   at morn to wake more heavnly and resind   so shall the labours of the day begin   more pure and guarded from the snares of sin   — — c c   from an hymn to the morning    aurora hail and all the thousand dies   that deck thy progress through the vaulted skies   the morn awakes and wide extends her rays   on evry leaf the gentle zephyr plays         harmonious lays the featherd race resume   dart the bright eye and shake the painted plume   — — c c   from thoughts on imagination    now here now there the roving fancy flies   till some lovd object strikes her wandring eyes   whose silken fetters all the senses bind   and soft captivity involves the mind   imagination who can sing thy force   or who describe the swiftness of thy course   soaring through air to find the bright abode   th empyreal palace of the thundring god   we on thy pinions can surpass the wind   and leave the rolling universe behind   from star to star the mental opticks rove   measure the skies and range the realms above   there in one view we grasp the mighty whole   or with new worlds amaze th unbounded soul   — — c c such is the poetry which we produce as a proof of our assertions how far it has succeeded the reader may by this time have determined in his own mind we shall     therefore only beg leave to accompany it with this observation that if the authoress was designed for slavery as the argument must confess the greater part of the inhabitants of britain must lose their claim to freedom to this poetry we shall only add as a farther proof of their abilities the prose compositions of ignatius sancho who received some little education his letters are too well known to make any extract or indeed any farther mention of him necessary if other examples of african genius should be required suffice it to say that they can be produced in abundance and that if we were allowed to enumerate instances of african gratitude patience fidelity honour as so many instances of good sense and a sound understanding we fear that thousands of the enlightened europeans would have occasion to blush but an objection will be made here that the two persons whom we have particularized by name are prodigies and that if we were to live for many years we should scarcely meet with two other africans of     the same description but we reply that considering their situation as before described two persons above mediocrity in the literary way are as many as can be expected within a certain period of years and farther that if these are prodigies they are only such prodigies as every day would produce if they had the same opportunities of acquiring knowledge as other people and the same expectations in life to excite their genius this has been constantly and solemnly asserted by the pious benezet whom we have mentioned before as having devoted a considerable part of his time to their instruction this great man for we cannot but mention him with veneration had a better opportunity of knowing them than any person whatever and he always uniformly declared that he could never find a difference between their capacities and those of other people that they were as capable of reasoning as any individual europeans that they were as capable of the highest intellectual attainments in     short that their abilities were equal and that they only wanted to be equally cultivated to afford specimens of as fine productions thus then does it appear from the testimony of this venerable man whose authority is sufficient of itself to silence all objections against african capacity and from the instances that have been produced and the observations that have been made on the occasion that if the minds of the africans were unbroken by slavery if they had the same expectations in life as other people and the same opportunities of improvement they would be equal in all the various branches of science to the europeans and that the argument that states them to be an inferiour link of the chain of nature and designed for servitude as far as it depends on the inferiority of their capacities is wholly malevolent and false     chap viii the second argument by which it is attempted to be proved that the africans are an inferiour link of the chain of nature and are designed for slavery is drawn from colour and from those other marks which distinguish them from the inhabitants of europe to prove this with the greater facility the receivers divide in opinion some of them contend that the africans from these circumstances are the descendants of cain others that they are the posterity of ham and that as it was declared by divine inspiration that these should be servants to the rest of the world so they are designed for slavery and that the reducing of them to such a situation is only the accomplishment of the will of heaven while the rest considering them from the same circumstances as a totally distinct species of men conclude them to be an inferiour link of the chain of nature and deduce the inference described     to answer these arguments in the clearest and fullest manner we are under the necessity of making two suppositions first that the scriptures are true secondly that they are false if then the scriptures are true it is evident that the posterity of cain were extinguished in the flood thus one of the arguments is no more with respect to the curse of ham it appears also that it was limited that it did not extend to the posterity of all his sons but only to the descendants of him who was called canaan by which it was foretold that the canaanites a part of the posterity of ham should serve the posterity of shem and japhet now how does it appear that these wretched africans are the descendants of canaan—by those marks it will be said which distinguish them from the rest of the world—but where are these marks to be found in the divine writings in what page is it said that the canaanites   0 were to be known by their colour their features their form or the very hair of their heads which is brought into the account—but alas so far are the divine writings from giving any such account that they shew the assertion to be false they shew that the‡ descendants of cush were of the colour to which the advocates for slavery allude and of course that there was no such limitation of colour to the posterity of canaan or the inheritors of the curse suppose we should now shew upon the most undeniable evidence that those of     the wretched africans who are singled out as inheriting the curse are the descendants     of cush or phut and that we should shew farther that but a single remnant of canaan which was afterwards ruined was ever in africa at all—here all is consternation— but unfortunately again for the argument though wonderfully for the confirmation that the scriptures are of divine original the whole prophecy has been completed a part of the descendants of canaan were hewers of wood and drawers of water and became tributary and subject to the israelites or the descendants of shem the greeks afterwards as well as the romans who were both the descendants of japhet not only subdued those who were settled in syria     and palestine but pursued and conquered all such as were then remaining these were the tyrians and carthaginians the former of whom were ruined by alexander and the greeks the latter by scipio and the romans it appears then that the second argument is wholly inapplicable and false that it is false in its application because those who were the objects of the curse were a totally distinct people that it is false in its proof because no such distinguishing marks as have been specified are to be found in the divine writings and that if the proof could be made out it would be now inapplicable as the curse has been long completed with respect to the third argument we must now suppose that the scriptures are false that mankind did not all spring from the same original that there are different species of men now what must we justly conclude from such a supposition must we conclude that one species is inferiour to another and that the inferiority depends upon their colour or their features or their form—no—we must now consult the     analogy of nature and the conclusion will be this that as she tempered the bodies of the different species of men in a different degree to enable them to endure the respective climates of their habitation so she gave them a variety of colour and appearance with a like benevolent design to sum up the whole if the scriptures are true it is evident that the posterity of cain are no more that the curse of ham has been accomplished and that as all men were derived from the same stock so this variety of appearance in men must either have proceeded from some interposition of the deity or from a cooperation of certain causes which have an effect upon the human frame and have the power of changing it more or less from its primitive appearance as they happen to be more or less numerous or powerful than those which acted upon the frame of man in the first seat of his habitation if from the interposition of the deity then we must conclude that he who bringeth good out of evil produced it for their convenience if from the cooperation of the causes before related     what argument may not be found against any society of men who should happen to differ in the points alluded to from ourselves if on the other hand the scriptures are false then it is evident that there was neither such a person as cain nor ham nor canaan and that nature bestowed such colour features and form upon the different species of men as were best adapted to their situation thus on which ever supposition it is founded the whole argument must fall and indeed it is impossible that it can stand even in the eye of common sense for if you admit the form of men as a justification of slavery you may subjugate your own brother if features then you must quarrel with all the world if colour where are you to stop it is evident that if you travel from the equator to the northern pole you will find a regular gradation of colour from black to white now if you can justly take him for your slave who is of the deepest die what hinders you from taking him also who only differs from the     former but by a shade thus you may proceed taking each in a regular succession to the poles but who are you that thus take into slavery so many people where do you live yourself do you live in spain or in france or in britain if in either of these countries take care lest the whiter natives of the north should have a claim upon yourself—but the argument is too ridiculous to be farther noticed having now silenced the whole argument we might immediately proceed to the discussion of other points without even declaring our opinion as to which of the suppositions may be right on which it has been resuted but we do not think ourselves at liberty to do this the present age would rejoice to find that the scriptures had no foundation and would anxiously catch at the writings of him who should mention them in a doubtful manner we shall therefore declare our sentiments by asserting that they are true and that all mankind however various their appearance are derived from the same stock     to prove this we shall not produce those innumerable arguments by which the scriptures have stood the test of ages but advert to a single fact it is an universal law observable throughout the whole creation that if two animals of a different species propagate their offspring is unable to continue its own species by this admirable law the different species are preserved distinct every possibility of confusion is prevented and the world is forbidden to be overrun by a race of monsters now if we apply this law to those of the human kind who are said to be of a distinct species from each other it immediately fails the mulattoe is as capable of continuing his own species as his father a clear and irrefragable proof that the †scripture account of the creation is     true and that god who hath made the world hath made of one blood all the nations of men that dwell on all the face of the earth but if this be the case it will be said that mankind were originally of one colour and it will be asked at the same time what it is probable that the colour was and how they came to assume so various an appearance to each of these we shall make that reply which we conceive to be the most rational as mankind were originally of the same stock so it is evident that they were originally of the same colour but how shall we attempt to ascertain it shall we englishmen say that it was the same as that which we now find to be peculiar to ourselves—no—this     would be a vain and partial consideration and would betray our judgment to have arisen from that false fondness which habituates us to suppose that every thing belonging to ourselves is the perfectest and the best add to this that we should always be liable to a just reproof from every inhabitant of the globe whose colour was different from our own because he would justly say that he had as good a right to imagine that his own was the primitive colour as that of any other people how then shall we attempt to ascertain it shall we look into the various climates of the earth see the colour that generally prevails in the inhabitants of each and apply the rule this will be certainly free from partiality and will afford us a better prospect of success for as every particular district has its particular colour so it is evident that the complexion of noah and his sons from whom the rest of the world were descended was the same as that which is peculiar to the country which was the   0 seat of their habitation this by such a mode of decision will be found a dark olive a beautiful colour and a just medium between white and black that this was the primitive colour is highly probable from the observations that have been made and if admitted will afford a valuable lesson to the europeans to be cautious how they deride those of the opposite complexion as there is great reason to presume that the purest white is as far removed from the primitive colour as the deepest black we come now to the grand question which is that if mankind were originally of this or any other colour how came it to pass that they should wear so various an appearance we reply as we have had occasion to say before either by the interposition of the deity or by a cooperation of certain causes which have an effect upon the human     frame and have the power of changing it more or less from its primitive appearance as they are more or less numerous or powerful than those which acted upon the frame of man in the first seat of his habitation with respect to the divine interposition two epochs have been assigned when this difference of colour has been imagined to have been so produced the first is that which has been related when the curse was pronounced on a branch of the posterity of ham but this argument has been already refuted for if the particular colour alluded to were assigned at this period it was assigned to the descendants of canaan to distinguish them from those of his other brothers and was therefore limited to the former but the descendants of cush as we have shewn before partook of the same colour a clear proof that it was neither assigned to them on this occasion nor at this period the second epoch is that when mankind were dispersed on the building of babel     it has been thought that both national features and colour might probably have been given them at this time because these would have assisted the confusion of language by causing them to disperse into tribes and would have united more firmly the individuals of each after the dispersion had taken place but this is improbable first because there is great reason to presume that moses who has mentioned the confusion of language would have mentioned these circumstances also if they had actually contributed to bring about so singular an event secondly because the confusion of language was sufficient of itself to have accomplished this and we cannot suppose that the deity could have done any thing in vain and thirdly because if mankind had been dispersed each tribe in its peculiar hue it is impossible to conceive that they could have wandered and settled in such a manner as to exhibit that regular gradation of colour from the equator to the poles so conspicuous at the present day these are the only periods which there has been even the shadow of a probability     for assigning and we may therefore conclude that the preceding observations together with such circumstances as will appear in the present chapter will amount to a demonstration that the difference of colour was never caused by any interposition of the deity and that it must have proceeded therefore from that incidental cooperation of causes which has been before related what these causes are it is out of the power of human wisdom positively to assert there are facts however which if properly weighed and put together will throw considerable light upon the subject these we shall submit to the perusal of the reader and shall deduce from them such inferences only as almost every person must make in his own mind on their recital the first point that occurs to be ascertained is what part of the skin is the seat of colour the old anatomists usually divided the skin into two parts or lamina the exteriour and thinnest called by the greeks epidermis by the romans cuticula and hence by us cuticle and the interiour called by the former derma and by the     latter cutis or true skin hence they must necessarily have supposed that as the true skin was in every respect the same in all human subjects however various their external hue so the seat of colour must have existed in the cuticle or upper surface malphigi an eminent italian physician of the last century was the first person who discovered that the skin was divided into three lamina or parts the cuticle the true skin and a certain coagulated substance situated between both which he distinguished by the title of mucosum corpus a title retained by anatomists to the present day which coagulated substance adhered so firmly to the cuticle as in all former anatomical preparations to have come off with it and from this circumstance to have led the ancient anatomists to believe that there were but two lamina or divisible portions in the human skin this discovery was sufficient to ascertain the point in question for it appeared afterwards that the cuticle when divided according to this discovery from the other lamina was semitransparent that the cuticle     of the blackest negroe was of the same transparency and colour as that of the purest white and hence the true skins of both being invariably the same that the mucosum corpus was the seat of colour this has been farther confirmed by all subsequent anatomical experiments by which it appears that whatever is the colour of this intermediate coagulated substance nearly the same is the apparent colour of the upper surface of the skin neither can it be otherwise for the cuticle from its transparency must necessarily transmit the colour of the substance beneath it in the same manner though not in the same degree as the cornea transmits the colour of the iris of the eye this transparency is a matter of ocular demonstration in white people it is conspicuous in every blush for no one can imagine that the cuticle becomes red as often as this happens nor is it less discoverable in the veins which are so easy to be discerned for no one can suppose that the blue streaks which he constantly sees in the fairest complexions are painted as it were on the surface of the upper skin from     these and a variety of other observations no maxim is more true in physiology than that on the mucosum corpus depends the colour of the human body or in other words that the mucosum corpus being of a different colour in different inhabitants of the globe and appearing through the cuticle or upper surface of the skin gives them that various appearance which strikes us so forcibly in contemplating the human race as this can be incontrovertibly ascertained it is evident that whatever causes cooperate in producing this different appearance they produce it by acting upon the mucosum corpus which from the almost incredible manner in which the †cuticle is     perforated is as accessible as the cuticle itself these causes are probably those various qualities of things which combined with the influence of the sun contribute to form what we call climate for when any person considers that the mucous substance beforementioned is found to vary in its colour as the climates vary from the equator to the poles his mind must be instantly struck with the hypothesis and he must adopt it without any hesitation as the genuine cause of the phænomenon this fact of the variation of the mucous substance according to the situation of the place has been clearly ascertained in the numerous anatomical experiments that have been made in which subjects of all nations have come under consideration the natives of many of the kingdoms and isles of asia are found to have their corpus mucosum black those of africa situated near the line of the same colour those of the maritime parts of the same continent of a dusky brown nearly     approaching to it and the colour becomes lighter or darker in proportion as the distance from the equator is either greater or less the europeans are the fairest inhabitants of the world those situated in the most southern regions of europe have in their corpus mucosum a tinge of the dark hue of their african neighbours hence the epidemick complexion prevalent among them is nearly of the colour of the pickled spanish olive while in this country and those situated nearer the north pole it appears to be nearly if not absolutely white these are facts which anatomy has established and we acknowledge them to be such that we cannot divest ourselves of the idea that climate has a considerable share in producing a difference of colour others we know have invented other hypotheses but all of them have been instantly refuted as unable to explain the difficulties for which they were advanced and as absolutely contrary to fact and the inventors themselves     have been obliged almost as soon as they have proposed them to acknowledge them deficient the only objection of any consequence that has ever been made to the hypothesis of climate is this that people under the same parallels are not exactly of the same colour but this is no objection in fact for it does not follow that those countries which are at an equal distance from the equator should have their climates the same indeed nothing is more contrary to experience than this climate depends upon a variety of accidents high mountains in the neighbourhood of a place make it cooler by chilling the air that is carried over them by the winds large spreading succulent plants if among the productions of the soil have the same effect they afford agreeable cooling shades and a moist atmosphere from their continual exhalations by which the ardour of the sun is considerably abated while the soil on the other hand if of a sandy nature retains the heat in an uncommon degree and makes the summers considerably hotter than those which are found to exist in the same latitude where the soil is different to  00 this proximity of what may be termed burning sands and to the sulphurous and metallick particles which are continually exhaling from the bowels of the earth is ascribed the different degree of blackness by which some african nations are distinguishable from each other though under the same parallels to these observations we may add that though the inhabitants of the same parallel are not exactly of the same hue yet they differ only by shades of the same colour or to speak with more precision that there are no two people in such a situation one of whom is white and the other black to sum up the whole—suppose we were to take a common globe to begin at the equator to paint every country along the meridian line in succession from thence to the poles and to paint them with the same colour which prevails in the respective inhabitants of each we should see the black with which we had been obliged to begin insensibly changing to an olive and the olive through as many intermediate colours to a white and if on the other hand we should complete any one of the parallels according to the same  0  plan we should see a difference perhaps in the appearance of some of the countries through which it ran though the difference would consist wholly in shades of the same colour the argument therefore which is brought against the hypothesis is so far from being an objection that we shall consider it as one of the first arguments in its favour for if climate has really an influence on the mucous substance of the body it is evident that we must not only expect to see a gradation of colour in the inhabitants from the equator to the poles but also different shades of the same colour in the inhabitants of the same parallel to this argument we shall add one that is incontrovertible which is that when the black inhabitants of africa are transplanted  0  to colder or the white inhabitants of europe to hotter climates their children born there are of a different colour from themselves that is lighter in the first and darker in the second instance as a proof of the first we shall give the words of the abbé raynal in his admired publication the children says he which they the africans procreate in america are not so black as their parents were after each generation the difference becomes more palpable it is possible that after a numerous succession of generations the men come from africa would not be distinguished from those of the country into which they may have been transplanted this circumstance we have had the pleasure of hearing confirmed by a variety of persons who have been witnesses of the fact but particularly by many †intelligent africans  0  who have been parents themselves in america and who have declared that the difference is so palpable in the northern provinces that not only they themselves have constantly observed it but that they have heard it observed by others neither is this variation in the children from the colour of their parents improbable the children of the blackest africans are born white in this state they continue for about a month when they change to a pale yellow in process of time they become brown their skin still continues to increase in darkness with their age till it becomes of a dirty sallow black and at length after a certain period of years glossy and shining now if climate has any influence on the mucous substance of the body this variation in the children from the colour  0  of their parents is an event which must be reasonably expected for being born white and not having equally powerful causes to act upon them in colder as their parents had in the hotter climates which they left it must necessarily follow that the same effect cannot possibly be produced hence also if the hypothesis be admitted may be deduced the reason why even those children who have been brought from their country at an early age into colder regions have been observed to be of a lighter colour than those who have remained at home till they arrived at a state of manhood for having undergone some of the changes which we mentioned to have attended their countrymen from infancy to a certain age and having been taken away before the rest could be completed these farther changes which would have taken place had they remained at home seem either to have been checked in their progress or weakened in their degree by a colder climate  0  we come now to the second and opposite case for a proof of which we shall appeal to the words of dr mitchell in the philosophical transactions the spaniards who have inhabited america under the torrid zone for any time are become as dark coloured as our native indians of virginia of which i myself have been a witness and were they not to intermarry with the europeans but lead the same rude and barbarous lives with the indians it is very probable that in a succession of many generations they would become as dark in complexion to this instance we shall add one which is mentioned by a ‡late writer who describing the african coast and the european settlements there has the following passage there are several other small portuguese settlements and one of some note at mitomba a river in sierra leon the people here called portuguese are principally persons bred from a mixture of the first  0  portuguese discoverers with the natives and now become in their complexion and woolly quality of their hair perfect negroes retaining however a smattering of the portuguese language these facts with respect to the colonists of the europeans are of the highest importance in the present case and deserve a serious attention for when we know to a certainty from whom they are descended when we know that they were at the time of their transplantation of the same colour as those from whom they severally sprung and when on the other hand we are credibly informed that they have changed it for the native colour of the place which they now inhabit the evidence in support of these facts is as great as if a person on the removal of two or three families into another climate had determined to ascertain the circumstance as if he had gone with them and watched their children as if he had communicated his observations at his death to a successor as if his successor had prosecuted the plan and thus an uninterrupted chain of  0  evidence had been kept up from their first removal to any determined period of succeeding time but though these facts seem sufficient of themselves to confirm our opinion they are not the only facts which can be adduced in its support it can be shewn that the members of the very same family when divided from each other and removed into different countries have not only changed their family complexion but that they have changed it to as many different colours as they have gone into different regions of the world we cannot have perhaps a more striking instance of this than in the jews these people are scattered over the face of the whole earth they have preserved themselves distinct from the rest of the world by their religion and as they never intermarry with any but those of their own sect so they have no mixture of blood in their veins that they should differ from each other and yet nothing is more true than that the english jew is white the portuguese swarthy the armenian olive and the arabian copper  0  in short that there appear to be as many different species of jews as there are countries in which they reside to these facts we shall add the following observation that if we can give credit to the ancient historians in general a change from the darkest black to the purest white must have actually been accomplished one instance perhaps may be thought sufficient herodotus relates that the colchi were black and that they had crisped hair these people were a detachment of the æthiopian army under sesostris who followed him in his expedition and settled in that part of the world where colchis is usually represented to have been situated had not the same author informed us of this circumstance we should have thought it †strange that a people of this description should have been found in such a latitude now as  0  they were undoubtedly settled there and as they were neither so totally destroyed nor made any such rapid conquests as that history should notice the event there is great reason to presume that their descendants continued in the same or settled in the adjacent country from whence it will follow that they must have changed their complexion to that which is observable in the inhabitants of this particular region at the present day or in other words that the black inhabitant of colchis must have been changed into the fair circassian as we have now shewn it to be highly probable from the facts which have been advanced that climate is the cause of the difference of colour which prevails in the different inhabitants of the globe we shall now shew its probability from so similar   0 an effect produced on the mucous substance beforementioned by so similar a cause that though the fact does not absolutely prove our conjecture to be right yet it will give us a very lively conception of the manner in which the phænomenon may be caused this probability may be shewn in the case of freckles which are to be seen in the face of children but of such only as have the thinnest and most transparent skins and are occasioned by the rays of the sun striking forcibly on the mucous substance of the face and drying the accumulating fluid this accumulating fluid or perspirable matter is at first colourless but being exposed to violent heat or dried becomes brown hence the mucosum corpus being tinged in various parts by this brown coagulated fluid and the parts so tinged appearing through the cuticle or upper surface of the skin arises that spotted appearance observable in the case recited now if we were to conceive a black skin to be an universal freckle or the rays of the sun to act so universally on the mucous substance of a persons face as to produce     these spots so contiguous to each other that they should unite we should then see in imagination a face similar to those which are daily to be seen among black people and if we were to conceive his body to be exposed or acted upon in the same manner we should then see his body assuming a similar appearance and thus we should see the whole man of a perfect black or resembling one of the naked inhabitants of the torrid zone now as the seat of freckles and of blackness is the same as their appearance is similar and as the cause of the first is the ardour of the sun it is therefore probable that the cause of the second is the same hence if we substitute for the word sun what is analogous to it the word climate the same effect may be supposed to be produced and the conjecture to receive a sanction nor is it unlikely that the hypothesis which considers the cause of freckles and of blackness as the same may be right for if blackness is occasioned by the rays of the sun striking forcibly and universally on the mucous substance of the body and drying the     accumulating fluid we can account for the different degrees of it to be found in the different inhabitants of the globe for as the quantity of perspirable fluid and the force of the solar rays is successively increased as the climates are successively warmer from any given parallel to the line it follows that the fluid with which the mucous substance will be stained will be successively thicker and deeper coloured and hence as it appears through the cuticle the complexion successively darker or what amounts to the same thing there will be a difference of colour in the inhabitants of every successive parallel from these and the whole of the preceding observations on the subject we may conclude that as all the inhabitants of the earth cannot be otherwise than the children of the same parents and as the difference of their appearance must have of course proceeded from incidental causes these causes are a combination of those qualities which we call climate that the blackness of the africans is so far ingrafted in their constitution in a course of many     generations that their children wholly inherit it if brought up in the same spot but that it is not so absolutely interwoven in their nature that it cannot be removed if they are born and settled in another that noah and his sons were probably of an olive complexion that those of their descendants who went farther to the south became of a deeper olive or copper while those who went still farther became of a deeper copper or black that those on the other hand who travelled farther to the north became less olive or brown while those who went still farther than the former became less brown or white and that if any man were to point out any one of the colours which prevails in the human complexion as likely to furnish an argument that the people of such a complexion were of a different species from the rest it is probable that his own descendants if removed to the climate to which this complexion is peculiar would in the course of a few generations degenerate into the same colour having now replied to the argument that the africans are an inferiour link of     the chain of nature as far as it depended on their capacity and colour we shall now only take notice of an expression which the receivers beforementioned are pleased to make use of that they are made for slavery had the africans been made for slavery or to become the property of any society of men it is clear from the observations that have been made in the second part of this essay that they must have been created devoid of reason but this is contrary to fact it is clear also that there must have been many and evident signs of the inferiority of their nature and that this society of men must have had a natural right to their dominion but this is equally false no such signs of inferiority are to be found in the one and the right to dominion in the other is incidental for in what volume of nature or religion is it written that one society of men should breed slaves for the benefit of another nor is it less evident that they would have wanted many of those qualities which they have and which brutes have not they would have wanted that spirit     of liberty that sense of ignominy and shame which so frequently drives them to the horrid extremity of finishing their own existence nor would they have been endowed with a contemplative power for such a power would have been unnecessary to people in such a situation or rather its only use could have been to increase their pain we cannot suppose therefore that god has made an order of beings with such mental qualities and powers for the sole purpose of being used as beasts or instruments of labour and here what a dreadful argument presents itself against you receivers for if they have no understandings as you confess then is your conduct impious because as they cannot perceive the intention of your punishment your severities cannot make them better but if on the other hand they have had understandings which has evidently appeared     then is your conduct equally impious who by destroying their faculties by the severity of your discipline have reduced men who had once the power of reason to an equality with the brute creation chap ix the reader may perhaps think that the receivers have by this time expended all their arguments but their store is not so easily exhausted they are well aware that justice nature and religion will continue as they have ever uniformly done to oppose their conduct this has driven them to exert their ingenuity and has occasioned that multiplicity of arguments to be found in the present question these arguments are of a different complexion from the former they consist in comparing the state of slaves with that of some of the classes of free men and in certain scenes of felicity which the former are said to enjoy it is affirmed that the punishments which the africans undergo are less severe than the military that their life is happier than that of the english peasant that they have     the advantages of manumission that they have their little spots of ground their holydays their dances in short that their life is a scene of festivity and mirth and that they are much happier in the colonies than in their own country these representations which have been made out with much ingenuity and art may have had their weight with the unwary but they will never pass with men of consideration and sense who are accustomed to estimate the probability of things before they admit them to be true indeed the bare assertion that their situation is even comfortable contains its own refutation or at least leads us to suspect that the person who asserted it has omitted some important considerations in the account such we shall shew to have been actually the case and that the representations of the receivers when stripped of their glossy ornaments are but empty declamation it is said first of military punishments that they are more severe than those which the africans undergo but this is a bare assertion without a proof it is not shewn     even by those who assert it how the fact can be made out we are left therefore to draw the comparison ourselves and to fill up those important considerations which we have just said that the receivers had omitted that military punishments are severe we confess but we deny that they are severer than those with which they are compared where is the military man whose ears have been slit whose limbs have been mutilated or whose eyes have been beaten out but let us even allow that their punishments are equal in the degree of their severity still they must lose by comparison the soldier is never punished but after a fair and equitable trial and the decision of a military court the unhappy african at the discretion of his lord the one knows what particular conduct will constitute an offence the other has no such information as he is wholly at the disposal of passion and caprice which may impose upon     any action however laudable the appellation of a crime the former has it of course in his power to avoid a punishment the latter is never safe the former is punished for a real the latter often for an imaginary fault now will any person assert on comparing the whole of those circumstances together which relate to their respective punishments that there can be any doubt which of the two are in the worst situation as to their penal systems with respect to the declaration that the life of an african in the colonies is happier than that of an english peasant it is equally false indeed we can scarcely withhold our indignation when we consider how shamefully the situation of this latter class of men has been misrepresented to elevate the former to a state of fictitious happiness if the representations of the receivers be true it is evident that those of the most approved writers who have placed a considerable share of happiness in the cottage have been mistaken in their opinion and that those of the rich who have been heard to sigh and envy   0 the felicity of the peasant have been treacherous to their own sensations but which are we to believe on the occasion those who endeavour to dress vice in the habit of virtue or those who derive their opinion from their own feelings the latter are surely to be believed and we may conclude therefore that the horrid picture which is given of the life of the peasant has not so just a foundation as the receivers would lead us to suppose for has he no pleasure in the thought that he lives in his own country and among his relations and friends that he is actually free and that his children will be the same that he can never be sold as a beast that he can speak his mind without the fear of the lash that he cannot even be struck with impunity and that he partakes equally with his superiours of the protection of the law—now there is no one of these advantages which the african possesses and no one which the defenders of slavery take into their account     of the other comparisons that are usually made we may observe in general that as they consist in comparing the iniquitous practice of slavery with other iniquitous practices in force among other nations they can neither raise it to the appearance of virtue nor extenuate its guilt the things compared are in these instances both of them evils alike they call equally for redress and are equally disgraceful to the governments which suffer them if not encourage them to exist to attempt therefore to justify one species of iniquity by comparing it with another is no justification at all and is so far from answering the purpose for which the comparison is intended as to give us reason to suspect that the comparer     has but little notion either of equity or honour we come now to those scenes of felicity which slaves are said to enjoy the first advantage which they are said to experience is that of manumission but here the advocates for slavery conceal an important circumstance they expatiate indeed on the charms of freedom and contend that it must be a blessing in the eyes of those upon whom it is conferred we perfectly agree with them in this particular but they do not tell us that these advantages are confined that they are confined to some favourite domestick that not one in an hundred enjoy them and that they are never extended to those who are employed in the cultivation of the field as long as they can work these are they who are most to be pitied who are destined to perpetual drudgery and of whom no one whatever has a chance of being freed from his situation till death either releases him at once or age renders him incapable of continuing his former labour and here     let it be remarked to the disgrace of the receivers that he is then made free not—as a reward for his past services but as his labour is then of little or no value—to save the tax with the same artifice is mention also made of the little spots or gardens as they are called which slaves are said to possess from the liberality of the receivers but people must not be led away by agreeable and pleasant sounds they must not suppose that these gardens are made for flowers or that they are places of amusement in which they can spend their time in botanical researches and delights alas they do not furnish them with a theme for such pleasing pursuits and speculations they must be cultivated in those hours which ought to be     appropriated to ∥rest and they must be cultivated not for an amusement but to make up if it be possible the great deficiency in their weekly allowance of provisions hence it appears that the receivers have no merit whatever in such an appropriation of land to their unfortunate slaves for they are either under the necessity of doing this or of losing them by the jaws of famine and it is a notorious fact that with their weekly allowance and the produce of their spots together it is often with the greatest difficulty that they preserve a wretched existence the third advantage which they are said to experience is that of holydays or days of respite from their usual discipline and fatigue this is certainly a great indulgence and ought to be recorded to the immortal honour of the receivers we wish we could express their liberality in those handsome     terms in which it deserves to be represented or applaud them sufficiently for deviating for once from the rigours of servile discipline but we confess that we are unequal to the task and must therefore content ourselves with observing that while the horse has one day in seven to refresh his limbs the happy african has but one in fiftytwo as a relaxation from his labours with respect to their dances on which such a particular stress has been generally laid we fear that people may have been as shamefully deceived as in the former instances for from the manner in which these are generally mentioned we should almost be led to imagine that they had certain hours allowed them for the purpose of     joining in the dance and that they had every comfort and convenience that people are generally supposed to enjoy on such convivial occasions but this is far from the case reason informs us that it can never be if they wish for such innocent recreations they must enjoy them in the time that is allotted them for sleep and so far are these dances from proceeding from any uncommon degree of happiness which excites them to convivial society that they proceed rather from an uncommon depression of spirits which makes them even sacrifice their rest for the sake of experiencing for a moment a more joyful oblivion of their cares for suppose any one of the receivers in the middle of a dance were to address his slaves in the following manner africans i begin at last to feel for your situation and my conscience is severely hurt whenever i reflect that i have been reducing     those to a state of misery and pain who have never given me offence you seem to be fond of these exercises but yet you are obliged to take them at such unseasonable hours that they impair your health which is sufficiently broken by the intolerable share of labour which i have hitherto imposed upon you i will therefore make you a proposal will you be content to live in the colonies and you shall have the half of every week entirely to yourselves or will you choose to return to your miserable wretched country—but what is that which strikes their ears which makes them motionless in an instant which interrupts the festive scene—their country—transporting sound—behold they are now flying from the dance you may see them running to the shore and frantick as it were with joy demanding with open arms an instantaneous passage to their beloved native plains such are the colonial delights by the representation of which the receivers would persuade us that the africans are taken from     their country to a region of conviviality and mirth and that like those who leave their usual places of residence for a summers amusement they are conveyed to the colonies—to bathe—to dance—to keep holyday—to be jovial—but there is something so truly ridiculous in the attempt to impose these scenes of felicity on the publick as scenes which fall to the lot of slaves that the receivers must have been driven to great extremities to hazard them to the eye of censure the last point that remains to be considered is the shameful assertion that the africans are much happier in the colonies than in their own country but in what does this superiour happiness consist in those real scenes it must be replied which have been just mentioned for these by the confession of the receivers constitute the happiness they enjoy—but it has been shewn that these have been unfairly represented and were they realized in the most extensive latitude they would not confirm the fact for if upon a recapitulation it consists in     the pleasure of manumission they surely must have passed their lives in a much more comfortable manner who like the africans at home have had no occasion for such a benefit at all but the receivers we presume reason upon this principle that we never know the value of a blessing but by its loss this is generally true but would any one of them make himself a slave for years that he might run the chance of the pleasures of manumission or that he might taste the charms of liberty with a greater relish nor is the assertion less false in every other consideration for if their happiness consists in the few holydays which in the colonies they are permitted to enjoy what must be their situation in their own country where the whole year is but one continued holyday or cessation from discipline and fatigue—if in the possession of a mean and contracted spot what must be their situation where a whole region is their own producing almost spontaneously the comforts of life and requiring for its cultivation none of those hours which should be appropriated to sleep—if in the   0 pleasures of the colonial dance what must it be in their own country where they may dance for ever where there is no stated hour to interrupt their felicity no intolerable labour immediately to succeed their recreations and no overseer to receive them under the discipline of the lash—if these therefore are the only circumstances by which the assertion can be proved we may venture to say without fear of opposition that it can never be proved at all but these are not the only circumstances it is said that they are barbarous at home—but do you receivers civilize them—your unwillingness to convert them to christianity because you suppose you must use them more kindly when converted is but a bad argument in favour of the fact it is affirmed again that their manner of life and their situation is such in their own country that to say they are happy is a jest but who are you who pretend to judge of another mans happiness that state     which each man under the guidance of his maker forms for himself and not one man for another to know what constitutes mine or your happiness is the sole prerogative of him who created us and cast us in so various and different moulds did your slaves ever complain to you of their unhappiness amidst their native woods and desarts or rather let me ask did they ever cease complaining of their condition under you their lordly masters where they see indeed the accommodations of civil life but see them all pass to others themselves unbenefited by them be so gracious then ye petty tyrants over human freedom to let your slaves judge for themselves what it is which makes their own happiness and then see whether they do not place it in the return to their own country rather than in the contemplation of your grandeur of which their misery makes so large a part but since you speak with so much considence on the subject let us ask you receivers again if you have ever been informed by     your unfortunate slaves that they had no connexions in the country from which they have forcibly been torn away or if you will take upon you to assert that they never sigh when they are alone or that they never relate to each other their tales of misery and woe but you judge of them perhaps in an happy moment when you are dealing out to them their provisions for the week and are but little aware that though the countenance may be cheered with a momentary smile the heart may be exquisitely tortured were you to shew us indeed that there are laws subject to no evasion by which you are obliged to clothe and feed them in a comfortable manner were you to shew us that they are protected at all or that even one in a thousand of those masters have †suffered     death who have been guilty of premeditated murder to their slaves you would have a better claim to our belief but you can neither produce the instances nor the laws the people of whom you speak are slaves are your own property are wholly at your own disposal and this idea is sufficient to overturn your assertions of their happiness but we shall now mention a circumstance which in the present case will have more weight than all the arguments which have hitherto been advanced it is an opinion which the africans universally entertain that as soon as death shall release them from the hands of their oppressors they shall immediately be wafted back to their native plains there to exist again to enjoy the sight of their beloved countrymen and to spend the whole of their new existence in scenes of tranquillity and delight and so powerfully does this notion operate upon them as to drive them frequently to the horrid extremity of putting a period to their lives now if these suicides are frequent which no person can deny what are they but a proof that the situation of those who destroy     themselves must have been insupportably wretched and if the thought of returning to their country after death when they have experienced the colonial joys constitutes their supreme felicity what are they but a proof that they think there is as much difference between the two situations as there is between misery and delight nor is the assertion of the receivers less liable to a refutation in the instance of those who terminate their own existence than of those whom nature releases from their persecutions they die with a smile upon their face and their funerals are attended by a vast concourse of their countrymen with every possible demonstration of joy but why this unusual mirth if their departed brother has left an happy place or if he has been taken from the care of an indulgent master who consulted his pleasures and administered to his wants but alas it arises from hence that     he is gone to his happy country a circumstance sufficient of itself to silence a myriad of those specious arguments which the imagination has been racked and will always be racked to produce in favour of a system of tyranny and oppression it remains only that we should now conclude the chapter with a fact which will shew that the account which we have given of the situation of slaves is strictly true and will refute at the same time all the arguments which have hitherto been and may yet be brought by the receivers to prove that their treatment is humane in one of the western colonies of the europeans six hundred and fifty thousand slaves were imported within an hundred years at the expiration of which time their whole posterity were found to amount to one hundred and forty thousand this fact will ascertain the     treatment of itself for how shamefully must these unfortunate people have been oppressed what a dreadful havock must famine fatigue and cruelty have made among them when we consider that the descendants of six hundred and fifty thousand people in the prime of life gradually imported within a century are less numerous than those which only ten thousand would have produced in the same period under common advantages and in a country congenial to their constitutions but the receivers have probably great merit on the occasion let us therefore set it down to their humanity let us suppose for once that this incredible waste of the human species proceeds from a benevolent design that sensible of the miseries of a servile state     they resolve to wear out as fast as they possibly can their unfortunate slaves that their miseries may the sooner end and that a wretched posterity may be prevented from sharing their parental condition now whether this is the plan of reasoning which the receivers adopt we cannot take upon us to decide but true it is that the effect produced is exactly the same as if they had reasoned wholly on this benevolent principle chap x we have now taken a survey of the treatment which the unfortunate africans undergo when they are put into the hands of the receivers this treatment by the four first chapters of the present part of this essay appears to be wholly insupportable and to be such as no human being can apply to another without the imputation of such crimes as should make him tremble but as many arguments are usually advanced by those who have any interest in the practice     by which they would either exculpate the treatment or diminish its severity we allotted the remaining chapters for their discussion in these we considered the probability of such a treatment against the motives of interest the credit that was to be given to those disinterested writers on the subject who have recorded particular instances of barbarity the inferiority of the africans to the human species the comparisons that are generally made with respect to their situation the positive scenes of felicity which they are said to enjoy and every other argument in short that we have found to have ever been advanced in the defence of slavery these have been all considered and we may venture to pronounce that instead of answering the purpose for which they were intended they serve only to bring such circumstances to light as clearly shew that if ingenuity were racked to invent a situation that would be the most distressing and insupportable to the human race it could never invent one that would suit the description better than the—colonial slavery     if this then be the case and if slaves notwithstanding all the arguments to the contrary are exquisitely miserable we ask you receivers by what right you reduce them to so wretched a situation you reply that you buy them that your money constitutes your right and that like all other things which you purchase they are wholly at your own disposal upon this principle alone it was that we professed to view your treatment or examine your right when we said that the question resolved itself into two separate parts for discussion into the african commerce as explained in the history of slavery and the subsequent slavery in the colonies as founded on the equity of the commerce now since it appears that this commerce upon the fullest investigation is contrary to †the principles of law and government the dictates of reason the common maxims of equity the laws of nature the admonitions of conscience and in short the whole doctrine of natural   0 religion it is evident that the right which is founded upon it must be the same and that if those things only are lawful in the fight of god which are either virtuous in themselves or proceed from virtuous principles you have no right over them at all you yourselves also confess this for when we ask you whether any human being has a right to sell you you immediately answer no as if nature revolted at the thought and as if it was so contradictory to your own feelings as not to require consideration but who are you that have this exclusive charter of trading in the liberties of mankind when did nature or rather the author of nature make so partial a distinction between you and them when did he say that you should have the privilege of selling others and that others should not have the privilege of selling you now since you confess that no person whatever has a right to dispose of you in this manner you must confess also that those things are unlawful to be done to you which are usually done in consequence of     the sale let us suppose then that in consequence of the commerce you were forced into a ship that you were conveyed to another country that you were sold there that you were confined to incessant labour that you were pinched by continual hunger and thirst and subject to be whipped cut and mangled at discretion and all this at the hands of those whom you had never offended would you not think that you had a right to resist their treatment would you not resist it with a safe conscience and would you not be surprized if your resistance should be termed rebellion—by the former premises you must answer yes—such then is the case with the wretched africans they have a right to resist your proceedings they can resist them and yet they cannot justly be considered as rebellious for though we suppose them to have been guilty of crimes to one another though we suppose them to have been the most abandoned and execrable of men yet are they perfectly innocent with respect to you receivers you have no right to touch even the hair of their heads without their     own consent it is not your money that can invest you with a right human liberty can neither be bought nor sold every lash that you give them is unjust it is a lash against nature and religion and will surely stand recorded against you since they are all with respect to your impious selves in a state of nature in a state of original dissociation perfectly free chap xi having now considered both the commerce and slavery it remains only to collect such arguments as are scattered in different parts of the work and to make such additional remarks as present themselves on the subject and first let us ask you who have studied the law of nature and you who are learned in the law of the land if all property must not be inferiour in its nature to its possessor or in other words for it is a case which every person must bring home to his own breast if you suppose that any human being can have a property in yourselves let us     ask you appraisers who scientifically know the value of things if any human creature is equivalent only to any of the trinkets that you wear or at most to any of the horses that you ride or in other words if you have ever considered the most costly things that you have valued as equivalent to yourselves let us ask you rationalists if man as a reasonable being is not accountable for his actions and let us put the same question to you who have studied the divine writings let us ask you parents if ever you thought that you possessed an authority as such or if ever you expected a duty from your sons and let us ask you sons if ever you felt an impulse in your own breasts to obey your parents now if you should all answer as we could wish if you should all answer consistently with reason nature and the revealed voice of god what a dreadful argument will present itself against the commerce and slavery of the human species when we reflect that no man whatever can be bought or reduced to the situation of a slave but he must instantly become a brute he must instantly be reduced to the value of those     things which were made for his own use and convenience he must instantly cease to be accountable for his actions and his authority as a parent and his duty as a son must be instantly no more neither does it escape our notice when we are speaking of the fatal wound which every social duty must receive how considerably christianity suffers by the conduct of you receivers for by prosecuting this impious commerce you keep the africans in a state of perpetual ferocity and barbarism and by prosecuting it in such a manner as must represent your religion as a system of robbery and oppression you not only oppose the propagation of the gospel as far as you are able yourselves but throw the most certain impediments in the way of others who might attempt the glorious and important task such also is the effect which the subsequent slavery in the colonies must produce for by your inhuman treatment of the unfortunate africans there you create the same insuperable impediments to a conversion     for how must they detest the very name of christians when you christians are deformed by so many and dreadful vices how must they detest that system of religion which appears to resist the natural rights of men and to give a sanction to brutality and murder but as we are now mentioning christianity we must pause for a little time to make a few remarks on the arguments which are usually deduced from thence by the receivers in defence of their system of oppression for the reader may readily suppose that if they did not hesitate to bring the old testament in support of their barbarities they would hardly let the new escape them st paul having converted onesimus to the christian faith who was a fugitive slave of philemon sent him back to his master this circumstance has furnished the receivers with a plea that christianity encourages slavery but they have not only strained the passages which they produce in support of their assertions but are ignorant of historical facts the benevolent apostle in the letter which he wrote to philemon the master     of onesimus addresses him to the following effect i send him back to you but not in his former capacity not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved in this manner i beseech you to receive him for though i could enjoin you to do it yet i had rather it should be a matter of your own will than of necessity it appears that the same onesimus when he was sent back was no longer a slave that he was a minister of the gospel that he was joined with tychicus in an ecclesiastical commission to the church of the colossians and was afterwards bishop of ephesus if language therefore has any meaning and if history has recorded a fact which may be believed there is no case more opposite to the doctrine of the receivers than this which they produce in its support it is said again that christianity among the many important precepts which it contains does not furnish us with one for the abolition of slavery but the reason is obvious slavery at the time of the introduction     of the gospel was universally prevalent and if christianity had abruptly declared that the millions of slaves should have been made free who were then in the world it would have been universally rejected as containing doctrines that were dangerous if not destructive to society in order therefore that it might be universally received it never meddled by any positive precept with the civil institutions of the times but though it does not expressly say that you shall neither buy nor sell nor possess a slave it is evident that in its general tenour it sufficiently militates against the custom the first doctrine which it inculcates is that of brotherly love it commands good will towards men it enjoins us to love our neighbours as ourselves and to do unto all men as we would that they should do unto us and how can any man fulfil this scheme of universal benevolence who reduces an unfortunate person against his will to the most insupportable of all human conditions who considers him as his private property and treats him not as a brother nor as one     of the same parentage with himself but as an animal of the brute creation but the most important doctrine is that by which we are assured that mankind are to exist in a future state and to give an account of those actions which they have severally done in the flesh this strikes at the very root of slavery for how can any man be justly called to an account for his actions whose actions are not at his own disposal this is the case with the proper slave his liberty is absolutely bought and appropriated and if the purchase is just and equitable he is under the necessity of perpetrating any crime which the purchaser may order him to commit or in other words of ceasing to be accountable for his actions these doctrines therefore are sufficient to shew that slavery is incompatible with the     christian system the europeans considered them as such when at the close of the twelfth century they resisted their hereditary prejudices and occasioned its abolition hence one among many other proofs that christianity was the production of infinite wisdom that though it did not take such express cognizance of the wicked national institutions of the times as should hinder its reception it should yet contain such doctrines as when it should be fully established would be sufficient for the abolition of them all thus then is the argument of you receivers ineffectual and your conduct impious for by the prosecution of this wicked slavery and commerce you not only oppose the propagation of that gospel which was ordered to be preached unto every creature and bring it into contempt but you oppose its tenets also first because you violate that law of universal benevolence which was to take away those hateful distinctions of jew and gentile greek and barbarian bond and free which prevailed when the gospel was introduced and secondly because as   0 every man is to give an account of his actions hereafter it is necessary that he should be free another argument yet remains which though nature will absolutely turn pale at the recital cannot possibly be omitted in those wars which are made for the sake of procuring slaves it is evident that the contest must be generally obstinate and that great numbers must be slain on both sides before the event can be determined this we may reasonably apprehend to be the case and we have shewn that there have not been wanting instances where the conquerors have been so incensed at the resistance they have found that their spirit of vengeance has entirely got the better of their avarice and they have murdered in cool blood every individual without discrimination either of age or sex from these and other circumstances we thought we had sufficient reason to conclude that where ten were supposed to be taken an hundred including the victors and vanquished might     be supposed to perish now as the annual exportation from africa consists of an hundred thousand men and as the two orders of those who are privately kidnapped by individuals and of those who are publickly seized by virtue of the authority of their prince compose together at least ninetenths of the african slaves it follows that about ten thousand consist of convicts and prisoners of war the last order is the most numerous let us suppose then that only six thousand of this order are annually sent into servitude and it will immediately appear that no less than sixty thousand people annually perish in those wars which are made only for the purpose of procuring slaves but that this number which we believe to be by no means exaggerated may be free from all objection we will include those in the estimate who die as they are travelling to the ships many of these unfortunate people have a journey of one thousand miles to perform on foot and are driven like sheep through inhospitable woods and deserts where they frequently die in great numbers from fatigue and want     now if to those who thus perish on the african continent by war and travelling we subjoin those who afterwards perish on the voyage and in the seasoning together it will appear that in every yearly attempt to supply the colonies an hundred thousand must perish even before one useful individual can be obtained gracious god how wicked how beyond all example impious must be that servitude which cannot be carried on without the continual murder of so many and innocent persons what punishment is not to be expected for such monstrous and unparalleled barbarities for if the blood of one man unjustly shed cries with so loud a voice for the divine vengeance how shall the cries and groans of an hundred thousand men annually murdered ascend the celestial mansions and bring down that punishment which such enormities deserve but do we mention punishment do we allude to that punishment which shall be inflicted on men as individuals in a future life do we     allude to that awful day which shall surely come when the master shall behold his murdered negroe face to face when a train of mutilated slaves shall be brought against him when he shall stand confounded and abashed or do we allude to that punishment which may be inflicted on them here as members of a wicked community for as a body politick if its members are ever so numerous may be considered as an whole acting of itself and by itself in all affairs in which it is concerned so it is accountable as such for its conduct and as these kinds of polities have only their existence here so it is only in this world that as such they can be punished now whether we consider the crime with respect to the individuals immediately concerned in this most barbarous and cruel traffick or whether we consider it as patronized and encouraged by the laws of the land it presents to our view     an equal degree of enormity a crime founded on a dreadful preeminence in wickedness—a crime which being both of individuals and the nation must sometime draw down upon us the heaviest judgment of almighty god who made of one blood all the sons of men and who gave to all equally a natural right to liberty and who ruling all the kingdoms of the earth with equal providential justice cannot suffer such deliberate such monstrous iniquity to pass long unpunished† but alas he seems already to have interfered on the occasion the violent and supernatural agitations of all the elements which for a series of years have prevailed in those european settlements where the     unfortunate africans are retained in a state of slavery and which have brought unspeakable calamities on the inhabitants and publick losses on the states to which they severally belong are so many awful visitations of god for this inhuman violation of his laws and it is not perhaps unworthy of remark that as the subjects of greatbritain have two thirds of this impious commerce in their own hands so they have suffered in the same proportion or more severely than the rest how far these misfortunes may appear to be acts of providence and to create an alarm to those who have been accustomed to refer every effect to its apparent cause who have been habituated to stop there and to overlook the finger of god because it is slightly covered under the veil of secondary laws we will not pretend to determine but this we will assert with confidence that the europeans have richly deserved them all     that the fear of sympathy which can hardly be restrained on other melancholy occasions seems to forget to flow at the relation of these and that we can never with any shadow of justice wish prosperity to the undertakers of those whose success must be at the expence of the happiness of millions of their fellowcreatures but this is sufficient for if liberty is only an adventitious right if men are by no means superiour to brutes if every social duty is a curse if cruelty is highly to be esteemed if murder is strictly honourable and christianity is a lye then it is evident that the african slavery may be pursued without either the remorse of conscience or the imputation of a crime but if the contrary of this is true which reason must immediately evince it is evident that no custom established among men was ever more impious since it is contrary to reason justice nature the

understood that slavery was unknown in africa before the piratical expeditions of the portuguese as it appears from the nubians geography that both the slavery and commerce had been established among the natives with one another we mean only to assert that the portuguese were the first of the europeans who made their piratical expeditions and shewed the way to that slavery which now makes so disgraceful a figure in the western colonies of the europeans in the term europeans wherever it shall occur in the remaining part of this first dissertation we include the portuguese and those nations only who followed their example  the portuguese erected their first fort at delmina in the year      about forty years after alonzo gonzales had pointed the southern africans out to his countrymen as articles of commerce  in the ancient servitude we reckoned convicts among the voluntary slaves because they had it in their power by a virtuous conduct to have avoided so melancholy a situation in the

it denies that government was a contract no social compact was ever made in fact—it is to suppose it possible to call savages out of caves and deserts to deliberate upon topicks which the experience and studies and the refinements of civil life alone suggest therefore no government in the universe begun from this original but there are no grounds for so absurd a supposition for government and of course the social compact does not appear to have been introduced at the time when families coming out of their caves and deserts or in other words quitting their former dissociated state joined themselves together they had lived a considerable time in society like the lybians and gætulians beforementioned and had felt many of the disadvantages of a want of discipline and laws before government was introduced at all the author of this essay before he took into consideration the origin of government was determined in a matter of such importance to be biassed by no opinion whatever and much less to indulge himself in speculation he was determined solely to adhere to fact and by looking into the accounts left us of those governments which were in their infancy and of course in the least complicated state to attempt to discover their foundation he cannot say therefore that upon a very minute perusal of the excellent work before quoted he has been so far convinced as to retract in the least from his sentiments on this head and to give up maxims which are drawn from historical facts for those which are the result of speculation he may observe here that whether government was a con ract or not it will not affect the reasoning of the present essay since where ever the contract is afterwards mentioned it is inferred only that its object was the happiness of the people which is confessedly the end of government notwithstanding this he is under the necessity of inserting this little note though he almost feels himself ungrateful in contradicting a work

from africa is estimated here at  00000 men two thirds of whom are exported by the british merchants alone this estimate is less than that which is usually made and has been published the author has been informed by disinterested people who were in most of the west india islands during the late war and who conversed with many of the most intelligent of the negroes for the purpose of inquiring by what methods they had originally been reduced to slavery that they did not find even two in twenty who had been reduced to that situation by any other means than those mentioned above the author desirous of a farther confirmation of this circumstance stopped the press till he had written to another friend who had resided twenty years in the westindies and whose opinion he had not yet asked the following is an extract from the answer i do not among many hundreds recollect to have been but one or two slaves of those imported from africa who had any scars to shew that they had been in war they are generally such as are kidnapped or sold by their tyrants after the destruction of a village in short i am firmly of opinion that crimes and war together do not furnish one slave in an hundred of the numbers introduced into the european colonies of consequence the trade itself were it possible to suppose convicts or prisoners of war to be justly sentenced to servitude is accountable for ninetynine in every hundred slaves whom it supplies it is an insult to the publick to attempt to palliate the method of procuring them  the writer of the letter of which this is a faithful extract and who was known to the author of the present essay was a long time on the african coast he had once the misfortune to be shipwrecked there and to be taken by the natives who conveyed him and his companions a considerable way up into the country the hardships which he underwent in the march his treatment during his captivity the scenes to which he was witness while he resided among the inland africans as well as while in the african trade gave occasion to a series of very interesting letters these letters were sent to the author of the present essay with liberty to make what use of them he chose by the gentleman to whom they were written ‡ were this not the case the government of a country could have no right to take cognizance of crimes and punish them but every individual if injured would have a right to punish the aggressor with his own hand which is contrary to the notions of all civilized men whether among the ancients or the moderns  this same notion is entertained even by the african princes who do not permit the person injured to revenge his injury or to receive the convict as his slave but if the very person who has been injured does not possess him much less ought any other person whatsoever  there are instances on the african continent of parents selling their children as the slaves of this description are so few and are so irregularly obtained we did not think it worth our while to confider them as forming an order and as god never gave the parent a power over his child to make him miserable we trust that any farther mention of them will be unnecessary † abbè raynal hist phil vol   p      justin l   c    cicero de officiis l   c    it is universally allowed that at least one fifth of the exported negroes perish in the passage this estimate is made from the time in which they are put on board to the time when they are disposed of in the colonies the french are supposed to lose the greatest number in the voyage but particularly from this circumstance because their slave ships are in general so very large that many of the slaves that have been put on board sickly die before the cargo can be completed  this instance happened in a ship commanded by one collingwood on the   th of november      fiftyfour of them were thrown into the sea alive on the  0th fortytwo more and in about three days afterwards twentysix ten others who were brought upon the deck for the same purpose did not wait to be handcuffed but bravely leaped into the sea and shared the fate of their companions it is a fact that the people on board this ship had not been put upon short allowance the excuse which this execrable wretch made on board for his conduct was the following that if the slaves who were then sickly had died a natural death the loss would have been the owners but as they were thrown alive into the sea it would fall upon the under writers  this gentleman is at present resident in england the author of this essay applied to him for some information on the treatment of slaves so far as his own knowledge was concerned he was so obliging as to furnish him with the written account alluded to interspersed only with such instances as he himself could undertake to answer for the author as he has never met with these instances before and as they are of such high authority intends to transcribe two or three of them and insert them in the fourth chapter they will be found in inverted commas  one third of the whole number imported is often computed to be lost in the seasoning which in round numbers will be   000 the loss in the seasoning depends in a great measure on two circumstances viz on the number of what are called refuse slaves that are imported and on the quantity of new land in the colony in the french windward islands of martinico and guadaloupe which are cleared and highly cultivated and in our old small islands one fourth including refuse slaves is considered as a general proportion but in st domingo where there is a great deal of new land annually taken into culture and in other colonies in the same situation the general proportion including refuse slaves is found to be one third this therefore is a lower estimate than the former and reduces the number to about   000 we may observe that this is the common estimate but we have reduced it to  0000 to make it free from all objection ‡ including the number that perish on the voyage and in the seasoning it is generally thought that not half the number purchased can be considered as an additional stock and of course that  0000 are consumed within the first two years from their embarkation  that part of the account that has been hitherto given extends to all the europeans and their colonists who are concerned in this horrid practice but we are sorry that we must now make a distinction and confine the remaining part of it to the colonists of the british west india islands and to those of the southern provinces of north america as the employment of slaves is different in the two parts of the world last mentioned we shall content ourselves with describing it as it exists in one of them and we shall afterwards annex such treatment and such consequences as are applicable to both we have only to add that the reader must not consider our account as universally but only generally true  this computation is made on a

might claim them again unless they were marked we do not mention this instance as a confirmation of the passage to which it is annexed but only to shew how cautious we ought to be in giving credit to what may be advanced in any work written in defence of slavery by any native of the colonies for being trained up to scenes of cruelty from his cradle he may consistently with his own feelings represent that treatment as mild at which we who have never been used to see them should absolutely shudder  in this case he is considered as a criminal against the state the marshal an officer answering to our sheriff superintends his execution and the master receives the value of the slave from the publick treasury we may observe here that in all cases where the delinquent is a criminal of the state he is executed and his value is received in the same manner he is tried and condemned by two or three justices of the peace and without any intervention of a jury  particularly in jamaica

slavery should consider those africans whom they call negroes as the descendants of canaan when few historical facts can be so well ascertained as that out of the descendants of the four sons of ham the descendants of canaan were the only people if we except the carthaginians who were a colony of canaan and were afterwards ruined who did not settle in that quarter of the globe africa was

ptolomy many ages after these settlements there was another eruption of the cushites into these parts under the name of saracens and moors who overran africa to the very extremity of mount atlas they passed over and conquered spain to the north and they extended themselves southward as i said in my treatise to the rivers senegal and gambia and as low as the gold coast i mentioned this because i do not think that they proceeded much farther most of the nations to the south being as i imagine of the race of phut the very country upon the river gambia on one side is at this day called phuta of which bluet in his history of juba ben solomon gives an account † when america was first discovered it was thought by some that the scripture account of the creation was false and that there were different species of men because they could never suppose that people in so rude a state as the americans could have transported themselves to that continent from any parts of the known world this opinion however was refuted by the celebrated captain cooke who shewed that the traject between the continents of asia and america was as short as some which people in as rude a state have been actually known to pass this affords an excellent caution against an illjudged and hasty censure of the divine writings because every difficulty which may be started cannot be instantly cleared up  the divine writings which assert that all men were derived from the same stock shew also in the same instance of cush p   0 that some of them had changed their original complexion  the following are the grand colours discernible in mankind between which there are many shades white  —olive—  copper brown   black  see note p   0 to this we may add that the rest of the descendants of ham as far as they can be traced are now also black as well as many of the descendants of shem  diseases have a great effect upon the mucosum corpus but particularly the jaundice which turns it yellow hence being transmitted through the cuticle the yellow appearance of the whole body but this even as a matter of ocular demonstration is not confined solely to white people negroes themselves while affected with these or other disorders changing their black colour for that which the disease has conveyed to the mucous substance † the cutaneous pores are so excessively small that one grain of sand according to dr lewenhoecks calculations would cover many hundreds of them  we do not mean to insinuate that the same people have their corpus mucosum sensibly vary as often as they go into another latitude but that the fact is true only of different people who have been long established in different latitudes  we beg leave to return our thanks here to a gentleman eminent in the medical line who furnished us with the abovementioned facts  suppose we were to see two nations contiguous to each other of black and white inhabitants in the same parallel even this would be no objection for many circumstances are to be considered a black people may have wandered into a white and a white people into a black latitude and they may not have been settled there a sufficient length of time for such a change to have been accomplished in their complexion as that they should be like the old established inhabitants of the parallel into which they have lately come  justamonds abbé raynal v   p     † the author of this essay made it his business to inquire of the most intelligent of those whom he could meet with in london as to the authenticity of the fact all those from america assured him that it was strictly true those from the westindies that they had never observed it there but that they had found a sensible difference in themselves since they came to england  this circumstance which always happens shews that they are descended from the same parents as ourselves for had they been a distinct species of men and the blackness entirely ingrafted in their constitution and frame there is great reason to presume that their children would have been born black  this observation was communicated to us by the gentleman in the medical line to whom we returned our thanks for certain anatomical

to be found in the same parallel one of whom was black and the other white it would form no objection against the hypothesis of climate as one of them might have been new settlers from a distant country  suppose without the knowledge of any historian they had made such considerable conquests as to have settled themselves at the distance of  000 miles in any one direction from colchis still they must have changed their colour for had they gone in an eastern or western direction they must have been of the same colour as the circassians if to the north whiter if to the south of a copper there are no people within that distance of colchis who are black  there are a particular people among those transported from africa to the colonies who immediately on receiving punishment destroy themselves this is a fact which the receivers are unable to contradict  the articles of war are frequently read at the head of every regiment in the service stating those particular actions which are to be considered as crimes  we cannot omit here to mention one of the customs which has been often brought as a palliation of slavery and which prevailed but a little time ago and we are doubtful whether it does not prevail now in the metropolis of this country of kidnapping men for the service of the eastindia company every subject as long as he behaves well has a right to the protection of government and the tacit permission of such a scene of iniquity when it becomes known is as much a breach of duty in government as the conduct of those subjects who on other occasions would be termed and punished as rebellious  the expences of every parish are defrayed by a polltax on negroes to save which they pretend to liberate those who are past labour but they still keep them employed in repairing fences or in doing some trifling work on a scanty allowance for to free a fieldnegroe so long as he can work is a maxim which notwithstanding the numerous boasted manumissions no master ever thinks of adopting in the colonies ∥ they must be cultivated always on a sunday and frequently in those hours which should be appropriated to sleep or the wretched possessors must be inevitably starved  they are allowed in general three holydays at christmas but in jamaica they have two also at easter and two at whitsuntide so that on the largest scale they have only seven days in a year or one day in fiftytwo but this is on a supposition that the receivers do not break in upon the afternoons which they are frequently too apt to do if it should be said that sunday is an holyday it is not true it is so far an holyday that they do not work for their masters but such an holyday that if they do not employ it in the cultivation of their little spots they must be starved  these dances are usually in the middle of the night and so desirous are these unfortunate people of obtaining but a joyful hour that they not only often give up their sleep but add to the labours of the day by going

the reader remark that it prevails but in one of the colonies against mutilation it took its rise from the frequency of the inhuman practice but though a master cannot there chop off the limb of a slave with an axe he may yet work starve and beat him to death with impunity † two instances are recorded by the receivers out of about fiftythousand where a white man has suffered death for the murder of a negroe but the receivers do not tell us that these suffered more because they were the pests of society than because the murder of slaves was a crime  a negroefuneral is considered as a
