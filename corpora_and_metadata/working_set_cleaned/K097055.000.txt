an argument showing that the prince of wales though a protestant has no just pretensions to the crown of england  with some remarks on the late pretended discovery of a design to steal him away  london printed for a baldwin near the oxford arms in warwick lane   0   the preface the town has been amused with a story of late about a design discovered at st germans to have stolen away the prince of wales and some of our newswriters have been prevailed with to put it into their public papers and bestow it upon the world  since then he that prints a story subjects both himself and his tale to the censure of every reader i have as much right as another to pass my judgment in the case  and though i am first assured from very good hands that the story it self is a forgery and that at st germains they know nothing of the matter yet i think it may not be amiss to give the world some short observatious upon the subject because i believe they will quickly hear more of it for the story of stealing the prince of wales was not contrived to no purpose but as an anticedent to something which was to come after which the world is to be acquainted with in good time when it is first observed how they will relish this  if what i shall say be offensive to such who are concerned for the young gentleman they ought to be angry with the broachers of the story and not with the author of these observations  an argument showing that the prince of wales though a protestant has no just pretensions to the crown of england among those people who are more than ordinarily careful for the future it has been a question not a little debated what shall we do for a king in england after the decease of his present majesty and the princess in case they should die without issue  and though it be properly a work which no body has any thing to do with but a parliament yet our busy politicians have ransackt foreign countries for a king  some wiser than others have proposed the duke of savoys son the young prince of piedmont some one some another as their fancies guide them ay but says a learned rabbi skilled in the letter of the law he is a roman catholic and that is a bar by our constitution well replys another but he may he sent into england to be educated a protestant at the hearing of which medium a third party have thought fit to start a case on the other side why so may some body else and so all parties become friends again  they that have ears to hear let them hear first we thank those gentlemen for satisfying the world that they despair now of the restoration of k james which has been so long talked of and are content to postpone their happiness to a time so remote that possibly it may never come to pass  and as to the case in hand if they think it proper they may propose it to the next parliament and no doubt but what they do in it the nation will be well satified with and in the mean time we refer them to the experiment  but it may not be improper to examine here the project laid to try the nation how such a story would take with them  and if you examine the newspaper you will find it introduced into the world with a we hear we hear there has been a design discovered at st germans to steal away the prince of wales and to convey him over into england to be brought up a protestant  the writer of this news would be very helpful in the discovery if he would honestly inform the world how and where he heard the news whether he had it by letter or messenger post or express for it is certain that no body else can hear any thing of it  if he will own with more honesty than he wrote that he really invented it of his own head to help fill up his own paper as no question they many times do in other cases it will be the best reply to my suggestions that any body can make and i must allow all i am saying is as impertinent as  knavish  but if he was directed to write it by some body no matter by who it must be from a design  i shall attempt therefore to open the eyes of the world a little by examining the incoherences and inconsistences of the story and then the design of it  as to the incoherence of the story a discovery of a design but by no evidence or information no persons designing taken nor none enquired after to be apprehended no body named to be discoverers or discovered so that they are only supposed to be afraid of such and such a thing and to have doubled the guards to prevent it  then the reason is set down for which he should be conveyed away to be carried into england had they stopped there something might have been meant some mischief might have been supposed to have been designed against him but to clear it up to the world the very bottom of the design is laid open that they should take the child away to educate him a protestant  unless the author of this news was let into the project i speak of he would never have suggested it but all mankind would have thought that if there had been any danger of stealing him away to carry him into england it should be with some wicked design to make away with him his coming being death by our law rather then educate him in the protestant religion  the party therefore that could descend to these particulars though no evidence be produced nor no confession made of any person concerned must i say be let into the design  and now i have said so much of a design i desire to explain what i mean by it  the design i mean is not to steal the prince of wales as they call him away and bring him into england  but to broach an oponion among the people that on the failure of the present settlement the prince of wales is the true and lawful heir of the crown and that to qualify him to enjoy it he may be bred a proestant  and to insinuate this more finely into our fancies it is put the other way that they are afraid the english people should steal him away to make him a protestant in order to have the kingdom whether he will or no  i cannot help making a little sport of this jest    that we should be made believe the late king would be so chary of this child and his religion as to prevent his being declared heir apparent to the crown of england on the bare apprehensions of his being educated a protestant   that the english should be in such distress for a successor to the crown when god be thanked there are two happy lives to enjoy it before hand as to go abroad to steal one   that the crown of england should be accounted so mean a thing that a guard should be set upon any body to prevent their being spirited away from the court of france to be made king of england   and to add to the ridiculous part of it that any body on pretense of educating him a protestant should dare to bring him into england without license from the present government as is expressly provided for by act of parliament they would make a special protestant of him indeed where he must be a martyr at first conversion to bring him where setting his foot was immediate death by the statutes of the kingdom  the insinuation therefore of stealing the prince of wales to make a protestant of him is a figurative expression a metanimy a way of speaking wherein something is intended which is not expressed and if i could make it speak english it is thus  that if you please gentlemen to have the prince of wales to reign over you after the failure of the present settlement he is at your service and will come and be brought up in the protestant religion whenever you think fit  i shall not enter into any discoveries of the nature of the succession of the crown of england nor of the right of such families as pretend to it they are things to tender to be handled here  but in this case i may presume to say that since the present settlement of the crown of england is declared by the parliament of england owned by the world and received by the general ascent of the nation at the end of this settlement the same collective body of the nation are the only judges of the right of any person whatsoever  and as for the gentlemen who are so willing to restore the line of king james they are desired to consider that by attempting it in this method they come under a necessity of owning the authority of the parliament of england the same authority which abdicated his father and by consequence must justify all the proceedings of the late revolution and this will be a bitter pill to them  not but that stranger things than these have been done too for a crown but this must be done before an english parliament can so much as consider of it nay by suggesting or so much as supposing his right to be referred to the english nation it must at the same time be supposed that he would not stick at all that to be declared capable of inheriting the crown of england  these are such contradictory and inconstent things as makes the story very ridiculous and shows the party is driven to strange shifts to bring to pass their designs and would comply with any thing to get the reins in their hands again  now if they only want to know how the nation would resent an attempt of this nature they may be soon satisfied in that point by moving it in parliament and in the mean time they need not pretend to keep a guard upon him at st germain for i dare say the english nation will as soon steal away his father as him and they have not shown themselves so fond of either as to make them afraid of it  i shall not at all enter into the enquiry concerning the legitimacy of his birth nor quote the learned authorities of the eminent mr fuller on that head whose evidence is to as much purpose as the matter is insignificant  for be it so that king james is the true father of the child it matters not one farthing in the title to the crown for his father whose legitimacy no body doubts by being a roman catholic has rendered himself incapable of the government and so does the son and settlements are not to be altered every time he thinks fit to alter his religion  but methinks it remains as an eternal mark either of the folly or pride of his parents that if the queen was really with child which  god forgive me if i am mistaken i never believed she did not put it past all possibility of debate by giving such undeniable proofs of it as it is known such cases will admit of and that to those persons in particular as she knew would be very sorry to see it  the queen was not a lady of so much nicety as that she should decline letting such female effects of her conception be known especially to her own sex as would have confounded all gainsayers  nor did she want the vanity of showing those invincible demonstrations to some persons in the court to whom she might have reason to think the truth would have been a particular mortification  the truth then being so easy to be made plain and those easy steps being omitted gives me more cause of doubt in the matter than all the affirmatives of evidence fuller can do for it was not a thing for the nation to prove a negative upon as some have pretended to expect but they in whose power it was once to make it plain having omitted it mankind ought to doubt the truth of it because had it been true none but madmen or worse would have concealed any part of it  nor does the declaration of the present king when prince of orange say any more than that there was ground to suspect it and then concludes that the examination both of it and the right of succession is referred to a free parliament which parliament having settled the succession according to that article on the unexpected occasion of the abdication of king james and his carrying this son on whom the doubt was raised into france to be brought up a papist examining into his birth became needless and it signifies nothing whether he be legitimate or no his father rendered them both incapable by the article of religion and the nation has settled the succession another way  this with submission i think to be the true state of the case and will pass for such with me till i see it stated otherwise by some body that understands it better than i do  but some have started a case which requires a word or two of reply  if the prince of wales be allowed to be the legitimate son of king james and had been a protestant there had been no objection against his title  this has a plain answer in the sequel of the story the abdication of king james did not consist in his maladministration but in his deserting the nation and it may be remembered that there was great struggling for the word in the convention some would have had the word deserted voted instead of abdicated  now if king james deserted the nation so did his son with him and thereby the throne became vacant and the power of government devolved upon such as were next heirs and who they were was to be decided by the parliament who have been allowed to be the judges of the right of succession in all ages  now the parliament did not upon this vacancy of the throne proceed to elect a king as some people are mighty fond of saying and so alter our constitution to an elective monarchy  but they proceeded to examine whose the right of government was and to make a declaration of that right by authority of parliament and king james and his son if he be his son having left the kingdom they declared that the throne was thereby vacant that is by their deferting the people and that the succession ought to descend so and so which succession they farther confirmed by the sanction of an act of parliament  had k james notwithstanding his maleadministration continued in the kingdom though he might have been deposed yet the parliament must have gone upon other measures to have transferred the succession to the crown from him to another head  on this account it is that the king and queen of england are declared rightful and lawful  and on this foundation the young gentleman we speak of though he were the legitimate son of king james and a protestant yet having deserted the people of england with his father has equally abdicated the government and the throne was thereby vacant  the point of religion is the next bar the commons of england at the first meeting of the convention did not make any new laws but only made a declaration of what was before the undoubted right of the people of england and what ought to be observed by any prince who should hereafter succeed in the government and in order to obviate all objections against the continuing under the government of king james and before they had entered upon ths consideration or his having gone away and left them they laid a firm foundation of a regular government in a message to the lords carried up by mr hampden and a body of their members in which the vote of the house was read at the bar of the house of lords thus  resolved nemine contradicente that it is inconsistent with the constitution of this protestant kingdom to be governed by a popish prince  now how a popish prince may pretend to be converted and turn protestant to obtain a crown and how often he may turn and return on the same account and whether the settlement of the succession is obliged to change with him or how far a parliament would think themselves obliged to take notice of such changes of the religion of a prince these are things not for me to determine  but this i dare be free to determine that no parliament will send into france to steal away a prince to make a protestant of and so force him to accept of the crown of england whether he will or no and especially a person whom they thought fit to leave wholly out of their settlement before  so that these gentlemen may save themselves the labor of attempting the conversion of this prince for the settlement of our succession was not built upon his being a roman catholic but upon the abdication of his father and so far upon his own as his birth shall appear to give him a title since he has from that time forward absented himself from the kingdom to which his pretenses if he had any were to be made  it may be asked here to what end and purpose k james conveyed him away if he had any confidence in the possibility of clearing up the point of his legitimacy he might have left him here it was impracticable that any violence could have been pretended to be acted upon him for nothing could have been charged upon him if the illegitimacy of his birth had been alleged the proof would have been put upon the nations side till which nothing could legally have been done to his prejudice but as it is the proof remains at their own doors which since they thought fit to omit i see no concern the nation has in the matter  for suppose q mary had really been with child and had for as wise ends as other things were then done thought fit never to let it be known and a child had been born in the dark and bred up in private and the nation knew nothing of the matter but that twenty years after when the parliament might have settled the succession another way this child should be trumpt up as a right heir to the crown  it would be never the less true that he was k jamess son and he would have as much right to the crown as a real son but who would have believed it would not the nation say and reason good why was it not told us that the queen was with child why was not some of the royal family entrusted with the knowledge of it why was not the queens being with child made known and the protestant ladies of the court shown such proofs of it as that they might be able to testify the truth of it  would it be enough to say it was below the queen to trouble her head about it and she did not think the satisfaction of the nation worth her while  i question whether any nation in europe would accept of a king upon such terms we see it is quite otherwise in france where all the princes of the blood are at liberty and claim it as a privilege to come into the very chamber of the queen when she is in travail and to see the infant as soon as it is come into the world  the case thus stated i put it upon all the champions of their party to disprove the argument which i lay down in these few words  that the persons on whom the proof of his legitimacy lay having omitted the legal demonstrations of it which they ought to have given it is very reasonable that we should question the truth of it  and while the ligitimacy of his birth remains a question the people of england ought not to trouble their heads about him for it is not for us to enquire of it but they should have made it out whose business it was  thus far the reason of the case is plain without any need to go to proving of negatives  and while it is thus they may even take their double guards off of him again for if he is ever kidnapd away to make a protestant of we must be reduced to very hard terms and the english crown go a begging at a most pitiful rate  i confess i am no friend to a commonwealth government in england when i reflect on the last how ill it was managed and how soon it fell into disorders and parties and how little a while it continued but i had rather see a commonwealth set up or any thing popery excepted than that we should be brought to seek a king at the french court and one that we have repudiated as born in huggermugger no body knows how nor where and that his mother did not think it worth while to give the english nation satisfaction about when she was with child but on the contrary scorned the attempts of some of the first quality to make the discovery  but that which adds to the banter too is that we should steal him away bless us all that we should turn kidnappers for a king and spirit folks children away for let him be whose son he will it is certain he is some bodies to make kings of them  the truth on it is it is not a light matter to be a king of england it is a post of great difficulty as well as honor and perhaps k james may be afraid to venture his son least he should have no better success than himself which would certaily fall out if he took his measures  but to think that the english nation should ever entertain such thoughts of his son allow he were so as to take him away by stealth i cannot call it an affront to the nation it is rather a banter upon the poor young gentleman who i dare say knows not a word of the matter  i remember i have heard it said before the fire of london happened news was carried down into the country that the city was burnt and was reported publicly above  00 miles from london at least two days before the fire began which was a certain token of a design to bring it to pass  if i should judge of the present case by the practice of those people i should expect to hear next post that this young prince is really lost carried away etc to the unspeakable grief of his parents and the disturbance of the whole court etc  i shall not venture to say it will be so but i may venture to say there are several turns of state in the world which such a thing may answer  as first if it should be true that at the bottom of the business this was not the legitimate son of k james which however uncertain we are of it it is well enough known to themselves  why now they see the sham will not take and they have ran the jest so far as that they have ruined themselves and the show is over they will of course be soon weary of the child and as a plot made a prince of him so another may reduce him to what they please he may be lost in the dark and be heard of no more and give it out that the english have carried him away to reserve him in petto as the pope does his cardinals to make a king of him when they want one and in the mean time bring him up a heretic  this is an easy way to be rid of him whenever they please and so the poor young gentleman had better have appeared in the world what he really was  nor do we want instances of impostors set up in the world to personate princes who have afterward vanished as they came when the persons who set them up could not bring to pass their designs by it  or if we should suppose that the king of france has his eyes on the succession of england as he has lately had on that of spain in right of the duchess of burgundy and possibly may oblige king james to make the second experiment of leaving him the crown by his last will and testament i do not say such chimeras as these are in the heads of any body but i do say that if they are twill be absolutely necessary to remove the person we are speaking of out of the way  and what likelier project can they have to rid themselves of him and as they may think at the same time to make the nation uneasy then to give out that the english have carried him away to make a protestant of him  these are ends i say that such a thing will serve and i may be excused making such remote guesses and suppositions for none of them are so wild and chimerical as the fancy of bringing him hither  and if any such measures should be taken with the young gentlemen i think a single author may venture to enter this protest in the name of the whole nation that it is a trick of their own and the english nation can have no hand in it  the authority of the nation cannot have any hand in it because they can do nothing in private and it must be known if it had been parliamentary  the honest protestant loyal party cannot be said to have a hand in it because mankind is said not to be able to do that which their known interest forbids them to do and no body can imagine that party should ever design to bring him hither without imagining at the same time that it was to murder and destroy him which god forbid  as to the jacobite english party they cannot design it because twill not any way answer their designs  first if ever they should have power to make him a king publicly it is plain he will serve their turn as well if he be a papist as a protestant or else they cannot be what we call them jacobites that is friends to king james  secondly if they bring him in only to reserve him in petto as i said it must be one of these two ways either publicly or privately  if publicly unless they have a force to defend him they bring him only to martyrdom for our laws will take immediate hold on him and put him to death  if privately to be reserved till the line shall fail he must then reside incognito and if ever the time should come to set him up having been lost so many years no body would know him and the nation would never believe twas he which would always leave room for impostors and setting up sham princes to mise insurrections and disturb the public peace of the nation as in the case of perkin warbeck and ralph wilford in the days of henry the seventh  so that rightly examined this sham will never fasten upon the english nation for it will answer the ends of neither friend nor foe  but if ever we hear that the prince of wales as they call him is lost carried away it must either be that they are conscious to themselves of his being a foster son and the design having miscarried are weary of the adopt and so have dismissed him this world or else that he is removed to try another fetch for the english crown by way of title which if the prince of piedmont dies falls by inheritance the bar of religion excepted to the house of bourbon in right of the wife of the present duke of burgundy who is granddaughter to a daughter of england by king charles the first  and as to the bar of religion pray what is that to a good army what is the gospel to a kettle drum or justice and laws to a regiment of curiasseeres if the french king comes once to have a fair claim to the crown of england for his grandson and you have nothing to plead in bar but his religion he will talk with you about that in other terms   you must certainly expect to talk in the insernal language of fire and smoke and though it is hoped we should have zeal enough for our religion to fight him to the last gasp yet all men must allow the power of france at this time is so great that twould be much better never to have it brought to a trial  finis
