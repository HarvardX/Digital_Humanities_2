athelwold a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants  london printed for l gilliver at homershead over against st dunstans church fleet street mdccxxxi

men and women attendants the scene chester  preface to the reader if there is any thing in my writings that deserves to be remembered they will live without patronage if they ought to be forgotten they would die in spite of protection so i commit them to the world unsustaind by dedication  no patrons authority can protect a bad work  and a good one can want no protection  i am afraid we need look no farther than the dedications of our poetic writings for the source of that neglect which the art itself complains of  while poetry preserved its honesty it was considered with distinction but when it degenerated into a traffic between praise and reward it became despised like the gold of utopia not by ignorance of its value but through scorn of the use it was put to  before i speak of the following tragedy i am obliged to take notice of another the first dramatic sally of my youth and which i should be ashamed to confess i had the folly to begin and finish in a week but that i have occasion from that confession to hope pardon of its faults and admire the english goodnature which received it with undeserved indulgence  it was written on the same subject with this upon mr booths recommending it to my choice it was also acted at the same theater and is still a living evidence against me under the name of elfrid or the fair inconstant  as i knew nothing of the rules of writing the play was consequently an unprund wilderness of fancy with here and there a flower among the leaves but without any fruit of judgment  i know not how it came to pass that athelwold even in that piece deserved some little pity but i am afraid i was too dull a painter to hit a likeness for the ladies  elfrid suffered more by my ill conduct than her own and was a lighter inconstant than the histories of those times have shown her and as for edgar the monarch came out of my hands as one of his successors out of the archduke of austrias stripped of every thing that became his condition and only a king in his title  i therefore considered myself as not deserving pardon from the public till i had purchased it with something better on the same subject  this was the original of athelwold  the new play has neither thought design nor expression in the least resembling the old one and my only reason for troubling the reader with this little story is because should there be any thing in the second attempt greatly preferable to the first it will be a proof that fancy for to say genius would be making bold with what is none of my own wants the aid of the judgment and should have regard to the rules of an art which like religion had an orthodox establishment but like that too has been warped and weakened by mysterious dullness and the dry pride of commentators  i am unable to execute any thing in poetry if i have wasted the care i bestowed on this tragedy  nor can i have so unjust an opinion of the public taste tho i think nobody will celebrate it for poetry as not to know that should there be merit in athelwold there are spirits in the nation who have influence and generosity to awaken others into their sentiments  i say this for the sake of the stage for as to myself the distinction of deserving to be read is all the advantage i propose from my writings  a hill  prologue spoken by mr wilks our authors wishes partial to the stage not for himself your favor would engage not his own cause but ours he would defend nor fears an enemy  nor tasks a friend but frankly bids me own that from his plays he means no profit and deserves no praise yet has he one fond passion to impart one favorite weakness that has warmed his heart constant he doats on a declining fair yet recommends his mistress to your care though past her bloom still tempting she appears a midagd matron  of three thousand years slight not dame tragedy  nor fancy sirs that pain and spleen and age alone are hers old as you think her still she moves and warms smiles through the soul and swells the heart with charms but the vain prude too coy to yield at pleasure vows she will be wedded  or withhold her treasure take her to wife  the match could never be wrong but for one quality  she will live too long could ye for once forgive the serious strain and bear a useful truth undressed and plain  fain would the muse remind you that the stage received most honor from the wisest age athens shone brightest when the crowded scene fired her bold sons  to dare  to act  to mean greatly to copy the departed great and be the chiefs they learnt to emulate warmed by this heat which to their plays they owed the guided passions of a people glowed high beat their cherished hearts in glorys cause firm stood their freedom and long lived their laws charmed into virtue and by pleasure taught the raptured youth the meant impression caught grew up to greatness liberty and arts and snatched the heros from the players parts oh could we live to hail the future day when sparkling folly shall give genius way when low light scenes shall tempt the eye in vain and passions power impress the heart again then shall the muses like their monarch smile and all heavens blessings crown his happy isle epilogue spoken by mrs booth this whining tragedy has made me hoarse yet as an epilogues a thing of course i cannot help telling ye before we part i am glad my husbands dead with all my heart that is one confession  and one more shall be i wish the author were as dead as he his murdering muse in downright love of teizing kills one for being pleased and one for pleasing stabs ethy  cause her love was an untrue one drowns my good man because he liked a new one lud lud  what work twoud make among the fair should every belle be drowned that loves a pair and as for beaux  who make no bones of erring they would fill the seas all round like shoals of herring a fine example truly dont it move ye were it well followed  how twoud soon improve ye send ye in pairs to heaven where good folks trust is martyrs lord help ye of poetic justice i for my part had a sweet race to run i  not to be a queen  must be a  nun no ladies have a care os that  the poet belies the story  and thank heaven i know it  elfrid was wiser and the king was kinder even in the convent he knew how to find her he pious prince loved penitence so well that often he traced it to the loneliest cell confessed the saints himself  blessed occupation freely bestowed his princely consolation and eased the father girards of the nation nay it is no laughing matter  i am serious i meant no mischief i  no hint mysterious ask hollinshead  he will tell ye if it is new to ye that edgar was a lion  at church duty one of his virtues needs must envy raise he was the veriest patriot of his days he not to maids alone thought pity due his will unwearied worked for husbands too dependent princes sent their wives by the dozen to tax this bounty of their royal cozen and eight dubbed monarchs of his own creation rowed him in grateful triumph round the nation this being so  what does our author merit who wrongs a prince  of such a public spirit hang him dull poet  i will say nothing for him in good king edgars quarrel i abhor him  take him among ye  and if ere you would mend him to some kind jesuit for new notions send him athelwold a tragedy act   scene   a rocky coast without the city of chester athelwold elsrid

been left far distant  athelwold shame on this pride that swells the hearts of kings  but that i shunned his widestretchd navy whose expanded wings enclosed you empty triumph we had in safety held on our course for lancaster  and edgar and chesters dreaded walls been passed unseen  elsrid why shunned you edgar you had struck no shoal had jealousy not wrecked you where was the danger had we amid the shouting swarms approached his glittering barge that proud of eight kings rowing methought moved conscious of her glorious freight and felt her sovereigns triumph  athelwold edgar is young amorous impatient hot as the summer sun but as the shadow changing  emma the sister of leolyn my friend must be his queen that day once past that day now near my elsrid trembling no longer for my souls best treasure i shall unveil thee to the eye of edgar then in full luster break upon the court charm the glad world and swell the voice of wonder till then   elsrid till then you think a womans honor is safest when not trusted  come be wise laugh at your sexs notions and see truth unprejudiced by maxim you have been taught that a mans caution guards a womans virtue believe me it is an error  wronged by the doubt we make that doubt our license and grow light to justify suspicion  athelwold of thee not jealous i fear the heart of edgar there is a secret which yet thou must not know  for all the glory fortune could heap upon a happy wisher i would not he had seen thee  elsrid why choose you then to lodge me in the gardens of his palace  athelwold safely concealed in my apartment there while triumph busies the tumultuous court fair as thou art thou may remain unknown till soon we reimbark for lancaster but fate has driven me under edgars eye nor can i shun his presence  a shout at distance the barge triumphant twixt the two sounding banks floats proudly in see the broad sprinklings from the golden oars dashed in gay mists against the glittering sun scatter a liquid lightning  ere the king lands retire my souls soft charmer from this boat that foremost strikes the shore descends a lord wily suspicious flattering base and busy malice and fear divide his motley soul softening submission dwells on his cool tongue but his heart burns with envy  see he lands oswald the states prime minister  retire he must not see thee  look  edwyn attends thy coming exit leading elfrid

goes for loyalty  earl athelwold reenter athelwold fortune befriend your hopes my noble lord as she does ours who on a day like this when sovereign edgar triumphs like a god brings back his godlike favorite to partake a splendour thought imperfect wanting you  athelwold oh it is too kind my lord amidst your cares to waste this fine court rhetrick on a plainness so unadorned as mine  in wars big pomp the king sometimes in the broad battles front finds athelwold most near him but for a day so safely plumed as this a thousand feathers loftier and far more gay than mine had been were proud no doubt to wave in state about him  oswald nay my good lord your enemies must own your valors ablest rival is your reason  athelwold why will you angle with too short a line in depths of cautious honesty  i know you  why will you still you and your envious faction bow to the happy favorite you hate and smile your curses on me  shame on your meanness if i deserve esteem give it sincere if not disdain to court the man you fear and with brave truth renounce me  oswald why thus it is ever distrustful men but nourish new suspicions from the best means we use to quench the old still i am misconceivd  my lord my lord ill agents have been busy  and here comes one reenter edwyn whom oswald should avoid  i will charm the king with news of your return exit oswald  edwyn a newborn love is full of soft impatience  soon as arrived i was commanded to return and press you to shorten your meant absence  athelwold is she safe  edwyn egbert is warned should the king quit the crowd and but approach the garden to conceal her  athelwold then i will fear no longer but expect the king and meet him with a masked smile of innocence  o edwyn should ethelinda know i have married elfrid how wretched would it make her  oswald hates thee as if he read our secret through thy heart saw there thy generous silence which conceals my dearstoln night of joy with that soft charmer who that saw both could think her neice to oswald  edwyn so my good lord would her false servant say that doubly faithless fairone who betrayed to me her ladys honor yet forsook me  athelwold she wronged her mistress but she loved thee surely who in that secret gave up both our honors to thy safe keeping  but since all was told thee twere now a fruitless point of proud reserve with thee to keep that silence which the favored should hold in reverence of a ladys honor as sacred as his glory  oh suppose not because she blessed my wishes that ethelinda yielded like common beauties  edwyn twas plain you loved her for when her horse was drowned in severns ford you from your own leapt rash through the swoln stream plunged on and snatched her sinking  athelwold true i loved her but loved her with desire while in her breast love which at first was generous gratitude drew all its warmth from pity  never never shall i forget how blissfully i won her twas the dear night before this fatal journey i found her edwyn sunk on her couch alone weeping with amorous grief for coming absence loose and enchantingnegligent her dress faint was her air and a kind nameless languor sighed in short heavings from her softened heart and every breath was tenderness and love there while transported on my trembling knee bending i gazed and hung devoutly over her raptured and charmed i plunged amidst attraction sighed on her eyes breathed over her panting bosom and snatched her soul unguarded  millions of vows fierce burning vows of everlasting love transport and marriage and eternal truth thawed her reluctant virtue to belief then  in the soft desires new warmth i pressed her till in the beating tumult of her heart she gave  she knew not what  nor meant compliance fortune renounce me edwyn but my reason prefers her even to elfrid  my passion did not the love she felt for me i feel for elfrid and am unwillingly undone  like her a warlike symplony hark  the king lands the avenging hand of heaven points out my baseness  how shall my guilty eye meet the wronged goodness of the royal edgar how shall i skreen the charms of injured elfrid from the kings sight  what shall my bleeding heart say to lost ethelinda  yet edwyn find her tell her i come while every busy eye hangs on the pomp to sigh my soul out to her say in the inmost garden  the close walk that points upon the grotto  edwyn fatal wreck heaven that commissioned it avert my fears exit edwyn  athelwold alone he comes  i will walk a turn behind these rocks and gather firmness to sustain his eye whom most of men i love yet most have wronged exit  scene ii enter edgar from the triumph atttended by leolyn oswald etc edgar chester this act to times last hour renowns thy name with edgars far as the bounded world gives space for fame to breathe in shall be spread the boast of this days triumph  yet thou say nations whose names lie deep in unborn time will rise and censure and mistake our purpose  leolyn many will judge amiss and call it insult  edgar i know it and despise it my freed soul then stripped of her encumbrance mounting strong shall rise above ambition nor hold fame by the faint tenure of weak mortal praise but from the partners of her bright enlargement spirits that judge unprejudiced and move unbounded and in millions fill those voids which thought even aches to guess at  leolyn the forms of homage differ with sovereigns wills yet are but forms kings suffer not by seemings if they did the shame that follows insult would cut double and wound the wounder deepest  edgar nobly spoke spoke like the friend of edgar and of athelwold  oswald malignant envy will not dare misjudge the virtues of our monarch raised to this height our wishes are outstript and all our task is to receive and wonder at our blessings  edgar no flattery oswald  it is my noblest pride to have deserved applause to listen to it sullies the conscious glory  athelwold  reenter athelwold friend of my soul my lifes best self my light my every wish at once and every blessing  athelwold kneeling my gracious partial sovereign  edgar rise  nor distress me with this vain ceremony bow but to heaven that made thee not a king to make thee more and stamped thy soul divinely  cornwalls daughter i find deserved not i so long should lose thee all thy long letters welcome as they were brought me no hope from elsrid fame it seems deceived us and had flattered her  athelwold she is fair but never could have been that striking charmer so found and lost at once she flames not out with that strong blaze of charms that living fire that burns unquenchd upon your royal memory  edgar no athelwold  i see i hear she cannot else had thy eyes caught fire and streamed it on me else had thy laboring heart oppressed with meaning shook like an earthquake in discharge of passion  thou art a cold describer  oh  the day the dear remembered day when at the altar where in thanksgiving i had bowed to heaven heaven seemed descending on me  my raised eye met her flashed charms amidst a gazing crowd who from the scaffolded cathedrals sides poured their bold looks upon me greatness and languor flowed in a softened radiance from her mien and kindled every shrine with new divinity sweetness sat smiling on her humid eye balls and lightwingd fancy danced and flamed about her scarce were the solemn duties of the place remembered while i saw her  at last  with pain  slow  dragging my reluctant eyes away i lost her  ere religion licensed love to steal a second wonder  oswald strange that since then inquiry should have toiled in vain to find her  edgar one would have thought the light that paints the world might have been lost as possibly as hers but since all search is vain and farfamd elsrid fails my last hope i will redeem my heart and quench the blazing image  danger and arms shall fright the trembling softness from my soul i will resume wars thunder  athelwold  leolyn  help me to conquer wake me again to glory tear me from love  and guide me to renown trumpets without hark  they move on  stay  friends have much to speak of anon we meet again  exit edgar followed by oswald etc  athelwold prince leolyn you had a warlike though unhappy father yon rugged hills have echoed with his glory but that his last too fatal rashness forfeited half wales your patrimony edgar blushing must have remembered when he spoke of love you have a sisters claim  leolyn emma my lord was then a sovereigns daughter now she is sunk to sister of a subject time was when edgar short of his present fortune weighed my daring and vowed my sister should partake his throne he sees me now grown tame an humble suffrer and while he holds my lands neglects my blood and boasts another love to shame my patience  athelwold hope better from him the kings heart is noble and his past promise sacred passions tide bears him aslant and must a while have way unite your means with mine my fate requires your sister should be queen urge rights of faith and leave the event to me  leolyn i can urge nothing let me consess that love the smiling ruin love has unmanned me till my softened heart wants even the will to murmur  ethelinda the gentle ethelinda fills my soul why start you at her name why have you shunned to urge her pity in your friends behalf you saved her life and must have interest in her to aid a lovers wishes  athelwold oh friendship friendship to what will thou reduce me  leolyn i doubt not friendship i speak of love  my love to ethelinda  athelwold be wise and think no more of ethelinda  leolyn bid me not live and i will obey you gladly but when you bid me cease to think of her you bid me live to sense of all deaths pains and die to all lifes comforts  athelwold how deaf is passion you must not think of ethelinda  leolyn i must not  athelwold unless you cease to pres my aid you must not  leolyn great is your power it is true and no where greater than in the breast of leolyn  yet sure a prohibition of such fatal weight owes your friends ear some reason  athelwold i have no reason ruin and fate break in upon my schemes and plunge me in confusion  leolyn ruin and fate schemes and confusion  this disorder proves what i have long feared that where i hoped a friend i fired a rivals jealousy  athelwold you wrong me prince widely you wrong me  leolyn oh  grant heaven i may  ease my impatience quickly then and say whence that confusion rose  athelwold from you from you from ethelinda friendship honor pity spare me the torment of a plainer reason and trust my faith there is one  leolyn is one  ha what plainer reason  perish all my hopes unpitied  let my hated name be blotted from every list of honesty and fame if i renounce not athelwolds false friendship and from this moment hold him for my foe till he discloses this pretended secret that my heart springs to snatch at  athelwold hot leolyn rash headstrong man  now by the eternal power by heavens alldreaded throne thou shall not   leolyn shall not what not marry ethelinda  athelwold impatient leolyn why do thou interrupt me   leolyn impatient said thou i am frost rock ice adamant  perdition impatient i am an anvil  shall not marry her  athelwold i see you moved  and bleed with pity for you you said i was your rival hear me rash man for i will shame suspicion by a trust your levity deserves not  am i thy rival  take then this secret from me yes leolyn woman and love have made a traitor of me i have indeed been false but not to thee i have deceived the king  have married elsrid and found her beauty more than fame had spoke her this known destroys me yet even this i tell to ease the throbbing doubt of thy fond heart  leolyn ease what whom  said thou not that ethelinda must not be mine that ethelmda shall not and while life trembles at it thou would sooth me with a slight tale of elsrid  why do thou trifle with me or do thou know for by my hearts lost hope thou seem to mean it  some black secret story that her fair fame is touched by  ha  by that heaven that doomed me from my birth to wrongs and shame thou have thyself betrayed my ethelinda my tortured memory recollects your looks her bluthes your confusion when by chance my entrance has disturbed your privacies with an unwishd intrusion  oh it is plain thou have destroyed my peace thou have possessed her thou  thou  thy guilty silence owns it proves it was it not so  say answer me  speak tell me  athelwold mad as the winds in tempest  till thou coolst i will not answer thee  leolyn drawing his sword curse on my lifes best wishes if i not force the secret from thy heart or drown it in thy blood  athelwold away light threatner  twas friendships undeserved and generous delicacy that in a tender and unguarded moment has waked a jealousy that will distract thee  honor forgive me if too nicely urged i seem to wrong thy laws  and tell this madman i have myself a claim to ethelinda that blots out his for ever  leolyn married to elfrid and yet a claim to ethelinda too that blots out mine  die and be dumb for ever thou lying babbling traitor  athelwold nay then defend thyself rash boaster they fight leolyn is disarmed  enter oswald with a guard oswald shame my good lords shame on this sudden boldness of dispute so near the royal presence  at the hills foot your warmth alarmed the king and he requires your presence prince  leolyn oh that the kings command were kind enough but to indulge the death proud athelwold despised the power of giving me exit with oswald and guards  athelwold alone why hoped i peace who had declined from virtue the innocent alone act steadily the guilty can but mean it  o ethelinda  in the dark race of vice when once begun we start on mischiefs we most wish to shun pushed by the fate of guilt and thence accursed new crimes grow needful to support the first till from dishonor we to ruin fall and one disjointed virtue loosens all exit  the end of the first act act ii scene i a grove in the palace garden athelwold ethelinda ethelinda all this is false in reason but your eloquence proud of its power provokes you to offend that you may force forgiveness  was it not cold too cold for love in all this cruel length of chearless absence when your dangerous charge too was but to gaze on beauty never to write never to bid me hope the muchfeard elfrid had left your heart still partial to my fondness a fondness that destroyed me turn your eyes from me  they look as they would reproach me do not see me but tell me why you made such speed to leave me had you but staid to add one hour of peace to those of guilty softness had i been yours your wife that fatal morning you do not know what tears it would have saved me  athelwold oh speak no more your words are winged with fire they pierce my soul they enter and burn in me  ost have i trembled as i do now when reverence and desire shot from those angel eyes have warred within me yet never was i thus distressed before  ethelinda that you are generous my fond heart confesses else how destroyed a wretch were ethelinda if like the base among your sex you shunned me nor pitied the kind weakness that betrayed me but added shame to guilt and grew inconstant and left me for another save me ye saints to what a dreadful depth of startling misery had my lost honor plunged me  athelwold graced as you are with artless virtue and unconscious beauty strengthened with wisdom sanctified by truth and sainted over with sweetness  though your voice is tuned to transport and each melting accent shakes to my soul and swells despair to music yet is there something so disordered here that i even wish thee silent  thy soft words moving and warm and gentle as thy bosom strike me like death when his eternal frost creeps in cold anguish over us  ethelinda oh my kind lord to feel this wondrous ecstasy for me this noblest tenderest mark of mournful passion is such a sweet atonement sor my tears that i could weep for ever  be it my glory my dutys pride and my full hearts chief joy to give unbounded love in soft exchange for your indulged endcarment  let me not live if i prefer not that dear name your wife to all those empty sounds those titled nothings which edgar treasures for his unknown queen  my lord  you start  and tremble and look pale come  this quick sense of gratitude and love works too intense and i must chide you for it  athelwold it is too much  and honor and humanity disclaim the brutal heart that could bear this and be less moved than i am  curse on the wild the boundless luxury of wanton love what have i lost what am i doomed to suffer who could heap sufferings here  ethelinda sufferings my lord and wanton love  what love  whose sufferings  athelwold mine mine thou injured truth  who could name wanton and mix a thought of thee  ethelinda but you named sufferings  athelwold what lover lives without em  ethelinda a lovers sufferings once past give present joys a livelier relish the sacred tie that firms a wifes fost claim will free pained memory from the blush of weakness  athelwold aside how mean is guilt that it must bow the heart to falsehood and disguise  new in dissembling i shall betray my grief and shame my art   the suffering that i meant my ethelinda was that an illtimed chance a while withholds our hands but what are nuptial forms to love prince leolyn my friend  alas he loves you loves you my souls sweet pain to such excess that his life hangs but on his hope of you jealous he dies with fear that i am now his rival in your love  what will he feel when i am owned your choice  may not your pity indulge appearance for my friends wished ease till time or accident gives means to save him mean while   ethelinda what would you do mean while my lord you would not sure that i receive him hear him  athelwold that were too much it might perhaps suffice should i more rarely and with caution seek the blessing of your presence  ethelinda my lord my lord you are detected  my taught heart at length blind as love made it sees your baseness through and burns with shame and bursts with indignation this poor deceit was formed but to evade my due repair of honor twas the word wife that made this sudden politician of you   athelwold soften those angry eyes which sparkle on me  ethelinda  away  nor bring contagion to my soul  oh what a dreadful change in my poor heart has one weak moment made  scorned like the vile dishonored infamous despised for ever i must become a wanderer round the world meet cold  and hunger  poverty and shame anguish and insult  better all than man the faithless murderer man  what am i doomed to whom have i trusted oh revenging heaven see my distress and punish me with more i cannot be too wretched  begone deceiver i would not curse thee  i will not wish thee pain but never never let me see thee more  athelwold be not transported thus   ethelinda insolent coldness but i deserve it all  my fairy dream must last no longer and i wake to woe the pleasing folly sinks and in its room rise penitence and scorn and lasting pain now now the shifting scene makes haste to change now now comes on the race of shame and grief which every woman is condemned to run who trusts her honor to betraying man  yet every woman where she loves believes though not to doubt is thus to be undone oh what a difference twixt the calms of virtue and these heartrending pangs of guilt and shame far has your fatal journey outgone all that my slow fears forboded  these are the joys the sweets the transports the eternal rounds of love and tenderness and gratitude which were to charm away my sense of ruin  o woman woman  what is vanity what is belief that though a thousand fall we shall conquer and still hold our conquests  athelwold by the sweet memory of that dearest night  ethelinda curse on the illchosen oath  all you can swear by that will be as false and base as you are loosen your hated hold  i will not hear you  athelwold could you say hated  ethelinda off  by the eye of heaven that saw my faith betrayed not all thy arts shall sooth me to forgive thee  away  be gone  athelwold look yonder  by all my hopes of peace your uncle oswald and leolyn in confrence  oh think  recover your scattered spirits and round the neighboring grot let us take different walks and shun their eye  ethelinda when next i see thee may my woes  athelwold oh hold  that oath would kill me  why do you tremble thus shall we not meet again  ethelinda once  and no more till in eternity  athelwold an hour hence here exeunt severally  scene ii enter oswald and leolyn oswald what and was this your doughty cause of quarrel because he boasts to have won from ethelinda that womans toy you sigh for  leolyn i wish indeed but cannot wish dishonourably  oswald that is you would not tell as he does  why that is generous honor in love is silence  but two such friends as you and athelwold cannot methinks have fought an amorous quarrel  your rivals thoughts are filled with high state projects something like jealousy of trust supposed betrayed  some plot some schemings some aim your caution started at or which your oath to edgar checked your wished assent to something like this no doubt provoked proud  athelwold no matter  fear him not oswald has power and can procure you the kings thanks perhaps even against favored athelwold  as for his tale of ethelinda women are passive agents and when love prompts them can outsuffer martyrs i would not swear he wrongs her yet i think so believe him not till i have sounded her half wales with leolyn a prince restored should please a woman better than earl athelwold a traitor fallen from power  was it not thus speak frankly to your mistresss disposer and let her thank your loyalty  leolyn lord oswald i am unpracticed in the arts of court and my free thoughts range open as my eye balls wronged as i am by athelwold my heart disdains to hide his virtues  he may have wishes he may deceive in love but not in loyalty a brave man cannot serve a prince and wrong him  oswald nobly remarked  in faith your honor charms me we live in dangerous times and men must learn to try the bosoms they would trust their peace in what sudden ruin might not careless innocence draw on a great mans fortune  had i unwarily espoused your interest ere my art had poised your hoped fidelity i had not known you now all that ethelinda holds is yours but what is already athelwolds  leolyn by heaven i cannot bear the insinuated guilt the shadowy doubt distracts my tingling heart and i could kill thee but for trifling on it  oswald kind temperate madman  take my thanks so due to your indulged forbearance  by good saint austin these lovers are the wildest of all lunaticks their ravings have no intervals  but see your smiling stars have sent your mistress hither that madness may be matched and soothed with folly  leolyn oh my full heart  it is she   oswald thou finished lover come  hear me charge her for thee  so ethelinda enter ethelinda alone and cheeks thus rosy  one would have sworn the sun as lively as he looks to day had wanted warmth without a lovers aid to light up that carnation  ethelinda i meant my lord to have left the garden  but mistook the walk i know not how  i found the inner door fast locked  so came about this shadier way  oswald you seem confused methinks  ethelinda but warm my lord  oswald it is a good omen to a lovers hopes that you bring warmth about you  prince leolyn has sighed a thousand raptures in your praise and that he loves you truly take this mark elsewhere he is eloquent  dumb in your company and never looked so like the thing he is not as you now see him  leolyn oh judge not of my pain by this too light description  did not soft termblings seize on my tongue i could have told my passion in words that humbler truths have taught to speak it  ethelinda it is yours my lord by privilege of blood to treat me without ceremony  but  sir if you would have me think you really love swear but to grant the first request i make and i shall wish you happy  leolyn i swear with transport  ethelinda this moment leave me then nor ever more speak of your hopeless passion exit leolyn bowing  oswald i did not think that thou had half this bravry nor knew thee for a heroine  why what a pity this welltimd fierceness this high flash of spirit met not the same deserved success as now when tried against earl athelwold  ethelinda against earl athelwold  oswald against him for him on him or about him i am not nice in womens rhetoric  if i must speak it plainer it had been well you had defended your lost honor there as here your peevish pride  come come  i know you these secrets keep not long in our court air already it is the whisper of the drawing room and by tomorrow the kings grooms will have it  ethelinda what have i lived to hear  is it my lord a wonder that i tremble  who what bold villain has gathered malice from the forge of hell to charge this flashood on me  oswald why thou would call him no doubt sweet athelwold  ay stare  no matter when next you meet my honor against yours great odds as things go now he will be forgiven  ethelinda did athelwold the soft the generous athelwold say this of ethelinda  oswald say it  he sings it boasts it proclaims it  nay within this hour hung it on his swords point and held it out to clear the lovedimd eyes of leolyn  ethelinda oh  illknown athelwold where shall afflicted ruin rest concealed if in a breast like thine it finds no shelter only forbear to curse me  i do not kneel in hope of fruitless pardon  infamy and scorn and want and shame are light revenge to what i feel within me  conscious remorse and rage at my own weakness plunge despair and agony and madness through my breast and i thou would be a slave if i could wish to live and let the suns broad eye look on me  oswald rise ethelinda  and hide thee in thy chamber there as thou can be comforted  anon i will consider with thee what is due to pity what to honor  in yon cross walk of meeting sycamores or my eyes cheat me or i diseem the king  it is he  begone exit ethelinda what brings him hither at a time like this his st more hasty too and his raised look more ardent and intent than i have seen it  enter edgar edgar oswald  where is she  passed she not this way  oswald who gracious sovereign  edgar she  the only she  star of my hope the phantom of desire the power that through my eyes rushed on my soul and reigns unnamd within me  mounted but now i led the shouting thousands slowly on rounding the hill beneath the terrassd garden there from above her angel form looked over and beamed amazement on me  as once in arms thou did behold me like the lightnings flash shoot from my saddle to the aid of athelwold dismounted and in danger such was the fire with which i leapt from my widestarting horse that sidelong fled my shadow low on the ground i knelt and gazed up at her  the sudden stop spread an alarm throughout and the checked triumph halted in short confusion  this when she saw surpised she darted inward from my sight and left despair behind her  oswald was it now my evergracious lord  edgar this instant now blessed by unusual chance a private key gave me swift entrance through the postern door to seek her in the garden  am i awake enter elfrid look oswald look  again the shining vision breaks on my glowing eyes  thou pride of daylight thou fairest loveliest noblest work of nature if thou art mortal as my beating heart and my fierce wishes promise how have i lost thee where is the happy corner of the world that could thus long conceal thee  elfrid aside again the king  such was the conquering the commanding softness with which he knelt at the remembered altar whence my long woes took date  sir  is it generous with this light freedom of licentious raillery to shock a strangers modesty  oswald madam   edgar be dumb  exit oswald why have those piercing eyes so ill distinguished the reverence of my ardour  license and freedom would in your presence be dissolved to awe and flow in sighs to soften you  this hand oh give it me  and i will swear upon it that my charmed spirits never rose till now in such a tide of extacy  that heaven has left your sex in shade to light up you with every grace that swells desire in mortals or gives your guardian angel pride to view you  elfrid what am i doing whither am i drawn oh the too charming the persuasive speaker i feel his powerful voice in every vein as if my heart expected and confessed him sir  if a woman flattered thus agreeably can judge unprejudiced you seem of birth of honor and of high accomplishment i cannot therefore doubt that when i tell you earl athelwold protects me you will forbear to press upon the solitude i seek and for his sake regard me  edgar if athelwold protects you i am athelwolds protector and you are doubly safe   elfrid perhaps my sovereign  forgive an ignorance that could see and hear you yet waited to be told you were a king heaven has diffused around your speaking air a glow of majesty that marks you royal i should have knelt before and paid this duty undoubting that i owed it  edgar rise  dear divinity and charm me with the sweet the heavenly name you must be worshipped by  you said that athelwold was your protector are you of his blood nothing but that can make him dearer to me  elfrid ask me not what i must of force conceal and should have more concealed but my surprise drew it unpurposd from me there is a reason a powerful reason why i must insist you suffer me to leave you my stay would ruin me if you have ever felt an amorous tenderness and have not feigned it now you will not wish to make a woman wretched  i dare no more than this  you cannot love if you detain me  edgar riddles and torture  my charmed soul is filled with unspoke meanings for an age to come and you are measuring moments  elfrid are you a king is it your right to rule  command your passion  there is a liberty that dwells with love too brave for forced submission  stir not to follow me for if you do by all that is holy here and dreadful in eternity i swear i will be lost for ever exit elfrid  edgar the conscious grandeur of her inborn pride inflames her for a queen awed by her frown i stood insensible and unresolved nor knew that i obeyed her  how blind is love who would have hoped this softner of my soul while athelwold was wandering in her search was of the blood and in the house of athelwold in vain proud man with busy blindness strives and through long mazes each dark purpose drives lost on the depth of heavens unsounded will we still float doubtful yet are active still unwearied with mistakes err on content and deviate into blessings never meant  end of the second act act iii scene continues oswald and leolyn leolyn patience  curse patience why do thou talk of patience with the same breath the same cold tasteless calmness that spoke distraction to me have thou not told me that she confesses it that this proud beauty this haughty fierce disdainful marbly virtue that scorned my honest passion this austere frowner has been  perdition on the name twoud choke me  have thou not fired me with the basest truth that ever stung the heart of a fool lover and do thou talk of patience  give it to statesmen i spurn the servile lesson patience said thou rage and despair have broke upon my soul and washed away all patience  oswald my spirit thank heaven is none of these wild fiery racers that like a spark in flax if not strait smothered burns up the road it runs through yet i feel warmth when chafed by provocation and let me tell you there may be ways and we may find em prince to reach this proud presumer  leolyn i must not aid thee he was my friend and then my life was his by tie of duty  he was since my enemy and then again twas his by claim of conquest i have lost revenge to honor  i have no right to lift my arm against him for from a hand obliged as mine has been justice itself would redden into murder  but were i oswald wronged as thou art and free to weigh those wrongs without this counterpoise of obligation i would hunt athelwold to the worlds verge nay would leap after him and snatch at vengeance through the unfathomed depth of dark eternity  oswald i too perhaps who have as light a spring as you prince leolyn might try that dreadful leap could i be sure that it was bounded but by depth and darkness but should there lie some realm of light beyond i should look foolishly when i fell through to find my state grown worse than twas before and no road back again  methinks it is strange that you hot fighters friends of barefaced anger have never learnt our safer courtly art of vengeance without danger  you injure me and i assault you openly  man against man gives chance an equal cast it is you or me suppose as first you wronged you now should kill me where is vengeance then  what equity is here no  let me pay the affront with a first blow whereby i hazard nothing that sets us equal and if i not strike home he is then at liberty to stand on even terms and try once more  leolyn what dare thou do for ethelindas honor  oswald force him  to please her on and marry her  leolyn he cannot marry her  oswald why truly he who has unmarried won what others marry for will wed at leisure  leolyn cannot  i say  death thou art such a trifler  oswald if you had said he would not marry her your doubt had erred with likelihood  but that a man has taught a maid what wives alone should learn and cannot therefore make that maid his wife is a new point in logic  troth i have seen the court thick sown with these instructed virgins who all grew up to husbands and sometimes have even learnt on for life from their first teachers  leolyn tire me no more with this provoking lightness upon a theme that stings me  i tell thee he cannot  mark me  he cannot marry ethelinda because  he has already married elfrid   oswald elfrid what elfrid  leolyn why that farnoisd elfrid what is her fathers name the western duke  death  i remember nothing  cornwall  he the duke of cornwall  she whose fancied charms the king was wise enough to choose this athelwold his ears engrosser and his eyes pourveyor to go and look at for him  a strange mad humor worked in his brain that she might prove his idol his wild church shadow that you have heard him talk of you know it as well as i  what do you gaze at you listen as if i prophesied  oswald it is prophecy and happily foretells the longwishd downfall of our state column  this atlas athelwold who bears the heaven of favor on his shoulders and shadows all beneath him  but are you sure  leolyn i told it not to aid thy dark designings but to lament the ruined ethelinda what will fate do with that unhappy charmer honor forbids me now to wish her mine and he who has undone her is anothers  enter edgar hastily edgar who is anothers  oswald the prince provoked to warmth by news scarce credible and lost in wonder we heard not royal sir your near approach  edgar what news what wonder  warm  the prince was warm yes  the hot british blood your countrys proverb the lightning of your tempers flames i find to its full violence  what mad presumption licensed your arroganee so near my presence to quarrel with earl athelwold to day whose friendship is your fortune  leolyn sir  a prince though fortune wrongs him in restraint of power thinks like a prince as when his throne sustained him  edgar his throne proud leolyn thy father was a rebel  detected treason inverts the vanquished traitors property and he and his lost blood are forfeits all  i love the fearless bravery of free spirits but thy blind fierceness shocks me  urge it no farther a moving pity pleads thy cause within me nor wish i thou should blast it  oswald gracious sovereign the prince unlike his father fought your cause and startles me with news which when i tell you it joins the names of athelwold  and traitor will justify the wonder it has given me  edgar traitor  and athelwold profane conjunction as well might the two poles be pressed to join and crush the unbelieving world between them  take heed rash men when ye dare touch the honor of envied athelwold that ye not fail to prove his guilt till like a sunbeams glare it dazzles my faiths eye and makes it weep or your vile malice shall but fan the fire that kindles to consume ye  what has he done leolyn  oswald  speak  one of ye speak  or must i wait till you invent some wile to skreen your trembling envy  what would ye say of atheldwold  oswald prince leolyn asserts that he has married the famed western beauty and has described her falsely  edgar after a pause malicious ignorance oh that the power that rules the heart of man would ever thus make mischief impotent  see now this falsehood learn to know this traitor this athelwold whom your inferior souls want sympathy to judge of  his hearts refinement his elegance of will adorning duty has plotted with a subjects sweet deceit to cheat his king to ecstasy  by heaven i had not known but for your bold mistaking that he had formed this dear design against me to night he means when triumphs weary noise is hushed in darkness and my mind unbent has room for mighty pleasure to surprise me to pour upon my unexpecting soul a tide of gladness he but held it back to make its flow more welcome  but i have seen her thou too have seen her oswald  the big joy bears down all memory that you both presumed to wrong the man i love and i forgive it that you may learn to worship athelwold  oswald nay i have ever said even to his enemies that he was formed for loyalty  leolyn this doubling statesmans baseness and the joy of his imperious master have uprooted the prudence of my patience  i must speak though every glance of his disdainful eye shot a new ruin at me  sir  by this transport of a blessed lover near his promised joy judge of the vastness of my sisters grief whom lone despair and sense of hopeless love abandon to distraction  edgar is it well done to choose this time this place and this rash manner to goad a conscious frailty  leolyn tomorrow sir had been too late for when your heart is filled with elfrid and with rapture how should i hope there can be room for thoughts of a past promise or absent emmas claim  edgar now by the stings which thy abrupt unartful insolence has roused to fix their points on my touched heart the power of millions warring on my realms should never force me to thy sisters arms had she a charm for every fault of thine nature has cursed her with one single stain that blots out all her virtues the part she shares of thy rebellious blood is bane to love  o athelwold how am i blessed in thee the guilt of others held against thy worth reflects it stronger on me  well may traitors malign thy loyalty antipathies hate by the law of nature  take his sword why have i power if not to curb presumption when it insults my pity  see him a prisoner in the castletower and when i am no longer angry  ask me what i resolve concerning him exit edgar  leolyn it is well the world and i grown weary of each other can separate without sorrow  oswald see if good fortune brings not earl athelwold into the garden dissemble your concern and i will move him to stir in your behalf and reconcile you to the kings pardon  leolyn shame on thy supple soul thou art the moving shadow on the dial pointst at each different hour with equal ease but measuring all art nothing   oswald by good saint austin an apt and keen conceit  the castletower and solitude will ripen meditation till your wit quickens and your fire flames double  enter athelwold starting at sight of leolyn athelwold prince leolyn  of all thunwelcome world the last i would have met retiring  leolyn hold sir  a word   oswald he has bcthought him of my good advice and takes the hint he scoffed at   leolyn when my friend serves me i forget him not  let me discharge a debt my full heart owes you it may be long ere we shall meet again therefore before we part i judge it needful to whisper in your ear  that athelwold is a detested villain   athelwold drawing a villain leolyn  after a pause yet  keep thy life  thou have been injured by me  the wrongs that i have done forbid revenge against the wrongs i suffer puts up his sword  leolyn racks on thy heart forbid revenge how dare thou name revenge thou loose betrayer thou reproach of greatness thou dignified deceiver revenge  great heaven let ethelindas ruined innocence riseon thy trembling soul  twill fright revenge and shake thee into sense of silent shame thou calm cold ruiner  athelwold nay now thou know thou wrongst me i have been too resolved and dared a guilt i will not dare to justify  farewell when in some cooler moment thou deserve to hear my serious thoughts i may confess i have been faithless to thee  leolyn stay  ere thou go let my exulting heart proclaim one joy edgar betrayed like me has power and will to punish his betrayer  i have told it oswald already knows  the king too knows it and the whole world shall join to curse thee for it that thou have married elfrid  that happy secret was all that fortune lest me for my vengeance and i have given it to the tongues of millions  athelwold thou have not done that outrage on thy honor  leolyn not done it  by the pangs which wrung my soul for ethelindas ruin but i have  not done it  twas the last the liveliest stroke that i could pierce thy heart with   athelwold drawing again then thou shall die my guilt absolved by baser of thy own disclaims contrition  reassumes revenge and gives thee up to my remorseless anger  defend thy life more bravely than before or thy hot blood shall blush upon my point to expiate thy dishoncsty   leolyn see where my sword lodged in a colder hand secures thy bravings now boast the welltimd triumphs of thy tongue that safely dares a prisoner  athelwold restore it oswald how or by whose command it is thine no matter  i have not leisure now to ask or hear it give him his sword this instant   oswald my lord i hold it by the kings command  athelwold forcing the sword from oswald talk not to me of kings  less than a god would now want power to keep it  give me the sword on pain of thy own life refuse it not away  nor interrupt us  oswald alas alas how fruitless is good counsel runs out hastily  athelwold here take thy sword and teach it if it can to guard thy baseness  leolyn oh that my boiling blood had no restraint but fear of what thou threatenst  and that this morning had left resentment free nor cursed my memory with that loathed life which since twas spared by thee is mine no more against thee   athelwold perish the poor pretense that covers thy confusion  if aught i did had merit to withold thy arm take notice that i renounce it  i despise thy gratitude false as thy boastings  if thou want yet more to reinspire thy rage and wake thy honor  i will invent disgraces to provoke thee if in contempt of thy too weak resistance i spared thy life  against my mercy weigh my triumph over her innocence who charmed thee that makes the balance even  oh thou have raised me to such a burning such unmasterd anger that i grow base as thou art  and thy blood will stream in vain to quench it  leolyn rail on  i will wait spite of thy arrogance i will wait  nor kill thee till some new injury sets free my rage and blots out obligation  athelwold tortures and fire shall thou inflame me thus  unseat my soul tear out wronged patience from my bleeding heart and work me into tempest then grow cool and insolently mild with stoic tameness hope  thou coudst stop me in the steepest fall of my whole hurried vengeance  no  if thou waitst new provocation it attends thy call this will enrage thee to renew thy rashness strikes him and meet the death i mean thee  leolyn drawing yes  that has done it now thou have freed me from all fond reluctance and sanctified the will that sinned before they fight  oswald without haste  or we come too late  enter guards and beat down their swords athelwold we are prevented  leolyn then i must wait and groan for liberty to thank thee as i ought  athelwold for liberty oh doubt it not  by heaven it shall be thine i will myself find means to force thy freedom that i may claim thy life in just exchange where shall we meet softly  leolyn west on yon terrassd cliff  athelwold expect deliverance ere an hour be past then haste  and find me there  enter oswald oswald quick  seize prince leolyn  leolyn it shall not need my sword is yours again conduct me at your pleasure  oswald to the guards lead to the tower exeunt leolyn oswald and guards athelwold be hushed my heart  forget this rash mans rage and till i meet him next be weak as woman for ethelinda comes and brings reproach that bows me to the dust in conscious shame  enter ethelinda to athelwold ethelinda cooled by a short reflection into hope that i mistook your purpose let me yet say you are wellmet my lord  athelwold oh  would i were the time has been when if we two were met there was no world beyond us  but now i wander like some fabled ghost trembling and earnest to impart his secret yet wanting power to speak it  ethelinda such ghosts they say wait to be spoke to first then they reveal their dreadful wills and vanish  twill be thus with your proud heart soon as i have accused you covered with shame your answer will be short confused and fatal and you will vanish from me alas i fear for ever  look on me athelwold raise your fallen eyes  they once could gaze delighted and hung their beams on mine as both were formed of one divided flame which parted hard and struggled for reunion  teach em once more to fix an unmoved steadfast look upon me hold them thus earnest nor decline their lids till you have answered me this one sad question what have i done that could deserve from athelwold that he should boast my ruined peace to leolyn your conscious eye sinks guilty  my lord my lord the virtue that inspires this generous shame had shown a nobler influence had it taught you that insult always base is doubly so when he who caused the crime upbraids it too  athelwold can you believe me so depraved a wretch so lost to honor gratitude and shame as to be conscious of a purposed guilt thus infamously vile  ethelinda i do by heaven nay know you guilty for since i saw you last my uncle cruelly reproached me with it and told me you proclaimed it  athelwold proclaimed it no i am unhappy but i am not base it were too long and too perplexed a tale while misery lies unloaded on my heart to undeceive thee now  if thou believst i am that low unmanly wretch thou speak me take this dishonored sword pierce my false breast revenge thy wrongs and save my tongue the shame of what it soon must tell thee  ethelinda what would thou tell me thou tremblest and i read some dreadful meaning that struggles to break on me  why will thou kneel there glows a generous tenderness about thee which half absolves thy purpose and bids me hear thee with firmness and with pity  athelwold oh ethelinda   ethelinda out with it  speak  would thou not say  i hate thee  athelwold no by my soul though time has changed my love it is changed but as the diamond that grows brighter and lost but dust in polishing  it is now no more a fierce wild flame but in its place truth calmer and more lasting it is soft respect it is tender thought kind will and grateful memory it is friendship  it is such love as angels feel who mix their meeting fires  and flame together  ethelinda such was the false the artful eloquence that lured me to my ruin but my heart instructed by distress can now read meanings who that is new in passion could believe that this fair picture of thy faded love but proves thou love another  athelwold what will thou say when thou shall hear me own that fear is just when i confess abhorrent of deceit that love which seemed to root my soul in thee has new transplanted it to elfrids bosom you start as if my guilt were yet a secret though leolyn confesses he has told it for in his illretaining breast i trusted the fatal secret of my double falsehood both to my king and thee he should have added how i was lost  that will and faith and reason at once gave way beneath a weight of passion and against judgment honor love of thee fame and allegiance i was born away till she who should have been my masters queen deceived like thee became  oh  turn aside thy eyes  while i have voice to say  my wife  ethelinda go on   athelwold thou art not moved  some power divine sustains thy gentle soul  ethelinda i pity thee so mean a stratagem shamefully formed to force me upon leolyn and free thee from the pain of long dissembling go on  that i may teach my heart to hate thee this low contrivance this poor trick of art is baser than inconstancy  athelwold sorrow like mine sinks the sad heart too low for artifice and my proud soul outswells and floats above it that i am lost beyond redemption lost my roof that once grew proud in hopes of thee conceals too clear a witness  yet may thou curse me if i not reverence and esteem thee still with my hearts inmost softness thy power improves even by defection lost to my frailer sense my soul adores thee like some nameless being in which the woman mixes with the angel and makes a new divinity  ethelinda thy words thy looks disordered and thy trembling frame fill me with fear and wonder  it cannot be thou should thus moved and movingly dissemble by heaven i will be satisfied  thou say this rival this imaginary elfrid is now in thy apartment i will fly thither and when i have unraveld all thy guilt let loose despair at once and die distracted  athelwold oh stay  for pitys sake for your own sake for mine for the kings quiet   ethelinda i will not be held though kings and flames and war and devastation and death himself stood threatening breaks away and runs off  edgar without what hoa  lord athelwold  athelwold it is the kings voice  edgar what has thus long disjoined thee from my joy hid from thy sight by the dark grot between us thy voice took pity on my hearts impatience and taught me how to trace thee pomp could not please while friendship waited for me sudden i left the unfinished triumph filled with a nobler joy and wanting soul to taste it in thy absence  but thou art grown a lover athelwold an angry lady left thee  is it possible that the unjudging sex have wills so blind that athelwold in love can sigh in vain punish the peevish beauty with neglect and fly to thy kings heart for refuge from her  athelwold i blush  and am confounded  my gracious lord to be surpised in my unguarded weakness by your too piercing eye  yet womans power   edgar teach the tall pine to bend before the wind  what has not edgar felt the power of woman they toy with scepters  and the frowns of kings serve them to smile at when the wanton tyrants play over their soft triflings to the heart they set their eyes on fire to light us up then melt us into warmth that softens wisdom and we receive the stamp their folly gives us but why have thou deceived thy princes trust thou art for ever forming some kind plot to quicken pleasures relish by surprise but i have now detected thee  and mean for once to spoil the grace of thy design and break upon thy purpose  athelwold royal sir if some malicious foe   edgar yes yes they charge thee and all thy guilt lies open  but thy plottings make loyalty look dull and shame plain duty i have unveiled the secret lead  to thy lodgings when we are there i will convict thee athelwold of such designs against thy sovreigns rest as more than i shall thank thee for  athelwold aside whither will fortune drag me  i am discovered and he but puts on joy to shame my ruin with the contempt of easiness  edgar yes athelwold statesmen shall learn from thy deserved renown from honors thou shall owe my strengthened crown that where the monarch is not blind of heart affection is the favourites wisest art while to selfservers due contempt is shown let friends who seek our interest find their own  end of the third act act iv scene athelwolds apartment elfrid and a lady elfrid what does her coming mean  he could not send her of what distinction seems she  lady in her deportment awfully sad or proudly angry madam  elfrid i saw her from the window she seems much moved and carries in her face a kind of war of sorrow against pride that shades yet softens the rigor of her beauty as i have seen a hovering cloud obscure too fierce a sun and make his influence sweeter  said she my lord commissioned her to see me   lady madam she did on sudden business of the utmost consequence to your own peace and his  elfrid look  what impatience she stays not your return  wait within call exit lady enter ethelinda i thought myself so much a stranger here that i receive you madam in surprise i may have cause to blush at when i have learnt to whom i owe this favor  ethelinda you owe it madam to the too liberal will of one whose favors more of your sex than you have been obliged to so kind a purposer as athelwold means much he leaves imperfect  you had rather he should have come his own ambassador than sent a representer such as i am unqualified to smooth your angry brow that frowns cold welcome at me  elfrid i frown indeed to hear the name of athelwold pronounced with this familiar license  sure you know him with more than common intimacy madam who treat him with this frankness  ethelinda if to have been his intimate may license frankness toward him the court has claimers who can dispute their title to your lover by rights of longer date and juster tenure than those you hold him by  elfrid your pardon madam i find i was mistaken in your purpose but twas my womans error she informed me you came from athelwold had she said for him i should have better known with what respect to entertain your visit  on my word he was unkind to give a lady pain who lost him thus reluctantly  you watch his first return to court with eye too keen to be so coldly looked at  ethelinda though he told me his roof concealed a witness of his guilt i took you for a shadow but i perceive his falsehood may be trusted when he speaks of his own baseness  think me not abrupt  if oaths had power to bind he should be mine triumphant in the prosperous pride of beauty your easy scorn insults the miserable unconscious of their anguish  sense of lost peace perhaps transported an afflicted heart and i appeared too warm  i shall no more invade your wished repose all i would ask is  pardon the dreadful question are you the wife of athelwold  elfrid the wife what right of claim could he presume to me but what that title gave him  ethelinda farewell  for ever kneel and pray heaven to whose indulgent hand you owe attraction to increase and guard it else will your destined ruin soon instruct you that he who tempted by your charms betrayed his hearts vowed mistress and deceived his king will for some new temptation give up you and leave you subject to anothers pity as i am now to yours  elfrid stay madam stay you have alarmed me to my inmost soul and i adjure you as you hope return of your departed peace not to go hence till you explain the fatal mystery which your last words were filled with   ethelinda the part i bear in the black meaning my sad soul determines to feel in silence till i shake it off to distance whence it can return no more  for you the king who sent this trusted favorite to court you to the bed of royal edgar not that of athelwold  the king thus wronged will punish your false lover with revenge which amidst all my agonies i dread and tremble for his woes who has destroyed me  elfrid o my foreboding heart  a thousand wonders a thousand mysteries at once revealed come rushing on my memory  now athelwold no longer is it doubtful to my thought why the kings eye was judged more dangerous than shoals and rocks and shipwrecks  now the mystery of royal edgars words so lately heard opens unveiled upon my frighted soul and pain and terror and confusion shake me oh cruel undeceiver why have you waked me why have you torn me from my joyless calm which though it gave no transport lulled me in quiet and kept these storms of life from breaking on me  enter lady lady madam  the king   elfrid what would thou say  lady the king is entering here and my lord with him  scarce had i breath to fly before  and give you notice  elfrid save him kind heaven  teach me some angel to avoid this king teach my distracted heart to scape this precipice which way may we retire  yon inmost door opens upon the gallery  lady it is locked and they are here  ethelinda oh the severe resolve of righteous heaven they come  i tremble for this false mans fate and my unwilling feet are rooted here  enter edgar followed by athelwold edgar why do thou linger athelwold  look here the secret thou would have withheld yet longer shines out like the suns heat to gladden nature and make creation smile  elfrid  my queen soul of my kingdoms hopes my fame my glory thou art his gift  oh let thy angeltongue join to confirm my vow to this loved friend this friend to whom i owe the sweet surprise that i thus gaze upon thee thus approach thee lend me thy wished consent to firm this oath which by my souls eternal hopes i swear that day and night shall cease and time be lost and natures slackning springs unwind the world ere i forget his interest in my heart or hold my athelwold less dear than now  elfrid confirm his oath kind heaven  edgar thou saintlike goodness how shall my swelling heart contain this joy this overpowring gladness  blessed as i am centered in happiness twixt love and friendship i can look down on my neglected throne can see the pride of power rise far beneath me and heaven has scarce reserved one bliss to wish for  ethelinda oh blind blind man exit disordered  elfrid aside her ardent sense of wrongs points at her life and charity compels me to save her from herself exit elfrid  edgar what mean their looks signals of terror and disordered partings why are they vanished thus  ha by my soul thou too art touched with the contagious madness now has some devil malignant to thy truth wrought to perplex thee  no part of earth i govern dares cherish mischief that could wound my friend with this quick sense of anguish  athelwold oh that all language could be expressed by looks or that my king great substitute of heaven could read my heart like that first power who made it  edgar what have thou suffered i think i should have said what have thou done but that i speak to athelwold  athelwold how base how like a coward fighting blind is he who dares commit the crime he dares not own and bold enough to know himself a villain fears least another knows it  edgar stop  say no more art not thou athelwold let me look on thee  no  by thy sacred empire in my heart it cannot be  i am at peace again go on  thy enemies in vain accused thee but thy own words alarmed me  yet my glad eyes have traced thee over and absolve that form even from the power to harbor a mean mind unsuited and deceitful  athelwold what can i say guilt when it meets suspicion or reproach sustains itself within and learns to balance offense by punishment but where it finds compassion and has wronged a generous confidence it ought to blush in blood and has no way to pardon or to peace but this  through death  edgar disarming him hold thy rash hand  and like my subject learn to die when i command thee  can it be possible one brave as thou art should have guilt to justify this fear of a friends eye  is elfrid mine or trusted with the wants that pressed my soul have thou instead of giving robbed me of more and left thy prince a bankrupt unblessed by love and yet deprived of friendship  athelwold what has not love made honor guilty of  turn royal sir turn your eyes inward and in emmas tears read the too fatal power of elfrids beauty how could weak athelwold expect to conquer where godlike edgar fell  edgar heaven it is thy hand when subjects thus from princes crimes grow bold to charge their treasons on their kings example and shame us into justice  true i have erred but mark what difference twixt my guilt and that which thou nor dare to speak nor i to hear by elfrid won from emma love in me proved but too strong for love in thee not love to love was treacherous  but love to honor to friendship loyalty to sworn obedience to all the violated laws of life  what subject though unfavourd dares invade his sovereigns claim  but when that subject is a servant too bound by the double tie of duty and allegiance when beyond all his king his master whom he wrongs selected him treasured his hopes and wishes in his heart lived in his breast partial but in his cause and against warring worlds would have defended him what can that faithless traitors reason urge to match his guilt with mine  enter elfrid hastily elfrid oh  athelwold the injured stranger strong by despairs wild rage breaks like a tempest from your servants care and meditates destruction no voice but yours will calm her into patience  in her hearts anguish she calls on athelwold till shrieks of woe echo from tower to tower your fatal name and the wide castle rings with her reproaches  edgar go  and appease her grief thou source of sorrow free my dimmed eyes from aching at thy presence and leave me to the pain of sharp reflection what thou should suffer from a princes hand who is this wretch by thine exit athelwold too fatal beauty why have i found thee but to lose thee more and change a painful hope for certain misery  elfrid if in your royal heart i hold such influence abate your wonder at my power in athelwolds why were you friends but that your souls had sympathy and purposed each like other  it is scarce a moment since i first learned that when he pressed his passion he wronged his sovreigns meaning yet already i find the fault most yours  love is a leveller and all degrees are equaled where he reigns why was another sent if edgar loved me why was not cornwall honored by your presence when your unnumberd navy swept her coasts in your last guardian circuit  had you then landed indulgent to my loyal fathers prayer from what a dreadful length of destined woe had my sad heart been guarded  edgar i saw thee first unknowing thou were elfrid at the dread altar where from our aweful dunstans holy hands the consecrated oil confirmed me king  how were thou lost so soon  elfrid swear but to pardon the generous though unfaithful athelwold and i will show you we were doomed unhappy but by the will of heaven  edgar kings should be just and such compulsive oaths too lightly sworn make that necessity which might be choice and strip the grace from mercy  elfrid then hear my vow since you decline to bind your doubtful will thus on my knees allpowerful heaven my soul appeals thy righteous throne  hear  and afflict me with every woeful curse thy wrath has stored for perjury if ever i consent to quit the breast or claim of athelwold or should he fall by your revenging hand if i not shun for ever even to death the sight the voice the name of royal edgar  edgar cruel cold proud disdainful  glorious elfrid what has thy rashness sworn  yet let me perish if to have sworn it has not made thy loveliness as awful as divinity  was ever distress thus hopeless could your untouched heart have sense of what mine suffers you would have feared to wound me with this pain of fixed despair  elfrid now shielded by the safeguard of my oath virtue may speak secure and own its weakness there was a time ever athelwold was mine when to have been the wife of uncrownd edgar would have been more than monarchy to elfrid  fatally curious from the deep impression of an alarming dream i saw you crowned hid in a clamorous press that shouted round me and shook the sacred dome with peals of joy  edgar oh tell it me again  was i so blessed that you then thought with tenderness on edgar what was that dream charm me thou rising wonder with each soft circumstance of pleasing pain for while i die with terror of my fate it is heaven to hear it from a voice like thine  elfrid oh sooth not misery  forbear to speak with this untimely this forbidden softness awed by remembrance of my dreadful dream i tremble ignrant of the will of heaven too dimly gleamd upon my distant soul i dreamt i sat and saw the imperial crown placed on your sacred head your form the same as when i after viewed you at the altar and fainting with reflection left the throng soon as the diadem adorned your brow you turned methought with brightness more than mortal held it presented thus and high in air stepped to the seat that bore me when strait a cold a shadowy hand divided us loud shrieks rung through the temple the gay pomp was darkened and a broad sea of blood rose high between us and bore us from each other  edgar thy ominous dream creeps in cold tides and curdles all my veins seek we thou lost inflamer of desire the false the fated athelwold  my heart heaves with unusual bodings powerful pity struggles with justice and it is more painful to me to think my friend should fall to need forgiveness than to forgive my enemy  elfrid this is indeed to reign so reigns the worlds supreme disposer all things but one are subject to his power but even his power itself obeys his mercy proud of dominion yet enslaved to fear kings who love blood through one long tempest steer while the calm monarch who with smiles controuls roots his safe empire and is king of souls  edgar when woman formed to soften man to peace fans his disquiet and gives care increase love is a weakness and to wish in vain were a forced freedom and escape from pain but where our hearts are charmed by forms like thee where passions sympathize and souls agree there to love hopeless is in life to die and languid in void blanks of being lie  end of the fourth act act v scene the garden ethelinda alone ethelinda oh shame why keepst thou this alarming distance cruelly kind press inward on my heart but fright not reason cling not to my thought blot blot remembrance out strike home at life pour all at once oblivion on my soul and quench me into quiet  enter athelwold athelwold madam   ethelinda murderer   athelwold i come   ethelinda how dare thou  athelwold i would find a voice to tell thee i could die to bring thee comfort  ethelinda comfort from thee  false man till thou were base i never wanted comfort  till my wronged heart had weakness to believe and share the pains i gave i knew no grief honor and peace and innocence were mine i never felt a wish that was my own or woe but for another  now thou see me shunned hopeless blasted infamous and scorned cut off from every social joy of life pitied by others hated by myself forsaken even by thee for whose sole sake all other joys forsook me  yet thou dare insult my murdered peace and proudly charitable feed famished hope with the cold alms of pity  athelwold be witness for me that alldreaded power who made my tortured heart and knows it best till elfrids fatal beauty forced my will i never had a wish beyond thy love my hopes dwelt on thee and my doting soul drew taste and purpose from thee at thy voice awakened life leapt listening to my ear and i became all eye whenever i saw thee thou were possession and desire combined all that ambition wished or fancy formed with thee there was no grief no joy without thee  ethelinda inhuman flattery all and smiling murder the barbarous elegance of mans soft art to cheat believing innocence  ever long thy elfrid the resistless charmer  she will hear thee poorly urge the same excuse when some third fool believes thee  athelwold would kind fate point my lost heart a way to prove its pain what would i not with transport suffer for thee to ease the woes i gave  ethelinda one way there is and love and honor point it but have a care refuse not to my kindled hope its claim lest in my halfhushd bosom thou should rouse new swarms of torturing mischiefs whose dire stings will drive us both to madness  athelwold name it to me and if i not obey the wished command think me indeed the wretch thy anger paints me  ethelinda redeem me from the shame i suffer for thee forsake this woman who usurps my right and do a noble justice to my love and thy own injured honor  athelwold she is my wife the laws firm knot has bound her mine forever  ethelinda the wife  o patient heaven what less am i did not i first receive the plighted vow did not i fondly trust the affiancd faith of nuptial contract  if to join her hand in breach of oaths that bound thy soul to mine firms her thy wife and sets aside my claim so sacred and so sworn  then solid rights are shadows and the empty forms of time take place of truth and reason  athelwold twill not be  my soul is torn with a vain war of passions honor and shame and grief and generous pity desire perplexed and strong divided will to dote forever on the guilt i hate and shun the worth that charms me  righteous heaven look down on ethelinda revenge her wrongs do her that justice which in vain i wish her curse this despairing wretch who cannot bless her and dart thy blastful lightenings on a flame no earthly fire can conquer  i am a traitor a mean abandoned starter from my faith a false forsworn deceiver  give me thy pity and if thou can have goodness so extreme refuse me not thy pardon  but for love  alas forget it  fly me  hate me  fear me  oh share not in the misery i am doomed to join not thy virtue to a fate so cursed so fallen beyond the reach of lost relief as the unhoping athelwolds  ethelinda i thank thee thou have awakened me to feel heavens justice  but now so low so poor do thou appear to my returning reason that i hate not my guilt itself more bitterly than thee or than my own weak heart for having loved thee what woman ever shall live beloved and flattered yet timely wise enough to think it possible that one she sees and hears as thou have been she ever can behold as thou art now inhuman sex who smile us into ruin and love us into infamy  begone  fear for thyself kneel pray solicit heaven think not of me or my afflictions more but by repentance wash away the stains from thy own perjured soul lest my shocked spirit when it meets thine in a less guilty world renews its pangs cvn there to see thee tortured beyond my power to bear though doomed for me exit in disorder  athelwold alone she is gone  and i am left to walk the world like a pale shade that shuns the paths of men light searches me too deep  my conscious soul starts inward and escapes the eye of day oh bosom peace now lost  were there in guilt no weight more painful than this lower of brow this eyedejecting sense of infelt shame yet shun it all you who have hearts like men that you may raise the front and look like virtue i hate myself beyond the taste of hope why live i then there is a gloom in death will hide me from my thoughts  yet weigh that well should i die now twoud seem despair not justice twoud look like shrinking from a sense of pain like wanting strength myself to cope with scorn yet meanly leaving it to a wronged woman o ethelinda  what a slave am i thus to have killed thee with disgrace and ruin who never had a stain on thy white soul but one thy pity for thy murderer gave thee for whom became i this black wretch  for elfrid  her who already scorns my traitor flame and burns to the kings wishes  why staid she with him what could she hear what say in that nice juncture hell to my heart into what reptile poorness does a man creep who dares not see his shame  whose crimes compel him to be dumb when wronged because complaint is only due to innocence throws himself on the earth  enter edgar and elfrid edgar athelwold i was once thy friend and thought thee the wealth of a kings heart i trusted thee and was deceived thou in whose breast i lodged my hopes of peace have let in misery on me what shall i do to save insulted majesty from the contempt of weakness  yet convince thee that i can bid my pity be thy punishment  elfrid alas my gracious sovereign wound him not with too severe reproach whom your great soul determines to receive to unhopd mercy  the king my lord too generous to revenge the lovers falsehood on the subjects faith in kind remembrance of your virtues strength forgets your amorous weakness  twere too much for gaining me to lose a monarchs love  athelwold no  madam  i am fallen beneath your favor  kings  born to think supremely know it is glory to rise above revenge  but you who thus can speak and look the queen you are not yet must find it difficult to pardon guilt that robs you of your royalty  elfrid my lord that jealous brow and those reproachful accents wrong the good meaning of a heart that loves you  edgar shame on thy blindness arrogant mistaker so cold to sense of thy own guilt so warm to charge anothers innocence  her prayer first won me from my anger  for her sake i force my struggling soul to mean thee pardon but take it with condition  take it thus gives him his sword and heedfully remark it if henceforth thou dare aspire to elfrid call her thine or talk or think or dream of thy bold claim thou shall not live an hour  till then breathe on the infamy of thy disloyal act is vengeance as severe as i can wish thee  athelwold oh sir resume a gift i cannot stoop to hold on such conditions death would bless me it is what i wish and merit i deserve all punishments but life with loss of elfrid  elfrid shocked and unworthy a debate like this i should be still less worthy could i hear it unconscious of the wound it gives my honor  oh thou eternal ruler of the world here by thy dreadful name i kneel and swear i will be neither athelwolds nor edgars  safe at thy altars consecrated foot in some still convents solitary gloom aweful religion shall benight my eyes and hide me from the world  there will i weep and wish myself forgotten  edgar oh  recall explain or limit the toohasty vow thou mean but to retire till i am dead or till his death who wronged thee  elfrid should he fall for me may heaven refuse my parting soul if i not keep my vow unbroke for ever  edgar hear this  and blush at thy base jealousy thou blind profaner a shriek without  elfrid that alarming shriek rings to my trembling heart and wakes its fear for one more wretched yet  more lost than i exit hastily and athelwold is following edgar athelwold  come back  athelwold a curse on guilt it sinks the brave to cowards  it was once my hearts proud joy to meet my sovereigns eye it is now my souls worst torment  hide me earth from edgars angry brow from my own shame not death itself can hide me  edgar i have bethought me that love and fate deny we both should live the heart of elfrid when thou art no more may teach her to forget thee  i or thou must fall  it was the kings intent to pardon the subjects treason the king does forgive thee but the friend cannot pardon  let us then on equal terms dispute our doubtful claim to death and quiet or to life and elfrid here i renounce distinction give allegiance to the wild winds as thou have done before and seek an equals vengeance for my wrongs draws  i know that i descend and that the throne disdains a subject foe but i disclaim that cold prerogative of a kings safety to teach thee that i need no borrowed power myself the guardian of my injured honor myself my strength when my false friend betrays me  athelwold kneeling o generous edgar my imperial master whose spirit reigns distinguished among souls as among kings thy person think me not how plunged soever in the guilt of falsehood so lost to sense of the unmeasured distance between my prince and me to dare defend one aching atom of this hated breast against a wound he wishes me  no take lays his sword at the kings feet my sword  it has been drawn with some success in your loved cause direct it to the heart of this new traitor at your sacred feet the tainted blood will flow with willing waste and wash away the memory of his crime who lives too long when he not lives for you  edgar rise and provoke me if thou would be kind by some wished mark of arrogance  presume talk insolently of thy worth defy me smile at my swords raised point threaten  accuse  deny  calumniate  any thing but this spare this soft sorrow hide this sweet humility and i shall keep my purpose  o athelwold why have thou pained my soul with this sharp conflict why have thou wronged me into will to hurt thee throws down his sword  athelwold how ill should i deserve your unwishd mercy did not my life become more odious to me than was the guilt i fall for  from my birth with fixed unalterable deadly hate i punished faithless rebels trust me now against myself my sovereign shall not need revenge his wrongs on athelwold  one prayer has boldness yet to urge your royal ear then i have done with wishes and the world  prince leolyn whom i have made unhappy now suffers for my guilt so greatly wronged i shall not rest in death till your tried goodness permits his freedom and bestows on him my forfeit honors and the lands i leave  edgar i charge thee as thy heart would wish my pardon attempt not on thy life wait and expect thy doom from the slow workings of my soul that labors to resolve but knows not how for leolyn thy generous wish has moved me go  bring him to my presence  i will walk and meditate alone till thy return exit athelwold  edgar alone how shall i move in this dark maze of passion it is true my favorite has betrayed me basely but he was first himself betrayed by love that tyrant of the heart more king than i ranks monarchs with his slaves  let me weigh  athelwold by my own wishes and then punish him when i can see unmoved those eyes which charmed him how shall i act at once to shield my fame and satisfy my love  could reasons force tear the unlicensd image from my heart or patient leave to time thunhastend means to bless my fierce desires who knows what chance or death or thought or womans changeful will or my own conquered wishes may produce  kings should however injured do no wrong they cannot err alone since what they act they authorize in others  let me then extinguish low desires lest at my flame i light a nations wishes  i will strive to check this rising passion and forget that she who charms me thus is in my power till i can bend that power to reasons rule  they come  i will avoid them  and reflect what measures to resolve on exit edgar  reenter athelwold followed by leolyn leolyn turn  whither would thou lead me  athelwold in this place but now i left the king  a little farther and we shall find him soon  leolyn stay  for we find in these provided swords what well reminds us of our late parting  thou have performed thy promise with bravery so noble that again spite of my burning wrongs i almost love thee  it cannot need that i should spur thy will to what remains unfinished taking up a sword  athelwold i had forgot it guilt and repentance and the tears of shame had washed the indignation from my heart  methinks we were not born for enemies enough already have we wronged our friendship let us be foes no more  leolyn first perish leolyn did thou not blast my honor by a blow fired with a ruffians boldness strike a prince and can he live to pardon  shame to thy heart or give my glory the revenge it claims or i will brand thee with a cowards marks and teach light boys to scorn thee  athelwold if it must be spare me a moments pause  twill soon be past and death will want to time to sat his purpose  what shall i do  to trust him with my softness to tell him what at my request the king was won to grant him were to seem afraid and shrink from his revenge  o fatal chain of long depending woes that guilt is bound to conflicting passions blast the bad mans hopes and all his thoughts are whirlwind   leolyn come on  thy blow burns hot and i will wait no longer  athelwold hold  leolyn be slow  the chance of conquest is various and unknown  and should i fall thou will have cause to grieve thou did not hear me  leolyn never  till vengeance has been paid its full never will i grow tame and hear thee more  athelwold taking up the other sword take thy own way then  let destruction fall and find thee without shelter  but see the king his coming  in this place prevents our purpose on to the appointed terras  follow me exeunt together  reenter edgar with an officer edgar what oswald told me of a second quarrel renews my anger against leolyn and wakes me into fear of some new consequence from his enlargement  take a guard and bring him to answer this presumption  exit officer  enter oswald oswald oh sir  unhappy ethelinda rests her sorrows are no more  edgar what has fate done  oswald see sir yon terras which oerhangs the sea thence falling steep at once the frighted eye aches down a depth of rocks to reach the surge that breaks unheard below  there walking swift with frantic action in a long loud speech the poor distressed complainer talked and wept to the wild oceani told the waves her woes and listening earnest often in dumb suspense paused for an answer  till at last more shrill she screamd resentment to the distant deep  thou art she cried as cold and deaf as athelwold then sudden from her breast in rash despair snatching a dagger  she with all the rage of a resolved destruction plunged it thrice in her distracted bosom  edgar alas for athelwold how will he meet this sight  reenter officer and guards with leolyn edgar answer me quickly  where is athelwold  leolyn immortal  and at peace  edgar what  have thou murdered him ungrateful and detested murdered him him who alone obtained thy freedom from me and in the generous anguish of his guilt prayed that his titles and his forfeit lands might all be thine whom as he wronged in life he could not rest in death to leave unhappy  leolyn this had been daggers to my guilty soul could he have fallen by me  but like a god who smiles and pardons when provoked by mortals he met my rage with a serene contempt mastered a second time my failing sword and gave me life in punishment  live leolyn he cried and spoke it with an air unmoved superior not insulting  live  and know that had not conscious guilt a point more strong than thine  no wound could reach the breast of athelwold  yet though he will not be compelled to die he chooses not to live  for he has wronged thee come and see justice done thee  at that instant the shock of ethelindas dreadful fate heard as we passed upon the extended terras alarmed his care too late  i saw him sir   edgar go on   leolyn i saw him sir as i drew near raise his fallen victim from the bloody ground and on his cheek support her bending head but her weak joints soft sinking from their trust she hung sustained and bled upon his bosom he groaned  looked wild  called loud upon her name and for a moment stopped her flying soul twice at his voice she stretched her dying eyes and gaspd  and struggled  and would fain have spoke but failing  in a short convulsive sigh breathed out her soul  and sunk upon his bosom he  standing near the downfall of the cliff strained her with rapture in his circling arms o leolyn he cried forgive me now tell the wronged king i leave his elfrid free and thus too late do right to ethelinda  then springing furious over the dreadful rock leaped with the dead to death  together both fell frightful to the deep which closing over them veils them from sense of woe in rest forever  edgar great was his guilt and greatly it is atoned nothing is safe but innocence  be it your care to send out boats that their recovered bodies may rest beneath one marble over which i will erect a cloister and endow it for hourly prayers to heaven to rest their souls  haste all and watch the afflicted elfrid near assist her  guard her  wait at her apartment and save her from her sorrow  oh leolyn be obstinately just indulge no passion and deceive no trust let never man be bold enough to say thus and no farther shall my passion stray the first crime past compells us into more and guilt grows fate that was but choice before  finis
