third edition  london printed for r blamire in the strand  mdccxciii  the life of john trueman many lives have been written of men famous in the world the following is the life of a poor daylabourer hardly known beyond his parish his name was john trueman his father was a very honest man but having nothing to live on except his own labor he had little to leave his son but his blessing and a good example  when the old man died john was a servant with farmer clarke who took an affection to him from his youth and treated him like a child with him he lived nine years and served him faithfully having never had any other master for he did not like change he was always a clever active lad never spared himself served his master as he would have served himself never learned bad words was always endeavoring in his spare time to improve himself in reading and writing and was such a lover of truth that i have heard farmer clarke say he never told him a lie in his life whether it made for him or against him the farmer used to say all came out just as it was this is a very good property in a young lad and almost a sure sign that he will turn out well  while john trueman lived with farmer clarke he made a strict friendship with one of his fellow servants whose name was andrew wilkins andrew was a good lad and liked his master but having a quarrel with the carter who was a surly fellow he left his place and took on with old michaelson the thatcher he was quiet sober and industrious and john and he still kept up their acquaintance tho they did not often meet together  in july    0 farmer clarke died and having no children he left what he had about  00l among his relations he considered john as one of them and left him  0l  john was now about twentyfive years of age and having a few pounds which he had saved besides his legacy he furnished a neat little cottage on the side of the common and soon afterward when he had gotten into good work married betty meadows a prudent young woman in the neighborhood  a little before this time old michaelson died poor fellow he hurt himself by a fall from farmer rickmans barn which he never got the better of and andrew wilkins getting into all his work was accounted the best thatcher in the parish he was sent for to all the barns and ricks in the neighborhood and made a great deal of money it was he who thatched the farm house at netherwood which was thought to be as good a piece of work as any that could be seen in ten parishes john still kept up his friendship with him but they seldom saw one another except on sundays when they commonly staid with two or three other young fellows of the parish to sing a little after service for they were both good singers and in summer would sometimes take a walk together in the evening the first piece of work andrew did after he set up for himself was thatching johns cottage he would take nothing for his labor but john soon after gave his little girl a niece who lived with him a prayer book and a new hat  in this cottage john brought up a large family three sons and four daughters yet he could never be said to have a family of seven children on his hands they were soon taught as they grew up one above another to do something for their own maintenance his wife not only spent frugally what her husband earned by his labor but likewise added to it by her own spinning and knitting and that of her daughters their money did not go to the grocers for tea and sugar and butter they lived hard but the children were tight and the cottage neat if a neighbor came in betty still continued her work she had no time for gossipping and teadrinking she herself rarely went out except to church and now and then to market with a few chickens or a young goose and yet if she could be of any use to a sick neighbor nobody was more ready many a piece of good advice she would give her neighbors when she thought they wanted it and she had that pleasant way of giving advice which always brought it home to the point she aimed at and yet without giving offense  one day mary roper came in with a new scarlet cloak on bordered very finely with a piece of white catskin and pray how do you like my new cloak said she betty i like it very well said betty what might it cost you fifteen shillings said mary roper which i earned myself last august at the squires betty trueman continuing to turn her wheel began carelessly to enquire into the price of shopgoods  what brown linsey was a yard  what dowlas  and how much cloth would make one of her girls a shift when she had gotten all out of poor mary she wished now said she neighbor stopping her wheel i will make free to tell you a piece of my mind you see you have spent as much on a cloak as would have bought nine yards of dowlas and a good brown linsey cloak besides which would have kept you as warm as this scarlet one if you had been as able as mrs ivyson i should have thought it suitable and should have said never a word but with such families mary and such means as you and i have i should have been as much ashamed of going about the parish with a scarlet cloak that cost me fifteen shillings as i should have been of going about with three of my childrens shirts pinned to my back mary roper who did not see what her neighbor had been driving at till it came suddenly upon her was very much hurt and said she would never put on her red cloak again as long as she lived she should always think when people looked at her that they saw three of her childrens shirts pinned to her back nay as to that said betty as it is bought you had better wear it but such people as we mary have nothing to do with finery we should make every penny go as far as it can our chief show should be in keeping our children tight and clean as to the moneys being of our own earning i think nothing of that for why should not the mothers earnings go to maintain the children as well as the fathers  in john truemans family every thing that was earned by the father the mother or the children went all to one common stock and answered the best end and though they were oftener than once visited by sickness once five of them had the small pox together yet they always got out of their difficulties themselves and never had a single farthing from the parish in the midst of all their poverty john always contrived to have twenty or thirty shillngs tied up in a bit of rag against a rainy day nobody should live upon alms he used to say but people who have lost the use of their hands and feet  this worthy man not only set his family an example of industry but of every thing else that was good nobody ever heard him swear an oath he had been brought up himself in the fear of god and he brought up his family in the same way teaching them to pray morning and evening to beg gods blessing on each day and to thank him at night for his mercies he was strictly honest  was gentle and kind to every body  and was so sober that i have heard him say he had not been twice in an alehouse during his life he was a great enemy to alehouses in general but especially to pothouses the pothouse sells liquor without a license and is commonly more frequented by bad people  he believed nothing corrupted young lads so much and used to say he wished to have it written over the door of every one of them in large letters this is the devils school  he always detested the pothouse but particularly at this time he had the affliction to find that it and the alehouse had been the ruin of his friend andrew wilkins andrew had long been one of the soberest fellows in the parish and perhaps might have continued so if he had had his friend john trueman always at his elbow he was one evening against his inclination seduced into a pothouse this was the beginning of all his misfortunes once going is a step toward going a second time and a second time is two steps and leads directly to a third poor andrew took several and began to love liquor then it was over with him john trueman saw very little of him for he seldom came to church he next began to neglect his business and it was then that young simpson got into the parish and did most of the thatching work after this poor andrew began to run into debt he owed three pounds at the chandlers shop twelve pounds at different ale houses and pothouses and seven shillings at the bakers during the course of all this mischief john trueman often undertook to set him to rights come my man he would say pluck up a good courage leave these cursed houses set heartily to business and you may yet do well now and then poor andrew made a faint endeavor but he fell back again into his old haunts till at length his credit being gone and his debts troublesome he ran off and left the country  in the mean time john trueman increased in reputation he did not want the wicked amusement of drinking in summer after his work was over he generally every day spent half an hour or perhaps an hour in his little garden  planting his cabbages and potatoes hoeing the weeds and sowing his beans and peace his wife also persuaded him to take a little field of a couple of acres behind the house were she kept a cow which she bought out of the earnings of her spinning and she found it answered very well his garden which was neatly kept was one of his chief amusements but the employment in which he took most delight was the instruction of his family seldom a day passed in which he did not spend a part in teaching them their catechism or hearing them read the bible or some good little book which the parson used to give them it was a pleasing sight to see him sitting with the younger children one on each knee and the elder standing round him come jemmy he would say to the eldest boy let your little brothers and sisters hear how well you can say your book and then he would make him repeat the creed the lords prayer or the commandments and would ask him such questions as the minister used commonly to ask at church it was very pleasant also to hear john and his family singing psalms on a sunday evening which they often did john had an excellent base voice and among the rest there were good tenors and trebles indeed john was always thought at church the best of the band  he drew out also several texts of scripture which he called christs catechism and made all his children get them by heart the minister one day saw them and said he could not have chosen them better himself he was so well pleased with them that he had them printed out in a book and made all the children of the parish get them by heart in the end of this account i shall give a copy of them  above all things this worthy man was cautious never to let his children play idly in the streets on sundays they were sure he said to pick up bad words or something or other that was wicked if they were ever seen with bob webster or jere rymer whose fathers were breeding them up to the gallows they were sure of a whipping but in general they were very good children and rarely did any thing but what their father and mother allowed among other things he strictly forbad them to go out at night the devil he would say takes that opportunity to lead young lads astray they generally begin by going out at nights  either john or his wife went always to church with the elder children the other stayed at home with the younger no children in the parish were so well behaved at church as they they always looked on their prayerbooks and minded what they were about they took care also before they went into church not to have occasion to go out during the service which many little children do and disturb the congregation very much as each of them got to the age of twelve years their father gave them a prayer book with gold edges of which they were always mighty proud  thus educated they not only soon became useful but had the choice of the best services in the country their father however would suffer them only to go where the family was sober and regular and the master and mistress set a good example i have taken a great deal of pains john would say with my children and my reward is to see them well settled they can all work i thank god and are all willing and i am in no fear of their getting a livelihood any where this spirit in the father gave the children credit and consequence they had no occasion to seek for places they were always sought after thus when lady lumley wanted one of johns daughters for a housemaid and sent him word by mrs jackson that she had inquired the young womans character and liked it very well john next inquired the character of lady lumley and finding she led a loose sort of life playing at cards on sundays and keeping bad hours john made a civil excuse and would not let sally go to her he chose rather to let her go to mrs mears a clergymans widow who lived in the next town tho she gave only four pound wage and lady lumley gave six  you are now my dear child said john going from your good mother who has always given you the best advice you must now advise yourself i hope there is no occasion to give you any instruction about your duty to god and reading your bible i shall only therefore give you a little about your new way of life i have endeavored to get you into a sober family but i may be deceived if you should find it is not so give me a line and i will come over and advise you but if the family be a good one as i believe it is for i have always heard mrs mears and the two misses well spoken of dont be hasty to leave them tho you hear of other girls in the neighborhood who have less work and higher wage work seldom hurts a young woman in health but laziness and idleness always do and as to wage trouble not yourself so much about that as about getting a good character staying long in a place is creditable my good father used always to say a long service is a good inheritance and i found his words true besides it is more profitable for by going about from place to place after greater wage and being often out of place you lose far more than you gain look at poor bet nixon that girl has been in seven places within these two years and by always trying to better herself she is now become as ragged as a colt how different was nancy selwood she lived nine years with good lady burnaby and was grown quite into her friend and i have heard say it cost the old lady many a tear when nancy left her but when her brother had taken that great farm and had lost his wife every body thought it right in nancy to go to help him she would not have left her old mistress for any other place i dare be bound  john then gave his daughter some advice against sauciness and pertness which he said answered no end if you find said he you cannot live happy in your place continue to do your duty in it while you do stay and give warning quietly  before the girl went to mrs mears her mother also gave her a little advice about dress now sally said she i desire i may never see you follow any of those slovenly fashions of letting your hair hang in great bags behind and dangling in curls upon your shoulders and wearing dirty bits of gause ruffles and handkerchiefs and flapping caps and bunches of nasty ribbon about your hat such things do not become young women at service nor any people in low stations when you go to church be always neat and clean and tight  at all times you may be tight and when you buy any thing let it be plain and good rather than fine if you were to come home such a slattern figure as betty nixon was when she came from place i should be quite ashamed of you  nor was it only in his own family that john was of use he did many a kind action among his neighbors his friendly disposition was so well known that wherever there was any distress john trueman was the first person applied to many a days work he gave up to serve a friend he was considered also as a very good judge among his neighbors and put an end to many a quarrel sometimes also though he was one of the most peaceable men in the world he was known to do justice in a very summary manner himself where the law was tardy and its sentence could not easily be obtained  he and his sons were at haycart the field was full of people both men and women and among them was a tall rawboned fellow who as they were resting at noon began to swear and talk obscenely to the women one of johns daughters was among them and john was much hurt with the fellows impudence and two or three times rebuked him smartly but though he turned the laugh upon him he could not make him hold his tongue on this john getting up very deliberately and taking his cartwhip gave the fellow a smacking cut round the body a circular stain about his shirt for he was without his jacket showed how ably and dexterously john had applied the lash now my good fellow said john remember never to swear and talk obscenely again in company with john trueman the fellow started up in a rage and snatching up a pitchfork swore he would be revenged come come my man said john sit down quietly and be civil i have three strapping lads here who if you dare lift a finger at their old father will drag you through yon horsepond up started the three lads in an instant each with a pitchfork in his hand and the fellow not choosing to meddle with the old man went off muttering that if there were justice to be had either for love or money he would have it  john was a man of such good natural sense and so well informed for a common person that he had always something to say that was proper on every occasion if he ever heard a lad swearing for instance he would tell him swearing was hard work whatever he might think of it it was working for the devil without wages thou wilt get nothing for thy labor my lad he would say and why would thou do for the devil what thou would do for no master on earth  or if he saw him going to the alehouse he would tell him that a poor lad going into an alehouse always put him in mind of a silly fish going to drink in a hoopnet it is easy to get in but he does not know how to find his way out again  or if he met him going to a horserace  a mountebank  a cockfight  or a conjurer he had always something ready to show him his folly and how much better it would be for him to mind his business  how good a divine john was the following little story will show  he was mowing one day with richard willet  a fellow of the parish who was never thought to be over fond of work and as they were eating their dinner under the hedge lord b came past in his coach aye now says willet there is a man that has something to thank god for he has nothing to do but to ride about where he pleases and has a good dinner to go to at noon and a cup of the best while we poor hearts after a hard days labor are glad of a bit of cold bacon to our bread and a drop of sour beer  how know you said trueman that my lord is happier than you or i is it riding about in a coach think you and eating a good dinner that makes a man happy no no dick something else goes to make a man happy he must have happiness within if all be true as i have heard my lord has been desperate vexed ever since the king turned him out of his place and as he has diced away most of what he had as i have heard people tell who have been in london i should think he has not much happiness to brag on  but suppose my lord was ever so happy what then does that make us more unhappy i durst lay a wager there is as much happiness in my cottage as in bromleyhall  besides what matters it during the little while we live in this world whether we are lords or laborers did you ever hear dick how far it is to france or scotland and if you were going to one of those places would you think it was much if the road for half a dozen steps  as far as to that gate for instance  was bad now it is just the same with regard to this world and the next you have heard of eternity i suppose it is like a long journey round and round the world that will never have an end now as certain as you have that knife in your hand lord b and you and i have all that journey to take alike we shall all travel in the same way and what mighty difference does it make if he go as far as that gate in a coach and we on foot at the gate lord b must get out of his coach and we shall be all alike then happy he who has done best if we have lived well with our little and done our duty as to the lord and not unto man god almighty will reward us poor as we are as much as he will reward my lord though he should have done what good he could with his better means then what will it signify how we have gone to the gate our business is to look to the long journey we have to go afterward  thus this good couple lived respected by every body high and low it was a great pleasure to the squires lady and her daughters to take an evening walk to betty truemans which was about a mile and a half from them they used to carry a little tea and sugar in their pockets and were sure of a piece of good household bread and a neat pat of butter often too they would bring their company with them and the neighbors have sometimes seen in a summerevening a coach or two standing at johns door  about the year      a very distressing circumstance happened to this worthy family  betty trueman had a brother in wiltshire who lived very creditably on a little farm on the edge of marlboroughdowns his wife died and left him an only son who as he grew up proved a great distress to his father he would settle to nothing he kept bad company used bad words and got a habit of drinking about the beginning of march john trueman was informed of his brother in laws death and as he was left executor he took a journey into wiltshire to settle his affairs the most difficult thing he had to settle was young tom meadows his nephew what to do he knew not to leave him was ruin to take him among his own young folks was dangerous after weighing the matter on all sides john thought distressing as it was he had no choice left but to take the young man home and try what he could do with him john truemans manners were exceedingly pleasing and young meadows had taken a great fancy to him john had observed it and this was the chief foundation of his hopes as he thought by kind treatment he might work upon him he took him home therefore and determined to use him in all respects like one of his own sons while he behaved well john knowing that idleness is the beginning of all wickedness took him always to work with himself the young man could not help working when he saw his uncle work by degrees work became easy to him and he could do a tolerable days work johns sons also commonly worked with them and when they all came home at night john had always some innocent merriment to make the lads cheerful while supper was getting ready they generally worked by the great and at the end of the job john divided the money into equal parts and gave his nephew as much as he took himself tho his work was by no means equal he took of him likewise for his board just the same as he took of his own sons always telling him that if he could do better he was welcome by treating him in this generous kind manner he daily gained more and more upon him and the young man himself began to find more pleasure in sobriety and industry than in drunkenness and idleness the example also of his cousins had great weight with him he began to be intimate with them and to be better pleased with the innocence and cheerfulness of their company than with the rioting swearing drinking and obscenity of his former companions not but that he once or twice broke out  once particularly at the fair when he met with one of his old friends and two or three times his uncle heard an oath and an obscene jest come from him but as he saw that the young man on the whole meant to do well he treated him with great kindness and when he found fault with him did it like a friend  young meadows had now been about four years with his uncle and was come of age when john took an opportunity one day to carry him into the fields privately and thus spoke to him you know tom you have often heard me say i would do what i could to recover for you what little matters your father left and every now and then i told you i was doing my best i will now tell you what i have done after your fathers debts were paid most of which i find you occasioned the sale of his stock cleared   l  0s i then endeavored to get in what was owing to him particularly that debt of grays and i believe we have done the best we have collected   l i have also sold the little tenement near burntwood for   l out of this money good mr webb whom you remember and who has done all this business for us charges only  l which i thought very little as lawyers work i know is costly so that you see by this account you are worth   0l  0s and some little interest which we are to receive at michaelmas for part of it during the last two years will bring the whole as you will see to near  00l john then put the accounts into his nephews hand and told him mr webb desired when he had examined them that he would sign them and now said john the next question is what is to be done with all this money  many young lads thus made suddenly rich would have had a hundred schemes at once young meadows had but one he was now thoroughly reformed and as thoroughly convinced of his uncles care and kindness he was a sensible lad and clearly saw how kind a part his uncle had acted he told him therefore how much obliged he was to him for saving him and his little fortune from destruction and if he would be so good as advise him what to do he would leave the management of every thing to him why then said john i think you are yet too young to know what to do with it yourself you had better put it out to use and let it increase for a few years in five or six it will increase  0l and you will then be grown as many years wiser and may either turn it to farming or what you like better this advice was taken and john got the money well put out by mr webbs means but before this was done tom meadows who was a generoushearted young fellow wished to make some presents to his cousins in gratitude to his uncle for having saved his little affairs from ruin but john would hear of nothing on that head telling his nephew that none was in a way to give who was not in a way to live   in about half a dozen years a good little farm in the neighborhood offering and meadows still continuing his love for husbandrybusiness his uncle persuaded him to take it and assisted him with his advice in stocking and managing it young meadows was skilful industrious and careful his skill taught him what was best his industry performed what his skill pointed out and his care preserved what his industry procured from skill industry and care every thing may be expected every thing therefore throve under such management and the little farm produced more than many farms of double the rent his uncle soon advised him to add to it by taking more land but at the same time told him that a little farm well managed was better than a large one neglected  but here i must mention an affair which made a great change in his life he had had from his earliest youth a great regard for a farmers daughter in his fathers neighborhood she too had observed it and had no dislike to him for he was a pleasing good natured fellow but she heard all her friends speak of him as so bad and idle in all his behavior that she never allowed herself to think favorably of him afterward when she heard from all hands how clever and worthy a young fellow tom meadows was grown it gave her great pleasure tho she did not know for what particular reason of this young woman tom meadows began now to think when he found himself in a condition to maintain a wife with credit and he entrusted his faithful uncle with his secret  this was rather a little disappointment to john who secretly hoped that young meadows would perhaps have married one of his daughters he would not however allow the thought to take a moments possession of him but immediately told his nephew he had always heard nancy freeman mightily praised but as you have not seen her said he for some time you may now think different when you do see her or perhaps she may be engaged i would advise you therefore to say nothing at present but go and visit your aunt grace there said john you will see how the land lies and may act accordingly  young meadows followed his uncles advice he paid a visit to his aunt grace and finding the land lay very well he mentioned his wishes first to farmer freeman and then to his daughter the farmer had no objection and the young woman gave him no denial  only she wished for a little time to consider about it tom however plainly saw he had an interest in her affections so a second visit to his aunt grace brought matters to a conclusion and he came home with the happy tidings that the  0th of the next month was fixed for the day  but god almighty leads us to happiness in his own way the things of this world do not always happen according to our wishes and expectations and this should prevent our setting our hearts upon them it happened so on this occasion while young meadows was fitting up his farmhouse neatly for his bride he received a letter by the post on friday informing him that she had been seized with a fever the sunday before and was then lying speechless he immediately mounted his horse and riding all night got just in time to receive an affectionate look and farewell smile which shot through his heart with a thousand tender feelings never afterward forgotten he saw her at ten oclock at twelve she was a corpse  this melancholy event gave a new turn to the mind of young meadows at first all was horror and confusion around him his cheerful fields were solitary wastes the sunshine of heaven was a distressing gloom the darkness of night was more pleasant to him than the light of the sun he thought not about his business but walked among the lanes and hedges avoiding his very workmen and afraid to speak to any body he met even his uncles family he shunned  by degrees however his mind became more calm his temper which was naturally lively in a few years recovered at times a little of it is cheerfulness his goodnature began to flow as usual to every body around him and he could join in innocent amusements the settled bent of his disposition however became serious and religious he often used to make a comparison between the wretched creature he once was given up to drinking and debauchery and the sober innocent life he now led and with regard to the great affliction he had met with he could now even think of that with satisfaction he would say tho it was bitter to him at the time yet it had befallen him through a kind providence she was taken to gods mercy he doubted not and instead of the many distresses she might have met with in this world was changed into a happy being while he himself had seen in a thousand instances of what advantage his afflictions had been to him his wicked heart wanted thoroughly to be subdued and nothing but so great an affliction as this had been could have done it effectually god almighty had now he hoped thoroughly wrought his conversion he had long seen the folly of wickedness he now saw the happiness of religion  with these thoughts the manner of his life agreed he seldom went from home he employed his time on the business of his farm and his leisure on reading the bible and other good books his family was an example to all farmers he was kind to his servants and workmen and took care to have them wellinstructed in none of his fields an oath or a lewd jest was ever heard as he was much among his laborers he had a constant eye over them every sunday he carried them with him to church and took care that the lads went regularly to hear the catechism explained which he thought was much fitter for them than for mere children who could understand but little of what they were told  he never again had any thoughts of marriage he had always two or three of the grandchildren of his good uncle with him whom he called his nephews and nieces and bad them call him uncle a name he liked to hear but for some reason or other little nancy was his great favorite and always lived with him nancy fed the poultry and took care of the petlambs and as she grew up had the charge of the dairy he always expressed the greatest regard for his uncle and used to show it to all his relations his uncle he would often say was the great means under god of saving him from destruction  thus i have put together what particulars i could find of this worthy man many of them happened after that part of john truemans life in which i have placed them but i thought it was best to put them all down together  whether farmer meadows is now alive i know not the last account i heard of him was from one of his neighbors at weyhillfair who said he was alive and hearty and one of the best men in england i remember that was the mans expression but this is now at least seven years ago and if he be still alive he must be advancing toward old age but it is time now to return to john trueman  in the year      james ivyson died who was outdoor steward or bailiff to the squire and overlooked his workmen and cattle every body said the squire would appoint john trueman in his room because they thought he was the fittest for it but the squire was then at his estate in norfolk and nobody knew any thing more for a fortnight when a letter came by the post from the squire to mr trim his honors attorney desiring him to get john trueman to look after his affairs till his return when he should satisfy him for his trouble after the squire came home nothing more was said the squire however ordered the woodhouse cottage to be fitted up very neatly and furnished then people began to change their minds and think it was for the young man whom the squire had brought with him out of norfolk and who it was said was going to marry madams maid but mr trim told farmer weeks at the vestry that he still believed john trueman was the man though the squire who commonly kept his thoughts to himself had said nothing certain to him  however so it was for when all was finished at the cottage in about two months the squire sent for john trueman into his library and bidding him sit down began by telling him he had always had a very good opinion of him which compliment john returned by telling the squire in the frankness of his heart that he had always had the same of him well said the squire i value your good opinion john more than that of many a man who wears a better coat but i did not send for you now that we should compliment one another but to talk about business i think said he my honest neighbor you are now too old to work i hope sir said john your honors tenant farmer weeks did not tell you so i have worked with him off and on these fifteen years and i hope i can do a tolerablish days work yet no no said the squire weeks did not tell it me i speak only from the parishregister i should guess you are now about sixty your honor guesses very well said trueman last whitsuntuesday i entered into my sixtyfirst year the squire then asked john what he made of his work by the year for he understood that he and his sons generally worked by the great please your honor said trueman i always made enough to live on but i never kept any count well said the squire to cut the matter short you know something by this time of my business and i know something of your abilities to manage it have you any objection to take possession of the woodhouse cottage and supply ivysons room i shall allow you fifty pounds a year and some other little perquisites  objection sir said trueman what objection can i have but i think your honor ought to have objection thus to saddle yourself with an old man just off his work  why you contradict yourself john said the squire smiling you told me just now that farmer weeks would tell me a different story however continued he it is of no consequence for it is not the use of your hands that i want but of your head i do not want you to work yourself but to see that other people work as i have a great many laborers about me i want a good eye over them and if i am not mistaken you have both spirit and honesty to do the fair thing by them and me  my wife also tells me that nobody makes better butter than betty trueman she wishes therefore to place her over the dairy and poultry some consideration also shall be had for that one of her daughters i think lives with her she may still continue to do so and i will pay her wages as your wifes servant and as for your sons if you can employ them all about the grounds i shall be glad for i am told there are not better working lads in the parish  trueman felt more for all this goodness than he could well utter the squire however understood by his looks what was in his heart in short it was agreed before they parted that john should take immediate possession of the woodhouse cottage which was a neat thatched brick building consisting of four good rooms and outhouses surrounded on three sides by a large oakwood from which it had it is name and open in front to a meadow with a stream at the bottom and a fine view into the country beyond it  on the evening after this conversation john called such of his children together as were at home and told them all that had passed  how kind god had been to him  and that next to god their best services were due to the good squire i always had a secret trust said john that god who is the poor labourers truest friend would never forsake me in my old age nor suffer me to be a burden to the parish  john then told them that though people commonly bequeathed their goods at their death he chose to bequeath his in his lifetime for he had now he said no more occasion for them the good squire had provided for all his wants he then produced his little stock among them  his cow  his pigs  his poultry  and household furniture every one was to choose in order and the mother was to choose for the three daughters who were out at service it happened however in this family distribution that the youngest came off the best for the eldest refused to take the best things lest they should injure the younger the cow was left to the last well says john since none of you will take the cow if you are all willing well give her to tom for he is the only one among you who is married and has a family and milk will be more useful there than any where else this proposal pleased them all but tom who would not accept the cow on any account the dispute however was at last ended by giving her to toms eldest son john a little chuffy boy who was just old enough to be taught to say tank you granfar for cherry  but the goods which the old man prized most were not yet disposed of these were his tools there was not a man in the parish who had so complete a set of tools of every kind as john trueman he kept them all in the nicest order and used to call them his hands and would thank god for giving him so many hands that if one should be disabled he might use another the only thing in which john ever showed any backwardness in assisting a neighbor was in lending him a tool but he had often suffered for his goodnature and found nobody so exact about tools as he was himself nor that showed the care for them which he thought a good tool deserved these tools he distributed among his sons  a scythe and a couple of billbooks to one  a couple of spades and a pickax to another bestowing at the same time some commendation on each tool and telling his sons that these tools under god had been the support of them all  and that he who did not value his tool seldom cared much about his work  john having thus disposed of his goods had nothing now left but to settle his family tom the second son who was married was put into immediate possession of his fathers old habitation the eldest and youngest john proposed to take with him to the woodhouse cottage as soon as they could handsomely leave their master for they both worked with the same farmer jenny of course went with her mother  thus these pious parents found themselves happily provided for in their old age by the blessing of god who never forsakes his religious servants but always in some way supports them john used often to say god was the poor mans only friend the rich may take comfort if they can find any in their riches and pleasures but the poor man he would say has nothing to depend on but god it is his business therefore certainly to make god his friend  john having now settled his affairs took possession of his cottage and new employment and that he might make the better appearance he laid aside his old working jacket and wore every day his best coat which had served him nine years for a sundays coat and had been every week carefully laid by in the chest he now bought a new one for sundays his wise also laid aside her linsey gown and except when she was about some dirty work put on always her camblet one  john lived in his new employment twenty two years and the squire was so well pleased with him that he was often heard to say if he had had him ten years before he should not only have had his work better done but should have saved many a pound for tho james ivyson was always reputed and was in fact a very honest man yet he had not that spirit and commanding way with him of keeping people to their work which john had and yet john was beloved by all the laborers for he was always doing good turns to one or another with the squire and plainly showed that he did not want to get all favor to himself indeed he was continually applying to the squire or his lady not only for the laborers but for any of the parish whom he thought proper objects the squire and his lady were the friends of the poor and always ready to encourage his applications well knowing both his honesty and his judgment johns rule was to speak to the squire about the men and to his lady about the women and children  the squire generally after breakfast took a walk among his workmen and after he and john had talked over the business of the day john took that opportunity to introduce his other business poor tim jenkins please your honor said john to him one day has got into a sad scrape the poor lad works with farmer sykes and had been sent by his master with a gun to terrify the rooks from the corn when a hare popt out and tim silly lad could not help shooting at her and unluckily killed her just as he was taking her up who should come riding down the lane but sir thomass steward he took down tims name and told him he should hear from sir thomas by and by and the poor lad hears that mr trim has orders to proceed against him so i fear he will get into some mischief for sir thomas your honor knows is young and hot unless you will be pleased to write a bit of a note to pacify him i know he will refuse your honor nothing and the poor lad is in a world of trouble for what he has done he never was a poacher in all his life and i dare be bound he will never do such another thing again  the squire promised to write a note that evening to sir thomas and was going away when john called his attention again sir said he i have another little matter to mention robin napper bought yesterday at farmer ayless sale a score of weathers which he intends to fat but as i think his lands are not yet ready for them i advised him if your honor has no objection to let them go a few weeks in your honors rough grounds about millpond i will take care they shall do no mischief to this also the squire consented and left john very happy in having got a pardon for poor tim and the rough grounds for his friend robin  the lady he used to take about the time when she went to see her poultry which was generally about eleven oclock she had something of humor about her and used to say she never saw john look silly but when he had some request to make whenever she saw him with that particular face on as she called it she knew at once what he intended to say and without waiting for his request would ask well mr trueman what is gone wrong now i heard her ask him this question one day when john making one of his sideling bows answered no great matter gone wrong madam but poor little rose smith that fine little girl you took so much notice of when you went out of church the sunday before last has burnt her leg very sadly and old dame plasket has done what she can for her but it grows worse poor smith i fear can hardly raise money enough to pay a doctor so i thought madam i would mention the thing to you if you would let me send mr morley to her  in all these requests it was hard to say whether the asker the giver or the receiver was more gratified  as john was kind to all the laborers he was equally attentive to the squires business he kept the people to their work but without any overbearing temper tho it was the more difficult as he was now placed over many of his old companions nobody gave him more trouble than one willet who was always at a loose end why now dicky john would say to him suppose the squire should snip you off a shilling or two from your wages on saturdaynight would not you say he cheated you and is it not just the same if you snip him off an hour or two a day from his work which you may easily do by working as if you were not in earnest if the squires work be too hard for you you had better go somewhere else but while you receive honest pay do my man earn it honestly  willet soon after took his advice and went where he was not so closely looked after nobody was a better judge of work than john he put nothing hard upon the laborers at the same time none of the idle fellows cared much to work under him  but idleness was not the only thing john used to complain of among the workmen he was often hurt with a little dirty mean envious temper which he found among them if ever he did any of them a good turn with the squire he was sure to hear from one or another something bad of the person he had assisted which was as much as to say the informer thought he deserved a favor better himself tho the truth sometimes came out on these occasions yet john was very backward in believing the reports of malice and envy he generally lent a deaf ear to them and instead of listening would turn another way and bid one of the men measure that ditch whether it was so wide as it should be or make that part of the drain a little deeper  while john was one day directing some workmen near the great road he was much affected by a circumstance he met with a cart came by with a poor old man in it who seemed but just alive pray master said the carter be so good as to tell me the way to your poorhouse what have you got for us there said john a poor strolling fellow said the carter who has been hopping about all the parishes of our county with one leg and being taken ill in ours we had him examined and find he belongs to you and as we would not rob you of such precious stuff we have brought him to you again  while the fellow was making these low jokes john thought he discovered in the poor wretch something of the features of his old friend andrew wilkins tho he had not now either seen or heard of him these fifteen years he asked the carter his name for the man himself seemed speechless the fellow said he could not tell but on looking into his order his honors name said he is andrew wilkins knight of the beggars if you know such a gentleman johns heart was too full to answer the fellows inhumanity as it deserved he told him he would take the charge of the poor man himself but the carter saying he durst not shove him out any where but as the order directed john went with him to the poorhouse where he saw andrew laid up comfortably but he was too far gone to take any refreshment and died that night  john did not fail the next day to give the young fellows who had seen what had passed a lecture on the subject that poor fellow said he whom you saw brought to the poorhouse yesterday was formerly one of the cleverest lads in this parish i suppose hardly any of you except jonathan can remember much of him you remember jonathan what a clever lad he was a more sober quiet honest diligent fellow god never put breath into he was the best thatcher in all these parts where i made one shilling he made two and might have done as well as any man in the country but the devil and bad company put it into his head to go to the alehouse one sup of beer drew on another and that made him relish a third and when he began to like it all was over with him so you see my lads it is not always beginning well that keeps us right a man may be ruined at any time of his life without his own care and the grace of god to follow it whatever you do my lads keep from these bad houses it will never be well till the green grass grows in the pathway to all the alehouses and pothouses in the country  john himself took great pains to carry his laborers another way of one thing he made a point which was to have them all assemble every sunday morning and go with him to church except such as had large families who stayed at home every other sunday that their wives might take their turns and generally every easter they all appeared at the sacrament in about a year john had brought them into such regular habits that it was pleasing to see so many people together so orderly the squire had seldom fewer than thirty or forty men at work they were chiefly employed in draining fencing and improving a large tract of common which had been taken in by act of parliament and which the squire was dividing into farms  about the beginning of february in the year      john trueman was taken ill of a sort of pleuritic disorder which it was thought he had brought on by exposing himself too much to the cold east winds at first his head ran continually on his business he could get no sleep he was sure wat nixon would not sink the drain deep enough for there was a great soak of water he said in that place and a shallow drain would signify nothing but the squire assured him he himself had seen the drain and that it and every thing else were going on very well the squire then gave positive orders that nobody on any account should speak a word to him about business  by degrees the good old man became composed and all worldly thoughts subsided no hope of his recovery remained the evening before he died the squire saw him for the last time he took him by the hand and asked him how he felt himself john said nothing but gave him a look so full of tenderness affection and heavenly feeling that i heard the squire say he would freely give a hundred guineas to have that look exactly taken down in a picture  it set all the world at a distance i remember that was the squires expression  the same evening john saw also for the last time his children and grandchildren and blessing them all sent them to their rest his wife alone who would not leave him sat by him in silent sorrow and between eleven and twelve he went off in a quiet composed sleep with his hand locked in hers he died in the eightysecond or eightythird year of his age equally regretted by the squire  the whole body of workmen  and all who knew him he was carried to his grave by six of his grandchildren each about seventeen or eighteen years of age well younkers said the clergyman to them at the graveside after the service was over you have now followed your good old grandfather to his grave i hope you will all endeavor to follow him a little farther he was a good christian and an example to us all the poor lads wiped their glistening eyes with their coatsleeves and black gloves and said nothing but their hearts glowed within them and each thought he would do his best to be like his grandfather  the old man was buried on the north side of the church near the yewtree and the squire placed a handsome stone over his grave with an inscription to his memory  his wife died about six months after equally beloved and regretted and was buried by his side  after the death of john trueman the squire appointed his eldest son james to succeed him who having had a better education than his father and having been brought more into the world became a man of more consequence and was very lately on the death of mr woodcock appointed the squires principal manager of all his estates both in hampshire and in norfolk with a salary for living and traveling charges of two hundred a year and a good house to live in having been more among gentlemen he soon got their manners and always sat at the squires table except when he had any lords or other great company with him yet he still preserved his fathers simplicity of behavior changing only his honest bluntness into a little more civility and politeness  but as mr james trueman is still alive i fear to say any thing which if these papers should get into his hands might offend his modesty  christs catechism drawn up from texts of scripture by john trueman of faith he that comes to god must believe that he is and that he is the rewarder of such as diligently seek him  he must believe also on the name of his son jesus christ by whom we are justified  and in the spirit of god which god gives unto them who obey him  to his faith he must add virtue for by works is faith made perfect  our duty to god trust in the lord with all thy heart cast thy cares upon him for he cares for thee love the lord thy god and set thy affections on things above not on things on the earth for no man can serve two masters we cannot serve god and mammon in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let thy requests be made known unto god for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers  above all things swear not  neither by heaven nor by earth nor any other oath  our duty to our neighbor put away lying and speak every man truth with his neighbor  let no man defraud his brother in any matter for the lord is the avenger of all such be faithful in all things he that is faithful in a little will be faithful also in much  be kindly affectioned to one another with brotherly love for if god so loved us as to send his son to be the propitiation for our sins we ought also to love one another dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath charity is not easily provoked it suffers long and is kind be kind therefore one to another forgiving one another even as god for christs sake has forgiven you  our duty to ourselves be not wise in your own conceit god resists the proud but gives grace to the humble  walk not in rioting and drunkenness for drunkenness and revelling are the works of the flesh and they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god but temperance is the fruit of the spirit  abstain also from fleshly lusts which war against the soul know you not that your body is the temple of god if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy fornication and all uncleanness let it not be once named among you nor filthiness nor foolish talking  let every man labor working with his hands if any man will not work neither should he eat  be content with such things as you have for god has said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee having food and raiment therefore be you therewith content  withdraw from every brother that walks disorderly a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump  the conclusion fear god and keep his commandments for god shall bring every work into judgment and every secret thing whether it b good or whether it be evil  the life of richard atkins before i begin the life of richard atkins i must beg the readers pardon for a little imposition i put upon him with regard to his name in the first edition of this work i called him richard worthless but many people who had been in those parts said they knew no such person and began to doubt the truth of the whole story i am thus obliged therefore to put down his real name which was richard atkins indeed i was unwilling to put it down at first because there are two or three in this parish and perhaps more in other parishes of the name of atkins who are very good people and i was afraid of giving them offense i know few better men any where than edward atkins of leaside and i never heard any thing bad of jonathan at the mill except the story that farmer hollis used to tell which nobody believed as he had a quarrel with the miller  i must also desire the reader will excuse my calling him the son of a shoemaker whereas in fact his father was a tailor but i did this for the same reason as i changed his name the better to conceal him lest i should give offense  but now lest the reader should think i have imposed upon him in other things as well as in these i desired the churchwardens and overseers to certify the truth of the following account to which they had no objection i have therefore put down their certificate  we whose names are hereunto subscribed having read the following account of richard atkins son of tailor atkins and having known the said richard atkins from a boy do hereby certify and declare that we do believe the said account to be a true and faithful one as witness our hands churchwardens james majendie richard hopkins overseers william soam robt twentyman   richard atkins was the son of a drunken tailor who might have had all the business of the parish if he had not loved the alehouse better than his work  the man who neglects his business will also neglect his family young atkins therefore was left to pick up all the vices he could find and as he was an apt scholar he made a quick progress he learned to swear about the time he learned to speak even his father thought he began to swear too early and has been heard to say d  n you dick if i hear you swear again i will lay this stick over your shoulders but the vice to which he was most addicted in his childhood was lying nobody could believe a word he said and he soon lost the name of dick atkins and was known in the parish by the name of lying dick  but i shall give such particulars of his life in order as i have been able to collect that i may set him up as an example for others to avoid  as far as i can find he was at first intended for his fathers business but the fathers drunkenness soon brought the business so low that it could not furnish employment either for the one or the other this it must be owned was a great misfortune to the lad and not of his own bringing on but a sober steady youth would have met with friends who in such circumstances would have relieved and assisted him lying dick never deserved a friend from the first he showed a bad disposition good boys remember the rule they have been taught and never to do to others what they would not like to have done to themselves but bad boys find a pleasure in doing mischief dick atkins was never better pleased than when he could play a mischievous trick he liked to throw filth privately on the clothes of passengers  to show cruelty to birds and beetles  to tie ears of corn together in a pathway through a field to trip people up in the dark  or to knock down a young duck or a chicken  but he once severely paid for a piece of mischief of this kind he met one day on the road a blind beggar led by a dog and cutting the string had great pleasure in seeing the poor blind man grope about on the loss of his faithful companion this was seen at a little distance by an honest farmer on horseback who appeared to take no notice till he came to the spot when suddenly jumping off his horse he seized poor dick by the collar and gave him such a horsewhipping as he did not forget for some months after he then made him kneel down in the dirt and ask the beggars pardon and then pull off his own garters and tie the dog up again  but god almighty who is kind even to the unthankful and unworthy and throws opportunities of doing well in their way if they would use them threw opportunities in the way of this wicked youth  he was about fifteen years of age when his father died his mother and two daughters were carried by the parishofficers to the poorhouse but a good lady in the place hearing that dick tho an idle vagabond was old enough to get his bread and wishing out of mere compassion to put him into a way of doing well if he chose it sent for him and having clothed him placed him under her gardener here he might have done very well and recovered all he had lost but his mind ran on nothing but wickedness the gardener however being a rough man kept him in some kind of order by the help of a hazel wand but he scarce ever durst trust him out of his sight or set him about any thing that required the least care dick generally did as much mischief as he did good and nothing could have kept him so long in his place but the great desire his good mistress had to reclaim him many a time she sent for him into the parlour on complaints from the gardener sometimes she would threaten him  sometimes she would give him kind admonitions  and sometimes when he had done any thing that had the least appearance of care and goodness she would give him sixpence or a shilling to encourage him but all was to no purpose his mind was bent on nothing but wickedness after keeping him therefore three years and forgiving him almost as many faults as he had spent days in the house she was obliged to send him off at last on his pilfering grapes through some panes of glass which he had broken in the hothouse  as the manner in which he was found out may be a good caution to all thievish lads i shall relate it it had long been his practice to pilfer fruits of different kinds and sell them at the next market by the assistance of tom flinch who had been bound a parish apprentice to a neighboring gardener flinch always sold them as his masters so the theft passed off very well but after they began to deal in hothouse grapes flinch found himself suspected as it was thought his masters hothouse could not produce any so fine he resolved therefore in time to drop the trade he had a quarrel also with dick who swore he had cheated him and the thing was true enough for tho they had agreed to share the profits of their plunder equally together flinch who was the older and more cunning knave never gave him more than twopence in the shilling flinch however had too much spirit to be called a cheat by a thievish lad and determined to be revenged so he wrote the gardener a scrawling letter without a name telling him how he might catch the thief who had stolen his grapes if he would knock gently three times on wednesday evening at nine oclock at the little trapdoor through which bark used to be thrown in the door would open and a hand with grapes would come out the gardener did as he was instructed he knocked three times gently at the trapdoor when it flew open and a hand pushed out with a large bunch of grapes accompanied with a low voice is all safe the gardener instantly seizing the hand cried out with a voice like thunder yes all is safe now he then took a cord out of his pocket which he had provided for the purpose and tying the hand tight to a staple in the wall he went round to discover the owner of it  and now while the gardener is going round let me take the opportunity of giving young people who find themselves dishonestly inclined a little advice in the first place i would advise them to think better of it and be honest for thieving is a very dangerous trade and is generally sooner or later found out but if they will not take this part of my advice and are determined to continue to thieve let me next advise them to be very cautious whom they take in as partners of their trade for this partner must at any rate be a knave and a knave is a fellow on whom they can have no security i dare say this is good advice because these were the very reflections which poor dick made as he stood in woul plight with his arm stretched through the hole and pinned to the wall expecting every moment the gardeners coming round he wished in the first place he had never touched the grapes and in the second that he had never trusted such a wicked rascal as tom flinch  poor dick had just time to make these reflections when he heard the gardeners foot coming briskly up the gravelwalk the gardener knew well enough what fox he had caught but pretending in the dark not to know he took the advantage of a bundle of hazel wands which were standing against the wall for tying up flowers and shivered several of them in pieces upon the different parts of dicks body as he writhed and twisted every part toward him crying out at every blow who are you you thief who are you speak you dog speak i will make you speak dick screamed loud enough to be heard half a mile off but the gardener still continued laying on and crying out speak you dog speak i will make you speak turn the other side you rascal you will twist your arm off in short he gave dick a most severe beating and did it on this principle that as he knew his good mistresss lenity he was desirous of execution first and of sentence afterward he was not however satisfied with what he had done but begged his mistress to let him carry dick before the justice there will be no living madam said he if such varmin is not properly catechized i suppose the gardener meant chastized for catechizing  varmin will not always do   his mistress however did not care to carry him before a justice in which i think she was wrong for a second punishment would have done him no hurt and might have tended perhaps to give his thieving hands another direction however she despaired now of doing him any good and turned him out of her service  as the reader is made a little acquainted with tom flinch he may be curious perhaps to know what became of him his history is very short tho it was not concluded till two years after this time  dick in hopes of appeasing the gardener while he was belabouring him gave up his friend flinch as the beginner of all his wickedness this by the way was a great lie for at the fair where generally there is as much bad as good carried on dick first met flinch and enticed him to join with him in robbing his mistresss garden and selling the fruit before this as far as i can find flinch was an honest lad the gardener however took no notice of dicks confession but went on with the work of correction some days after however meeting flinch in the road hark you my lad said he come here flinch came trembling the gardener then taking him aside told him what dick had said now tho i partly believe from some circumstances added the gardener that the thing may be true yet as i never could believe a word that lying rascal said i hope it may be false however whether it be true or false i shall take no farther notice nor bring you into any trouble  so take care and be an honest lad  this advice or rather the fright he had received had such an effect on flinch that he kept honest for three months  the itch of thieving however came upon him again and he began by halfpennies and pennies to cheat his master in fruit which he sold to servants and others who he knew would buy it without asking questions this is a very shameful and wicked practice for such people not only join in the cheat by purchasing at an underprice what they know must therefore be stolen but they encourage and bring up thieves this was the case at present encouraged by such people flinch went on at length however he began to be suspected and his master marking some fruit and finding it gone had little doubt what hands had taken it he made inquiry privately at market and at the houses of his customers and found that flinch had often sold fruit on those days when he knew he had sent him out only with gardenstuff nothing more remained but to endeavor to catch him in the fact without seeming to suspect him accordingly one day as flinch was going to market with a basket of peace his master called him back hark you tom said he have i not often forbid you to carry the basket so full you scatter half of them by the road and people say there is not good measure take a larger basket fetch that which stands in the entry tom after many shuffles was obliged to fetch it and his master turning the peace into it behold from the bottom came tumbling out grapes peaches and plumbs flinch in great terror was beginning to frame a lie when his master seizing him by the collar gave him a terrible shake and stifled the lie in his throat you rascal said he this trade has been carrying on these several months i have long suspected you and now i have caught you flinch was then given into the custody of a constable  committed to bridewell  carried before a bench of justices  and sentenced to be whipped through the town which sentence his master took care to have executed with sufficient severity  this chastisement made flinch an honest lad  that is it made his hands honest but in his heart he was as great a knave as ever he went back to his place but his master had now taken such a thorough dislike to him that he was determined if possible to get rid of him while he was taking measures for this purpose with the parishofficers flinch who liked his master as little as his master liked him resolved to save all farther trouble on this head and to run off what hastened this determination was the jibing he continually met with from the lads in the town when he went with his basket one would ask him if he had time to count the lashes while smith was whipping him another would ask if his back was got well yet and a third would tell him he might be ashamed of rearing so loud for a few scratches  flinch therefore being determined to leave his master made up a little bundle of his things privately and taking the day before him went off early on monday morning before his master was stirring he needed not to have been at so much pains to go off privately for his master never thought him worth inquiring after  flinch took the road into somersetshire here he found the people just beginning harvest and offering himself to a farmer as the weather was catching he got work after the harvest was over he still continued with his master in the room of a sick lad as his character was not known in this part of the country he might now have done very well he had another opportunity god often gives wicked people opportunities to repent but they choose rather to listen to the devil it happened so on this occasion flinch had not been here long before the devil put wicked thoughts into his head and instead of driving them out his own bad inclinations joined with them and he forgot all the good resolutions he made after his whipping and the opportunity which god had now given him of living again with credit  but i will not stop the story of dick atkins by telling all the wicked tricks of flinch  how he cheated one of his fellow servants of half a crown  how he stole some linen from farmer rogerss wife  and how he picked up a silverspoon at mr boothbys where he had gone upon an errand i shall just mention the thing which brought him at last to the gallows he had not yet been found out so like all other sinners he went from bad to worse  flinch it seems had learned to write which is a very good thing to those who make a right use of it but illdisposed lads turn every thing to bad if they learn to read they read only bad books if they learn to write it makes them only more mischievous good lads make use of writing to inquire after their friends and let them know they are doing well themselves but flinch made a different use of his writing the devil put it into his head to write a threatening letter to farmer rogers without a name to get five guineas from him the letter was as follows as i copied it out of a newspaper where it was put down  farmr rodgrs this is gif you notis that if you dont pit fiv ginnes under the blu ston at the ten mil ston your a ded man so luk tut from yurs to coman   flinch perhaps did not know that writing a threatening letter without a name is a hangingmatter which in fact it is if it can be proved he knew however he intended to rob farmer rogers of five guineas and that he deserved to be hanged for that  farmer rogers who was a timorous man was much terrified with this letter and determined not to stir abroad on any account but the next day the exciseman calling upon him rogers showed him the letter poh said the exciseman it is only the trick of some cowardly rascal  never trouble your head with it let us try however if we can catch him leave the matter to me so mr jackson took tom rogers with him the farmers eldest son and together they contrived a box in which they fixed the lock of a gun tying to the trigger a purse with a few halfpence in it they then filled the box with gunpowder and put all together carefully under the blue stone as the letter directed they then went to a house at a distance which overlooked the blue stone and relieving each other by turns they waited for the explosion the first night nothing happened but the second night about twelve oclock they saw and heard the explosion they immediately ran out and found the poor miserable flinch on the spot in a most deplorable condition his face was all over black and bloody  he was quite blind  and his right hand all scarified the next day he was examined before a justice and sent to exeter jail for the fact was committed just within the borders of devonshire at the next assizes he was tried the felony being plainly proved he was found guilty condemned and executed on that day three weeks the jailsurgeon said he believed he could never have got his eyes again if he had lived fifty years the night before he was executed he confessed all his wickedness to the clergyman who attended the prisoners  the linen he had stolen  the halfcrown  the silverspoon and several other things but he said the first person that put any wickedness into his head was a gardeners lad whom he had been formerly acquainted with whose name was dick atkins  one thing i had almost forgotten to mention when flinch went first into somerfetshire he changed his name i have heard what name he went by but as i am not quite sure i forbear to mention it as i should be very sorry to say any thing that was not quite true indeed i only mention the thing at all lest some or other looking into the jailbooks at exeter and not finding the name of thomas flinch hanged at such a time might suspect the whole story to be an untruth but flinch was certainly hanged at exeter tho he was hanged by a different name  having dispatched flinch let us now look after his friend dick atkins whom we left just turned out of the service of his good old mistress for stealing grapes  dick had now the world to begin again his good mistress had given him five shillings to sublist on till he could get into work with which dick contrived to get five times drunk she had given him also a spade and a mattock these he pawned to repeat his favorite pleasure a sixth time  being now reduced to necessity he was obliged to take up his own tools at the expense of paying a penny a day out of his earnings for the use of them and work for the farmers nobody could work better when he pleased but dick had no call but mere necessity few therefore cared to employ so idle a fellow when they could help it  in the mean time his vices which increased with his years began to make larger demands upon him he had learned early to swear to pilfer and to drink but he had now attained his twentieth year and sought after other pleasures he began to frequent bad houses  to get acquainted with abandoned women  to attend cockfights  and to gamble at fairs and horseraces these were expensive pleasures and made a larger demand upon him than his labor could furnish in his child hood he had been called lying dick because lying was the most conspicuous part of his character but now he might have been called drunken dick  or lewd dick  or thieving dick  or any other wicked name that could be thought of  among the places which this abandoned youth chiefly frequented was a notorious pothouse on the edge of a common the woman who kept it was a vile prostitute this house was frequented by all the thieves cockfighters poachers horseracers pickpockets and smugglers in the country and tho dick learned few new vices among them yet he learned to practice his old ones in a more shameless and open manner something new however he was still learning he learned several new and more horrid oaths than he had known before he learned several shifts and tricks to screen himself and draw in the unwary he learned also the art and mystery of smuggling and of nightpoaching neither of which he had yet practiced  among the wicked wretches who frequented this house one of the most wicked was bleareyed ned the smuggler this fellow as the most wicked was of course the most agreeable to dick they formed a great intimacy together and were scarce ever separate among other pieces of instruction which dick received from this fellow one was that it was always better to have the appearance of some business than to have none at all  that he himself had been bred a sawyer that he seldom indeed worked at his business but that he was always the less suspected from having one  this advice to undertake a business which required no work was very agreeable to dick so he became a sawyer and joined in partnership with bleareyed ned  of all businesses that of a sawyer is best suited to an idle fellow for tho a sawyer may make a great deal of money if he be industrious as many do yet no business furnishes so many notable excuses for idleness the partner may be ill or he may be out of the way for as the sawyers work in partnership there are the excuses of two men instead of one to avail themselves of the saw too may be out of order which is an instrument that is not so easily repaired  besides the occupation of a sawyer dick had others he broke horses for gentlemen which furnished him with an opportunity of riding about the country and calling where he knew there was the best beer he smuggled also a little with his friend bleareyed ned but poaching was the business he took most delight in he knew well how to catch game of every kind as this was a business he liked he made a great proficiency in it no man knew better how to lay snares for the hare or the woodcock or to take at once a whole covey of partridges or pheasants as they crept through a hole in the hedge he dealt a little in venison also williamson the most noted deerstealer in the forest used to say there was not a better fellow for the purpose in the whole country than dick atkins if he would give his mind to it in fact he did give his mind to it but having once nearly been sent to jail for deerstealing he was rather shy of the business and thought poaching a safer employment  in these occupations dick made no distinction of days only that in general he spent his sundays either at the pothouse or the alehouse  commonly at the former for there he met some or other of his vile companions and as the pothouse was more out of the way they could drink and roar and play at ninepins and swear and curse and wager and blaspheme with less observation as to the church neither his father nor his mother ever set him an example of going there and he had now so long neglected it that he might say as another wicked drinking fellow once said he had almost forgotten what the inside of a church was made of  having thus taken a view of dick atkins as a single man let us next see him in a married state  at a farmhouse in the parish to which atkins belonged lived a young woman of the name of molly summers she was the only child of an honest farmer and her parents dying young she had been very properly brought up by her uncle john a very worthy man who took her fathers little farm on his death by the care and kindness of this relation her small fortune which was about seventy pounds was increased when she came of age to near a hundred he charged her nothing for her board and clothed her besides on condition of her being useful in the family and as molly was a welldisposed girl they lived together in this way very happily and both her uncle and aunt were as fond of her as they were of their own children  on this girl or rather on her fortune dick atkins had fixed his eyes it was some time before she took the least notice of him however by degrees it was whispered about the parish that dick atkins kept company with molly summers and the thing came to her uncles ears  why molly said he it surely cannot be true that you have any thoughts of marrying dick atkins  molly said nothing  you must certainly molly continued her uncle do as you please i can lay no restraint upon you i only warn you that if you do marry him you are a ruined woman such another idle rascal does not live in this or in the next parish to it what hope can you have of a fellow who follows no business and is drunk almost every day of his life i have seen many of these idle rascals in my time and i never saw one of them that ever came to good  in the morning molly told her uncle she had been thinking of what he had said and would take his advice accordingly the next time she saw dick she told him she had heard he was a drinking fellow and as she did not like drinking fellows he need trouble his head no more about her  ah molly said dick i suppose uncle john has been telling you all these fine stories of me but has not you the sense to see the rights ont you are very useful to uncle and he would be very sorry to lose you and besides he would not wish you to marry because he hopes your fortune will go to his children  this struck poor molly with the irresistible force of truth she knew well that part of what dick had said was true and she concluded that all the rest was true also she now saw clearly that it was not in pure friendship that her uncle had given her so much good advice and from this moment she looked upon him as less sincere than he pretended of course dicks interest prevailed as the uncles lessened and the affair went on as briskly as ever  well molly said her uncle to her since i cannot prevail on you in one thing let me prevail on you in another let me entreat you not to marry till your money is settled upon yourself and at your own disposal so that if the worst comes you may at least have something to depend on  molly thought this advice extremely good and promised to take it the next day therefore she mentioned to dick ah molly said dick this is another fetch of uncles to stop our marriage he knows well enough i cannot marry without money i never wishes to deceive nobody and i will tell you molly all the rights i has been wild formerly  the worse luck but since i got acquainted with you nobody never seed me in liquor no nor never shall it is true i has no money but i can work as well as any body in the parish what i wishes to do is to take old burnabys farm and you knows molly one must have a few pounds to stock it you shall have little lucy porter for your maid and there we shall live as happy as the day is long  but i pray you molly let us make an end of this business soon that uncle may not make any more delays  all this appeared so fair and honest and reasonable to poor molly who had a generous heart that it overturned at once all her uncles advice and the very first account he had after this of the steps she meant to take was from the minister at church who published the banns of marriage between richard atkins and mary summers both of this parish this cast a damp on all the congregation for they all loved poor molly and saw she was a ruined woman  well molly said her uncle when he came from charch i find you will take neither one part of my advice nor the other the minister has just been asking if any body knew any cause or just impediment against your marriage i have told you molly many causes and just impediments against it but if you will not think so yourself nobody else can think for you i have now done with speaking on the subject and heartily wish you may find this change turn out to your happiness  i fear it much  poor molly soon found her uncles fears too well grounded her marriage turned out as every body expected it would do when dick had gotten her money he had gotten all he wanted he had no intention of taking a farm he carried her to a wretched cottage almost naked of every necessary the very thatch was so bad that the rain trickled through in many places but with regard to himself he spared no expense the first thing he did was to buy a horse a new saddle a pair of neat buckskin breeches a pair of tight new boots and bright steel spurs with the longest shanks he could get he was seldom at home which was poor mollys chief comfort for when he was at home he was generally drunk and attended by some of his vile companions at these times she was obliged to see such horrid scenes of wickedness and to hear such dreadful oaths imprecations and obsceniy that her heart sunk within her and she wished herself dead an hundred times dick took great offense at her mallan chollic humors as he called them and told her he would never have married her if he had known she had been such a miserable soul poor molly could answer him only with floods of tears  or with deep sighs when her heart was too big for such a vent when she was in her sullens as dick would call these fits of despondency he would sometimes beat her and once or twice he turned her out of doors and told her when she had done blubbering she might come in once poor creature she sat all night in the carthouse his behavior was so shocking that the neighbors interfered and complained to the justice which poor molly herself never would have done the justice sent for dick and gave him so severe a reprimand that for the future he refrained from beating her but in all other respects his behavior was as brutal as ever  in the midst of his wickedness dick was seized with a violent fever he had been at a cockfight where he got drunk and falling from his horse at night he rolled into a wet ditch and lay there till the morning when he was found and carried home almost dead it cannot be supposed that his wife had much affection for him but duty supplied the room of affection his disorder increased and her attention increased with it for several nights her clothes were never off and the little necessaries she got for him she was obliged to procure by selling something or other she could ill spare but his blood was in such a corrupted state by a constant course of drunkenness that the doctor said from the first there was but little hope of his recovery often when his fever ran high he was almost raving mad and his poor wife was obliged to get two or three of the neighbors to hold him down in these fits he would utter such dreadful things as terrified all around him ah poor soul said tom davis i would not have thy conscience in me for fifty pound at intervals however he was in his senses but he was then in as dreadful a state if ever he dropped asleep for a moment he started as if he had seen something terrible and once or twice staring wildly about him he asked where it was his wife bid him lie quiet and told him there was nothing but he cried out he saw it as plainly as he did her what he saw nobody could tell but it was plain as tom davis said that his guilty conscience had taken hold of him  one day when he was in a more composed state his wife asked him if he would like to see the minister to which he consented the minister came and sitting down on a chair by his bed side well richard said he how do you feel yourself  very bad sir very bad indeed  i fear you are said the minister but what is your particular complaint  i am all over bad inside and outside  i suppose you mean by that said the minister that you think your soul and body both in a bad state you have no doubt led a very wicked life and if all be true that i have heard have been a very grievous sinner  too true sir said dick too true the worse luck mother pitmans house has been the ruination of me  mother pitmans house said the minister may be bad enough and i believe it is but mother pitmans house is no excuse for you nobody forced you into it it was your own doing welldisposed lads never go near mother pitmans house nor any other house which they know is a wicked one and will lead them into sin but there is another house richard which i believe you never went near and that is the house of god if you had frequented that house as much as you did mother pitmans it is probable you would not have been lying now in all this distress both inside and outside  here dick laying his hand on his head as an acute pain shot through it cried out o god o god  aye richard said the minister when the poor wretch was a little composed the wickedest people cry out upon god in their extremities and this shows that all people naturally think god is their best friend in their distresses if they would call upon him as earnestly in their health as they do in their sickness how happy would it be for them  i hope sir said dick that i have suffered so much in this world that god will be marciful to me in the next  and then he mentioned some confused account he had heard of jesus christs carrying a thief to heaven because he had been crucified for his sins  i know of no such doctrine in scripture said the minister as that he who is punished in this world shall for that reason escape punishment in the next we know of no ground to expect salvation but by leading good lives and trusting in the merits of christ to atone for our repented sins  and the only repentance we know of consists in a change of our hearts as well as our lives but i have heard other sinners richard besides you lay great stress on she thief on the cross but we have not the least reason to suppose he was saved because he was punished in this world but because that was the first opportunity he had of knowing his duty and acknowledging his blessed savior but it is a different case richard with those who live in a christian country they have many opportunities god gives us opportunities richard and it is our part to make use of them he has given you many every sunday you had an opportunity what an opportunity you lost when you lived with your good old mistress at groveplace what an opportunity you lost when you married this virtuous young woman whom you have made so miserable i say not these things to add to your distress but this is not a time for selfdeceit and i want to convince you that all the wickedness you have been guilty of has arisen more from your own wicked self and the neglect of those opportunities which god had given you than from mother pitmans house or your bad companions who would never have sought you if you had not first sought them all you can do now is to have a deep sense of your own wickedness  to pray to god to forgive you through christ  and to make sincere resolutions that if it should please god to raise you up again you will thoroughly change both your heart and life  contrary to the opinion of all people dick recovered the minister on this occasion came to him again and put him in mind of this farther great opportunity which god had now given him if this was neglected he warned him of what the scripture said of those wicked persons whose latter end was worse than the beginning dick promised every thing the minister wished  he would take up entirely a new life  nobody should ever see him drunk again  nor should hear him swear but he would keep his church and mind his work and take care of his family  one should have thought that all this would have been a sufficient warning to this unhappy profligate  at least for some time poor molly hoped it and began to raise her spirits but alas it turned out otherwise let all young people take warning of this and tremble when they once get habits of wickedness it is a dreadful consideration but it is a very true one that they hardly ever leave them off and though they may nor go such great lengths of wickedness as dick atkins did few people indeed do they may be very bad and yet far short of him besides when they get once into the train of wickedness it is impossible to say how far they may go let them take warning then from this unhappy young man who had formed all these dreadful habits of wickedness before he was twentyeight years of age  by the time this vile young fellow had recovered his strength all his wicked habits began again to appear he forgot all his good resolutions and all the minister had said to him and as if he had been losing time by his illness he appeared as if determined to make it all up he got again among his old companions he drank he swore he ranted he roared and out did the worst of them in wickedness making good what the minister told him that if he did not grow better his latter end would be worse than the beginning for it is never the way of wickedness to keep at a stand his wife as usual was the object of his resentment on all occasions when any thing displeased him she was always at hand for him to curse as the cause of every mischief  thus they lived together about four years and had in that time two children nothing could equal the distresses of poor molly and her family he would do nothing and she could do nothing she was naturally of a meek disposition and was now become so spiritless and brokenhearted that she could do little more than crawl about the house like a person half dead then would dick curse her for a lazy jade it was impossible he would tell her for him to maintain the family alone if she would do nothing if it had not been for her and her brats he could have maintained himself well enough poor molly never gave him a word of answer but sat leaning over the table resting her head upon her right arm and stroking the heads of her children who stood at her knee perhaps crying for food her uncle was her only comfort and indeed her only support for if it had not been for him she and her family must have starved but all that he could do was privately to do a kind thing now and then for her for when a woman has ruined herself by an imprudent marriage she has put it out of the power of any body to assist her effectually it is impossible to separate her interest from her husbands so that whatever is done for ber is done to support extravagance and wickedness young women therefore cannot be too careful in keeping company with young men they may very easily be deceived they are inexperienced themselves and had much better take the advice of their fathers and uncles and other friends than follow blindly their own fancies  let poor mollys example be a warning to them  after suffering five years for her imprudence and folly it pleased god at length to release her she was worn down by her afflictions and being reduced to a mere shadow could support nature no longer her uncle was with her at her death whom she tenderly thanked for all his kindness she was perfectly calm and resigned  she blessed god that her deliverance was so near  and said she had not been so happy since the fatal day as she called it a tear started in her eye as she looked at her poor children who were both asleep on the same bed on which she lay expiring poor little wretches said she i hope god will provide for you  oh how i wish this sleep  but i will not say what i was going to say for fear it should be wicked  then turning to her uncle she said i dare not ask you to have an eye to my poor children  but let me be buried near the place where you will be buried and just write over my grave here lies one who was deceived in marriage and died of a broken heart but do not put down my name  such was the end of an unfortunate young woman who was every way qualified to have made a married state a comfort to herself and every one connected with her if she had only acted with prudence  one fatal step ruined her  the melancholy event of his wifes death of which dick was as much the cause as if he had shot her through the head with a pistol had not the least effect on him he left his children to those who chose to take care of them and continued his pleasures the parishofficers calling a vestry got an order from the justices to take him up dick hearing of it or at least suspecting it left the country what became of him was long unknown some said he had been hanged at gloucester for stealing a horse but it appeared afterward that the fellow who was hanged at gloucester was another rascal of his name others who knew his face well said they had seen him in one of the hulks at woolwich but that too was a mistake and these reports only showed what people thought he deserved at last however the true account and all the particulars of his death came to light they were brought by a sailor one john patterson who came to see his aunt mary green the account was this  after dick left the country he went to sea with some smugglers but in their way from france they were pursued by a cutter when the cutter came up with them they were imprudent enough to fire and killed one of her men the cutter however soon overpowered and took them and put all their hands in irons dick who was wounded in the leg and two others wounded also were set on shore in a wild part of the country on the coast of lincolnshire and put under the care of an officer of the customs who happened to be going his rounds in those parts he could find no better place to put them into than an old boathouse on the beach where they were laid on a bundle of seaweed there was no furgeon nearer than wainfleet which was above twenty miles from the place the officer therefore thinking they were not worth the trouble of sending so far put them into the hands of a blacksmith who was a sort of farrier telling him they did not want any great matters of surgery only get them well enough said he to be hanged that is all we want two of them were desperately wounded and died one that afternoon the other the next morning but dick though disabled by a hurt in his foot might have done well if he had been carefully looked after the blacksmith came every day after he had done his work and dressed his wound as well as he could and brought him something to eat and drink but as there was a dispute about burying the dead bodies they were not removed till they became insufferably offensive these dead bodies and his own guilty thoughts were the only company which poor dick had for several days such company such neglect such a surgeon so hot a season for it was in the middle of a sultry august together with the very corrupt state of his blood it may be imagined did not contribute to the cure of his wound neither i suppose did the reflection that as soon as he got well enough he should certainly be hanged his wound soon began to mortify and grow ulcerous in which case the blacksmith had only to cut away every night the putrid flesh which had corrupted in the day the coarse instrument with which this daily business was performed and the rough hand which performed it put the wretched patient to intolerable pain patterson said he heard his screams though he was in a vessel near a quarter of mile from the shore as the wound was in his foot it was long before the mortification seized the vital parts but all his right leg and thigh were now so putrid and horridly offensive that the blacksmith declared who would might attend him he could do it no longer seventeen days from his landing he lay in this shocking condition before his miserable life was ended what his dying agony and despairing thoughts were nobody could tell as he spent all his dreadful hours by himself all that patterson knew farther was that when the farrier came one evening to give him a little food he found him dead and convulsed in so dreadful a way and his features so terribly distorted that he said he believed the devil was in the fellow for he did not think a human body could by any natural means suffer such distortion  about the time of dicks death his sister nan also died who had been as miserable a wretch as he had been as dick had ruined his wife she had ruined her husband in searching the parish where dick lived for some farther particulars of his life i found some which related to his sister nan and i hope the reader will think they are worth relating as an example to others  after the fathers death the widow and two daughters were carried as was said to the poorhouse where the elder died nan was the younger and soon began to show herself to be one of the most forward impudent nasty lying lazy girls of the place she had a downcast look which made some people believe her to be modest but it was only sullenness in which she abounded at the age of thirteen she was put out as a parish apprentice and had the good fortune to get into a place where her master and mistress were well disposed to be kind to her and give her good instruction but like her brother dick she did not improve the opportunies god gave her as she grew older she grew worse  her master would often say consider nanny that every thing has its beginning and among other things wickedness the devil first tempts young people to little sins when they have gotten this lesson perfectly he proceeds to tempt them to greater  but such good advice and much more was thrown away upon nan every year added something to her wickedness she grew more lazy more insolent more a liar and more impudent if any of her acquaintance advised her to behave better to her master and mistress she would d  mn them both  what did she care for them she was but a parish prentice and could not be worse than she was  they might turn her away if they liked at length her behavior became so bad that it plainly appeared she wanted to force them to turn her away which at last they did being able to keep her no longer  thus with very little money without character without friends poor nan was left to the wide world she did not however find that pleasure from liberty which she expected she soon grew tired of doing nothing for young people are much mistaken if they think idleness is the means of happiness none can enjoy true happiness but by doing their duty in that station whatever it is in which god has placed them  but nans being unhappy herself would have been of less consequence if she had not been a pest to others she was a nuisance wherever she came and was the ruin of several poor lads about the country who were foolish enough to listen to her  among others there was a young fellow whose name was harry philipson he worked with farmer hopkins and was as good a lad as any in the country he was very diligent and his master was very fond of him and could put more trust in him than in any lad about the house he never went to the alehouse  never used a bad word  went constantly to church  had a good coat for sundays and allowed his poor mother a shilling a week out of his wages but this wicked woman ruined him  he had been at the fair where his chief errand was to buy his mother a cheese and a pair of warm stockings he had done his business  had sent away his goods by his masters wagon and was himself returning quietly home pleasing himself with carrying his mother the stockings which he knew she wanted but did not expect at the town end he met some young fellows of his acquaintance dringing at a barrel of beer in some places during fairs people are allowed to se beer without a license which they do in booths or sometimes in the open air  they were joyous and merry and began to laugh at harry for sneaking out of the fair without affording himself a drop of beer like a man but buying a halfpenny worth of gingerbread like a child in short they overcame his modesty by laughing at him and he took his mug and sat down amongst them this was the beginning of all his misfortunes he who will do one thing against his reason will do another john trueman would have acted in a different way if they had laughed at him for sneaking out of the fair without a drop of liquor he would have laughed at them again and told them he should hear perhaps the next morning that they had not been able to get out of the fair in any way or if he could have thought of nothing to say to them he would have cried good night to you my lads good night to you and have left them poor philipson with all his goodness of heart had not so much resolution he was taken in and sat drinking among them till he had drunk far more than he ought  as he was returning home through the fields in the dusk of the evening he met nan atkins who was prowling about on purpose to waylay some or other whom she might accidentally meet from the fair for her only livelihood now was the money she got from the young fellows whom she ensnared here philipsons first fatal intercourse began with this wicked abandoned woman which continued to go on partly through her threatenings and partly through her arts if philipson had had the full use of his reason when he first met her he might have seen the wickedness and bad consequences of such an acquaintance and might have escaped but liquor had put the fear of god out of his mind and he was now drawn so far into her snares that he knew not how to get out in the mean time he became quite an altered man he used to make shuffling excuses to his master for neglecting his business he learned bad words from his bad companion instead of going to church on sundays he used to prowl about the forest with nan all the money he could earn she got from him his poor mother used to wonder what was the matter with harry he never came near her and she had not received a farthing from him for several weeks  nan had now lived seven or eight months in this vagabond way when the parish officers made it necessary for her either to go to bridewell or to choose which of her lovers for she had all the idle young fellows of the country after her she would take for a husband she fixed at length on poor philipson and threatened him into a marriage  she was now a married woman and if she had repented of her sins and changed her heart and life and done her duty as she ought she might yet have done well her husband had always been an industrious young fellow and though she had of late corrupted him yet he was still well disposed if she had done her part she too had good hands and might have been a prudent wise and a useful woman if she had pleased but all these opportunities which god put in her power she threw behind her  on his marriage with this bad woman harry took a little cottage among a few houses that stood by the common field he still worked with his old master farmer hopkins and determined to make up for his lost time but he soon found how unequally he was matched when he came home from his days work instead of finding a bit of victuals a clean fireside and a cheerful look he would find his door perhaps locked and nan gone nobody could tell where or perhaps he would find her drinking tea with two or three husseys as nasty as idle and as wicked as herself and eating up perhaps the only remains of victuals in the house harry would sit down and looking about him would ask if she had not got a bit of victuals for his supper nan would perhaps d  n him and bid him look into the cupboard if there was any thing there he might take it if not she could not get victuals without money sometimes also harry would see a bit of a nasty gauze cap or a yard of ribbon or a tawdry hat lying about in short all the money which he got at work and which she continued to get from him went either in eating or in buying finery the poor fellow got little of it himself and a poor miserable neglected child still less  all this hurt poor harry the more because when he went into robin joness cottage which was next to his he saw every thing neat and comfortable robin had three children and though he had no more to live on than philipson yet betty jones always kept them neat and tight their heads were always clean and well combed their hands and faces washed and their poor little coats were never ragged though they were patched with clouts of twenty different colors they always however looked rosy and healthy and every body saw at once that their mother took great care of them  the house too was as clean as the children both the tables shined like a looking glass the chairs were well rubbed and the dresser always clean scowered with white sand on the shelves stood half a dozen bright pewter plates and as many earthen plates two of them indeed were broken but as they stood on the broken parts they looked nearly as well as the others they were meant only for show for beneath them stood a row of wellscowered wooden platters which the family eat off there were several pots also and pans and bowls and wooden spoons all ranged in proper order and all clean but the best piece of furniture was a clock which stood in the corner opposite the door they had bought it soon after they began housekeeping at madam stephenss sale it was that clock which stood in the servants hall on one side of the clock hung a picture of the king in a fine red coat laced with gold and a crown upon his head on the other side hung the queen in a purple gown with a crown likewise many ballads also hung about in several places but all neatly pasted to the wall in the corner by the side of the clock stood a broom which was never weary tho somewhat worn out with sweeping if the children or the pig or the dog brought in the least dirt up it got and swept all into the hearth in a moment poor philipson would come into this neat cottage in an evening when he was locked out of his own and would find his neighbor robin sitting down to a mess of warm broth or a bit of hot bacon and greens ah robin robin he would say how happy a man should i be if my dame was like yours but i got wrong at first god forgive me and i have suffered for it ever since from looking into such a cottage as this when harry went into his own he was struck to the heart there he saw every thing slovenly and dirty the table was always swimming with some nasty slop there was never a chair to sit down on the little things which harry had got into his house on their marriage were all broken or destroyed  all that poor harry could do to bring his wife to a better mind he attempted he coaxed her and treated her kindly why now nanny he would say cannot you keep your house as clean and neat as betty jones keeps here is dont you think there would be more comfort and happiness in it you know nanny i bring you home all i earn and one might expect a little comfort for it but one can hardly sit down or lay ones hat on a table without getting into some nastiness if nan happened to be in better temper she would tell him he was not so clean that he needed to fear a little dirt or if she was in a bad temper which was commonly the case she would d  n him with which language she generally began her speeches and bid him go to bet joness if he liked being there so well  all attempts to reclaim her were however in vain she grew worse instead of better and confounded and ruined every thing poor harry in the mean time could not even buy a jacket for himself but went about one of the raggedest poor fellows in the parish  some of the neighbors used to say that nan drank how that was i do not know she came to dramming afterward but i do not find that she had yet begun  poor harry was at length however quite tired out he could bear her wicked ways and ill usage no longer instead therefore of giving her all he earned at the weeks end and coming home in an evening he kept his money in his pocket giving her only a part and went to the alehouse when he came from his work  this was certainly making bad worse young fellows cannot be too careful before they marry but when they are ill married they must bear it as an evil they have brought on themselves and must make the best of it  harrys new way of life of course was the cause of new misery while he brought nan all he earned to lay out on herself things did not come to the worst but when she was put to allowance and felt herself pinched she raged like a wild beast not that i blame harry for putting her thus to allowance all i blame him for was spending his money at the alehouse for drinking never did any man good or made him happier in whatever way he was miserable if he drink for comfort he never finds it when he is drunk it is true he does not feel the misery he wished to forget but when he is sober again his misery is increased it happened so on this occasion harrys cottage which was wretched before became now a scene of horror whenever he came home nan attacked him with all the virulence of foul language which generally ended in blows harry only defended himself if he had any remains of reason left but sometimes he was quite drunk and would then give her a sound drubbing many a time the neighborhood was alarmed with cries of murder and he has been found by the neighbors perhaps holding her back by her hair or she standing over him with a butchers knife swearing a thousand horrid oaths that she would stick it into him while the poor child was screaming with terror and ready to fall into fits in one of these horrid encounters they both suffered great damage harry lost an eye by the edge of an iron candlestick which nan threw at his head and she in the scuffle fell against the corner of a table and received a very bad bruise upon her breast all the neighbors however pitied poor harry and some advised him to go to a justice and swear the peace against her but harry would not consent  one day however as he was lamenting his misfortunes to his neighbor robin jones i think verily said robin if you will follow my advice we can mend her if we cannot cure her so he mentioned the scheme he had in his head to harry who approved it well then said robin the next time she is obstropulous only go to the door and whistle  an opportunity soon happened nan was obstropulous the next morning it was saturday and as harry was going out to work nan began by calling him a lousy villain and threatened with an oath to beat out his brains if he did not bring home all the money he received for his weeks pay harry seeing the storm beginning to rise stepped to the door and whistled robin who knew the sign instantly came in with a good cord in his hand they then seized poor nan by her arms and having pinioned her tied her tight to an old elbowchair and then fastened the chair to the wall now says harry i will leave you there nanny to cool a little so he carried the child to betty jones locked the door put the key in his pocket and went to his work nan yelled terribly but as all the neighborhood knew the cause and came to the window only to laugh at her she was tired at last with screaming for the entertainment of her neighbors and sat sullen harry seldom came from his work till the evening but on this occasion he came home at breakfast time well nanny said he if you will promise to be good i will loose you and you shall have some victuals nan was sullen she would not speak but only spit at him and made faces just as you like said he nanny so he locked the door again and went to his work  at dinnertime he returned nan had then found the use of her speech but only to abuse him for a cursed villain intending as she supposed to starve her to death many of the neighbors coming in and mocking her harry was inclined to let her loose but robin jones whispered him in the ear you fool if you do we have done no good yet so harry contented himself with saying all the neighbors nanny can witness that i offer to let you loose and give you victuals if you will only promise to be good  how can you make her promise any such thing said jenny sloper we all know what a quiet good creature she has always been and what a wicked fellow you have been to her never fear nan well bear witness for you  i have often heard said nanny bates of being bound to peace and good behavior but i never saw it till now  but neither the kind speeches of her husband nor the taunts of her neighbors had any effect on nan she sat sullen and only spit at them or made faces so harry locked up the door once more and went to his work when he returned at night nan continued still untractable he offered to loose her he offered her victuals she was quite sullen so he sat quietly down to his supper and between every mouthful asking her deliberately if she would be good or what pleasure she could take in being so obstropulous he made an end of his meal and taking the candle to go up stairs well nanny said he good night to you i am sorry you will not behave better  he had determined however at any rate not to keep her tied up all night but just to try this one more expedient nan however not knowing his intention and fearing the worst was at length subdued and as he was going up stairs called out you may loose me if you will harry who had not heard so meek a note from her a long time came down and asked her if she intended now to be good on receiving a milder answer than he expected he immediately loosed her nan burst into a flood of tears in a sort of hysteric fit and harry was terribly afraid he had gone too far however after taking a little victuals and drink she recovered but was very sullen and said little or nothing  the next morning when harry went to his work nan went to justice wilson and made oath of the usage she had suffered sir thomas was very angry he had never heard of such a thing before and resolved to make an example of poor harry so he appointed ten oclock the next morning to inquire into the matter and ordered several of the neighbors to attend but when he had found out all the truth he changed his mind and told nan he did not much like interfering between man and wife and advised her husband and her to make the matter up sir thomas however called harry privately and told him it was very true his wife had given him great provocation but still said he i do not approve the method you took you had better have brought your complaint to me and i would have bound her over and if she could not have found bail as i suppose she could not i should have sent her to bridewell there are separate cells now in which bad people are kept without being allowed to speak to any body these places soon bring them to reason harry promised sir thomas he never would tie her up again but begged his worship would be so good as not to mention his having found fault with him  it was a fortunate thing however for harry that nan went to the justice for she now found there was no remedy and though she continued still very bad  neglected her husband  her child and her house yet she never broke out into that violence of temper which she used to do if ever any thing of that kind appeared harry quieted her immediately by going to the door and threatening to whistle for robin jones  but though nan was better as to the violence of her temper yet there are so many kinds of wickedness which bad people run into that they are never at a loss it was about this time i believe that nan took to drinking i have heard that she was given to it before but from the best accounts i can gather i rather think as i have already observed she did not take to it till now in bad men this vice begins often in early youth but in women i believe it seldom appears so early  at a little lonely house on the edge of the common lived bet webster a vile hussy who kept a pothouse here nan used regularly to go sometimes taking her child and sometimes locking it up and here she used to carry whatever she could get to pawn a pot of beer or a glass of gin nan thought the greatest comfort which the world could afford but as the continuance of this pleasure grew too expensive for her she conceived the design of setting up a pothouse herself harry was much against it he told her he never knew a pothouse come to good and had known three or four of them broken up within these two years however for peace and quietness sake he at length consented so with the first money they earned they bought a couple of casks  two or three mugs  a little malt  a small firking of gin of the smugglers and two or three glasses with only shanks which they got cheap and which stood as well upon their mouths as if they had had bottoms the house being thus furnished as a pothouse was presently frequented by all the roaring idle drinking swearing fellows in the neighborhood in this shocking way of life nan continued two months and was a great nuisance to the neighborhood the gentlemen the farmers and the tradesmen all complained that their servants and apprentices were corrupted at length the matter came to such an height that spies were set upon the house and an information on oath laid before sir thomas wilson harry was fined five pounds and was obliged to pay it by selling a cow and a little forest mare which his late uncle robert had just left him in the last edition of this work it was said that harry had bought the cow and the forest mare which appeared to me very unlikely as i knew not how he could raise money for such a purchase on farther inquiry i find he did not buy them but received them as i have now stated the matter in a legacy  this affair hurt him very much and the more as he had always been against their selling liquor he had now lost ten times as much by it as he had ever gained  but nan could not much longer have carried on her business if this stop had not been put to it the mischief she did herself when in the violence of her temper she fell against the edge of a table began now to show itself it was a very ugly bruise and had ong been black inflamed and painful but it now through neglect began to mortify and became cancerous her constant gindrinking too had heated her blood to such a degree as to make the evil much worse thus do we continually bring misfortunes and mischiefs on ourselves which the goodness of god would never have brought upon us her pains poor wretch became intolerable she had no rest either by day or night and her stench was such that nobody could bear to come near her amongst all her distresses her bad conscience was not the least many a time she thought how happy she might have been if she had acted as she ought but all was now over the parishdoctor told her he could do nothing more for her and she must expect to die in a little time she would have prayed to god but she had never prayed in all her life and knew not how to begin she was afraid to send for the minister whose face she hardly knew her husband did all he could for her though she had deserved so little at his hands but nothing could ease her pains which shot through her body and nothing could ease her conscience which shot through her mind she lived about six weeks in this miserable way and when she died every one thought a nuisance was removed from the earth  after her death harry who had seen such a dreadful example before him took up a new life he left off drinking nobody ever saw him again at the alehouse he got his sister jenny who lived with farmer styles to take care of his house and child it is surprising how that poor little wretch had survived all the ill usage it had received from its mother but somehow or other through the kind hand of providence it had grown up to be six years of age it was yet too young to have learned a bad example from its mother and its father and aunt now set it a very good one harry had a pair of good hands and was very industrious  made a great deal of money  spent it all at home as he should do and having paid a severe price for the folly and wickedness of his youth in being connected with that bad woman he once more saw happy days through the blessing of god  and was an example of that great truth which he would often acknowledge that wickedness always brings its own punishment with it even in this world and that the poorest man may be as happy as the richest if he will only use such means as god has put in his power  the end
