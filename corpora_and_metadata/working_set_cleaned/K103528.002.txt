memoirs of t wilkinson  vol ii  memoirs of his own life by tate wilkinson patentee of the theatresroyal york and hull  in four volumes   if i had held my pen but half as well as i have held my bottle  what a charming hand i should have wrote by this time vol ii  york printed for the author by wilson spence and mawman and sold by g g j and j robinson paternosterrow and t and j egerton whitehall london anno    0  memoirs of tate wilkinson the winter of the year      was productive of many material theatrical revolutions a sudden and unforeseen stroke happened at drury lane by the unexpected loss of mr woodward the entire support of all the comedies where mr garrick was not concerned as his marplot foppington sir fopling flutter duretete bore testimony and he was of great importance in many where mr garrick was principal such as his never equalled bobadil and mercutio mr garrick being kitely and romeo all the pantomime department rested entirely on the shoulders of woodward in short the loss of that gentleman was such as put so dangerous a hatchet to the tree as made the old bark to tremble not only for its branches but an alarm even of the cutting up the root of the venerable oak that had flourished on that sacred spot and which had been dedicated to the muses for ages and stood many a threatening blast and tempest had they not at that juncture been remarkably feeble at covent garden by the loss of barry and others the tears of old madam drury would have had additional cause to flow woodward not to his praise or wisdom be it recorded left his enviable situation being in possession of every comfort and affluence and secure of the hearts and smiles of the public and on terms of amity with mr garrick yet with all these advantages he fled which he never repented but once and that for altogether woodward and barry seduced from both the theaters mr and mrs walker formerly miss minors both living now i believe mr jefferson mr vernon and also several useful performers a severe cut in a regular catalogue of stockacting plays  that the loss of so many performers with woodward at the head of such a desertion from the royal standard was considerably felt is certain but garricks name was a tower of strength he therefore in a great degree stopped the breach by his own force presenting himself early after this revolt not only in his characters of never failing command of attraction but by producing himself as a new marplot etc and this chasm in his theatrical army obliged him as a wise general to be more pliant and enter into an engagement with foot on his own terms with me to act in his diversions of the morning revolutions in the real state occasion the same compliance from policy and like mr bayess rehearsal has its sudden changes of government instances need not be traced to show the ins and the outs  mr garrick had that year during the summer vacation met accidentally with a young gentleman an intimate friend of mine with whom on the loss of woodward he took infinite pains and formed a great partiality and friendship for him he made his first appearance that year at drury lane in captain brazen in the recruiting officer early in the month of october i dined that day with my old acquaintance mrs wier near pall mall mentioned long before of harrow to this lady i shall again have occasion to recur with mrs wier lodged not a young lady though named miss roach and in truth an affected bold artful i dare not say plain rude disagreeable woman with mrs wier dined also mr baker manager of the york company here i refer to an instance in the early part of this work and remark how useful attentive civility turns out from whence there can be no reason at the time to expect an advantage my good behavior when i was thirteen or fourteen years old to this mrs wier grew into a lasting esteem which continued the acquaintance and was the whole and sole occasion of bringing about by that accidental meeting my being manager of the york theater  for strangers of any reputation were then never admitted to play at york or hull which rule had i abided by those stages had been on a more solid foundation than at the present day i perceived while at dinner an oddity of humor and manner in this elderly gentleman that demanded respect and esteem and i also felt really an attachment for his apparent marks of worth and benevolence this led into a strict intimacy while the old gentleman remained his few days in london  he wished i would visit him at york as a friend i was not known at that time in london as a performer and i regretted the loss of that worthy character when he left the capital after dinner we took a coach from pall mall to the theater and when arrived there hundreds were on their return  no room  no room was the cry from every part of the house mr baker with the ladies returned home but i from privilege of course had admission behind the scenes my friend was received with candor warmth and universal applause his person and manners were uncommonly genteel and highly finished a good representation of the real fine gentleman it is often lamented is rarely seen on the stage and to the truth of that observation i submit but at the same time let it be noticed that in persons of the first station in life aided with every requisite accomplishment all the necessary ingredients are seldom conjoined either in the real fine gentleman or the real fine lady so as to equal the expanse of our ideas read sir charles grandison and we shall find the poet has furnished him with a handsome and accomplished person his mind with manliness taste feeling generosity courage discretion assisted with all the arts and aids of education but few very few such paragons have been really seen though like the unicorn such exaltation of the mind and person may perchance exist now an actor of understanding and education must certainly be in a good school for attaining ease who performs before hundreds nightly and part of that collected audience consisting of the first personages and it is possible the best speaker in the house of commons if put really to act on the stage would feel not only awkward but likely inferior in point of freedom and expression to the actor even in the representation of the gentleman  the true fine gentleman is an arduous task to attain in the most exalted state and rarely to be viewed near perfection unless as visionary either at the court the bar army pulpit or the stage indeed at the palace ease elegance of manners and liberal education with every attendant accomplishment must give the truest polish and deportment and shine more conspicuous there than in any other department of life as certainly the great circle will ever be the only criterion of true taste and fashion but let us be informed of the most finished character at any period and enter our senate purposely to view the person and manners of the paragon so famous and extolled i think from observation i may almost venture to affirm the reality would certainly fall far short of expectation as a point in proof about eight years ago i had the opportunity of hearing a great mans maiden speech in the house of commons the tones of voice seemed truly captivating though he spoke not at that time in favor of court politics my situation was such i could not at the instant gain a glimpse at the fascinating prodigy but when afterward with infinite pains and difficulty that satisfaction was obtained  lo how the great man lessened to my view   the reason is demonstrative true perfection is seldom found in natures works so many requisites being necessary to the combination renders it as difficult to find as the longitude the late lord chesterfield employed his pen over numerous pages to illustrate this yet with all his knowledge labor and pains he could not create or realise in short the real fine gentleman may truly be termed the phoenix and that phoenix rare great britain in our present golden days may boast rising daily to full bloom adorned with every art humanity and honor that can fill the noble breast would the lord chesterfield just mentioned could be restored to one hours life he then might close his eyes with transport and from his quivering lips proclaim he beheld all his boundless wishes gratified when he viewed his favorite graces all united in the prince of wales  but to return the young hero who played capt brazen had more ease than any young or old actor i ever remember and in drawing his sword he threw all other performers at a wonderful distance by his swiftness ease grace and superior elegance to him was mr garrick afterward much indebted for the applause he received in hamlet in the sencing scene with laertes as he performed that character and there twas visible mr garricks pupil was the master after the play was finished i paid my respects to the young gentleman returned back to my company and gave them an exact description of the new adventurers good fortune which i did with true pleasure  mr baker was seldom in london but came to supply the loss of the york heroine mrs dancer after that mrs barry now mrs crawford who had eloped with mr dancer to barrys new dublin theater by a repair of coarse plaster in engaging the goblin miss roach a horrid spectre as a substitute for mrs dancer with her merit and then in her prime of life miss roach however undertook to be the york lady townly etc but when he made her appearance was so indifferently received that in consequence of it i do not believe she acted three nights the whole season she had a good benefit and that extorted by really good acting as she attended mass constantly and so devoutly that she was thought a saint though little nuns flesh in her composition for the would have debauched a whole convent she had much art a cunning understanding and a flow of spirits yet affectation that would have been surfeiting in a beauty but she flattered well and to flatter well requires study and caution  if well done there is no doubt of its being glibly swallowed she however wheedled mr baker into a belief she possessed great abilities and the public that she was a good woman  but it must have been without her head  before the middle of october mr foot had settled preliminaries with mr garrick for his two exotics as he called mr foot and myself to appear in the same piece mr foot then requested me to do bounce as a pupil to mr puzzle in the diversions of the morning a part i had refused when in dublin but now as an old stager from my practice at portsmouth and being in health and vigor i had not the same excuse or objection though it was a fatiguing scene it was advertised in the following manner diversions of the morning mr foot mr holland mr packer with others and mr wilkinson without my first appearance which certainly was unkind and unprecedented as it did not introduce me to the candor of the public which they ever grant to a young performer and novice on the stage however this is an after thought for i was at that time highly gratified with the large letters in which my name was printed a foible natural to every candidate soon after this farce was known by the town to be in rehearsal some mrs candor gave my friend mrs woffington the alarm who still lived and existed on the flattering hopes of once more captivating the public by her remaining rays of beauty born to bloom and fade and who declared she was astonished on hearing i had survived my presumption in ireland in daring to be the devil in her likeness there to take her off colonel caesar of the guards who it was whispered at that time was secretly married to mrs woffington had been as mentioned at portsmouth the night of my benefit when the duke of york and most of the principal gentlemen of the army in the kingdom were at that time assembled and were most forcibly struck with the sudden and high entertainment they received by seeing their favorite woffington where she was so little expected and indeed the exactness of manner rendered it certainly as a performance of that kind far beyond mediocrity  she was so alarmed on mrs candours intelligence and not without foundation of truth of my being engaged and worse than all to make my first appearance conjunctively with foot at drury lane that she thought it highly prudent for her same and peace from what materials of intelligence she had collected as to the imitation of herself in dublin to endeavor by every means of subtlety and force to counteract prevent and by authority put an effectual stop to such a procedure which she judged would hurt her mind all this was natural  most persons would do the same for the most trivial cause and this in fact was no more than trifling  not any person likes to be a subject of ridicule when she was first made acquainted with my appearance in queen dollallolla she declared by the living god she was amazed the fellow was not stoned to death in dublin but her own treatment of me might have fully convinced her that ill nature is too apt to find countenance particularly if exciting contemptuous merriment  on deliberation mrs woffington deputed col caesar to wait on mr garrick he related his objections in point of delicacy and honor concerning any affront however slight reflectedly thrown on that lady he said to mr garrick he should not be surprised if young wilkinson had success on such an attempt for without the sanction of a london audience to render it fashionable he knew it was possible having been a witness to his said imitation at portsmouth and as the same performance might render her as an actress ridiculous and as she was at that time under his protection his intention as a visitor to mr garrick was to inform him if he permitted such procedure or achievement from mr wilkinson on his stage he must expect from him col caesar to be seriously called upon as a gentleman to answer it mr garrick immediately not only acquiesced but expressed a detestation of any such performance bless his good nature and i actually believe would not have been displeased with receiving an order from the lord chamberlain for a prohibition of the whole of mr footes or my exhibition had it not proved at that juncture very convenient to make every show of novelty to attract the town to his grand london principal booth of the fair my appearing at all and the being attended to was neither mr garricks wish nor intention if to my advantage he therefore willingly obeyed the colonels mandate in behalf of his once lovely and admired peggy indeed he could have done no less to save appearances for where he had formerly so professedly avowed a tender passion mr garrick coincided in opinion that such an attempt on the merits of mrs woffingtons acting would be illiberal and unwarrantable in the highest degree  the day before the piece was to be acted he summoned foot and me and related the abovementioned particulars and informed us that his word and honor was engaged to colonel caesar that mr wilkinson should not take the liberty to make any line speech or manner relative to mrs woffington or presume to offer or occasion any surmise of likeness so as to give the least shadow of offense on any account whatever this i subscribed to on mr garricks commands and mr foot became my bail for the same  for garrick was really on this matter very uneasy with foot and wilkinson his d  d exotics  mrs woffington i shall seldom have to review again in these sheets and if the reader recollects i have not been sparing of her good qualities either as an actress or a woman what i have mentioned as to myself is only what belongs to my history but no pique from what had long ago passed and hope when she died if she favored me with a thought she forgave me as i now do her for had i been in her place i think i might and should too probably have acted the same as she did and by the same rule had mrs woffington been mr wilkinson she might not have acted with so little spleen  but that perhaps the reader will say is a compliment to myself  the diversions of the morning was at length produced in october and to an overflowing theater  curiosity was universally raised to see mr footes pupil as i was called and to this hour by many believed mr footes acquaintance were numerous and of the first circles and he took every precaution and care for his own sake for fear of failure or party to have me strongly supported and he blazed forth wilkinsons wonderful merit as on my success he intended what he put into execution which was to give me the laboring oar and make myself a number of implacable enemies and as to the money i brought he judged it only safe and fit for his own emolument  in the second act of the farce he surrounded by his pupils as mr puzzle their instructor called me on as mr wilkinson  mr wilkinson  i was received with every pleasing token by the first audience in the world for candor and liberality  for such london certainly is when unbiassed  it most assuredly commands and deserves that appellation  i found myself much more alarmed than i expected i should have been for the very name of a london audience strikes terror to the performer but that as well as other audiences are not always judges for themselves for party spleen envy hatred and malice can form so many different opinions which scattered like ratsbane up and down the pit without preserving their own respect as may and often does with wanton cruelty destroy many an actor and actress these things blessed be god only sometimes happen and will again  instances may be given not to be denied  the scene between mr foot and myself went off with great eclat on my departure from the stage while he did his puppets etc the audience grew very impatient by seeing my exit and judged that was all the new actor was to do and feeling a disappointment from murmuring they grew impatient and at last burst out into vehemently asking for wilkinson and desiring to be informed if that was the only performance they were to expect from that young gentleman this loud interruption was not paying him his accustomed attention and he seemed much nettled however he bowed and said the new performer was only retired for a little respite necessary for his following part of the entertainment this answer was approved and mr foot was proceeding but the little clamor had reached and disturbed the minds of the gods and john bull as well as their godships thinking mr foot meant to deprive them of part of their rights though they could not tell what as they had not all heard mr footes apology distinctly again repeated wilkinson wilkinson  foot at this second interruption grew really offended and having secured the lower house he stopped and said to mr manly holland who was on the stage with him did you ever hear such fellows d  n it they want the fifth act of a play before the second is over  and as what he said generally passed current this occasioned an universal roar and all went on peaceably and with great good humor till the appointed time for my second entrance which was near the conclusion  the people eager to applaud they knew not why or what but full of expectation that some strange performance was to be produced  and indeed to give an account of the approbation the sudden effect the incessant laughter would argue so much of the fabulist and of dear self that it would surfeit even me to read and if so how would an entire stranger feel why treat it with an angry or contemptuous opinion  therefore let it suffice that every thing succeeded that night that could gratify the pride vanity and most sanguine wishes of a young man greedy for fame the farce finished with my performance and mr foot on my bow made his own not attempting to proceed and was himself in great raptures for reasons before hinted at but when the curtain was down he went on and assured the audience he was much honored by their approbation and with their permission would the next night repeat the same piece again  which they had expected he would do and returned the usual tokens of their approbation  some of my imitations were mr sparks in capulet mr barry in alexander mr sheridan in orestes mr foot in the prologue with several others   the next night the house was jammed in every part  the morning of which it was strongly rumoured that the actors of covent garden were highly enraged  that mr sparks in particular was really disordered on the occasion  mr holland called at the theater and informed mr garrick and mr foot he had actually heard that mr sparks was so much hurt and unhappy that he had taken to his bed and was dangerously ill  foot immediately replied in his laughing manner that it could not be true or that it must be a d  d lie for he had met his wife with two pounds of muttonchops on a skewer for her husbands dinner this impromptu occasioned a hearty greenroom laugh for though the actors in general disliked foot at that time and ever did until he was a manager a wonderful instance indeed as they did not relish his writings on account of the freedoms he often took with the profession which always when introduced the actors and managers were generally mentioned in a degrading light and though he knew the public relished the severity yet in fact it was not generous or neat to dirty his own nest instead of cleansing the theatrical stable and his having been free with the performers mode of playing had occasioned very little regard from any and from several a fixed hatred he had a number of enemies in private life indeed many domestic characters severely felt his comic lash which was smarting to those on whom it was inflicted but still his universal acquaintance his wit humor open house and entertaining qualities raised him superior to his maligners and in general he rolled in luxury and indolence it would have been much more unfashionable not to have laughed at footes jokes than even at quins  quins were morose strong and of a particular vein of humor like the characters he succeeded in  as the old bachelor apemantus sir john brute gardener ventidius falstaff etc each of which bear a likeness of the man and there were often wellpointed stories related of him in books such as humphrey clinker and many like publications which will either justify or condemn my assertion but mr foot was irresistible spontaneous and not confined to manner or character for wherever he aimed his humor and raillery he shot the object as it flew by his quick fancy and all with a superior degree to his opponents  when mr garrick was at the noon rehearsals he ever was on the listen and if he heard foot and the performers joking would enter all full of whim and affected easy affability and equality and made himself one of the laughing group and at every jest of footes appeared to pay particular tributes of surprise applause and attention but when in turn he related what he had studied and prepared as very comical if the same repetition of approbation as had gone before attendant to footes humor was wanting to his he has been cut to the soul at finding footes superiority which was generally the consequence when both were pitched for battle and eager for victory at the game of repartee and sparring sarcasm and which was frequently granted to foot by the courtiers and adulators of garrick even while depending on the smiles of their master and under the apprehension of incurring the terror and loss of favor from offended majesty  one great reason as a man of wit for footes superiority on such convivial meetings was that he like tbe american felt bold knew his superiority which was raised by the perfect knowledge of garricks fears and which made foot so easy that he gave not himself the trouble to hate mr foot would frequently say to mr garrick bless me we have been laughing away our time it is past three oclock have you and mrs garrick enough for a third without infringing on your servants generosity for i know they are on board wages besides the kitchenfire may be gone out if it be one of your cold meat days or if one of mrs garricks fast days i cannot expect a dinner on emergency on footes repeating such a whimsical jargon garrick would act a laugh like bays though all the joke lay like mr bayess  in the boots  many whimsical meetings have i been at between those two great geniusses and truly enjoyed them from that time to the present but mr footes knowledge of garrick was but superficial when compared with mr murphys for mr murphys cool and sensible penetration made him a perfect judge of the whole inward soul of mr garrick while foot without perplexing himself with the fatigue of thinking was contented with slighter materials to garnish his merriment and which amply satisfied his love of satire and cheerfulness to speak seriously of these gentlemen  why foot should have entertained such an inconceivable disgust to mr garrick i cannot devise unless from that implacable attendant more or less in the human breast called envy which ever haunts a theater that garrick had much reason to be offended with foot is certain and that he inwardly hated him is as certain nor is that to be a matter of surprise as foot was ever endeavoring to expose and even if possible to injure him he gloried in it and seized every opportunity to have a cut at him and serve him up as the maimed not perfect garrick  unless to acknowledge perforce like colley cibber who allowed but with great difficulty to mrs bracegirdle that really garrick he believed had merit but foot never introduced his deserts or heard of him as an actor with pleasure or allowed him any credit for his theatrical abilities but wished the conversation was over or if obliged to give his sentiments would conclude with yes the hound had a something clever but if his excellence was to be examined he would not be found in any part equal to colley cibbers sir john brute lord foppington sir courtly nice or justice shallow and so the world goes round   but justice bids me say in favor of mr garrick that to my knowledge he often assisted mr foot with sums of money not trifling and foot always attributed the favor done from fear not generosity yet it certainly was an obligation and that service tendered when foot has been in awkward situations for want of cash and to relate facts on all sides i am here answerable  nothing extenuate or set down aught in malice   the following anecdote of dr johnson and garrick roscius may be relied on  doctor johnson being with foot holland woodward and others on a party at mr garricks villa at hampton as they were conversing on different subjects he fell into a reverie from which his attention was drawn by the accidentally casting his eyes on a bookcase to which he was as naturally attracted as the needle to the pole on perusing the title pages of the best bound he muttered inwardly with ineffable contempt but proceeded on his exploring business of observation ran his finger down the middle of each page and then dashed the volume disdainfully open on the floor the which garrick beheld with much wonder and vexation while the most profound silence and attention was bestowed on the learned doctor but when he saw his twentieth wellbound book thus manifestly disgraced on the ground and expecting his whole valuable collection would share the same victim fate he could no longer restrain himself but suddenly cried out most vociferously  why d  n it johnson  you you you will destroy all my books  at this johnson raised his head paused fixed his eyes and replied lookee david you do understand plays but you know nothing about books which repartee occasioned an irresistible laugh at garricks expense as well as that of his having given them a good dinner with plenty of choice viands  but if these are to be my memoirs it is necessary to rehearse over the scenes of my second nights performance  the house was what we of the theatrical tribe like to see and term chuck full in every part  not only from the alarm the first exhibition had given but by many who were inimical to my performance as well as those who approved of it for several actors had naturally rouzed their friends to crush me in the shell if possible and not only scotch the snake but kill it  on my first entrance there were marks of disapprobation and on my second sounded to me at such an alarming height that i thought all was over but the multitude of well wishers and the number whose curiosity had been raised longed to be satisfied and bore all before them and very trifling marks were heard or suffered after sufficient to create any great tremor or uneasiness  to be concise the opposition proved a favorable circumstance for it fixed me as the fashion and superior to my master foot as an imitator and i was triumphantly given out again with as much satisfaction to three parts of the audience as if i had been an actor of the first consequence on those boards  a little ill nature evidently shown is the luckiest circumstance that can happen to an author or performer of any merit but beware of a great deal  a single critic will not frown look big harmless and pliant as a single twig but crowded here they change and it is not odd for twigs when bundled up become a rod this little piece went on in a most flourishing state till about the fifth or sixth night when mr sparks of covent garden theater felt himself so wounded by my attack on his acting which truly was a very picturesque one and those who remember him and me at that time will allow what i have here said that he waited on mr garrick and requested he would not suffer him as a man of credit in private life and an actor of estimation in public to be destroyed by such an illiberal attack on his livelihood and as it struck at his reputation hoped he would not permit it in future as far as regarded himself whom it had rendered miserable  garrick said why now hey sparks why now hey this is so strange now hey a  why wilkinson and be d  d to him they tell me he takes me off and he takes foot off and so why you see that you are in very good company  very true sir says sparks but many an honest man has been ruined by keeping too good company  and then sparks made his bow and his exit mr garrick however came to the theater at noon paraded with great consequence up and down the stage sent for me and when i obeyed the mighty summons he was surrounded by most of the performers i fancied it had been some lucky goodnatured thought of his to serve me but why should i have imagined so  down busy devil down  for he soon convinced me to the contrary as he began a fiery lecture with now hey d  n it wilkinson  now why will you take a liberty with these gentlemen the players and without my consent you never consulted or told me you were  take off as you call it  hey why now i never take such liberties  indeed i once did it but i gave up such d  d impudence and in saying this the good manager forgot he d  d those arts that caused himself to ise  hey now that is i say  but you and foot and foot and you think you are managers of this theater  but to convince you of the contrary and be d  d to ye a common expression of mr garricks  in half jest half earnest  i here order you before these gentlemen to desist from taking any liberty with any one of covent garden theater and i think it necessary to avow and declare my abhorrence of what you have done and at the same time to disclaim my consent or knowledge of it  i do not allow my such unbecoming liberties nor will i permit them from another where i am manager and if you dare repeat such a mode of conduct after my commands i will fine you the penalty of your article  which was three hundred pounds  here i felt myself in a fine predicament here was a sudden fall to all my greatness and a haste to my setting  the actors and actresses one and all applauded the goodness of mr garricks heart and sneered at the lowered pride of an upstart mimic and his imitations i stood like cardinal wolsey in the third act of henry viii when looked on contemptibly by the lords surry norfolk suffolk etc so farewell my little good lord cardinal and had garrick gone and pronounced  and now to dinner with what appetite ye may  it would have heightened the resemblance if i may be allowed to compare small things with great  i was exceedingly embarrassed and mortified when up came to me dame clive who said aloud fie young man fie and declared it was impudent and shocking for a young fellow to gain applause at the expense of the players whose reputation with the public rested in their good opinion and the performers ought to appear quiet peaceable and well behaved and not act in such an hostile manner as i had done with those gentlemen who endeavor to get a livelihood  now added she i can and do myself take off but then it is only the mingottii mingotti was the mara of that year  and a set of italian squalling devils who come over to england to get our bread from us and i say curse them all for a parcel of italian bitches  and so madam clive made her exit and with the approbation of all the stage lords and ladies in waiting whilst i stood like a puppy dog in a dancingschool  when mr mossop the turkeycock of the stage with slow and haughty steps all erect his gills all swelling eyes disdainful and hand upon his sword breathing as if his respiration was honor and like the turkey almost bursting with pride began with much hauteur  mr wilkinson phew as breathing grand sir  mr will  kin  son sir i say  phew  how dare you sir make free in a public theater or even in a private party with your superiors if you were to take such a liberty with me sir i would draw my sword and run it through your body sir you should not live sir  and with the greatest pomp and grandeur made his departure his supercilious air and manner was so truly ridiculous that i perceived mr garrick underwent much difficulty to prevent his gravity from changing to a burst of merriment but when mossop was fairly out of sight he could not contain himself and the laugh beginning with the manager it was followed with avidity by each one who could laugh the most  and all anger with me was for a few minutes suspended and certainly mossops don quixotelike manner was irresistibly diverting and pleased every one but me who stood all their brunts for i did not feel myself in a cheerful mood yet good humor was so prevalent that i could not refrain from smiling and at this time can laugh very heartily whenever i bring the scene into my minds eye presently entered foot loudly singing a french song to show his breeding and on seeing such a group of actors on the stage pronounced like witwoud hey day what are you all got together here like players at the end of the last act  then said he had called at mr garricks house and was informed he should find him at the theater for he wanted to fix on two or three plays wherein he would act on the nights of his diversions in the morning mr garrick then assumed much serious consequence and related to mr foot the state of affairs  that he had received strong representations from covent garden theater and had from motives of humanity and consideration resolved to put a stop to wilkinsons proceedings and that mr tate must that night perform the part of bounce only and at his peril to disobey his orders and that after his exit as mr bounce the piece must finish with mr footes performance and no more wilkinson  if indeed now  if wilkinson could have taken me off as mrs garrick says why now as to that i should have liked it vastly and so would mrs garrick  but i again enforce wilkinsons not appearing on my stage a second time  and to my astonishment foot assented but had i been entrusted or acquainted with chicanery and the mysteries behind the curtain of a london theater though to this hour i am not above half perfect my wonder would not have been so great  i went from the playhouse in dudgeon and retired home with a heavy mind though only three hours before i had left my lodgings all elate and with a heart as light as a feather but all my alertness was gone and i entered with a bosom overpowered with shame and disappointment and should not have been surprised had i been affronted in the streets as i went to and from the theater for i every day received incendiary letters and the rage and anger of some particular performers even bordered on inveteracy  as the evening approached i went and prepared myself for bounce only according to order and when bounce was finished retired to the greenroom but am certain both mr garrick and mr foot had planted persons in the house to call for wilkinson because mr foot had not gone through half his performance when the call for me was universal which could not have been the case as it was a repeated piece and the time not come for my second appearance as usual had not some subtlety been used in the business as for my own part i am clear i was perfectly innocent not having any knowledge of the town or by any means at that time knowing how to raise a clamor of the kind therefore some chicanery must have been practiced in the affair i thought mr foot had been prepared with sufficient reasons for the omission and that he would have explained them to the audience and the farce be no more repeated but no doubt now remains with me that notwithstanding the lecture i had received in the morning it meant more than reached the ear and the event which followed was the result of ingenuity which by a develop of characters i think i may honestly venture to give a bold guess how the matter really was though at that time it did not strike my mind  the clamor continued when mr foot retired from the stage and mr garrick ordered the lights to be let down which consisted of six chandeliers hanging over the stage every one containing twelve candles in brass sockets and a heavy iron flourished and joined to each bottom large enough for a street palisade this ceremony being complied with mr garrick said it would with the lamps also lowered be a convincing proof to the audience that all was over but this only served like oil thrown on flames to increase the vociferation on garricks perceiving this he came to me in the greenroom and with seeming anger and terror asked me how i had dared to cause a riot and disturbance in his theater and send a set of blackguards into the house to call for me all i could urge in my horrid situation was asserting my ignorance of the matter but which was of no avail and while i was proceeding with my asservations in piano  the forte broke out into outrageous tumult  what was to be done i replied i would run away but that mr garrick said as matters stood could not be suffered foot  foot  foot was echoed and reechoed from every part of the house he had been standing with the most perfect ease and laughing all the time but being thus loudly summoned obeyed the call of duty and on the stage instantly presented himself and when there was interrogated why mr wilkinsons part of the farce that had been so well received was omitted mr foot made an harangue and observed if honored with their patience to hear him he would endeavor to explain and he hoped to their satisfaction on this silence ensued he said he was exceedingly sorry to have given cause for being called to an account for any motive of their displeasure begged respectfully to assure them that as to the omission of mr wilkinsons latter performance it had only been introduced by way of entertainment not with intention of injury to any individual whatever for a harmless laugh was all the young gentleman had aspired to  nor could he have meant more and by so doing to add a trifle for the entertainment of the public and mr wilkinson had desired him to remit his grateful acknowledgments for the kind indulgence they had honored him with but very unfortunately what had only been humbly offered as harmless had been basely misconstrued into wickeess for mr garrick and himself mr foot had received remonstrances and cruel reflections from certain performers alleging that they suffered in their reputations and as reputations were not slender materials in consequence thereof mr garrick and himself from motives of generosity had yielded to such importunity and allegations and had cheerfully sacrificed that part of the entertainment as by so doing they added happiness and private peace to others however beneficial the continuance of it might have been to the theater and ardently hoped their conduct on the occasion was such as merited not only the pardon but the approbation of the audience and which should ever be their study to merit and obtain  this declamation instead of pacifying was treated with marks of anger and contempt and an universal cry for wilkinson  wilkinson  on which mr foot advanced once more and said as for his own peculiarities if they could afford the least entertainment mr wilkinson was at sull liberty to exercise his talents to their utmost extent and then added archly for the which i have reason to think the manager did not find himself in the least obliged he believed nay was assured mr wilkinson might as far as respected mr garrick without any restrictions take the same freedom the cry was for me immediately to appear and that without delay mr foot promised i should be instantly produced and took leave with a general plaudit for as mrs bellamy observes mr town and john bull would have their own way and not be in the least controlled it may easily be supposed mine was a perplexed state being in every point circumstanced very disagreeably and not a friend to speak to me on mr footes return to the greenroom he laid hold of my arm and said i must go on the stage that moment and what must i do when i am there says i o replied he any thing  what you like and treat them with as much of me as you please aye but says i what does mr garrick say for without his orders i cannot proceed hey  why now  hey says garrick why now as they insist i really do not see that i am bound to run the hazard of having a riot in my theater to please sparks and the rest of the covent garden people  and if they are not satisfied with your serving up mr foot as a dish  why it is a pity as i today observed but you could give me but that you say is not possible with any hopes of success  why now  haste  they are making a devilish noise and so as you have begun your d  d taking off  why go on with it and do what comes into your head and do not in future plague me with your cursed tricks again so sam foot popped the exotic on the stage there was no time to be lost as they feared bad consequences i was afraid to go on but n the stage i was actually pushed by mr garrick and mr foot and my hair did stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine the curtain was dropped and the branches also down on each side my fright was apparent but mr town soon cheered my spirits as there was not one dissenting voice in the whole audience i began and very freely with mr foot and then was for retiring but the cry was no no  go on go on and many said aloud damn it take them all off i took the hint and was encouraged at so furious a rate that i went through a long course of mimicry with great eclat having permission as i thought my distress of the morning all vanished and was exchanged for the most delightful feelin s in the evening being all elated and on a short reflection relying on garricks declaration as the words of truth when he had twice declared nothing could please him or mrs garrick more than a well executed likeness of himself as an actor but note good reader in this point i had not acted with honor but duplicity for whenever he had jokingly ask me what sort of a subject i uld make of him i always answered i never could form any resemblance whatever for his manner and tones were so natural and his voice so melodious that any imitation was impossible this he greedily swallowed and believed  charming flattery but in the close of my performance that remarkable night the audience were wonderfully surprised and tickled on beholding so unexpectedly a resemblance of the incomparable roscius which increased my spirits to such a degree that  as i had in blood stepped in so far  returning were as tedious as going over    i determined to give the audience a good meal and finding my first attack had made a favorable impression in their opinions i advanced without mercy cried havoc and produced mr garrick in three characters  lear  beloved regan thou will shake to hear what i shall uter  thou coudst never have thought it  thy sisters naught o regan she has tied ingratitude like a sharp tongued vulture here i scarce can speak to thee  this speech set me agoing prepared for what followed and caused great effect by my being lucky in the thought and the application i had two long plaudits for pronouncing a few words but those words were in garricks manner and required time they were from biron a part he had only first performed the year before the play being revived and altered to show mrs cibber to advantage and has of late seasons proved equally so to mrs siddons biron  i come to him  it is belford i suppose he little knows of what has happened here i wanted him must employ his friendship and then  oh oh oh etc etc    i was not contented on this burst of encouragement but spoke as garrick from hamlet  for o it cannot be  but i am pigeonliverd and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slaves offal  bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murdered prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab  a cullion  fie upon it  about my brain     and at the last line i made my finish and exit in his manner with loud acclamations and was all alive alive o but for me personally to reciter these peculiarities would give a much better idea than even the ablest pen can possibly describe  after this night all opposition or affront was dropped and the enraged performers were advised to let me die a natural death as the most prudent method for by opposite means they rendered wilkinson popular and by not taking umbrage he would sink into insignificance the farce was continued and gained additional force and mr foot as he reaped the profit was highly enraptured and said wilkinson was very clever he was the general receiving high and honorary rewards whilst in fact i was merely held in rank but as a poor subaltern at low pay for standing to be shot at in that farce mr packer acted carmine and from that year      has remained in a respectable light to the present date  certainly the space filled up while garrick was in want of materials both as to performers and plays by this farce was a severe infliction on me as the only advantage i derived from it was making myself in some degree popular and universally known to be the son of the late rev dr wilkinson who was obliged to seek refuge and relief from the public by going on the stage but i really was in similitude no better than a stone eater or like powell the fireeater for i was compelled and obliged to submit for receiving thirty shillings per week playhousepay to step each evening comparatively speaking over red hot irons but surely it was my purity that guided my frequent walks with such safety all the time not one guinea as a present or as a bribe from either mr garrick or mr foot nay from that whimsical night mr garrick was so hurt and offended with my representation of his likeness that almost during the remainder of the season he never deigned to let his eye grace me with its observance and of course not a single word to comfort me from his royal lips all conveyed whenever i met him austerity anger and dislike indeed he felt himself inwardly hurt with the liberty i had taken yet surely he had drawn himself into the predicament by what was very extraordinary to say and allege of him as fact his own bad acting for he certainly was beyond compare the most universal great actor the world ever produced on a stage or probably ever will i like a fool as i was because i looked upon mr garrick as a great performer put confidence in what he said and thought it was gospel but it needs no wonderful sense and but very little experience to teach how wrong laughable and absurd it is to believe all that great men will say not but there are phoenomena of nobleness and goodness who are contradictions to such an assertion as i can testify have experienced and may again i trust i shall know blessings and benevolence from the great and benevolent the world in general like a wild garden may be overrun with weeds brambles and brairs nevertheless here and there a fine nectarine or peach may be plucked or like a lottery abounding with blanks yet astonishing luck may surprise the unfortunate with a prize  after having been at that time near twelve months in regular practice on the stage it does not at this period read to my advantage to have proved myself such an egregious dupe and to have been so mere a novice to arts of greatness and the observance of the wide difference between what is pronounced by the lips and thought by the mind  foot by the practice of seeing me take him off every night as i kept within the bounds of decorum let it not a whit disturb his repose for as he obtained the golden fleece  why let the world laugh and be  and so far it became hi sole business and interest while that farce lasted but as to his good riendship for me though very pleasant at the time it only extended to  no longer pipe  no longer dance  mr garrick who felt aggrieved from what he had himself desired me to do and what i had acted by his request and permission blamed me as is natural in most cases rather than himself and not being my friend it served to increase his spleen and dislike another reason made him express his tenderness of disposition and soft sensations of his heart by way of condemning my performance and by that open disavowal waved all blame or severity from being levelled at him as on that occasion he not only publicly disapproved but declared his innocence as to any knowledge of what i had done for so far from his suspecting or being aware of it i had surprised him by a stolen march so his hands were clear and as to mr foot if any dirt was thrown at him he could wash it off with his tea and clean himself but above all he feared if he seemingly approved and all was quiet and i found myself of consequence by evidently drawing money to his royal exchequer i might not without reason touch him on his tenderest point the very master string that made most harmony or discord in him  that was money  his money his money his money  if i from such a poor pittance proved myself a pecuniary object to mr garrick had he sanctioned and applauded what he had thus disapproved and had i petitioned and offered to remonstrate for an addition to my salary or solicited for a handsome present for secret services he could not with any degree of propriety have refused therefore he wisely and politically guarded against such an attack and thereby effectually prevented an impertinent request at that time from me or any friend i might depute to hint or present a memorial with stated reasons for my advancement in his army as i had under general bayess command in three or four successive engagements distinguished myself in the field of battle where i had fought with great bravery when serving in his regiment of light horse and was twice or thrice discovered amongst the slain this or any such manifesto would have proved fruitless and abortive for besides taking away his life his soul his dear old gold as he had yielded or in well acted appearance seemed to have yielded to the stings of his tender conscience by which it was conceived and even actually believed in opposition and against their senses that his goodness was superior to his selfinterest this afforded him two secret pleasures  raising his humanity at my expense and after all contriving to have it called for and continued as if against his inclination this was a master piece of a head finely interwoven with wheels within wheels and far superior to any mechanism his carpenters could boast of  and of their skill he had thus declaimed   what eager transport stares from every eye  when pullies rattle and our genii fry  when tin cascades like falling waters gleam  or through the canvas bursts the real stream  while thirsty islington laments in vain  half her new river rolled to drury lane and a third reason was though last not of the least pleasing result as by this train of my alleged offenses i was secluded and kept at a proper disance so as to prevent any approach to the throne therefore my harvest did not promise to be a golden one being forbid my appearance at court this farce continued going on with quietness and success till near christmas during that time i was in a perpetual round of engagements and invitations either with my own friends or on parties with mr foot at many of the fashionable tables such as mr calcrafts lady vanes sir francis delavals and mixed with the first set of gentlemen at the principal hotels and taverns in london one day i was led into an error from vanity but certainly not to my credit however as a faithful historian i will not hide the circumstance  as the glass and good humor went round and each seemed on a level i from intimacy and and really a liking to all my friend shuter did used frequently for half an hour together to introduce myself into company as mr shuter and being with him perpetually on his sober as well as his indiscreet frolics it actually only seemed to those acquainted with his mode and manner as another shuter as his stageacting or his private oddities were become equally easy to be assumed by me this caused so much laugh applause and flattery which is much more fascinating than a jackalanthorn and easily gains followers that i was persuaded to exhibit a likeness of shuter on the stage foot desired colonel thornton and several others to importune me urging what was really true that as a genius of comedy he could not receive any injury by the force of imitation that as a man of humor he would even himself be enterid with it and it was impossible for him on su a trivial occasin to be seriously angry as he hd more sense etc all these arguments working on my eagerness for fame seduced me but not without some pangs as i really and truly in the full sense of the word regarded shuter and admired his faults full equally with his best qualities for we had heard the chimes at midnight not any person now existing remembers this circumstance so well as mr austin he and i were very intimate and he was one of the very few belonging to the theater who wished me well and when i informed him of colonel thornton and footes request said why tate you are a great rogue but you may as well take off shuter as not it will only be a shyness for a few days and then you will shake hands and all will be well again and that evening with my waggish friends advice who loved a little mischief and which accorded with my own inclination it was concluded and the next night carried into execution  i want now though all is over and i am truly grieved to say shuter is dead and buried to lay the blame on the persuasive joseph and the odd bottle that made us both much wiser than when we yawned over the first it awkwardly happened the next day after this consultation that i met shuter at dinner and knowing my evil intentions i felt like most people who are conscious integrity is not the strict rule of their condut for though not a criminal or a serious matter it certainly wanted a palliation but i did not know how to act  shuter had stuck by me from m very first distress  shuter had stood buff for me against a host of foes  and i knew not any able lawyer who could undertake my brief and that brief weighed with such reasons who could st ictly acquit me even to myself if i had asked him seriously he certainly would have given a negative and still let suspicion of his friend hanker on his mind in future and on his refusal i could not think of doing it therefore i determined like a young couple for scotland who marry first and ask pardon afterward i cannot defend this conduct to shuter to this moment though i can boast if that can be taken as an excuse that i received great encouragement for the same but it deadened all shuters intimacy and mine yet like parthenope you will find with a little patience it was not dead neither i entered on the comictragical business i had promised on the very evening i had purposed the amazingly strong likeness of so popular a stage character when i appeared in walk gait voice and features in mruthen the london cries etc was by the galleries instantaneously recognized for their darling friend ned shuter and instead of anger they received it with such joy that when it was over i flattered myself shuter would be as pleased as myself but instead of that  no no it was quite the contrary i called it a joke shuter did not or if he would those about him were so little prone to goodnature that they would not suffer any vegetation of that kind to grow or rest in his mind but plucked it up by the roots applause i received it is very true but by all shuters friends and acquaintance which were very numerous i was shunned and looked upon as treacherous i think i had some perpetual fatality in those as well as the present days which quickly clouded my sunshine by heavy showers of perplexity  this trifling imitation of mine though very like was truly nonsensical and by no means injurious yet it was so blazoned by all the performers of both houses that i was represented in the blackest colors as incapable of friendship sensibility or gratitude this gave me many a twinge but the want of his company at that time was a svere punishment indeed as not being with him two or three evenings if practicable in the week required in my young opinion engagements of a superior kind to make amends for so great a loss as the society of my friend edward shuter my only compensation was the applause i received on my continued imitation which i thought a very good joke to keep up my spirits added to my kind reception at the theater all my own particular friends in private life were staunch and good and i had the pleasure of seeing the best of mothers perfectly happy and every reasonable want at command many of my mothers and late fathers acquaintance were as may be supposed in the vale of years and not of the frisky cast at that time i frequently dined at the thatched house in pall mall with colonel thornton of the blues and being so well received at drury lane theater secured those favors  for all in all depends upon success and every day stamps that remark  also with young captain st ledger the late general st ledger of whom i have spoken before  about the early time of my acquaintance with general st ledger mr flood colonel boden captain hussy and many others were frequently on snug chit chat parties sometimes for dinners at other times after the play and indeed these agreeable and reputable engagements made me great amends for the almost total neglect of sceni acquaintance mr austin being then my single intimate theatrical flower and the only one i could select out of the whole collected bunch of both the royal playhouse nosegays and with him that intimacy has continued  at that time during the run of footes farce i actually had received genteel presents not to be too free as an imitator mr ridout before my unlucky misunderstanding with shuter had very frequently desired the favor of both our companies to sup with him at the shakspeare at which meeting he informed me that he was unhappy at the apprehension of my marking his manner of playing before the london audience as he was well informed i had the capability of putting such an act into force for our mutual friend shuter had in his laughing manner told him the same but it had more forcibly alarmed him as mr macklin had declared at the bedford that mr wilkinson had proved more genius in his manner of personating that nonentity ridout than all his other forces collected and not many years are elapsed since i have from mr macklin himself heard the same expression repeated mr ridout continued to urge he was not an object of sufficient consequence to cause any addition to my reputation therefore unless i could allege a contradictory reason to that assertion he desired shuters interest might intervene and prevent my putting any such experiment into practice and said if he found i let him lie undisturbed and sleep in quiet he on his word of honor would not only think himself much indebted to me but in the utmost punctilio prove to me that he was not only an obliged friend but a grateful one shuter solicited and the bond of amity was settled to the satisfaction of the trio and i must in justice add mr ridout ever behaved to me like a gentleman and when past all worldly cares and solicitude proved himself the man of his word and honor as will hereafter appear  this whimsical jumble of mr footes went on till near christmas when his benefit was appointed the merchant of venice shylock for the first time mr foot portia mrs clive   to which was advertised for the first time that season the farce of the author which was wrote purposely for my assistance on that night the character was entitled and called mrs oshocknesy all was ready rehearsed and perfectly repared for our royal exhibition  when o dreadful to relate or as mrs inchbalds epilogue to such things are expresses it down came an order to suspend the ball  in plain english a peremptory mandate from the lord chamberlain to inform mr garrick that mr aprice a gentleman of family and fortune had made personal application to him as highly aggrieved and had urged that at the united voice of all his connections he desired the farce of the author might be expunged from the list of theatrical pieces they having all concurred in one general opinon that the character of mr cadwallader was purposely written and drawn out by the writer to render ridiculous mr aprice his manner and his peculiar oddities which made him a topic for public laughter and satirical joke and mummery  himself and wife could not go along the streets without being insulted with my dear becky and here comes dicky etc  which allegations were strictly true in short he urged that they were become common objects for laughter and affront by mr footes audacious freedom and though he honestly confessed he had with his wife dolly seen the farce yet they could not find a similitude but his family felt injured as well as all their friends who insisted on a curb being laid on mr footes licentiousness and the only proper and immediate removal of grievance rested on the sense feelings justice and honor of the lord chamberlain for instant redress his lordship on very little consideration favored the remonstrance and gave his verdict against mr foot being at the very crisis and not put in force till the day of performance all appeal all interest to counterbalance was in vain he would hear no petitions that day was the final will and pleasure and my poor mrs oshocknesys apparel may in consequence be mouldering for what i know on the shelves of the wardrobe at drury lane but i hope not for the honor of her family as the wardrobe was in hands that knew how to turn the penny and not let any thing be useless that by wise contrivance could be made to produce something and sure to do so if ever so little this sudden and fatal decree was irrevocable and mr foot as the command came so unexpectedly even while i was actually rehearsing the new scene was thrown into a consternation and panic not to be described those who are inured to misfortunes bear shocks of terror and disappointment with more firmness of mind than those whom affluence and favor have courted as use reconciles hardships and indeed is comprehended by what every old man and woman can say that one half of the world do not know how the other half live  mr foot appeared shocked pale and dejected for in the author he had depended on honors flowing thick upon him which this hasty killing frost not only nipped but cut the root so as to prevent its being for that year a tree bearing fruit nay even mrs clive was melted who hated him and had said but an hour before you play shylock mr foot how the devil should you know how to act shylock who never could play a character well in your life why not madam replied foot how can you tell i cannot act shylock till you have seen me why replied clive with a womanlike reason because i am certain you dont know how to speak a line of it and all was by the angry lady as easily pronounced as if it had been said to her cookwench by the bye though she was a comic actress beyond compare when in her proper line as mrs heidleburgh widow blackacre etc yet her portia was as truly bad as her own imagination however contemptible it might be formed mr footes shylock would be but this tender catherine and there she was clever almost sobbed for her dear foot when the author was prohibited and his lordship who sent the decree did not escape her deprecations but the secret lay here becky i mean mrs cadwallader her part in the farce being stopped was as great a disappointment to her as an actress as the author being silenced was to mr foot he felt like shylock which he had been rehearsing and regretted the money this stoppage would lose him three thousand ducats in that besides other precious jewels the incomparable clive outwardly grieved for foot and acted it very well though tragedy was not her forte but was inwardly assisted by her anger and all her tenderness being really moved for the loss of her dear mrs cadwallader and certainly very few such instances of great acting ever was or will be produced in competition with her performance of that character she there as cibber says in his preface outdid her usual outdoings she was the terror of poets managers actors actresses and musicians  o rare kate clive  there was no resource left but to change the farce stick up fresh bills explain the unavoidable necessity for so doing and request the usual indulgence  as to what farce  the stale diversions of the morning was the only substitute these precautions taken mr foot went home to dinner as sheepish and with as little appetite as i had done some weeks before on my general lecture day and i dare answer for him with as little relish for those who are blessed with superabundant spirits when once they are sunk are quite chopfallen  i retired with a mediocrity of temper on this occasion like an easy gentleman though really sorry for mr foot i was also sorry for the loss of my irish lady whom i had just taken into keeping but as my wants were not pinched this little fracas did not depress me the audiences in london generally have great consideration and though disappointed and vexed at not seeing this long promised favorite farce of the author with the new scene were convinced that mr foot should rather claim their pity and encouragement than their condemnation as he lost not only by his house being in some degree prejudiced that night by the peremptory order of high office but also his profits from the managers for eight or ten nights which alluring prospects were rendered impracticable great expectations being daily increased by mr footes repeated puffs in the public papers not omitting the humor and excellence to be expected from wilkinsons new character of mrs oshocknesy the substitution of the diversions of the morning was received rather like a new favorite than a repeated old piece which is generally the case in london whenever the chapter of accidents causes disappointments and every one is thoroughly convinced whatever has happened wrong is not in consequence of neglect or design nothing will stronger possess minds in general or warp them to obstinate ill nature so certainly as an idea of falsehood art or the being entrapped by the sinister theatrical views behind the curtain  good fortune had whirled her wheel so pleasantly take her for all in all till christmas      that my universal acquaintance made me quite an indifferent spectator and ideas of being a great man which had so often been crushed and lain dormant began to rear again not without strong hopes of honors accompanied i assured myself that halcyon days would some time come nay to place my hopes on infallible grounds a gipsey at norwood near dulwich fortold wonders and every wonder to suit my prophetic fancy she affirmed and i with a faith as strong as a sensible methodist believed all  mr foot be it understood had not acted at the haymarket with or without permission of the lord chamberlain from the time of his memorable giving tea nor from the year      at covent garden he had not acted at either theater till one night in the spring for miss macklins benefit tuesday april         her play was the orphan she acted monimia mr foot acted buck but his name for what reason i cannot guess was not inserted in the bills the first acting of the englishman in paris was as follows theater royal covent garden  benefit of mr macklin  the part of calista to be performed lothario mr dyer sciolto mr macklin altamont mr ridout lavinia mrs elmy and the part of horatio to be performed to which will be added a new comedy of two acts called  with an occasional prologue between  and an epilogue by miss macklin  all written by mr foot  nothing under the full price will be taken during the performance    miss macklin had only acted jane shore twice and lady townly once the first night of miss macklins jane shore it was then a common observation and by a few remembered to this hour that mrs cibber was that night really inspired with something more than mortal she felt the god and though her alicia had always been looked upon as one of her very best characters yet that nights performance she never equalled before or since as the world is not over good natured the cause was attributed to some offense at the rehearsal she conceived mr macklin to have given her therefore she determined in revenge to hurt miss macklin by her superiority and cast all possibility of competitorship at a distance i do not relate this as a fact only from madam hearsay but think there must have been something extraordinary in mrs cibbers acting that night to have occasioned so many different reports  mr foot presented mr macklin with his spick span new farce of the englishman in paris for his benefit the character of lucinda was drawn on purpose to introduce miss macklin to advantage and prove to the town that mr macklin had not spared any expense to render the education and accomplishments of his daughter worthy the notice of the public her dancing and music master were purposely introduced to prove her various excellencies mr macklin acted buck  in april it was buzzed that mr foot himself was to act buck for miss macklins benefit which i believe he did on tuesday the   th of april with a new prologue but mr foot was not seen and advertised as an actor from the spring      till at drury lane in october and november      five years when garrick wrote the prologue  a part of which i have inserted before relative to a circumstance already mentioned and here give the remainder  among the matters that occasion prate even i sometimes am matter for debate whenever my faults or follies are the question each draws his wit out and begins dissection sir peter primrose smirking over his tea sinks from himself and politics to me papers boy  here sir i am what news today foot sir is advertised  what  run away no sir he acts this week at drury lane how is that cries feeble grub foot come again i thought that fool had done his devils dance was he not hanged some months ago in france up starts machoe and thus the room harangud it is true his friends gave out that he was hanged but to be sure twas all a hum becase i have seen him since and after such disgrace no gentleman would dare to show his face to him replied a sneering bonny scot you rasin reet my frynd haungd he was not but neither you nor i caun tell how soon he will gaung to pot thus each as fancy drives his wit displays such is the tax each son of folly pays on this my scheme they many names bestow it is fame it is pride nay worse  the pockets low i own i have pride ambition vanity and what is more strange perhaps you will see though not so great a portion of it  modesty for you i will curb each selfsufficient thought and kiss the rod whenever you point a fault many my passions are though one my view they all concentre in the pleasing you   i must here note that mr footes first imitations of the actors was only on his first appearing on the haymarket stage  after that flourish he had a very genteel fortune left him in      and his gaiety of disposition and thoughtlessness was such as to suppose the stage was not worthy of attention and he did not imagine it was ever more to be his destined lot till that fortune by being expended obliged him from craving necessity to bethink himself and return  mr foot was descended from a family of distinction in devonshire a sir john goodeere but as i have not knowledge of heraldry and know not all the particulars will only mention that was the name of the respectable family to whom he by right claimed relationship he was introduced in every respect into the world with a fortune which his volatility soon expended and was universally known and received as a gentleman in every party where he was espoused caressed and connected he soon proved himself a spendthrift and was truly in character as the englishman returned from paris  in this year september      miss macklin was regularly engaged as an actress at drury lane and mr macklin took his farewell of the public in the following epilogue as a veteran actor thirtyseven years since dec      mr macklins farewell epilogue poor i tossed up and down from shore to shore sick wet and weary will to sea no more yet it is some comfort though i quit the trade that this last voyage with success is made the ship full laden and the freight all paid since then for reasons i the stage give over and for your sakes  write tragedies no more some other schemes of course possess my brain for he who once has eat  must eat again and lest this lank this melancholy phiz should grow more lank more dismal than it is a scheme i have in hand will make you stare though off the stage i still must be the playr still must i follow the theatric plan exert my comic powers draw all i can and to each guest appear a different man i like my liquors must each palate hit rake with the wild be sober with the cit nay sometimes act my least becoming part  the wit with politicians i must nod  seem full  and act my best becoming part  the dull my plan is this  mans formed a social creature requiring converse by the laws of nature and as the moon can raise the swelling flood or as the mind is influenced by the blood so  do i make myself well understood i am puzzled faith  let us like bays agree it you will know my plot much better when you see it but truce with jesting let me now impart the warm oerflowings of a grateful heart come good come bad while life or memory last my mind shall treasure up your favors past and might one added boon increase the store with much less sorrow should i quit this shore to mine as you have been to me prove kind protect the pledge my fondness leaves behind to you her guardians i resign my care let her with others your indulgence share whatever my fate if this my wish prevails twill glad the father though the schemist fails   mr macklin performed that very night in the refusal or the ladies philosophy sir gilbert wrangle lady wrangle mrs macklin and charlotte miss macklin the entertainment was the englishman in paris  in a few years he returned to the stage his tavern and coffeeroom having embarrassed not made his fortune and this very mr macklin in february      performed at covent garden theater shylock and sir archy msarcasm on one and the same night aged ninety also in the same year sir pertinax msycophant in the man of the world which part is not less according to our theatrical lingo than thirtysix lengths  each length should be fortyfour lines including the cues i am more induced to introduce this remarkable circumstance here as it is in some degree affinitive to my narration relative to mr foot and myself and marks in time and place mr macklin as the wonder of our theatrical hemisphere whom we now find again on the boards thirtyseven years after he had taken his farewell of the stage  that excellent performer and undoubted good stage preceptor of unbounded credit for the honor and reputation of the fraternity has shown and proved in a full court of justice and asserted the proper rights and privileges of an actor as an englishman and has not only relieved the oppressed performers mind when overpowered by injustice and calumny but made himself rise not only in a distinguished light as an asserter of natural liberty but elevated him in a much superior degree when possessed of retribution for wrongs and associated villainy combined against him and proved to mankind that he never forgot his master shakspeare who says that man shows likest god when mercy seasons justice for though his damages granted were great and would have nearly ruined his oppressors yet he was content with victory and like a true conqueror established his rights by an act of clemency and freely forgave all claim to the spoils he had been allowed  least it should not be known to what i allude i refer to mr macklins trial of a combined riot to prevent his ever playing again mr macklin pleaded as his own counsel and lord mansfield declared on the bench that mr macklin though an excellent player had never acted his part so well as on that day  therefore let every performer reverence him and his name and may he ever be in their flowing cups remembered and not forget at the same time that this honor to the profession took his leave of the public as mentioned but returned in a few years wrote love alamode man of the world etc pieces of sterling worth and was this year      acting in play and farce  sure he has labored hard in the vineyard and pray god he may descend peacefully and happily to his grave if any players are blessed with being holy spirits sure they will all hail his relief from this temporary abode of toil and sorrow  mr footes benefit though he was disappointed of his farce of the author was it is true very beneficial but his career was stopped and our diversions of the morning though it had afforded good dinners suppers etc for several weeks would not any longer produce even tea for breakfast particularly on a sharing plan as like most things in this world it had had its day and foot could only reflect on his own lines in that very farce where crambo repeats  o what a lord mayors feast of joy art thou thy face is venison and thy neck white veal and all thy other parts are beef and pudding  for says foot as mr puzzle a poet should always make comparisons on those things he likes best so mr foot the poet had by the approach of january with perfect ease squandered away all the profits which arose from our diversions and as easily the massy sum of his benefit night so all the extravagant rarities which he had enjoyed in november and december were in a comparative view to be devoured by a real good stomach by imagination with fancied delicacies like his own poet mr crambo and mr foot therefore in earnest felt the january blasts which cut him through and through  a single joint of mutton was his fare of which i often partook and he generally had one or two to dine with him but humble port and lisbon were the only wines at dinner  no claret or madeira for the credit had wained with the pocket  he never could work till his genius was put to its wits end poets are generally mentioned as poor and too frequently are so but i guess they have one particular advantage which other people when the shoe pinches do not enjoy for like the bear that when in want of food finds sustenance from sucking his paws  so the poet when in want of luxuries feeds on his own thoughts which luckily are never so bright or come to his aid with equal swiftness of thought and fiery flights of fancy as when destitute of the good things of this world he then needs not mr bayess recipe of stewed prunes or to physic and let blood to purge the belly i must allow myself at that time much obliged to his good breeding as he ever seemed glad to see me at his table and seemed to study to make that table agreeable and indeed he never showed himself to more advantage than when making his guests welcome as he seemed the generous hospitable cheerful and sincere friend of every person who partook of his fare which was always of the best whenever the best could with convenience be procured  he was soon after his benefit in such a state of poverty that all parties at the thatched house bedford arms etc were obliged to be given up he appeared vexed whenever i was indispensably engaged unless indeed he could get much better company such as mr murphy or mr macklin but they were not always to be had nor were they ever hand and glove for whenever macklin and he had a tiff though i believe mr foot might be the aggressor yet mr macklin on such broileries would treat him not only very cavalierly but very roughly  at the time my company was so welcome many happy laughing evenings have i had in jamesstreet with himself messrs murphy and macklin often as the circling glass went round and warmed my vain heart mr murphy and mr macklin would communicate their intentions of proceeding on a play or farce or some lucky thought foot got all the information he could and like mr bays pop he clapped it down and made it his own  mr murphy had particularly tried how far mr foot was worthy to be trusted for in      when mr footes englishman in paris was acted he approved of it so much that like sir john vanbrugh who relished cibbers loves last shift and his good acting of sir novelty fashion in complement to cibbers merit both as author and actor he wrote the relapse or virtue in danger as a sequel to loves last shift and created sir novelty fashion a peer of the realm under the title of lord foppington  so mr murphy pleased with the englishman in paris paid the same compliment to his intimate friend mr foot and set about writing a sequel to his piece  mr murphy made his first appearance as an actor at covent garden theater on friday the   th of october      in the character of othello  went over to drury lane in september      and on saturday september  0 played osmyn in the mourning bride  produced his new farce of the apprentice on friday january        he had in the summer of      finished his farce called the englishman returned from paris being a sequel to mr footes englishman in paris of which he having informed mr foot it caused his genius immediately to set to work and finish a farce in two acts on the same plan and with which he suddenly surprised mr murphy while his farce of the apprentice was acting with much good fortune at its heels at drury lane by having a new farce in two acts called the englishman returned from paris in rehearsal at covent garden and he had it acted for the first time on tuesday february        mr murphy was much chagrined and justly offended with mr footes duplicity on this occasion the reception mr footes piece obtained at covent garden was such as to preclude mr murphy from all thoughts of gain by an offer of his farce at drury lane not only by its success at the opposite theater but by mr footes being a thorough judge of the subject from his frequent trips to paris mr murphy therefore contented himself with bringing out his englishman returned from paris at his benefit with an occasional prologue on saturday april the  d which mr murphy spoke himself and in some humorous lines was very severe on his friend samuel but sam had got the money and it disturbed him not in the farce as well as i can recollect from so long a date and my seeing it once the only time it was ever acted i remember some doubt was made as to the identity of sir charles buck from paris as he had been announced to the public and introduced for a considerable time o yes replied sir charles you have had an impostor in town who with much easy familiarity and assurance has stolen my writings etc and not only robbed me but has also impudently dared to assume my name but i am the true sir charles buck this occasioned a great roar the only one i remember to have heard during the farce unless to mrs clive  as january      had pinched so february instead of being more calm and quiet made the air of covent garden far from being softened for it nipt the wit with increasing severity foot therefore as a resource wrote to the manager at edinburgh  callender as near as i can remember was the name of that commander the theater at that time in scotland was only a smuggling vessel but now it is enlarged and dubbed a royal man of war mr callender wrote mr foot word that himself and his company would be proud of his assistance for a few nights and assured him it was a compliment  at that time birds of passage from london to scotland were experiments unknown  for it was judged impossible for a london theatrical sunflower to survive the chillness of such a barbarous northern clime but opinions and experience which make fools wise have proved it to be not only a happy asylum but as fine a hothouse for the preservation and as good a nursery for rare and delicate theatrical plants as ever those of drury lane and covent garden could at any time produce in spite of the advantages that covent garden possesses and is undoubtedly a wellsupplied market for all our wants and wishes  foot at edinburgh to use mruthens words was quite a phenomenon  every one in london stared at his strange disposition to adventure from the metropolis of england a journey of four hundred miles to edinburgh and wondered that an actor of eminence should venture to a place where at that time a sixty pounds benefit was a treasure but that is no more surprising at this juncture than to mention that the facetious captain farquhar only eighty years ago at dublin had  00l which was then thought to be an enormous sum  and my different accounts only verify the same degree of increase of receipts at dublin but then the public when they recollect how well performers lived thirty years ago on less incomes than they now have are too apt to forget the difference there now is in the price of lodgings coals candles meat and drink and in short in every article of life as well as the very expensive ornaments for the stage with the very material article of hairdressing  edinburgh where mr foot first pointed out the road for londoners to make excursions to has made the most rapid strides in arts elegance and luxury of any place in the three kingdoms  dublin though wonderfully improved was thirtytwo years ago a noble populous and extensive city  edinburgh was not but it now really is and for my own part common honesty and honor compels me to remember i have often gone thither and often returned and never had to recross the tweed again for scotland but my heart felt a secret pleasure at the thought of visiting once more those whose attachments had been lasting and not vanished like the vapors of a day  mr footes trip to the north answered much better than was expected the stage at that time being a place of resort in edinburgh only for such independent persons as dared to judge for themselves and venture into that seat of profanation  it was but in the year      the rev mr home was so dissolute as to bring out his tragedy of douglas in the edinburgh old theater in the canongate for which heinous offense the elders of the kirk doomed him to banishment and excommunication for writing and bringing on a public stage a piece to be exhibited by play actors in satans tabernacle this bigotry has worn off and as extremes are often the subsequent consequence i believe edinburgh may vie with its neighbors in having many persons not too much troubled with attending those duties of religion for which that city once boasted in a violent degree of enthusiasm  foot when he received callenders invitation talked as familiarly of setting off as if he had been only going to drury lane theater where the boxes were open to him but on his preparation for his scotch journey when his hand went into his pocket it soon reminded him there wanted the needful both for going abroad or staying at home  well says he this scotch experiment must be tried but where is the means damn it i must solicit that hound garrick  he immediately did and garrick lent him  00l but then he lent it like mr garrick for though he chose to grant the favor to mr foot yet he could not omit his love of parade on the occasion for when he said yes he did not do it generously and genteely for fear the world should not know it but told mr foot he would see pritchard at noon and he mr foot might draw on him in the evening for the sum and leave his note of acknowledgment for the same foot did not relish the humiliating situation to appear before the playhouse treasurer as if requesting a boon from his master nor could he ask any gentleman of his acquaintance to transact the business for him as thereby he must betray his poverty he did not approve of sending his servant and as each of these modes seemed to lessen his consequence he at last determined to apply to me  with my dear wilkinson and do my good friend let me employ you on this difficult matter to which i readily agreed  took his note to drury lane treasuryoffice which after due examination passed current for i received the cash and soon returned with it to mr foot which gave him such spirits that all his cares were over and it seemed a moot point with him whether he should continue in london and spend the money or undertake the journey in search of more but for a wonder prudence once prevailed and the chair was ordered to be ready in the morning and he accordingly set off for canny edinburgh on the evening he received the cash he not only feasted with mr garricks money but by way of returning thanks told more ludicrous stories of him than at any other time i ever recollect he ridiculed him much as a poet and said davids verses were so bad and garrick so fond of writing that if he died first he dreaded the thoughts of his composing his epitaph this satire was whimsical and highly diverting but certainly ot doing garrick justice as the public and the stage are indebted to him for several pieces f great merit and if he has not left sufficient fame to stand as one of the first of the  pets et he is above mediocrity and is surely to be placed far superior to the worst but wits must be forgiven for such little sallies  when mr foot was gone i passed the remainder of the winter very happily with my friends who abstracted from the theater were increased and increasing and i wished them not to be diminished my lady mother thank god by my means was to the full as happy and as well accommodated as myself  from the time of mr footes benefit and his departure from london i never had any intercourse with king david but i have omitted to mention that on the evening of mr footes laving his lodgings in jamessstreet and on my wishing him a profitable pleasant and safe journey i requested the favor of his performance on my benefit night which could not according to my rank of salary happen till after his return from scotland which i supposed would be in about six weeks i thought i was not only entitled but had a right by my services to him both in london and dublin to expect my requested favor would be granted as soon as asked and indeed i wondered he had not prevented my asking him by first offering me such a compliment which in truth he assured me was his intention and his wish and complied with it as a pleasure to himself if he could by such a trifling tuble be of the least service to me for whom he had such a real and respectful regard and added to it that he promised me all his interest for my boxes which declaration sent me home perfectly easy and happy and here for a time the matter rested as i was entirely assured and satisfied with what he had professed but i was yet to learn  that words are but wind  ships are but boards  and men are but men  soon after mr footes departure i was engaged on a party one evening at the bedfordhead tavern southamptonstreet which consisted of colonel thornton colonel boden a captain s  in the seaservice myself and others after the hour of two the company thinned by degrees till only colonel thornton and myself remained when in about ten minutes a waiter entered precipitately and said mr wilkinson was wanted on urgent business i could not conceive what matter of moment could require my attendance at so late an hour but instantly obeyed the summons and was introduced into a parlour where i found captain s  surrounded by waiters and the host after a motion to enjoin strict silence and requesting above all things that col thornton should not know of the circumstance capt s  informed me the doors were surrounded by bailiffs who had a writ against him and he therefore earnestly desired i would exchange my clothes for his uniform  a chair should be called the curtains drawn and the waiters to order loudly the chairmen in the passage to carry the gentleman as quick as possible to the george inn drury lane i agreed ran up stairs took leave of the colonel and informed him a singular circumstance had occurred which i was bound in honor not to reveal and i kept to my word returned to captain s  and equipped myself in an officer like manner and was as if by stealth and secrecy conveyed in the sedan with much speed till the men set down their burden at the george inn i then let down the window and bid the chairman ring the bell on his performing that office a large fisted bailiff quickly supplied his place and proclaimed me his prisoner assurances that he was wrong were in vain for he persisted in his assertion till i actually told him the matter of fact knowing captain s  had made good use of his time and safely escaped the bailiff swore like thunder i coolly told him if he was not perfectly satisfied with the justifiable mode i had taken to serve a friend  if he wanted more information he must follow the chair to my lodgings in halfmoonstreet to which residence i ordered the chairmen to proceed immediately the bailiffs did not choose to follow but went in fruitless search of their prey and i retired to rest well pleased with the event in consequence of this capt s  the night before a stranger continued an intimacy and friendship with me for some years  march soon made its yearly visit and on the approach of april it hinted to me it was high time to make the necessary appearance before my master garrick and humbly to inquire with all submissive duty and awful respect when my benefit was to be fixed a matter that yearly makes wonderful uneasiness in many male and female breasts on their annual expectations as the event of benefit causes the passions alternately of hope fear envy joy distress exultation despondency etc etc to take place and raise whirlwind in their brain my article this year to a certainty gave me the power and right to ask such a question but mr garrick as usual answered why now that is why  hey cross and be d  d to you  hey why now that is  and i really do not see how that you young wilkinson can be able that is to say or for you to preume to pay the expenses of a benefit  it now really is and so des mrs garrick think an enormous expense and i do not see  but indeed with a partner i will consent to it  but not otherwise on any account  however my former fars like mrs cowleys first feelings were gone long ago and i like an audacious rebel persisted in my right of article to such claim and said i would abide by the test of that article and if he persevered in a refusal i would get the crown and anchor or some other large public room and try to make a benefit for myself he said he was truly astonished at my behavior it was so strange so rude  but really if i would continue in error why he did not see etc  and at last with as many delays as is too often experienced by dependence upon independence he with affected regard and pity and a threat of consequences from his future anger consented to fix  but it was not to be till monday may the   th       i took othello othello by mr wilkinson at the same time assuring him that mr foot would play for me as to mr footes acting for me i really thought it a duty as well as a debt of honor  mr foot came to town in a few days and in my bills and advertisements were published both play and farce but luckily as it proved i had not inserted mr footes name i called to see him and had reason to believe he was denied i called a second time and was then admitted i congratulated him on his return and informed him of my reliance on his fulfilling his promise by performing for my benefit which was to be on the   th of may and on that full dependence i had advertised the diversions of the morning and had the pleasure to inform him my boxes were all taken foot after coughing and taking a quantity of snuff and plucking his chin with tweezers a constant habit of his in private life at length coolly replied that as a young man e wished me success in the world but was hurt to observe the publishing his farce was an unwarrantable freedom his health was very indifferent and would not permit his assisting me at my benefit the infinite services and favors he had conferred on me by introducing me to the public notice of the london and dublin audiences were a full or more than an equal compensation for such trifling immaterial assistance as i had given him or that my vanity might have supposed to have added to the success of his piece by performing in it then again added he was not well and besides he had letters of consequence to despatch and no time to trifle away therefore must wish me a goodmorning i was truly astonished as may be easily supposed at such an unexpected mean despicable behavior it was ingratitude in every sense of the word  the reader will recollect what a winter of confusion and turbulence i had undergone  the money i had certainly drawn by the sweat of my brow he had feasted on my labor and had lived in clover while i was merely buffetted from pillar to post i desired he would not by any means neglect his health or his letters of consequence for that i not only took my leave of him for that day but was determined never more to trouble him with a second visit however to try him further i said as the farce was advertised my loss would be irreparable if not performed and hoped he would not add additional cruelty by inflicting a punishment unmerited by the refusal of the copy of his farce he sternly replied indeed he should he had a reputation to lose and would not hazard the representation of any piece of his not printed to be mutilated spoiled and condemned by my ignorant bungling here the visit ended and i left him most truly with an honest contempt and said to him when at the door farewell mr foot and determined never more to renew our acquaintance  in this dilemma some management was necessary how to cook up my billoffare as the   th of may required strength to make the night fashionable my best and only resource seemed to be the waiting on mr garrick and entreating the favor of his hearing the relation of my wrongs as i could not think of any expedient for relief unless he would for once advise and assist me this intention i put into instant practice and mr garrick received my tale of illtreatment with more attention and good nature than i could possibly have expected from our long distance and quarrels in fact he inwardly rejoiced at the destroying my connection with foot as he thought that together we were two mischievous devils and capable of giving him great uneasiness he stepped forward and said well tate o thought i if it is well tate all will be right you will now be convinced of your error in offending me and you will learn in future i hope to distinguish between your real riends and your professional ones i thanked him and urged my wish for the continuance of the farce and which i had long in secret secured it was correctly wrote out for me by mr brownsmith under prompter to mr cross of that theater why now says garrick that is if you have a true copy why but what would you do with it for want of footes characters being supplied o says i do not fear that sir for i mean to do them myself and in those characters i will make such an example of good mr foot by fair imitation as shall cause him to remember giving tea as long as he lives  garricks eyes sparkled with pleasure and betrayed a satisfaction he wished to conceal he inwardly hated foot and not altogether without reason he wished to frown but with all his ingenuity and cunning he was not an actor equal to the task for he could not hold back any longer his consent and said he was really unhappy at the ill usage i had received from that foot foot owed me a recompense for my great services but if i had lost a false friend i should find in him a true one but he must observe that he expected i would not make a bad use of his kindness but plant my mimicry against foot alone as he was a proper object and he wished every success to my benefit and performance nay he was so generous that he insisted on a bottle of wine being brought and after the second glass he asked me if i would drink any more but carefully at the same time put the cork into the bottle no more sir nay he was so generous on that occasion as to give me a neat new edition of othello worth one shilling and sixpence which i have to this day preserved and have piously transmitted it to my son when parting with him he assured me that he was so much hurt at the illtreatment i had received from foot that he never would make any future agreement with him which though merely words to please me on our reconciliation were prophetic as from that season it was not until the minor happened to succeed two years after that mr foot acted by engagement with mr garrick a long time when we consider garrick had spoken  as heroes states and kingdoms rise and fall so  with the mighty to compare the small  through interest whim or if you please through fate we feel commotions in our mimic state the sock and buskin fly from stage to stage a years alliance is with us  an age and where is the wonder all surprise must cease when we reflect how interest or caprice make real kings break articles of peace   i promised him not to introduce any mimicry that might tend to the least likeness whatever of the performers of either theater and reflection and a little experience soon convinced me it was necessary to act with every caution and to sacrifice a little applause to the prospect of hereafter obtaining substantial prosperity  the wishedfor night arrived a splendid and a crowded house  lady granard lady tyrawly sir francis delaval the duke of portland the captains divess the hanways mrs jones skeleton etc etc had secured all my boxes my acquaintance with such particular interest aided by public curiosity a full theater cannot be a matter of great surprise to relate  othello being the first character i had attempted in london alarmed me much particularly as the name of my mimicry had lessened all hopes of my being an actor in proportion as that reputation arose for every idea had been well circulated with indefatigable pains by the several families of the sneers the blandishes and the candours in the collaring scene in act the third i not only received repeated plaudits but even a huzza  yet what was really extraordinary i sunk again into a languor and stupid sameness which never was or yet has been one of my faults in the long catalogue and that i should be so stupidly dull and awkward with a crowd of friends is surprising indeed the only reason i can even now suggest was my heart and soul being so taken up with my public and dangerous attack on mr foot and that by undertaking a long and fatiguing character with the almost certainty of chill and cold to fix an instant hoarseness which i have generally found to be the case after playing a moorish part this should still be a lesson for young and old performers never to run such a hazardous trial by attempting too much in search of fame for by those means they let slip the ball they might with caution catch i had not only when heated the black to remove from my neck and face by repeated attempts with cold pomatum and great plenty of water and soap to scour them clean but twice after to dress from top to toe  first as lady pentweazle  then as mr foot in the second act of the farce but youth with good spirits accompanied with applause can do wonders  my lady pentweazle went off with every success my most sanguine hopes could wish for but when i came on in the very dress foot had worn and as mr foot the audience seemed actually astonished and from that point being gained i really was for the remainder of the evening persuaded by the height of fancy that i was mr foot i gave all the particulars he had done with the imitation of his puppets and a new italian burletta of my own composing in the manner of the favorite burlettasingers then at the opera house and what most highly pleased was the conversation scene between mr and mrs cadwallader as mr foot and mrs clive which cheered the audience as they had not seen it for two years peals of laughter attended the performance and i may add shouts of applause all my strokes on mr foot  when the curtain dropped great congratulations followed with such heartfelt satisfaction to myself as made me judge like shift in the minor that  thinking myself pretty near equal to my master i made him one of his own bows and set up or myself  but more of that speech will occur in its proper place as he wrote shift as a satirical level  a cap to fit me  which cap turned out the richest i ever wore and entirely at my master footes expense  my friend joseph austins benefit was to be on the wednesday following may the   th the fair quaker of deal and the farce of the apprentice in which farce he had desired me to perform a new scene the apprentice the first time mr austin but the wonderful reception of my farce on the monday occasioned him to alter his intentions and desired me to repeat the same for him which i was in true regard bound to promise and perform when garrick came to the theater on the tuesday morning for he had kept out of the way for fear of my d  d tricks he said mr austin was there and informed him of the particulars of the monday mr austin said that he greatly enjoyed all wilkinsons strokes upon foot garrick then pretending to be  said now why austin now what d  d  has this friend tate of yours been at well and now you want him to be at his tricks again on wednesday next well now really austin i will have no more to do with these d  d exotics  but you say he really trimmed foot well ha ha ha in the midst of this cheerful scene came a letter from the lord chamberlain couched in severe terms for mr wilkinsons taking the liberty on monday night to restore and act a scene from the author which had been prohibited it had given great offense to mr and mrs aprice and therefore it was expected no such rude infringement should be again repeated mr garrick was now really angry at being called to an account for my breach of his theatric laws but i had thought it vastly clever as it supplied that part where my imitations of the performers were usually given mr austin brought me the intelligence but it chagrined me much for as i had executed that part so well it was taking a principal feather from my gaudy newlyacquired plume however high authority had laid its weighty commands and i was obliged though much against my will to submit  the farce was nevertheless acted but with the lord chamberlains cruel lopping off a principal limb it went off vastly well but not with such acclamations as on my own night for indeed not having had time to prepare a substitute to supply the vacancy was a severe stroke on my performance  on my benefit i was favored with many presents which made my profit still more lucrative  ten guineas from the hon miss foley lord foleys sister was presented me by mrs wardle and a genteel douceur from herself who had an upper box and filled it flushed with this good fortune we were as happy a mother and son as the kingdom could boast  the theater closed in about fourteen days after my benefit and i began to prepare for my summer campaign which was once mre destined for portsmouth the war still continuing  but in consequence of some pique which had happened on my playing all the principal parts the year before several had taken it so much in dudgeon that a great desertion ensued the hero mr cook alias gentleman who though very lame and in years had been the stock romeo mr gates mrs price who was afterward married to mr parsons mrs mozeen mr and mrs fitzmaurice all had invited themselves on a jolly party for scotland where they had removed the winter before and were fixed for some time in the edinburgh company of comedians and were there when mr foot paid his first visit as i believe was mr james aikin for i heard mr foot on his return from that place speak very highly of that gentleman and i think it was that year  this desertion of the portsmouth troops made recruits quite necessary for which supply old mr kennedy the commander wrote to me and appointed me agent for my acquaintance and friends were so powerful at portsmouth as to make my assistance absolutely necessary to their taking the sield with safety or any hopes of success instead of engaging one tragedy queen i enlisted two which did not turn out to my satisfaction as a mrs daly was there whom i had created empress the summer before which rendered it next impossible for me to please all the three from bath i got my good friend miss morrison from london a miss kitty white miss kitty married a young man of the name of burden the season i am mentionng so she got blessed with a husband by my means  mrs white the mother was a most extraordinary character and worthy of record far from wanting sense and observation she was quick lively cunning and sagacious but had passions that outstripped the wind yet goodnatured at times all this variety as differently tuned for good or ill temper was aided by the finest slipslop collection of words imaginable that made her in truth not only to myself but to many others an inexhaustible fund of entertainment and she was to me beyond compare the most diverting old lady i ever met with whenever burden her soninlaw gave offense which was almost perpetually she used thus to harangue her daughter maam you have married a feller beneath you  you played lucy last night in the minor better than mrs cibber could have done upon my sold and yet this scoundrol would hurt such a devine cretur true mama replied her daughter but suppose he should in despair and rage cut his throat cut his throat let him cut his throat and go to the devil but he will not cut his throat no such good luck but i will tell you what maam if you contradict me i will fell you at my feet and trample over your corse maam for you are a limb maam your father on his deathbed told me you were a limb  you are pure as ermind maam except with sir francis dolvol and you shall not live with your husband maam you have no business maam to live with your husband the first women of quality maam dont live with their husbands maam  does mrs elmy live with her husband no maam  does mrs clive live with her husand no maam  does mrs cibber live with her husband no maam  so now maam you see the best women of fashioned upon earth dont live with their husbands maam  and thus concluded one of this good ladys harangues  another i must insert from mrs bellamys life but which being my own i may without any injustice claim and put it in its proper place  miss k white was a pupil of mr richs and during her initiation mr obrien of drury lane theater gave her some instructions how to perform with propriety the character of sylvia in the recruiting officer  one day as he was thus employed observing that the lady misconceived his directions and repeated a passge very improperly he told her she ought to consider that the part she was speaking was a parenthesis and required a different tone of voice and a greater degree of volubility than the rest of the sentence a parenthesis said miss white what is that  mrs white who happened to be present hearing this question of her daughters and blushing that she should thus betray her ignorance instantly broke out into the following polite and sensible exclamation  o what an infernal limb of an actress will you make what not know the meaning of prentice why prentice maam is the plural number of prentices  o you will make the devil of an actress  in short this old gentlewoman was the delight of myself and company and to those in particular who knew her  and her acquaintance was not confined she pleased me so much that i should tie the reader with the subject and make him skip from page to page so will leave my dear mrs white for the present proceed to business and introduce at some future opportunity that lady into good company  with this young lady miss white i safely arrived at portsmouth and soon sallied forth as alexander and appointed her my statira the brave admiral rodney was there to whom i was much indebted for his generous courteous and genteel behavior  we opened on wednesday the  0th of june      with the provoked husband lord townly with an occasional prologue mr wilkinson and manly by mr moody  his first appearance on that stage here was my first acquaintance with my good friend mr moody to whom i have been often much obliged i here beg leave to assure mr moody i hold him in great regard and shall never forget but ever remember him with the highest pleasure and esteem  mr moody arrived at portsmouth from jamaica and in his hand led from the lucky bark that wafted him safe to england a lady to whom he paid due attention a mrs osborne she was a sensible woman and had not lost time while abroad as her waist was not one of the most slim she made her appearance in the mourning bride and though osmyn pronounces in the third act that she is still his bride the mysterious rites delayed nor has the hymenial torch yet lighted up his last most grateful sacrifice which proves the meeting in the prison to have been the first after the marriage ceremony but our portsmouth almeria was so clever she evinced beyond doubt that she was pregnant in the fourth act and in act the fifth she could not continue till her coronation but she the mourning bride was obliged to be carried to her statebed where she was delivered of a brave chopping heir to granada  i called the next day to inquire after her health and found the lady dressed and sitting at a table perfectly well shelling peace for her dinner in a few days we had a merry christening i was one godfather and think my friend moody was a godfather or some kind of a father  which he knows best  this short relation is strictly matter of fact  mr moody had from his merit as an actor and by assiduity as a man of inspection and knowledge made that proper use of his time which every one should but what few do practice he returned to england after having gained and not squandered away but secured a property of consequence and by proper attention has increased it in yearly service to the present day and will prove mr moody had an invaluable friend not only thirty years ago but will stand the test to the last i wish i had thought and acted as wisely as he has done  mr moodys oflaherty and many principal comic characters have been and are still felt and acknowledged and will be on theatrical record some years to come and keep a remembrance for his tombstone to tell  whose dust lis here  but i trust and hope ere that time arrives he will enjoy many happy days and years  his being at portsmouth secured him a lucky transplantation to london that hotbed of genius which circumstance will presently occur  i revived the play of alexander and performed several new characters one of which was shylock for my friend moodys benefit but without knowing ten regular lines  also presented the diversions of the morning  i had two clear benefits  the first was on monday july   essex tea for i lived almost on my tea with the first night of the guardian  in the bills by desire pit and first gallery at the same price and nothing under full price during the whole performance  my attachment to my mother may be allowed laudable and an apology for offering here and there as occasion permits the insertion of a few of her letters  most fathers and mothers will pardon me as it proves the friendly intercourse there was betwixt us and the cheerful and strong attachment o the partial mother  london july the   th      dear tate yours on monday the  th with all the unlucky circumstances conspiring to hurt your night gave me less pain than the sight of your over and above long bill  too much indeed for the strength of any young man upon earth and i do not look upon you as one of the stronger sort i was so unhappy with the apprehensions of your being laid up in a fever from your violent emotions joined to the excessive heat of the season that till yours of yesterday i had no peace of mind it was dated the   th and so i ought to have received it on saturday i thank god for your health and also the favor of providence in blessing you with so good success in procuring the most necessary subsistence and comfortable supports of life i with great pleasure congratulate you upon the profits of your benefit and also upon the restoration of mrs strode from death to life for i look upon her as a most considerable friend to you and shall ever duly honor her as such which i beg you will tell her  on thursday last i went to mrs whites to know if any letter from her daughter but no other than one dated the day before your benefit and as they are not within the proper district of the general post they are sometimes several days neglected by the penny post so that i desire to have all yours directed to myself as the single line of all is well i shall always think most richly worth the sum of threepence from this visit i could not get away without a promise to drink tea on saturday which though so hot i did not know how to bear i went in hopes of hearing of you but though i was disappointed in that yet i cannot help owning the old lady has so much spirit and so much out of the common way that i was vastly entertained she now begins to fume about mr g  trifling after he had positively agreed to engage her daughter they had seen mr o  who seemed hurt at mr kings being engaged and told them the master was about two more the one a stranger who was to play the provoked husband at richmond that night and that mr g  and his lady talk of seeing portsmouth  your sweet monkey was sent home in disgrace for getting into lady forbess bed with several other misdemeanors so that i dont know what to do with the beastly hecreature  mrs townshend talking about the shrimps says that they are vastly fine and cheap at portsmouth and will keep so as to come sweet so that i would have you inquire the price of two pair of fine soles and if reasonable also to lady forbes mrs t and mrs b if an opportunity offers send them if not when you return will do as well  my compliments to the rival queens  i am your most affectionate mother g wilkinson   on monday july    i acted hamlet mr moody the gravedigger dancing by mrs blake better known by the name of miss polly durham the farce was the chaplet  as i was paying attention in the fifth act to mr moodys gravedigger mr kennedy the manager plucked me by the sleeve and said mind what you do for mr garrick is in the pit  it rather alarmed me but having time before my entrance to reconnoitre and not finding any likeness i looked upon it as a joke and not hearing from any person that he had been seen and so well known i went out to supper and staid late  but the next morning july    i was waked by a messenger from the fountain tavern with mr garricks invitation to breakfast i was of course astonished at such an unexpected visitant at portsmouth and wondered still more at the occasion which in my hurried thoughts i could not devise i instantly returned an answer that i would with pleasure wait on him hastily equipped myself and entered the room that great personage then graced made my bow and received a very hearty and friendly meeting here was a change  the following thought occurred to me o world thy slippery turns o world friends now fast sworn whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise are still together who twine as twere in love unsepable shall within this hour on a dissension of a doit break out to bitterest enmity so fellest foes whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep to take the one the other by some chance some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends and interjoin their issues on this wonderful greeting we were the most cordial good easy acquaintance that can be imagined we chatted agreeably for he seemed as pleased as i really was at this astonishing alteration  after breakfast we walked on the ramparts and then went to the dockyards he was in such good spirits that he ordered a bottle of hock to be made into a cool tankard with balm etc it was at noon in the height of summer and the heat was his excuse for so extraordinary a draught to him before dinner  my reader may be certain that whenever mr garrick chose to throw off acting and dignity and was not surrounded by business to perplex him he had it in his power to render himself a most pleasing improving and delightful companion  mr garricks walking arm in arm with me was an honor i dreamed not of he congratulated me on being so great a favorite and what he said was of much more service the being so well acquainted with the leading people at that place of which by inquiry he soon heard all particulars told me he was on a visit at dr garneys a gentleman of eminence who lived at wickham about eight miles from portsmouth to the left of portsdown once a physician but had given over practicing  his fortune being fully equal to ease and affluence mr garrick told me this visit had been for years promised but not paid till now said that dr garney was an old and intimate friend and he should be there seven or eight days mrs garrick was there and had sent him as a messenger with dr garneys compliments and her commands to insist that i would fix my own day and give them the pleasure of my company which visit they would all return so tate says my kind mr garrick mind you are well provided for we shall make it early in next week this obliging invitation i gladly complied with dressed in my best and even of that he took notice and said all was well except my buckles which being in the present fashion large and low on the instep he observed were like a sailors i did not want for lace to make me a gentleman  not absurd then  but such a figure now would be laughed at as it passed along  mr garrick received me at the doctors more like his son than merely a common acquaintance to whom he meant only to be civil and wellbred nor was mrs garrick a jot less kind she scorned to be ontdone in courtesy and met me with all that apparent regard as if a beloved relation had just arrived from the east indies she was in truth a most elegant woman  grace was in her step  i was introduced to dr garney his lady and son and after that to company who were quite strangers to me they appeared just like what were their universal wellknown character every thing that was good with power and will to render their pleasant mansion a happy resort for their acquaintance the situation was a little paradise in every respect that art and nature could contribute to make so it appeared to me to much advantage as the four immediate miles from portsmouth till you reach hilsey barracks the country is very indifferent very dreary and all confined for those four miles are regular fortifications ditches with drawbridges etc so that if it was not for the ramparts next the sea with that beautiful prospect of the isle of wight the ocean and the shipping portsmouth would be a very disagreeable situation in short much as i liked that residence i never could approve of it as a pleasant summer retreat the ramparts being the only good walk and those so exposed to the sun and reflection from the water that it made the evening intolerable nor has there been a possibility i fancy from the last time i was there to have formed such a comfortable resource as that of a cool and pleasant walk though when once arrived on portsdown ample amends is made to those who are on horseback or in a carriage as it certainly must be i should suppose all open to the view of the country behind and then by its other overlooking portsmouth the fleet isle of wight st helens and beyond southampton it must at least be one of the finest prospects in the world  my entertainment for the day for i was at dr garneys before twelve was as if calculated to please a man of fashion as to mr garrick he being much the youngest man of the two took me for two hours to every part of the house and garden that was worth observation and to the high top of an observatory built by the doctor for study curiosity and prospect and very near equal to that just mentioned of portsdown mr garrick ran and skipped about like a lad of twenty  indeed civility and kindness seemed the study of the day from him and the whole family and were visibly the intention and practice toward me  mr garrick had heard my benefit was over but when i informed him i was to have another he strongly recommended my night to the patronage of that worthy family and said he would take it equally as an obligation conferred on himself if bestowed on his friend mr wilkinson  there was honor  for i was a youth whose prosperity he had at heart because i was deserving and added unless that had been his opinion of me he had not invited or recommended me to the honor of dr garneys friendship after tea coffee etc we finished the evening with playing at bowls on the green and in walking i did not leave wickham till ten oclock at night and received a general invitation to make that house my own whenever convenience permitted or inclination prompted me i remember when talking of plays that day after dinner mr garrick said that he never acted but to one bad house and that was abel drugger when there was not  0l in the theater  on my departure from this so truly agreeable day never to be obliterated mr garrick gave me the play of barbarossa to be ready in that character and to study gloucester in jane shore and jokingly said he hoped there would not be any impropriety in bespeaking a play for friday july     and we desire wilkinson you will fix on a favorite character and do your best for the credit of both and damn it tate mrs garrick expects you will have a dish of tea ready after her jaunt by way of relaxation and if you disappoint us dr and mrs garney and all the party will be very angry therefore take care all these requests i assured him should be complied with he escorted me to my chaise and for the second time in his life made me very happy for i on my part never wanted gratitude or a pride to obtain his good opinion but our state of mind so fluctuates that it is merely a common barometer  it is true it is pity and pity it is it is true  i had promised more much more than i could make good for i had not the least doubt but any play i appointed would be granted servilely with a bow when authorized by the name of garrick here however i was mistaken for the next day when i summoned the company the three or four theatrical potentates in power pertaining to the petty state were very refractory each wanting to be principal on the occasion and by a majority of votes  lost my lieutenancy nor was i by myself for mr moody was not suffered on any account to be capital on this occasion  a mr white was the yearly garrick whose fame sounded and resounded from the county of devon to the bounds of hampshire therefore neither he nor they would permit any display of mine as each wanted to be a surprising actor and be elected by due right of merit in rurylane house of lords and commons says the morning gin and brandycag hero with a face  cleanliness speaking g affectedly and leaving out the letter r why is mr wilkinson to appoint a play for this mr ga  ick who is mr ga  ick mr ga  ick has no command over our company at portsmouth  and with the utmost nonchalance said mr ga  ick cannot i think be displeased with my macheath though i want no favor from mr ga  ick  assuring himself thereby of showing even garrick   here you shall see what you shall see and by that performance be engaged at drury lane and make king david tremble  so mr white who was lord paramount after as much altercation as would settle an address to the minister fixed on the beggars opera friday july   th      macheath mr white and mr moody was permitted to have the honor of acting lockit i was allowed to give tea and by particular desire to please me was added the author cadwallader by me of course it was with difficulty i could reserve twelve good seats as all the genteel people on hearing that mr garrick and his lady were to be there had crowded early to the theater the first act was finished and no mr garrick had appeared and on the second act beginning the audience and the performers blamed me for having asserted a falsehood and by way of a hum collected them to be disappointed and i really began to think it strange myself but to my great relief and satisfaction about the middle of the second act in my party came which was to me a gratifying triumph as mr white was very angry at having played so much of his macheath and mr ga  ick not present they were soon settled and paid much attention and very considerately and kindly mr and mrs garrick and their party made a point of obliging me by conferring strong marks of approbation  mr garrick was so pleased with my friend mr moody in lockit that he sent for him the next morning and engaged him for the ensuing season at a salary of thirty shillings per week because he told him he loved to encourage merit mr moody obtained mr garricks promise that he might make his entree in the character of king henry viii mr garrick after the sarce came round and insisted on my supping with them at the fountain tavern the noble troop of strangers were much increased by the addition of several gentlemen particularly as all the medical people of consequence belonging to the place went to pay their compliments to their acquaintances dr garney and family and also to mr and mrs garrick mrs garrick very politely thanked me for my performance which before so many people certainly appeared respectful attentive and kind and i judged my fortune made  o fickle fortune  about half past twelve mrs garrick was for retiring and as one of dr garneys friends had provided them beds not suffering them to sleep at the tavern mrs garrick had to walk up the street to her destined apartment mr garrick who never failed in attention to his lady would not trust her to the servants care only but would himself attend her and then return back to the company he observed i came that evening in a very large handsome seacaptains cloak which he said he admired much and he would with my leave wear it to attend mrs garrick to her residence all the ladies went at the same time to private houses and the great little man wrapped himself in my then honored roquelaure he soon returned said he was pleased with his walk as it had made him so well acquainted with my cloak and which he thought would be so comfortable for the winter that if he had one many a walk should he take in it instead of going in a sedan from southamptonstreet to drury lane therefore requested i would not leave portsmouth without procuring such another and take it to london for him  the evening was very chatty he had all attention paid him and in consequence showed himself to great advantage he asked me if i had seen that d  d foot i answered no to which he replied with vehemence he hoped for my sake i never would if i could avoid it either see or speak to him again what all this violent kindness proceeded from i never could account for however i thought then and do to this hour think myself highly obliged for to the observer it bore every mark of sincere benevolence and regard  it was three in the morning before the party broke up a very uncommon hour for him he took a most cordial and friendly leave and i was much pleased with my affable and agreeable entertainment and wished him a good morning and a safe and pleasant journey to his seat at hampton court for which place he was to set forward in two or three days  my second benefit was on wenesday the   th of august douglas tea and lethe my characters were douglas old man and lord chalkstone  i thought it would be rude and impolitic when this ceremony grew near if i did not according to the repeated invitations i had received wait on dr garney at wickham i hired the handsomest horse i could thinking that a post chaise for the day looked idle as well as extravagant for a distance of only eight miles though not a sailor in portsmouth but would have proved a better jockey than myself to make which clear i must relate my john gilpins ride to wickham which has made me dread horseback ever sine i had seldom used myself to that mode of traveling for though i had frequently gone from london to hampton court and richmond yet it was generally in a post chaise which ever was and is my favorite method of passing from place to place  the ostler of the fountain brought to my door a very fine looking horse and observing i wore spurs said pray mr wilkinson do you often ride on horseback i assured him the contrary because added he i beg then sir as you are not a jockey that i may take them off for the horse i have brought is so very spirited it may be dangerous for you to keep them on to this disarrangement i assented and for the first mile though hemmed in by the drawbridges and going on gently found it was very difficult either by giving the horse his own way or checking him to keep him within the power of my art of horsemanship but entertained hopes when i got into the open road by putting him into a canter that i should do very well by degrees the horse seemed wisely to comprehend that his own selfwill and sagacity were superior to his riders my ignorance was manifest to the animal and as he was fully convinced i assumed a government to which i was not by any means competent he was determined on rebellion and to himself usurped the reins of power the renewal of it to my fancy even now makes me giddy and i verily believe from that hour my brain was weakened which must plead some apology and it is a remark of truth that in almost every accident whether by falls down stairs or in the street from six years old my unfortunate head has always suffered these bruises on recovery may in some degree account for heaviness and stupidity and naturally for the luminary rays not to have shone forth so bright as i wished them even the night when i broke my leg my head was so jarred on the pavement as to occasion a violent stun and then such excrutiating pain as absolved all notion or feeling of my leg being in the least injured till endeavoring to walk on my recovery from the pain my leg already broke unable to do its office let me down and snapped the ancle bone  after having achieved near two miles with safety my bucephalus set off like mad i not being able by any means to keep my saddle but sat in a state of fear and terror in about half a mile after he had got into this wild freek in the narrow road i met the london wagon where with care there was scarce room to pass by it but to which this dreadful beast rushed that the wheel stopped and checked my right leg and brought me to the ground and on my fall the horses hind foot struck my jaw and made it bleed most plentifully providentially the men stopped the wagon but almost against their will for they could no conceive from the fury of the beast and the supposed misguided rage of the rider but i was some foolish mad fellow eager to show my horsemanship neck or nothing  the waggoners behaved with more civility than is usual for such animals for in general they certainly are merely such they only damned me for a fowl for they were right zure i mun be mad to ride dumb beast to fright the wagon like but when i declared my innocence as to any intended violence on their carriage and told them the real cause they thought it a very good joke and pronounced i should never be a sportsman sufficient to win the kings plate at newmarket  while i was wiping off the dust and blood and was really much bruised and with reason alarmed for had not the waggoners from seeing gilpins certain danger stopped the wagon i must have experienced a shocking death by being crushed under the wheels near thirty years before this day of relation or at best i could only have existed as a dreadful spectacle the gay mettled courser having disengaged himself of his rider was all the time feeding on such odd bits of grass as he could find i was helped on his back and reassumed the reins with as much ease as if no accident had occurred and i had only mounted a ladys gentle pad  the waggoners desired me not to ride again like a devil upon the kings high road for i might have seen wagon like and at the same time have seen there was not room to pass it and poor beast was so quiet it must have been all my fault i bore this second lecture with patience so thanked mr waggoner and proceeded on my journey for as to dwelling longer on my ignorance it was sufficiently explained and would have only increased their contempt not created pity and therefore would be a loss of time to us all as our journeys end was quite contrary to attain  i determined to be very steady and not venture on the perilous canter any more a gentle trot at the most was to suffice and that with all precaution we were jogging on as if by mutual agreement with great regularity and composure when an officer who was going to hilsey barracks cried out your friend scott dines at hilsey  do come to dinner wilkinson  and went galloping on my fiery footed steed scorning to be outdone in courtesy obeyed the summons with the utmost swiftness not by any means waiting to hear or consult my opinion as to the invitation while gilpin like i held by the pummel of the saddle out of breath and expected every instant my neck would be broke i was at the last gasp with this devil of a horse for the officer had no thought but i was determined to outride him and be at hilsey the first i found pulling or holding like major sturgeon by the main was all to no purpose and every moment supposed i should be sprawling on the ground but on seeing the turnpike i cried out aloud shut the gate murder murder for gods sake shut the gate at first they did not comprehend me but on observing my awkward manner of riding on this my flyinghorse and my continued cry of shut the gate they did so before i got to it then another fear instantly arose which was that of the horses despising the barred gate and leaping over it which if he had there would have been one major sturgeon less in the theatrical world but fortunately the creature either in pity to my fears or regard for his own limbs or from the custom of stopping at the gate which i cannot pronounce halted there and that suddenly on a supposition may be that the kings duty was necessary to be loyally paid to which he was possibly daily accustomed and to my astonishment in the midst of horrors he pleasingly surprised me by so doing for he seemed equal to any mad exploit whatever  here i stayed and got a glass of water and from the turnpike for about a mile to the left on the irregular paths of portsdown i expected he had settled to reason and had tried my skill in horsemanship sufficiently but on the up hill and down dale once more he began and more swift than ever without a chance of my meeting with any cottage or modern shepherd or shepherdess in case of accident or misfortune having quite left the public road for me to expatiate on the wonders i this day performed in the noble art of vaulting horsemanship might make young astley fearful of a rival and dare me to a trial of skill the sensible beast certainly knew what an insignificant major he had on his back and determined to make a frisky day of it at my expense i was in hopes till he took this third unlucky frolic all would have been well and that the headstrong servant was sensible of the errors he had already committed and i began to fancy myself an elegant prancer when he rapidly flew with me to a precipice of very considerable height where i thought he would for his own sake have stopped his carreer but to convince me he was superior to fear and scorned even imminent danger down he plunged headlong to the bottom i have seen something like this heroic action in an old pantomime of mr richs called perseus and andromeda where perseus like a flaming god suspended by a wheel of large circumference was whirled with great velocity around the theatric clouds and struck with his mighty sword the frightful gorgon who midst raging billows was ready to seize the chained andromeda his wishedfor prey one fatal evening the wheel and pullies broke and down fell perseus on the harmless stuffed dragon and instantly the curtain was dropped to hide the disgrace and to hasten to the relief of the before lofty airriding god  it needs not the travellers talent to point mine out as a frightful situation in every respect as myself and horse had taken the dreadful plunge i in idea gave up the ghost thinking all was inevitably over and that there was not a possibility of life being preserved this was momentary ease from pain brings death and so with me  it was i guess some minutes before i recovered from the shock of the fall or to the least ray of restored senses but thank god almighty they did return by degrees though sickness was violent the horse still lying on my thigh my head was on the hilly part and the horses feet at the bottom which kept part of his weight from crushing my thigh  after finding i had so miraculously escaped with life i was fearful as my right leg and thigh felt so much stunned that they were broke but by degrees pulling at the rough hill gently i got my left foot equal to push on the saddle and so relieved myself but yet doubted whether i was not in the elysian fields i was in such a state of perturbation and misery with pain sickness and wonder that it was a delirium when i was more collected i looked at the horse as he lay almost lifeless and by his not making any attempt to move i feared his limbs had suffered and that i supposed would make it an expensive ride added to my surgeons bill staying there would not do at any rate so as soon as i was able to get on my legs i slid to the bottom took hold of the bridle and the horse with great difficulty arose and was as patient as a pet lamb i winded him round and round the rugged place as well and as gently as i could till by slow degrees aided by that sweet maid patience i got him out of the dreary depth and once more attained a part appertaining to portsdown hills notwithstanding my third disaster i again had courage to mount being only about two miles from dr garneys and we proceeded with all the regularity and gravity of don quixote to the wishedfor villa and arrived at it after all my fatigues troubles and hairbreadth scapes and falling headlong down the deep tarpeian rock the doctor and his son were out and not expected home till dinner when i had related the story of my woes to mrs garney she was greatly alarmed and wished much for the doctors returning that he might immediately bleed me which she insisted was a ceremony necessary to be instantly performed i agreed in opinion with her but as the doctors coming might not be for two hours i retired to be brushed washed etc which was absolutely needful and it much refreshed me i then desired the favor of a bottle of madeira but mrs garney did not approve of it and instead of that potation recommended more hartshorn and water but i told her that i had on my arrival been well provided by her kindness with plenty of the watery element and now really wished for something else and thought madeira would do wonders she shook her head on hearing this and went out of the room as i was preparing myself for dinner she politely sent me the madeira and i most eagerly drank a full tumbler of it and it revived me wonderfully but prudence prevented my increasing the draught for by my good will as i was so thirsty and hot and the madeira had gone down so deliciously i could have finished the bottle but well it was i did not for in my hurried state of spirits and being bruised from head to foot it might have proved a more certain road to death than any dagger i had ever struck or any draught of poison i had ever swallowed as a stage patriot for the good of my country  the doctor and his son did not return till near four above two hours after i had arrived on my prancing bucephalus i was well refreshed and my face was in tolerable order all considered though it was much scratched and wounded mrs garney represented my story in most tragical colors which had it been so well told before i had drank the madeira she might have gained my consent for being bled as i expected it after the violent fall i had endured but on growing better and thinking the madeira had done every thing that was necessary all reasons or persuasions were in vain for i obstinately refused and said i wished for dinner and that was preferable to being bled at last the doctors kind intentions yielded to my petulance and the sight of the good dinner seemed to be the most prevailing argument on all sides the lancets were changed for knives and forks and i performed with those weapons more dexterously than i or any person at table expected we drank mr and mrs garricks health  the doctor inquired when my benefit was i told him  he asked for tickets which i could not have thought of carrying there in my pocket because a gentleman had invited me to dinner however he begged leave to present me with three guineas for three box tickets which i was to send him i accepted the kings pictures and of course sent three scraps of paper in exchange he desired i would come once more before i went to london i accordingly visited that pleasant hospitable spot again but it was in a postchaise not on horseback  no more of that  no more of that  on my return the horse either walked or went a gentle trot all the way to portsmouth and when in the public road though several gentlemen were returning from their evenings ride he was as easily conducted as if he had never been obstreperous every one was astonished when i related my adventures and but that they had a good opinion of my veracity and seeing the marks on my face and my naming the waggoners and turnpikeman as witnesses my story would not have been credited for the horse was so gentle and so easily guided they said that every one must conclude the rider was the most to blame  the want of judgment in me might in part have been the cause but from the circumstance of the ostlers taking off my spurs it was evident he treated his riders every now and then with a frolic and i guess his fall had made him feel pain and find he was in an error when he cut that caper of enchantment which bereft me of my senses and had he not had that fall i think he would have finished my career and effectually have prevented my ever seeing old portsmouth again  i do not recollect many particulars relating to this summer campaign worth setting down so will suppose my portsmouth engagement ended and greatly to my advantage but now though not an old man melancholy reflection tells me that were i to set my foot in that town there is not one man or woman gentleman or gentlewoman existing whom i should know  all gone gone but why should i moralize reflect on or regret the certain fate of all mankind is there a wonder in so well proved a certainty  miss morrison continued at that theater for some time longer  mr moody went for london to his new royal engagement and miss kitty white was soon after married to her favorite sailor mr burden the mother escorted her youngest daughter miss betsey to dublin as mr barry by the persuasion of sir francis delaval had engaged her  miss kitty was a pupil of mr richs at the same time he was larning me and she was taught at his academy for acting and there began our acquaintance mr rich took infinite pains in teaching his ladies mrs stott late mrs lessingham was also a pupil of his in      and made her appearance in desdemona  i cannot resist mentioning a little anecdote with which mrs clive and mr garrick were highly entertained it was related to them by benjamin victor who was at the play on the night it happened at portsmouth as follows richard the third mr wilkinson lady anne miss white richard o take more pity in thine eyes and see him here  miss white replied would they were battleax to strike thee dead    i need not tire the reader by a long story how happy my mother was to see her son after what she thought a tedious absence  on my arrival in london i found mr garrick was in town waited on him and was received by my good friend as cordially as when i had last seen him at portsmouth i had sent him his cloak for which he poured forth a profusion of thanks and said mrs garrick must pay for his portsmouth garment  at that time i frequently had the honor to breakfast with him an invitation i would never give or accept but on urgent or very particular occasions for give me the newspapers and letters and let me sit sullenly by myself during that ceremony every day  it is to me a strange invitation and may always be given with safety for i should be sure to refuse it at one of these breakfasts mr garrick desired me to be ready in bajazet for the annual ceremony at that time of acting tamerlane with the occasional prologue at both houses on the  th and  th of november  mr mossop had been inveigled by barry and woodward to their new theater in crowstreet dublin which gave a great shock and made a considerable chasm and derangement in our affairs of state  mr king was engaged this year from dublin and made his appearance in tom in the conscious lovers in october       mr king had not been there since the spring    0 when the roman father was brought on the stage in which he acted valerius but mr garrick produced mr king to the public in      as the herald in king lear and in the character of george barnwell in       garricks judgment here was not infallible and as to mr king it is no wonder he should not have known which way the true bent of his genius lay as too frequently is the case young performers think of nothing but tragedy i do not doubt but perseverance would have proved mr king an acquisition to the buskin but mrs chance decided otherwise and fortunately for the best  in the comedy of the confederacy he acted brass of which character the inimitable churchill takes particular notice and that gentleman though so keen and clever in his satires was not strictly just which is rather lamentable where strong and superior genius reigns mr king has proved a contradiction to his remarks and indeed my very exact explanation relative to myself before given evinces i was not the mimics mimic for such as it was it certainly was my own which indeed he afterward acknowledged as will be mentioned in proper time and place  on reviving the comedy of the confederacy mr garrick one evening sent for me in a great hurry to request as a test of my regard to oblige him that i would play old mrs amlet he said it struck his thought it might help to strengthen that comedy  i in duty bound immediately undertook the part  mass pope made her first appearance as a regular stage candidate in corinna though she had often acted as a child in miss in her teens lethe the oracle lilliput etc not acted here these eight years  dick mr palmer brass mr king moneytrap mr yates clarissa mrs pritchard flippanta mrs clive corinna for the first time and after which the pantomime of  it was acted again on monday the   th of october  the play was greatly received and miss pope gained much applause and gave great promise of being what she is universally acknowledged to be an excellent performer and she has from that night to this day been an ornament to the public as an actress of their own rearing and a credit to the stage as a worthy and amiable private character i must not forget to add that my old mother amlet was well received and for some nights repeated till the fates called me unexpectedly from thence  i well remember on the second night of the confederacy mrs clive called miss pope into the green room before her going on the stage as corinna and said to her my dear pope a sweet appellation indeed from clive you played particularly well on saturday night as a young actress  now take from me a piece of advice which i would have every performer attend to  you acted with great and deserved approbation but to night you must endeavor to act better and expect to receive less applause for if you let your young heart be too sanguine and rest on the caprice of public commendation or praise and find yourself disappointed you will foolishly let it damp your spirits and you will sink beneath yourself  therefore take my advice for your proceeding on the stage  the violent thunder of applause last saturday on your first appearance was not all deserved it was only benevolently bestowed to give you the pleasing information that they were well delighted and had their warmest wishes that you would hereafter merit the kindness they bestowed on you  young performers should remember this lesson for they are too apt to construe kindness and cherishing into a tribute due to their deserts  the play of tamerlane was next called and a few days before that play came to its annual rotation mr john moody made his entree in london as specified by his articles of war signed at portsmouth in the character of king henry viii the night previous to that i acted mrs amlet mr davies who was then an actor at drury lane and who wrote mr garricks life and various other pieces miscellanies etc was an old man at that time to me for i was exactly twentyone that november this old gentleman had set his heart on acting bajazet and when he came one morning to the playhouse and found me rehearsing the part he was so mortified that he could not contain his spleen but came into the greenroom and with an affected fit of laughter said ladies and gentlemen only think what our theater is come to  finely lowered indeed for we have henry the eighth acted by john moody john moody the coachman in the journey to london  and bajazet by an old woman meaning mother amlet on hearing which i very gravely turned round and said and pray mr davies why not bajazet by one old woman as well as another my old womans retort to mr davies as the existing john moody can witness was my first stage witticism and which procured an universal laugh in my favor besides that of triumph to my friend john moody and myself which i am certain he remembers to this day the play of tamerlane was still rehearsing and being then in favor at court i was summoned by mr holland into mr garricks dressing room  mr garrick said he wished to hear me repeat some of bajazets speeches in order to rectify my mistakes which would be easier to me there than if corrected at rehearsal mr cross the prompter was ordered to attend with the play mr holland whose part was moneses undertook to act the first scene as tamerlane mr garrick was in high humor saying well now cross hey why now this will be too much for my exotic hey cross i must do it myself what say you hey now cross cross replied i am afraid ot this year sir as the time is drawing near and bajazet is long and the play must be done next monday well now hey cross why that is true but dont you think my brow and eye at bajazet  how do you think i should play it o sir said cross like every thing else you do  your bajazet would be incomparable  to which we all bowed and assented he then acted a speech or two in my first scene and his look was truly inimitable i never shall see his like again now my turn came as he said for a private docking of luxurious branches and here follows the proof of mr garricks favorite wit which i formerly mentioned i went on rehearsing with holland my master saying very well vastly well indeed upon my word now now this  till the middle of the scene where repeating the long speech of o glorious thought  vastly well bravo  till i came to the difficult finishing li  so now you know my mind and question me no further  why hey now witkinson why this is all shittlecomesh  te and my a  e in a bandbox  here nw was i in eager expectation of a t  d as thick as my wrist and as long as my arm and d  n it it is all squitter sr mr king was there   the delicate reader will skip this leaf like sir clement flint in the heiress yet i hope will pardon it as i do not insert it for entertainment but fairly as the indispensable characteristic mirth which mr garrick with all his understanding was too apt to give way to though one of the first geniusses of the world yet he would descend to such low stuff and ribaldry poets may write and preachers declaim yet here is a strong picture that the wisest people at times are fools nature will take the lead in spite of what they call right and evince them that men are but children of a larger growth those who often teach the contrary laugh at you when you believe them and are sometimes found in equal error with those they austerely correct and it is certainly amazing to the cool reflector on the human mind that garrick with such idle stuff could not only highly divert himself but by the help of his kingly name stamp and pass it as current wit and humor  i actually aver that the related strokes of wit from mr garricks spontaneous and wonderful fancy were retail theatrical jokes for a week or month following that on my rehearsing with mr garrick mr holland judged it so comical that he had never done with the joke and so fashionable was it that not only the gentlemen but the ladies and those that were most delicate all professed admiration and strong appetite for garricks jests on wilkinson mr cadwallader in the author declares he eat the princes soup out of compliment though it was as bitter as gall and as black as his hat  still says  d  n his soup  as a relater of facts i cannot omit in regard to mr garricks amazing care of me as a manager i was then really ignorant of the art of properly lining my face with indian ink he not only gave a particular charge to mr johnson the housekeeper who possessed judgment in those matters but attended in person by half past five not merely to assist and see that it was done but corrected and gave the finishing strokes of the pencil himself and helped to improve my face with the necessary red and white and the yellow ochre but this is letting the reader too far into our stage mysteries and certainly such attention from a person of his rank and real independence was careful pleasing encouraging and kind i thanked him for it  my bajazet upon the word of a gentleman was better than well received i was perfect to a t or as a very old stager would term it quite rotten in the part however to attempt bajazet when i was but twenty years old and finish it with approbation certainly gave promise for the young racer though no jockey mr quin had been the bajazet and was allowed excellent and then well remembered  barry was in full fame and mossop not forgot in that character but still there were at drury lane only wilkinson and davies left at that juncture for bajazet holland being the moneses  mr foot at that time had not any engagement and mr garrick really acted the being offended with him so well and mr rich kept his natural stupidity so obstinately that mr foot was reduced from the pressure of his wants and bad state of his finances by way of immediate relief to his necessities to advertise a comic lecture at the haymarket theater early in december my curiosity naturally prompted me to attend his performance but lest i should be negligent mr garrick sent for me to rub up my attention fearing i might like a lazy sentinel sleep on my post he ordered me in strong terms to be there in time to be very attentive and to bring him a just account  the lecture was rather defective and lame but in that whimsical delivery and oratorical situation foot was unrivalled as he had great spirit judgment fire and volubility was very equal and collected in a situation so perilous and difficult in the first act of his oration he evinced all these shining qualities but he had not taken leisure nor prepared himself by any means with sufficient matter for such a nights entertainment as was expected and all to be done by himself it was too rash too unadvised and too like the lightning which does cease to be ever one can say it lightens he was wonderfully happy as the rising but not as the setting sun for it was not a glorious but a cloudy and darkened hemisphere  however he was recompensed for his trouble and cheered by seeing all his friends and a crowded theater at the full prices as now paid at the playhouses one of his remarks was levelled against the combined theaters urging that several veteran actors might be seen walking the streets at noon picking their useless teeth  another was levelled at mr rich who was fond of roman triumphs ovations etc also italian burlettas in one of which there was a sneezing duet he said that that bright managers time was too busily employed either to admit him or the destitute minor in his hand alluding to his then newwritten farce of that name as it was wholly occupied in showing how the old romans dressed and the modern romans sneezd and that garrick was too careful to allow if possible any writers existing even from the crumbs of his table so that with that penurious gentleman no author could hope either for subsistence or encouragement  the second part of his lecture failed in every essential point and all his former satire and sting had left neither prejudice nor effect to serve any purpose whatever  too often the error of our modern playwriters how charming are the two or three first acts of mr cumberlands choleric man but how different or rather indifferent are the latter that and other modern comedies put me in mind of congreves last tag to the old bachelor all coursers the first heat with vigor run but it is with whip and spur the race is won   it may be difficult without doubt to sustain and rise superior in the fifth act but that it is to be achieved is unanswerably proved whenever the provoked husband the beaux stratagem the suspicious husband and the wonder are acted in laughter glee and spirit they rise evidently to the last it must be admitted that in modern comedies the players as usual are brought all together for the purpose of moralizing at the conclusion but to very little purpose regarding the entertainment of the audience except its being a kind of joy to the nodding auditory and the hinting it is near bed time and a good preparatory lull for their nights repose and in consequence going out of the theater half asleep half awake it must frequently prove dangerous to many of his majestys good subjects particularly in frosty weather as we all know the purlieus of drury lane and covent garden are slippery ways and at best require wary walking therefore an author should always endeavor as far as practicable to make his last act resemble a good disposition when bestowing favors as experience tells me that be he ever so bountiful unless the last gift is surpassing the first the ungrateful receiver will feel chagrined and disappointed and return sulky acknowledgments or more probably no thanks at all but alas it is easy to correct and to assume coxcomblike criticism  as  we think our fathers fools so wise we grow our wiser sons no doubt will think us so so the second part of mr footes lecture was like a bad fifth act in a play he was exhausted and felt but little of his former self he seemed to have no resource and was reduced to beg leave to sit down at a table with two candles and read his new piece called the minor which he then wanted to bring on the stage and that was in a mutilated unprepared state even for the closet it was almost incomprehensible and as it may be supposed suffered much by being read to such disadvantage though enforced by mr foot yet it was very languid to a large audience  he soon found the forced experiment weighed as heavy on himself as on his hearers he therefore broke up the assembled court rather abruptly apologized for the hurry with which he had taken the liberty to convene them together and finished with an assurance of making considerable alterations and additions against the next essay of which he would give timely notice  he bowed and departed neither with tokens of approbation or disgust for each party seemed pleased with the release  the audience retired apparently contented with such fare as they had partaken of but not by any means wishing to sit down again to the same dish  mr foot must have been perfectly convinced of this for he never again offered to try their palates fearing i suppose it would not have suited their tastes but have been ordered away with tokens of disgust  when the lecture was over i posted to the theater and as full of my packet of news as poor scrub eagerly got to mr garricks room where he was waiting all impatience and colonel keppel with him both in full dress it having been a gala day at st jamess where they had been paying their respects  i dare say several country readers will doubt my authenticity when i mention mr garricks having been at court but they may depend upon it that the information to those who live in london would not cause any wonder or be a matter of the least surprise as the patentees of drury lane and covent garden not only go publicly o court at st jamess but if they were to neglect that ceremony at least occasionally as on birthdays etc it would be taken notice of judged a remissness and not respectful mr foot as patentee at the haymarket always went to court where the first nobility were as glad to see him as any other acquaintance or intimate friend  i not observing mr garrick to be so fully equipped with chapeau bras under his arm and colonel keppel the same my thoughts were carried from their proper channel and i entered the apartment so precipitately and was so eager like a postmessenger to deliver my credentials that i forgot to take off my hat but let it remain like a stubborn proud quaker on its right place the head this was not from a rude habit quite the contrary but in my hurry and ardent desire to prove my loyal zeal to king david i had really never thought of it mr garrick very kindly gave me a wink and a slight pull and pointed at my head i was quickly sensible of my error and apologized for it which colonel keppel laughed at very heartily and said he was sure it was from a hurry of spirits then sat down as eager as garrick to hear the news relative to footes lecture for he was a sincere friend of garricks  to foot of course the contrary after an hours conversation with some of garricks stories and his damning foot very heartily we parted in two or three days after i was summoned to a cabinet council in southamptonstreet i found footes abuse in his lecture had not digested but sat very heavy on my managers proud stomach mr garrick said he had just received certain information that the d  d fellow foot was engaged with barry and woodward for dublin and had actually set forward that very day  now says garrick my dear tate now you see i have such a regard for you that i cannot omit any opportunity of doing you a service i am given to understand you owe much to the good folks of dublin for the favorable respect and regard that many persons there have shown you for the which you should hold them in great good will now i have consulted to make your fortune and i will consent to your going to ireland immediately and to your staying there till the end of february or march that is you see provided you give your word and honor to me you will not on any account accept any terms whatever or be prevailed on to act with barry and woodward  this proposal i relished as much as mr garrick wished i promised to be guided as he desired i was quite elated with the scheme and was all alive and in tip top spirits at the thoughts of seeing dear dublin again and all my good friends there i returned mr garrick a thousand thanks for his gracious furlough  i took that opportunity of asking for the money for his portsmouth cloak which notwithstanding the honor of often breakfasting with him i had not yet received though the sum was not enormous being only three guineas it was elegantly made for the price and he frequently walked the theatrical deck of his royal man of war graced in that snug covering but now well said he i suppose you think now  hey that you are never to be paid for this d  d cloak which was in fact expecting i should have replied with my good sir your kindness is such that i should esteem myself highly honored by your acceptance of such a trifling present but i knew my man too well and was certain that his good breeding would not have put me to the trouble of a second offer for without more ceremony he would have accepted of it after breakfast mrs garrick immediately withdrew for still the house affairs would draw her hence  and he poor man had not he declared such an immense sum in his own custody but on the day mentioned for dublin hoy he sent the servant for it to mrs garrick and paid me the mighty sum  i do not know if with all his heart but i know i took it as mrs trapes does the capuchin in the beggars opera with all my soul  i informed my lady mother of my unexpected trip she did not like the thoughts of the sea for her wise son but trusting as she ever did to the sole guider of all things she mustered a resolution and prepared for my journey and voyage as i was obliged to go in four or five days  on the night i was to depart in the chester fly having had a porter to cord my boxes before i went to the play on my return to take leave of my mother and not to depart without the good blessing to my surprise i had locked up all my cash in the boxes and had not near sufficient in my pocket to reach dublin i did not wish to unpack my mailtrunk till i had got to holyhead where the officers of the custom would per force view and feel the contents i had at noon only left sufficient for three months for my mother which was ever my first care after i was so enabled to prove my duty it was near eleven oclock when i discovered my error and i had no remedy but to unpack or the having recourse to my good mr garrick for i was to be in the coach by twelve  i therefore made haste to southamptonstreet  rapped aloud and had the honor of admittance he feared on seeing me that some misfortune had happened i got but just in time to save my distance for he was in his nightcap and said in about fifteen minutes he should have been in bed i told him the accident and said i should really be much obliged to him for fifteen guineas which he declared he was glad i wanted as it gave him an opportunity to prove how willing he was to oblige me and actually would not let me by any means take less than twenty and if in drawing an exact copy as far as i can judge of the human heart i do believe i was welcome to the sum in the humor he was then in even had he never received it again when i represent a picture of oddities annexed to genius do not let me ungenerously not feel and declare how well he here bestowed and i dare aver with sincerity he at times did generous actions and liked they should be known but our minds are wavering in common life and when we consider the more his astonishing discernment descried and proved the difficulties he had to surmount no wonder it in some degree spoiled perhaps a good mind had he been placed in any other situation veracity demands this complimentary truth to his memory  mr garrick was an actor on the stage of life and on the stage itself he was not the actor but lifes exact mirror he held to public view i here submissively bow to the reader and seriously entreat the lady or gentleman to believe that a tribute paid to the merit of mr garrick by my bad pen gives me more satisfaction than any contrary mark of character could do but i am here giving a faithful account of facts incidents etc and before i have finished i flatter myself i have not inserted any thing which may impeach my gratitude to that gentleman on a summary view from the beginning till i shall arrive at the sum total or but what will prove if i have wrote a little evil in brass i have not wrote his good with water  if the reader wonders at my want of cash when i made this application it was owing to the mistake and the time of the night and urgency made the necessity for i was then an actor and not that great insignificant character a poor manager  money that i did not immediately want my mother at my request always put into the stocks  mr garrick would have been unhappy had i lost a day so eager was he for my expedition in every sense of the word i left my lodgings in halfmoonstreet now more genteelly termed little bedford street and was carefully conveyed to chester and from there to holyhead thence in a storm accompanied as usual with a violent illness i at length safe arrived to view that very beautiful situation of dublin bay and as iuminations and rejoicings for great events cannot be commemorated unless the day be ascertained  know then after an intolerable sickness in greece i landed about ten oclock on wednesday december         this was to me a happy landing and as i was going in a hackney coach to my lodgings i thought i recollected the figure of a lady i knew and on stopping the carriage who should it be but my dear mrs white who was come over with her youngest daughter sister to the miss kitty white who was with me at portsmouth  my favorite old lady was thus haranguing mr younger who that year was at crowstreet theater and pointing with dignity to a play bill sir you have not used my daughter bess well pon my sold and barry has kept her in loves last shift ever since she came  there is a bill with sylviar at the bottom by that d  d devil mrs dancer  now sir the poor dear creature wants the breeches parts and if she has them not mr barry will have his benches pulled  ask mr barry what he thinks my daughter came over to ireland for  then if you do not know i will tell you sir  the breeches parts sir and she expects all the breeches parts sir  and now you know bets mind  to me the remembrance of this odd whimsical lady is a treat and i am not single in my opinion as lord miltoun lord clanbrassil sir francis delaval mr foot and others used to be so entertained with my telling the incidents of her outre character as occasioned me and mrs abingtons acting two parts on the stage for the purpose  the old ladys lecture being over and seeing me she roared out o you devil tate is it you kit wrote me word you was coming come open the door and let me into the coach and go with me to bet  she will be delighted to see you she ordered the coachman to stop next door to ryans tavern near crowstreet theater and being safely set down we found miss betsey at home and with her a counselor barret whom i soon perceived had a strong penchant for her  well after my introduction to the counselor and some hot wind pon my sold for tate after his sea voyage all was laugh and harmony and as music has charms to sooth the savage breast but here was an instance not to congreves credit for it was quite the reverse mr barrett as he was traversing to and fro unfortunately took up the violin and quickly played the black joke the old ladys eyes were instantly inflamed and a violent storm arose which hung with impregnant clouds that hovered over our heads and burst at last in thunder and impetuous showers   mer barrett sir no more of at tune sir i wont suffer that tune of dildididily for it is b  die sir i am thrilled throfout when i hear it  for its b  die sir  but my dear maam says the counselor  my dear devil  says the lady  dont dear me the poor girl could not sleep all last night for that d  mn  n tune  mamar mamar says the poor innocent creature what is doldididily mamar  go to sleep maam  mamar mamar again says she with all the innocence in the world pray tell me what is doldididily  why maam since you must know its b  die maam and now i hope you are answered poor innocent creature she did not know what b  die was so let me hear no more of doldididily  the daughter here ventured to soften matters she was sure mr barrett meant no harm with doldididily when her mother turned about and with an alarming voice cried out  o you eternal limb i will fell you maam  and indeed she was almost as good as her word for she slapped her face most violently screaming out at the same time was ever mother so chilled throout  the daughter tragically on her knees pulling her mothers petticoats who was declaring for england ho  myself and mr barrett endeavoring to parate the young sobbing suppliant and the enraged heroine  mr barretts face by no means escaped her nails or what the old gentlewoman termed tremendours slaps till the entrance of a couple of fine boiled fowls with celery sauce roast beef and some mince pies which the counselor had ordered from ryans produced a wonderful effect for anger gave way to hunger and rage subsided for the different passions  she kissed bet h kssed tate  she la ughed and said to mr barrett  go you devil and wash your face with brandy it is the most sovereignest thing in the world for a scratcht face pon my sold and then come and get your dinner the counselor yielded to the enforced law of brandy and promising never to play doldididily again we made as good a quartetto as i ever remember  dinner was scarce removed when a rattat was heard at the door and in came mrs kennedy breathless and express from mr barry with the news that mr dancer had expired that day at noon the play intended for that evening was romeo and juliet and as miss white was studied in the part mr barry begged she would play it and instantly attend him at the theater to rehearse ay that she shall cried the old lady for bet has been in loves last shift for the whole winter poor creature and has had nothing else to comfort her but now bess has a good thing to do  she shall show what acting is pon my sold  off they went to the theater and as mrs dancer could not appear an apology was made and i saw miss white play juliet i must explain by the old ladys last shift that miss white had made her first appearance and played one part only that season which was amanda in cibbers comedy of that name  counselor barret lost no time in declaring his passion for in about six weeks the bar orator pleaded his cause so urgently and successfully that miss betsey allured by his fiddle attraction of doldididily eloped with him one morning whilst her tender mama was slumbering to that wakeful nightingale her nose and before the clock had struck ten the holy priest had made those two in one and they were fast married he had a genteel fortune but his lady did not prove true unto his bed i believe for he sent her to a nunnery a very improper place where not liking penance she soon finished her short career kened pined and died on the morning they eloped the good old lady burst suddenly into my bedchamber tore open the curtains and demanded her daughter from out of my bed but my assurances of innocence as to any knowledge of her maiden pacified her by degrees and off she set to search some other young mans bed for that it seemed was the place she had ascertained as the most probable to find her daughter bess this truly original character was born at hull i apprehend the natural acuteness of yorkshire air polished and refined by the allowed elegant breeding of st giless gave the extraordinary finish to the tout ensemble of this truly original slip slop character  mrs dancer soon as possible played again as her absence reduced barry to the most pressing necessities which being properly and submissively laid before her she melted and pitied his lamentable situation and generously flew to his relief at this period mr mossops tragical powers were added to those of mr barrys and these united of course were attractive  mr mossops eparture from drury lane was partly occasioned by an affront he took from mr garricks appointing mr mossop to act richard as we will suppose this night and his first and best character which stood well against mr garricks though not so artfully and finely discriminated and at the same time the manager secured a command from the prince of wales for the night following so that when mr mossop had finished riard with remarkable credit in february      to his astonishment the mr palmer of that age stepped forward and said tomorrow night by command of his royal highness the prince of wales his present majesty king richard iii king richard by mr garrick it gave a great damp to what mr mossop had just finished it certainly was galling and proved duplicity and ill nature as well as envy  i had a letter pointedly in my favor from mr garrick to a mr wilks who had just then finished a history of the irish stage and had paid mr garrick most lavish compliments mr wilks was very kind when i visited him and presented me with his book which i have carefully preserved  to show how easily mr garrick would let trifles vex him he used frequently to correspond with a mr swan of york who like mr rich thought himself the only reader or judge of shakspeares othello he had been an actor and acting manager many years before in dublin but not remembered as mr victor observes for the dublin stage being in such dreadful order till after the year    0 when mr sheridan son of dr sheridan and father to our present shining ornament of the english senate and the english stage became the undaunted reformer of every flagrant abuse mr swan after having at york taught mr jackson now the edinburgh manager how to undraw the curtain in his favorite balcony scene never acted but by his direction said to a gentleman of the theater now in york in a very respectable situation  no man understands othello but myself  no says the gentleman  what do you think of mr garrick  o by g  d the man is not adequate to it  for he has neither learning nor understanding equal to the task this foolish trifling circumstance was repeated to mr moody who when in london seeing mr swans letters to mr garrick wherein he paid great adulation to his judgment told the ridiculous circumstance as a proof of that gentlemans duplicity mr garrick after that received several letters from mr swan but never answered one  on the evening of my arrival in dublin december         i had a message from mr brown the manager of smockalley theater with an invitation to supper we soon agreed for he did not know i was bound not to act at the other theater so all i asked was granted and preliminaries were settled with the utmost harmony and the night fixed for my first mounting the stage but before i enter on the circumstances attending my own skill on this adventure it will be necessary  an historian to inform the reader respecting many alterations that had occurred in the meridian of dublin since my first attempt on that stage in december      and what i am now to mention was in january    0 all or most of my theatrical readers have doubtless been informed of the state of the dublin theaters from books relators or experience but a short information for strangers to those points in general is i think in some degree here necessary  when i acted with mr foot in      the expenses were on a narrow scale but on a more solid and secure foundation than in    0 or i fear than at present    0 indeed in this year the theater is honored with a patent yet like the expensive cones of cherburgh i fear the profit is still far back many storms assault and sometimes in want of regular supplies the garrison not loyal and the inside of the genii palace very melancholy not all well within though adorned with false glare and enterprise indeed to keep a dublin or a york theater and gain the attention of a fickle audience greedy for variety and soon satiated must be attended with expense and atigue of mind beyond the possible idea of an auditor and though great receipts do at particular times happen yet the very ill success that drags on for want of ability before the sudden spring tide sets the crazy vessel afloat makes the captain manager too well acquainted with that hard labor the vulgar term  working for a dead horse  i am sure i can tell the dublin manager i speak this feelingly but not as an agreeable truth and if i am wrong in my supposition of him i beg his pardon and wish him joy of his arduous situation  now mr sheridan in      was the manage of a good theater with decent wardrobe scenery etc  his plays acted with exactness propriety and regularity and with every necessary embellishment  a list of his company men  mr sheridan  mr foot  mr king  mr heaphy  mr glover  mr hurst  mr kennedy  mr isaac sparks  mr wilkinson and others  women  mrs fitzhenry  mrs kennedy  miss grace philips  miss philips  mrs heaphy  mrs glover  mrs pie and others  mr sheridan then did not gain any enormous sum though he was in universal esteem and beloved as a gentleman and an actor of great ability at times he had very beneficial seasons his charge for a benefit was only  0l  now on my arrival in    0 mr barrys charges were with difficulty and i believe loss continued at  0l mr barry and mr woodward by raising a subscription had a new extensive and more elegant theater and new brooms sweep clean they opened that theater in october      but it was loaded with not less than sixty subscribers tickets when woodward and barry first acted great sums were received but it was but the vision of an hour for the number of auditors were confined when compared to those of london and as john moody says they could not haud it they could not haud it  mr sheridan that year after endeavoring to rally forces and make way against the stream of fashion found the current too strong was obliged to quit his ship as the old crazy theatrical vessel threatened instant sinking and from the ruins of which the very rats had run he found himself deserted by mr king and mrs fitzhenry who went over to the foe so he took the first opportunity of a fair wind and retreated not deeming himself  armed with selfsufficient merit to take the field against a host of foes   for as hudibras says  he who fights and runs away may live to fight another day but he who is in battle slain will never rise to fight again   the first year seemed to promise barry and woodward success to barry it was not so material being in debt for that never disturbed his rest woodwards disposition was quite the contrary for his dinner good or bad would not digest unless he was certain it was paid for  he was an oeconomist in the strictest sense of the word  he had secured a little fortune quite sufficient for that enviable state independency his income at drury lane having been affluent with great benefits for several years and a darling of the public from boxes to the galleries but with a grand view for gain he unfortunately experienced a total change he had quitted luxury riches and ease and was playing in dublin with vexation danger and slavery in a comparative view and one mishap after another in perpetual succession the nights when barry and woodward did not act the houses were so bad as to cause a woeful drawback  crowstreet seemed on the first onset to promise well but barry was himself a very luxurious marc antony to support and the other house in smockalley though contemptible in a comparative view yet was often galling and pricked the sides of royalty for barry and woodward were appointed masters of the revels which gave them the power of dubbing their new house royal but the lord mayor at that time had the power to license what theaters he judged proper yet woodward found it impossible and a more difficult task than he imagined to crush what he at first looked on as a very contemptible weak enemy yet weak and malicious enemies can sometimes pour in strength and often create uneasiness and perplexity  the revival of douglas at the old house by mr digges and mrs ward  also getting plays occasionally bespoke  benefits artfully given to public charities and wellknown genteel families in distress but above all beginning their principal benefits in the height of the season against the strongest plays of their opponents certainly greatly hurt their consequence destroyed woodwards rest and lowered barrys fame which stood aloft and looked disdain and terror on the host of scattered scarecrows beneath him yet these inevitable strokes could not be parried  but on some of those nights when barry woodward mrs fitzhenry and mrs dancer did all unite with an excellent company and exerted their best abilities have they performed to a middling house while the other has had a full theater on some popular occasion to an illacted play with dirty clothes and scenes and a dismally badlighted theater  indeed i have known even in london when mr rich has revived an old pantomime tagged to a vileacted play that garrick has trembled and i have heard him remark that if they came to a tragedy at drury lane from want of admittance by an overflow of covent garden they were not in humor the whole night as the grown masters and misses were disappointed of seeing the puppetshew and were deprived of their rattle  i must mention all that incredible rage for pantomime in london is now to the credit of the audience no more but it comes in very properly as a relief  but thirtyfive years ago to harlequin socerer the doors were obliged to be opened at three oclock and were at times broke open so eager were the million for admittance  in the dublin struggle barry and woodward met with inconceivable and unforseen perplexities they had recourse to their powerful set of friends particularly to ladies of quality to add their names to their strong plays which had certainly irresistible charms but this could not always last however that and then beginning their own benefits gave a total overthrow to the enemy who were so tattered and so mean in their attire that their executors the greedy crows flw hovering over their head impatient of their lean inheritance they we obliged then to submit to the fate of war and she up the playhouse while barry ode triumphant i his gilded car and swept all before him  nor did he that i ever heard send them dinners and apparel but like mr bayess troops supposed them all dead men barry and woodward closed early in june      opened again in october and thought dublin their own but november had not elapsed before they had authentic intelligence that an army lay concealed but as they were poor do not think the army in disguise were as lucky as mr bayess where we are informed all the innkeepers were their friends indeed barry and woodward this year were by wishing to do too much the cause of their own destruction they had offered mossop as i have related great terms and bribed him from drury lane and here they certainly were wrong for mossop would never have left the first situation in drury lane on any chance or even certainty and join a banditti to perform in a theater so destitute of every article whatever to have opposed their handsome wellprovided theater in all points however they had him there mr mossop being bred a gentleman also the son of one and having had a dublin college education he was universally known and in high esteem and was then thought by every one prudent and of an economical turn but lived very genteelly it was difficult to decide that season which was the greatest favorite with the ladies as a tragedian barry or mossop which was strange as barry was not only far superior professionally but was the only actor for really making love i ever saw but mossop added to much sterling merit and the firmness of voice for strength and clearness that double attraction novelty but the audience unfortunately will not always judge as the players do but assert their undoubted right of pleasing themselves  i should like audiences to approve as i wished them and believe there are other managers would like seriously speaking the same and yet in a general view unless on riotous doings garrick had a wondeful power of that kind over his hearers as they mostly held him invaluable

ryder  now the reader if not theatrical will better understand what i had to encounter on my arrival mr brown was the desperate manager of smockalley theater he had been in much esteem as an actor and a gentleman at bath and edinburgh  once attempted richard at drury lane but was barely permitted to finish the part  he had been in the army and was well known by most of the officers was a most pleasing wellbehaved companion was very indolent a second digges for extravagance was much in debt in england and in dublin and it was very immaterial to him if he failed as manager for he could not be poorer and though it might put a stop to more credit he was so well beloved they never pressed him to any distress for as they knew money he had not to lock him up was inflicting cruelty that could not answer any good purpose his copper captain was so much approved that it always brought money woodwards was thought very inerior nor could he keep that play on a par against brown with all the striking advantages his theater and company possessed  our theater was as before described and looked like a dungeon mrs abington who was then of no note had three or four years before that november played a few parts at bath when mr brown was manager also at richmond and some chance plays with theophilus cibber in the summer by permission of the lord chamberlain in the haymarket and had been engaged in      at drury lane at thirty shillings per week mrs abington had performed dorcas in the mock doctor etc but mr garrick not perceiving her merit or in fear that encouragement would be for claiming advancement of terms did not seem inclined to introduce that lady to advantage before the public  but my then intimate friend mrs abington formed a better opinion of her own deserts and thinking mr garrick intended injury instead of acting friendly she without ceremony suddenly eloped in december to her former manager and old acquaintance mr brown who had ired smockalley theater at a trifling rent of dr wilson he had wrote to her on his new acquired honors and assured her of the choice of every leading character whatever if she would quit her then indifferent drury lane engagement mrs abington had arrived about fourteen days before me and had acted with good and gracious eception but not having the london stamp of consequence was only spoke of as really a very clever woman my terms were settled at shares after  0l and a clear benefit with three weeks notice whenever i should choose to appoint my night mr garrick in his act of grace had left me what is termed a creephole out of the act of parliament for he had not desired me to make it a provincial attack in what was then termed my way by ridiculing barry mossop woodward etc being assured my eagerness to do it was sufficient but here he was mistaken for under so good a theatrical guide as himself i must have been a stupid hound indeed not to have learned instinctively a small portion of sagacity and he did not doubt but i should be led by natural error into an eagerness for the sport without my paying any attention to the being right or wrong but i had with a little maturity attained some experience and observation and on ruminating on what had and what might happen and not by any means approving my drury lane engagement nor relying too much on a great mans promise and doubting of terms to please me for the following year the seeds of rebellion were scattered in my heart and promised growth  it presently on reflection convinced me if i made the managers of crowstreet my enemies i was not only acting as a fool but also as a tool to accomplish mr garricks purposes which would throw me back entirely into his power as i should exclude myself by so doing from all resource in the capital theaters and though i felt and glowed as the alexander and the lear of portsmouth still my connections and attachments to the great world made me only relish country retreats by way of relaxation and as a man of consequence appertaining to the royal theaters not as a constant resident of a provincial community therefore if by attempting to appear with great eclat i quitted all hopes of the substance by preferring the shadow it would put an effectual bar to all my selfflattering hopes of future prosperity and by pleasing two or three audiences might create a bundle of bitter lasting and implacable enemies yet while i preserved my engagement for the winter of any consequence as a public character in either london or dublin it was security for a good profitable reception for the summer in the country either in england or ireland  it so happened i was the first who had explored from london into the depths of country playhouses in consequence the success was much more secure profitable and blazing than it would be in the present times as now every principal actor and actresss merit is as well understood and declaimed upon at the half moon or any other publichouse as if one of their own breed almost every theatrical star having deigned to shine in all the principal theaters in the three kingdoms  now in point of imitation mr foot was fair game and allowed to be so even by the good company he was then engaged with at crowstreet  my first appearance at smockalley that year was on friday january      0  much ado about nothing  benedick mr brown beatrice mrs abington  with never acted in this kingdom the diversions of the morning which i acted at drury lane the season before for my own benefit  foot brought out a piece against me which luckily failed  he acted lady pentweazle in the first act as i did in the second act he expected to do a great deal with his tragedy alamodo but not having any person to relieve him and trying the pasteboard figures it was with difficulty that part was suffered to finish though after that time it did great matters at the haymarket but never so well as when we acted it together  he the author and myself dressed as the tragedy actor was golcondas the hero the papers of next day gave the following account i suppose from mr brown the director  last night taste or the diversions of the morning was performed at the theater in smockalley the uncommon applause with which it was received spoke the merit of the principal performer and by particular desire will be performed again on monday next  to mr saunders printer sir i send you an extract of a letter i found in sycamorealley this morning which as it contains theatrical news may afford some entertainment the original you or any one may see at any time but as the cover was lost i knew not to whom to return it  i am your humble servant zach johnson jamesstreet    jan    0 i have detached footes pupil to help you to pull down those mighty kings god send he may have better success than the ostrich for that i am told never drew enough to pay its freight he is all i can spare at present a d  d clever fellow and will work their buff if he should fail he will be no loser for he is continued on my pay i beg you will be kind to him  these cursed burletta people i took from marybone have done nothing i wish the devil had them for gods sake let me know if you think they would go down in dublin and i will hustle them off to you immediately tell the poor people to keep up their spirits for they may depend upon every assistance that can be spared by etc     before the performance i received a message from mr barry with proposals for an engagement which it was impossible to accept  foot said d  n the pug what can he do against me he is as ignorant as a whores maid  all my numerous good friends in dublin were daily increasing yet they much feared it would be impossible for me to succeed to any thing like advantage with such an indifferent company and in so shabby a theater mr ryder standing confessedly a good actor but neither he nor mrs abington had then rose to their welldeserved estimation but my acquaintance assured me of their concurrence to support me  on the morning of my first performance a gentleman mr coats a subscriber very intimate and warm in the interest of crowstreet theater said he waited on me at the desire of his friends messrs barry and woodward to inform me mr barry in particular wished me every success and i might rest assured on my benefit night they would not oppose any strength that might tend to my prejudice  at the same time begged permission to hint and leave the consideration to my better judgment that it would be extremely irksome to mr barry who was hazarding a deep game and had much at stake to give the slightest opportunity for his enemies the partisans of mr sheridans remaining party to laugh at any little peculiarities of mr barrys becoming an object for public ridicule by my talent of mimicry on the stage mr barry desired him to say his theater should always be open to receive me on any future occasion and it might happen at some other time to suit both our interests for our mutual advantage and added my visitor i sincerely wish mr wilkinson you will take my advice for the friends of messrs barry and woodward are of the first consequence and the leading people in the kingdom they have now paid a high compliment to your abilities and though mr wilkinson i have undertaken this embassy i assure you it is not entirely on their accounts but chiefly on your own i wish well to both parties my friends well of crowstreet and i wish you well as a young man early in life under the patronage of my old acquaintance mr chaigneau great disturbances often happen from trivial causes and if your imitation of those gentlemen of crowstreet should occasion the exertion of their strength and should they oppose you where you now have one friend you will then have a thousand enemies and it may fall heavy on you whereas if you act as by my advice you will increase your connexions these sentiments coincided so nearly with my own they were not harsh or unpalatable to me  mr chaigneau was a subscriber to crowstreet theater and had expressed himself uneasy on the subject i rather suspect he was the instigator of this visit i promised mr coats to acquiesce gave my compliments to mr barry and that he might depend on his request being complied with the day after my appearance mr barry sent me a short letter of congratulation on the good reception he had heard i was favored with the night before and desired when my benefit was that i would instantly inform him and enclose ten box tickets also the high breathing mr mossop called wondering as we had both been at drury lane the winter before that i had not soon after my arrival been to see him and left a card of direction to henrycourt damestreet he affected great ease and gaiety neither of which sat easy though a proud wellbehaved man he hoped we should be on friendly terms while i continued in ireland he did not express one syllable relative either to mimicry or what i had done or intended to do at smockalley theater on his departure he rung the bell for a pen and ink and begged permission to leave a note of remembrance for six box tickets on my benefit night i occasionally  on mr mossop in henrycourt so we both kept up the appearance of civility but i was not such a novice not to well know like polly in the beggars opera that all this wheedling was not for nothing and had he asked me to have drank like miss peachum i should not have poured any of his strong waters down my throat  when the benefit came i sent the tickets  mr mossop called in a few days and presented me with three guineas for his debt of honor  mr barry i called on and sent to but never got admittance when my departure grew near i really was urgent and desired mr mossop to mention it to him  he did one night while he was acting lear he sent a message after the play to see me the next noon i had touched his pride if i had not do not think i should have touched the cash i did not omit being punctual  he met me with all those winning smiles and graces for which he had few competitors on or off the stage after many excuses and rejoicing at my success he presented me with five guineas and apologized for begging my acceptance of such a bagatelle  i assured him i was fully satisfied he asked me to dinner with all the appearance of sincerity but i think i can pronounce he was better pleased and more sincere when it came to the short phrase of i wish you a good day mr wilkinson as he had made the parade i certainly was right to expect to be paid for my ten box tickets  barry without doubt possessed the art of pleasing persuasion beyond any man i ever saw so thought the late mr pelham he was bewitching to hear and dangerous to believe  previous to this account i should have mentioned the second night of my performance was on monday january   the merchant of venice shylock mr brown portia mrs abington and diversions of the morning i believe there might be  0l in the house i took great pains  mr foot was my chief food and i was really and truly greatly approved  the duke and duchess of bedford honored smockalley with a command on monday january     my not interfering with the peculiarities of the gentlemen of crowstreet theater of which every one more or less had his share certainly made me friends and also rendered my time more easy and quiet i was in a constant round of invitations and good irish feating  while memory holds its seat in my stracted globe dublin will never be erased thence nor must i in gratitude and duty to my friends there and respect and pleasure to myself ever forget that my first guinea i dared fairly call my own was in dublin so that my fair and lucky days i attribute to the genial soil of old ireland my unlucky ones but too often i set down to my own account with that mixture of vexation which lifts the ingredients of the poisoned chalice to my own lips indeed those who are blessed with hereditary or chance affluence or sufficient independence where the post of honor is the private station are the truly blessed yet they are not exempt from ills but certainly bid the fairest to possess content and happiness i should like to try the experiment of independence and who would not  i acted besides the diversions of the morning that season    0 king lear zamti in the orphan of china repeatedly mrs amlet etc corinna mrs abington brass mr brown also myself lord chalkstone and the old man mrs abington the frenchman with great applause i cadwallader and that lady becky  mr footes benefit at crowstreet was on tuesday february   th i fixed mine at smockalley for friday february   th  mr footes play was love makes a man  clody mr woodward don choleric first time mr foot with his tragedy aamode  his boxes though fashionable were not extremely well supported the house on the whole did not amount to above one hundred pounds  the weather on my benefit night was dreadful indeed every combination of deep snow storm etc notwithstanding the theater overflowed from every part and almost as soon as the doors were opened even the orchestra was filled with gentlemen who got over the greatest part of the pit was laid into the boxes  at crowstreet they acted measure for measure  duke mr mossop lucio mr woodward isabella mrs fitzhenry with fortunatus above   0l  a miss mneale had a good concert and there were debates that night in the house of commons the receipt of my house was    l the greatest ever known at that time in that theater i mention this dreadful night as to weather though a good blowing wind to me not by any means to denote my consequence but to have the reader note what dublin on a night of tempest and streets covered with snow could do even at that time when inclination prompted as not my house only but each place i have mentioned was well attended though dublin was not by a full third i have reason to believe what it is now and a city growing not only more populous but what is as good increasing in trade opulence and splendor the eagerness for admittance was so extraordinary that another night was desired for my advantage and mr brown the manager complied on condition of sharing after  0l which i agreed to i had  0 l on thursday feb    in what is there termed outstanding tickets my benefit this year in point of profit besides the receipt being better was far superior to my first benefit there in      a very particular circumstance occasioned this which honor and justice calls on me to explain  the farce as by bill was high life below stairs before my benefit happened mr foot who of all men in the world ought not to have been offended found himself much hurt and wounded and so little master of himself that notwithstanding the unbounded liberties he had taken not only with the players but also often to the disturbance of the peace of private families as mr langford mr aprice duchess of kingston and various other persons might rise up at three different stage trap doors like richards ghosts to declare and swear he actually visited me in great wrath attended by mr larry kennedy and in pistol like manner protested if i dared take any more liberties on the stage in future with him he was determined the next day to call me to account but i pursued my plan and was obliged amongst other favors to mr foot that he was not observant but let me rest in quiet we often met drawn up at noon in different parties in the trinitycollege gardens as perfect strangers but never at any house of visiting if we had his talent of wit would have forced me to have felt the severity of his lash this surely is a striking instance how little we allow for the feelings of others and how soon in general we are touched galled mortified and enraged ourselves that mr foot should have felt himself hurt by my sallies of mimicry is not only strange but that he should be so weak as confess it still more extraordinary and made his visit to me a standing joke against him in the greenroom every comprehension should retain shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow   indeed the only instance of true good humor and pleasantry on such an occasion was afforded to me by my old acquaintance the late mr holland when he returned from his liverpool summer excursion to london early in september      preparatory to the opening of drury lane theater which was bordering on the close of the theatrical haymarket campaign he was in the boxes at the representation of tragedy alamode where he was a visible witness to my similitude of his voice manner and mode of expression he also perceived and felt the uncommon applause that honored my performance he was himself at the instant convinced of the likeness after the performance he supped at mr footes and the never forgotten chase price jokingly and provokingly asked holland how he admired himself in the muses looking glass that mr wilkinson had that night shown him holland with a laugh attended with the greatest apparent good humor and nonchalance declared that he was so well pleased with the specimen of himself that if his friend wilkinson could support a difficult character throughout equal to his performance that evening he should pronounce him a most excellent actor chase price foot and every one of the social board united in paying compliments to hollands proper and well timed opinion of the tea he had sipped just before at the theater and unexpectedly pronounced it not unpleasant but even palatable except that visit from mr foot with mr kennedy in dublin we had never spoke from his refusal to play for me at drury lane in the spring      which cruel refusal as i then judged it turned out a most fortunate though unforeseen occurrence to me  the managers of crowstreet had to boast of the excellent performance of their plays the novelty of woodwards pantomimes got up at a great expense footes pieces and the amazing attraction of mr macklin and his attention to lovealamode that season being its first representation in ireland  it was thus acted  sir callaghan obrallaghan mr barry sir archy msarcasm mr macklin sir theodore mr walker beau mordecai mr messink excellent in a superior degree squire groom mr woodward  with this army in dread array they neglected what i luckily thought of the then new entertaining little farce of high life below stairs brought out at drury lane so early as the month of october that season it was often acted before mrs abingtons departure and mine for ireland so we were both perfect in all the minutiae of the farce or what we term the stage business very material points in getting up a piece with correctness each character was within the compass of our little troop  one and all with very little attention and care to appear to advantage besides having the great addition of originality it was well drawn for the compass of middling abilities to comprehend and execute so that take it for all in all high life below stairs was a strong chance of good novelty and was attended with very little extraordinary expense which was another convenience to our manager as he was to pay for what i revived or produced for my nights entertainments  no comparison could be drawn to our disadvantage  another favorable point  mrs abington approved of my thought for that farce and she not only consented but seemed pleased with mrs kitty and though she had played several leading characters yet our receipts only ran from  0l to   l and at best  0l in general one night with the other she labored under great disadvantages and such as much repelled her endeavors to get admittance in the court of fame for though she was much approved yet as she had not then a london stamp and as mrs dancer was firmly established in dubher merit was much forgot when her guests were departed  my night being so well and fashionably attended not only by a crowded but a most brilliant pit and boxes and the heavy play of douglas but indifferently acted and must have appeared to great disadvantage when comparisons were drawn by an impartial review of the different theaters  however it wat set out not only with composure but really applause  we were perfect which will ever help indifferent acting and my age was very proper for the part of douglas they were pleased to applaud me in it and that dismal story gave double force and a relish to our farce my tea had long been sanctioned and i had credit for all my imitations had they not been so good as they were but they had not any opinion of our farce though manufactured in london as mr garrick seldom at first put his name to any piece till its success was signed therefore not having a good authors name they concluded had it merited any notice it would not have escaped the scrutinizing eye of mr woodward they did not consider or sufficiently know that with barrys and mossops tragedies woodwards comedies and pantomimes and macklins love alamode they had worked all their buffs and macklin had drilled even the managers well at rehearsals which altogether with footes pieces etc cut out such work for the season as racked their inventions to get finished and produced so my audience only expected a poor farce and as poorly acted which would be treated with the laugh of the pit and sneering contempt would finish the evenings entertainment  but half the first act had not passed before ooks of universal surprise and satisfaon overspread every countenance with unceasing satisfaction  mr ryders sir harry was charming  mr gates was a very conceited actor all his faults and oddities served but to heighten the extravagance of my lord duke  mr heatons phillip as well as such a part could be done and he was a very good actor in all the dry clowns clodpoles etc  miss phillips aunt to the present mrs jordan our heroine who was also of a conceited turn though sensible and well educated made the part of lady bab better than any other actress i ever saw attempt it  myself from observation and youth must have been stupid indeed not to have been a very good jemmy the country boy and as the great personage always appears last in triumphal entries and processions  so in kitty mrs abington advanced the whole circle were in surprise and rapture each asking the other how such a treasure could have possibly been in dublin and in almost a state of obscurity such a jewel was invaluable and their own tastes and judgments they feared would justly be called in question if this daughter of thalia was not immediately taken by the hand and distinguished as her certain and striking merit demanded  the same farce was repeated the week following with the orphan of china feb    zamti mr wilkinson which i had before acted and had been well received in the character  the crowstreet managers advertised against it that they had dresses preparing in london which were to be sent over and intimating mr murphy the author would follow to see it rehearsed to which mr brown replied in the following paragraph  the orphan of china being a tragedy not any way difficult or mysterious to those who do not require to be parroted in their parts we can assure the public that it is now in perfect readiness and will be performed this evening at the theater in smockalley without the assistance of the author for as plays are sometimes revived long after the writers decease what would become of them in a theater where it is found essentially necessary for the poet to attend the latter rehearsals and as to the dresses neither the chinese or tartar are absolutely unknown in ireland therefore it is hoped it will not be objected as a fault that we have not gone to london either for design or materials  mandane was acted by miss ibbott  a lady of merit in speaking blank verse there was   0l in the house the second night of high life and it went off if possible with more eclat than on the first representation and abington resounded in all parts of the theater i remember the second night of high life mrs abington said to me with great propriety good god mr wilkinson what could provoke you to blunder so why should you think of a tragedy when you had reason to expect so fine a house as the company are not equal to the performance certainly her being so noticed in kitty would in speculation have been materially bettered with that lady in a leading character in comedy the house would have felt much injured and diminished in profit had half price been taken but it neither was then nor ever since has been the custom to take under full price in dublin  i had a strong party made again by my friends which with mrs abingtons name settled the business to my advantage but i told her my reason for taking a tragedy was solely that its gravity might aid and give spirit when the new farce came on the truth was i wanted to entertain myself with acting mr garricks part of the chinese zamti in which i was so fortunate as actually to please beyond mediocrity though dressed in an old red damask bed gown which was what we termed the stock bed gown for brabantio and many other parts and had for time immemorial been of that venerable use and bore the marks of many years faithful servitude  i was certainly lucky in my two nights answering with such swimming success and more fortunate still when i inform the reader twentyfour hours after would have given the last night a severe blow and greatly prejudiced it for the next day not only an alarm was received but several exprees arrived that thurot had actually landed at carrickfergus this of course caused the army to march by beat of drum instantly to give immediate assistance and repel the invaders and it naturally occasioned a general panic and confusion and was the topic of universal conversation throughout the city of dublin even the abington that day was not mentioned  it quickly subsided and mons thurot made an unfortunate retreat as stands on wellknown record  high life below stairs was perpetually acted and with neverfailing success  in ten days after its being performed abingtons cap was so much the taste with the ladies of fashion and ton that there was not a milliners shopwindow great or small but was adorned with it and in large letters abington appeared to attract the passers by this abingtonrage woodward endeavored to suppress by ridicule not here fit to be described but all to little or rather to no purpose for her reputation as an actress daily increased though on the remote ground of an unfashionable illsupported theater  i have neglected to mention the play of barbarossa at crowstreet on monday january     achmet mr mossop barbarossa mr sowden and zaphira mrs fitzhenry  after which was performed in two acts a new comedy called the minor  the principal characters by mr woodward mr jefferson mr sowden mr vernon mr walker miss white and mr foot which piece had during mr footes whole residence been constantly puffed in the papers and great things were expected from it as he himself had been acting and repeating all the best strokes at every table wherever he was invited or on whatever parties he was engaged his connexions were fashionable and extensive and this long conversation of the minor promised great matters  the house was full it was then only produced as a little comedy of two acts  smirk the auctioneer was not then inserted though he had talked much about it and told many stories of mr langford whom he aimed the character at  dr squintums whitfieldian epilogue was not wrote  the other scenes were much the same as when produced at the haymarket the summer following  nor was there the now printed introduction  shift mr foot did me the honor to write as a satire on me which part he acted so as to convey to the audience that wilkinson was the person whom he describes thus speaking as shift shift you must know then that fortune which frequently delights to raise the noblest structures from the simplest foundations who from a tailor made a pope from a ginshop an empress and many a prime minister from nothing at all has thought fit to raise me to my present height from the humble employment of light your honor a link boy   sir william wealthy a pleasant fellow  who were your parents   shift i was produced sir by a left handed marriage in the language of the newspapers between an illustrious lamplighter and an eminent itinerant cat and dog butcher  cats meat and dogs meat hearts liver lights or a good sheeps heart  i dare say you have heard my mother sir  but as to this happy pair i owe little besides my being i shall drop them where they dropped me  in the streets my first knowledge of the world i owe to a school which has produced many a great man the avenues of the playhouse there sir leaning on my extinguished link i learned dexterity from pickpockets connivance from constables politics and fashions from footmen and the art of making and breaking a promise from their masters here sirrah light me across the kennel  i hope your honor will remember poor jack  you ragged rascal i have no halfpence  i will pay you the next time i see you  but lackaday sir that next time i saw as seldom as his tradesmen   sir william very well   shift to these accomplishments from without the theater i must add one that i obtained within   sir william how did you gain admittance there   shift my merit sir that like my link threw a radiance round me i moved the compassion of one of the performers a whimsical man he took me into his service  my master was remarkably happy in an art which however disesteemed at present is by tully reckoned among the perfections of an orator  mimicry   sir william why you are deeply read mr shift   shift a smattering  but as i was saying sir nothing came amiss to my master bipeds or quadrupeds rationals or animals from the clamor of the bar to the cackle of the barndoor all were objects of his imitations and my attention in a word sir for two whole years under this learned professor i studied and starved impoverished mv body and pampered my mind till thinking myself pretty near equal to my master i made him one of his own bows and set up for myself     all this part went off very well as they soon felt the joke laughed and applauded nor did i dislike it myself quite the contrary for had i been really as described it was not my fault i could not have helped it his transfers scene went off but very so so and mrs cole by mr woodward very bad indeed for though great entertainment was expected from him and he was dressed with the utmost pains and study an article to which he paid much attention and consideration yet his performance completely d  d the farce he could not but with the utmost difficulty obtain permission to finish the part it gave great disgust he lolled out his tongue and played some tricks to help it which only added to its damnation  mr woodward having mrs cole only to act made the dressing of that beldam much more complete than any other actor could do who had shift and the other parts to equip and then dress again and it had that advantage on his first entrance but all favor soon vanished for when mrs cole complained of her rheumatism his manner was thought indecent by the gentlemen and all the ladies seemed offended with the character itself mr foot gave it out for some future evening with considerable alterations but it was not attempted again nor did he play i believe after his benefit feb    he acted on shares and was so surrounded with mr macklin and the other performers of strength that the expedition was by no means profitable to him the locality of the piece was one reason that caused its unhappy fate and another was it had not the london fashion so the minor was turned out destitute of friends and fortune  that piece was then condemned in dublin though supported by great actors but in a few months after in london raised its head and did wonders  from dear dublin and good friends i took my farewell early in march and left mrs abington going on in full career to reach the pinnacle where she has many years sat smiling and been looked at and admired with sincere pleasure and respect by the first persons in both the kingdoms at that juncture he had many disadvantages to struggle with such as the encountering barrys woodwards mossops fitzhenrys and dancers benefit nights at crowstreet which summonses the dublin world obeyed and smockalley which had sometimes by luck her attractions and chance benefits etc dragged on per force but on the ides of march was on the verge of a certain downfall  plays were thus acted then in crowstreet the orphan  castalio mr barry chamont mr mossop polydore mr dexter monimia mrs dancer an al the other characters well dressed and supported as may be supposed by referring to the list of the company with the advantage of new scenery a new and elegant theater etc   all for love  marc antony mr barry dolabella mr jefferson ventidius mr mossop octavia mrs dancer cleopatra mrs fitzhenry  alexander the great cast in the same manner  comedies with woodward macklin mrs kennedy vernon etc with the persons just mentioned so that take it all together it was equal to any company i ever saw in london and much better than i have frequently seen there though the old house was sinking rapidly had not mrs abington by her strength of arm upheld it yet it was indeed restored to its ancient dignity and family honors for one joyful happy night of ecstacy and that was no less than on the enjoyment of the abington at what might truly be called her own night  a strange play for mrs abington to choose it was a new way to pay old debts march    but she made amends by other performances that evening on which occasion the old the young the gay all bowed at her shrine as the temple of thalia such ascendancy had she thus quickly acquired over the public opinion  this attachment toward the latter end of the season did not cease with the million for it is true to attend the falling theater was grown a great bore yet still languishing for abington and wishing to see her on a better cultivated and good promising soil for her merit to be nourished and matured by a perpetual sunshine a party of leading persons proposed her acting a few nights at crowstreet before the theatrical campaign closed gave assurance of patronage on her nights of performance and on a clear night being promised and fixed for mrs abington in return for her support to the managers nights she complied with their desire  mrs abington had not any occasion to request this change of place or accumulation of honors as they were not owing to solicitation on her part but the persons of distinction were stimulated to this desire by their eagerness to satisfy themselves by seeing the new favorite transplanted amidst the gaudy flowers of crowstreet where they did not doubt but she would soon gain a state of distinction whenever the artists of theatrical florists met to signalize distinguish and decide the claims to the prizes when they scrutinized on the playhouse auriculas and the gaudy tulips  all that was contracted for by the persons of quality for the managers and mrs abington was i believe strictly abided by faithfully executed and answered to the infinite satisfaction of all parties the persons of lead and fashion were entertained and paid for their purchase of choice not compulsion the managers got money  mrs abington had a surprising and magnificent audience at her benefit  so i can guess they were all pleased  not that i would venture to pronounce all were entirely satisfied for there never can be great promotion at the real court or behind the theatrical curtain but it must and will affect and hurt the minds of those concerned a lord disappointed of his court expectation seldom i will not say never rejoices at the preference given to another so the actor or actress buoyed up with the pleasing tide of success must be alarmed when he or she not only heas but feels the treading of the kibe by a courtier or newraised favorite  it not only is galling but more is really to be said for it than is always allowed that merit should be cherished and raise its head is a first principle and duty from the audience and the manager but when considered as a lessening of pride and income to another it is a serious matter to the soul so piqued nor are any minds so soon hurt on the least frivolous occasions as those of the theater and sometimes it happens a phenomenon really starts up  mrs jordan four years ago only playing at york at  l   s  d per week was thought really very clever by london performers who saw her there but all said it would not do among them yet by great luck great good fortune indeed and to be for an hundred years at least remembered i theatrical annals she in two years afterward made even the london managers dread her frown her noncompliance her elopement her toothache or her any phantom of horror which she has threatened them with to the terror of tragedy itself and made them comply with the most exorbitant terms  a happy lot indeed a happy rise  i hope it will last her life and with care make her career successful as it has so providentially and wonderfully begun  mrs jordan is certainly the lucky child of fortune lulled caressed and nursed in the lap of nature she is undoubtedly the reigning thalia of the age    0 and deservedly so and to her comic talents archness whim and fancy i submissively bow and also acknowledge her humanity and goodness to her late parent  but am compelled as mr manager to declare like mr foot in his devil upon two sticks as greatness knows itself that mrs jordan at making a bargain is too many for the cunningest devil of us all  speaking of mrs abingtons merit in the comic line occasioned my introducing mrs jordans name at the same time and as i cannot yet quit mrs abingtons situation whom i left at her great benefit in dublin it may be easily supposed from her being so happily transplanted that she derived many advantages from playing with mr woodward mr macklin and other regulars nor was mr woodward a loser but a gainer by the acquisition to his stage as mrs abington rebounded the ball equal to the force with which woodward struck it  but now another irksome matter arose in consequence of her success where our passions or partialities are predominant it is not always reason can be listened to or obeyed it was very apparent from motives of policy and sound judgment that mrs abington should be engaged on the most eligible terms otherwise they could not hope such a rising actress would article to this woodward did not hesitate as it assisted his comedies and an agreement was settled for the following winter but when it is considered mrs dancer then played all the principal characters in comedy as well as in tragedy it made the sea of crowstreet troubled the waves that looked calm turned to rough breakers and the open sea to rise and threaten a storm for when those ladies acted in the same plays as in the ladys last stake mrs dancer played mrs conquest mrs abington miss notable by the bye mrs jordan why have you neglected miss notable  in love for love angelica mrs dancer miss prue mrs abington and many other plays where they were often mutually concerned and sometimes where mrs abington was the rival fine lady which some plays admit where the parts are of equal consequence miss notable and miss prue from the archness and excellent acting of mrs abington seemed to have the decision at the winning post for fame but i must observe those comic characters will ever when well supported obtain the loud applause however well acted mrs conquest and angelica may be by any actresses whatever as the hoydens are so well caculated for what we term stage effect  this division of hands from the upper and lower part of the house it was not likely mrs dancer as queen of the theater could relish or gulp down by any means to make the abington pleasing or agreeable this proved and grew offensive to mr barry as he was then as passionate an inamorato as ever youthful poet fancied when he loved and would have thrown immediate bars to the engagement with mrs abington and greatly impeded her rapid good fortune had not a sudden and important matter of astonishment at that time started up to the amazement of every facuty of eyes ears etc for barry and woodward lulled in their long wished for security became the dupes of their own arts and made the wandering prodigal woodward begin seriously to reflect and severely repent his foolish conduct in leaving his enviable situation in london and above all the horror of losing what he had saved with so much care this dreadful alarm was no less than the certainty of a report being confirmed as real which at first they treated as unlikely vague and impossible but it proved strictly true that mr mossop from the encouragement and instigation of all his friends and patronized by the countess of brandon of powerful sway with many leaders of fashion had certainly taken smockalley theater on a long lease purposing many expensive and gaudy alterations etc to oppose crowstreet in the month of october the ensuing season barry and woodward to prevent if possible this dreadful undertaking made him liberal offers nay even humbled themselves before him to entreat mossop to name his own terms all this only increased his pride and he surned at every kindness or emolument submitted to his acceptance and consideration they even offered him one thousand pounds english and two benefits whenever he chose to take them but all would not o though they certainly would have been losers by his acceptance but their situation was desperate therefore all they could do was right if by any means they could have effectually prevented such an opposition mossops pride and obstinacy was however bent on monarchy and so he was the cause of mutual ruin but he at last sfred in a peculiar degree of punishment  he had saved a decent fortune and by the absence of barry could have commanded a first station in london at either theater whenever he peased or wished a change from dublin but his pride was predominant over reason so he prostrted fame fortune health and peace of mind headlng at the shrine of vanity where sycophants haied him with songs of triumph in full chorus but his feal days were few and not to be end  to lok over this it seems as if i meant to rite a is y f the irish stage for which i am  my only reason for  here is to make it  of y narrative what was the  for my chanen of situation in the  my repeated visits to dublin in  gelema  will be better  ought into a little   parry a wodrd n  ct of hostity being  from  glad to secure mrs abington and i do suppose however she might fear foul play from mr barry and mrs dancer thought woodward to act with was a great point much better than being at mossops new theater without such a partner to support her mossop being out of her walk and woodward the comedian she therefore depended on his interest and candor for her consequence  the comic line mrs fitzhenry was also seured and by so doing they looked upon mr mossop not so formidable as they knew the situaion of london had no tragedy woman to spare and mossops whole forte was there only mossop had thought himself certain of mrs fitzhenry  she had not expressed herself happy or contented th mrs dancers power which sometimes occa oned little heart burnings and discontents whereas with mossop she might have been sole empress  hwever barry seeing the danger turned very mplying and enlarging her terms with other uceurs she thought it wiser to stay with barry and observe mossops success for a year and then dge how far it would be prudent to trust her feet n the slippery ways of smockalley mossop snuffed the air and breathed hard at mrs fitzenrys preferring barry but hearing how perexed mrs bellamys finances were and in such ranged state that she could not with sfet make her public appearance in london though if he could seduce her over to dublin for the winter his fortune would be made in a hurry though a any price he therefore articled to give her n less than one thousand pounds and two benefits with a charte blanch to act only what she please to fix on  mrs bellamy had performed juliet with mr garrick in london on its first great run and supported a principal line of characters in both the london theaters her benefits were brilliant so she had fashion and name with the london currency to insure her reception and had been in dublin when mr sheridan was manager where mr garrick acted at the same time and was esteemed their first actress was looked at as a charmin elegant young woman and was the univers toast in ireland      her character was also a that juncture respectable and she was received as a fashionable gentlewoman in several of the first families there all these points considered certainly afforded mossop sufficient grounds to entertain great promise of success yet this noble fancied structure in one night fell to the ground and lay as neglected rubbish unless occasionally making use of her best materials but as to being a substantial support to the theater it was merely visionary and not to be relied on for real services  mossop as a manager made his first appearance in pierre in venice preserved in november    0 belvidera mrs bellamy being the first night of her performing expectation was so great that the house filled as fast as the people could thrust in with or without paying on speaking her first line behind the scenes   lead me ye virgins lead me to that kind voice t struck the ears of the audience as uncouth and unmusical yet she was received as was prepared and determined by all who were her o mr mossops friends and the public at large with repeated plaudits on her entree but the roses were fld the young the once lovely bellamy was turned haggard and her eyes that used to charm all hearts appeared sunk large hollow and ghastly  o time time thy glass should be often consulted for before the short first scene had elapsed disappointment chagrin and pity sat on every eye and countenance  mrs bellamy had left dublin when in her zenith in may      and did not revisit it till that november    0 mossops friends were void of humanity when they thought of his danger and she that was to do all instead of that they judged would do more injury than service yet she was unavoidably in justice by article to be paid one thousand pounds and to have two benefits by the end of the third act they were all like bbadl planet struck the other two acts hobbld through mossop was cut to the heart and never played pierre one of his best parts so indfferently as on that night the curtain dropped and por bellamy never after drew a single house thre and by her mode of boundless extravagant living she got so deep in debt that she was often arrested when she was to play and the adience sometimes obliged to be dismissed indeed in her memoirs she mentions her being arrested there herself which added to her living publicly with mr digges though at the same time foolshly wishing it to be understood that she was wie to mr calcraft altogether unk her into universal contempt and insignificance she left dublin without a single friend to regret her loss wht a change from the days of her youth and as an actress of note her name ever more ranked in any theater nor did she ever again rise in public estimation  cardinal wolseys remarks may be applied equally as an observation to either sex where he speaks thus  such is the sate of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and  when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening  nips his root and then he falls as i do   they might serve also for mossop who oftn atd that part and actually died almost perishing r want at chelsea without common necessary food or clothing and was carried to his place f lst without leaving the means of payment fr his burial rites  alas poor mossop and bellamy may you ret in peace and prove an awful useful lesson which shows that their own errors and not the rod of god brought on their mieries and dreadful end mossop on his deathbed might truly speak as the cardinal and surely wolsey could not have been prouder and that pride he never lost but with hs last breath   i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders these many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my highblown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must for ever hide me thus poor bellamy who once lolled in her chair and rolled in her chariot and all the vanities of the world ended her days in a prison  mr mossop and mrs bellamy once followed and admired fell equal victims to the griping and of penury without one friendly hand to close their eye is indeed a clergyman of chelsea at his own expense paid for his poor coffin and dly performed his funeral rites  this conve a lesson to myself and every one that  iend in need money is the truest and prevents a deertion of those we term such for while there is any thing in hand to give there will always be some kind attendant ready to take but distress like lending money is too often the loss of friends and the triumph and contempt of enemies who had envied the prosperity even though that prosperity had bestowed favors on teir own wants there i am grieved to observe o the disgrace of human feelings such hardened inds as will exultingly triumph over the miseries of those from whom they have been even cherished d supported and may well make the unfortunate bitterly reflect like jane shore that  those who blessed now curse me to my face   also like what lear expresses  is it not as this mouth should tear this hand for lifting food to it and surely to aggravate the distressed and destitute is little better than a knave or villains office  certainly had i been provident of what i had accumulated it would have proved by this time like a tontine a decent independent income yet i have not been singular as the wise and truly cautious careful woodward was guilty of the same imprudence and spoke his public recantation as the prodigal returned  the late anecdotes relative to the once glittering and splendid appearance of the great and proud mossop and the unthinking pompous vain and foolish bellamy have occasioned in my reverie the recollection of a fatal fair one who in her time of luxury and affluence must be to this day still well remembered by many i mean the greatly admired followed and once celebrated lucy cooper and few if any are exempt from woe her faults and frailties were so numberless that the strictly rigorous armed with virtuous austerity would perhaps wish such a wretch as they will disdainfully term that poor unfortunate to be wiped from the annals of remembrance and not allow any trait to be retained but let such very good persons bless god for their uncommon lot of superabundant goodss relax a little from their severity return thanks for their heavenlike superiority and permit a drop of pity to fall as a tribute to that late forlorn well known character  lucy cooper from the year      till      was as great a toast as can be remembered in the court of comus and she herself was the first bacchant of the age her company when in the gay circle she presided at the social board absolutely gave inspiration to each flowing soul as in point of good sense combined with wit and humor if she did not surpass she was certainly equal as a bon vivant to any person of either sex that i ever remember her faults it is true were numberless and i fear weigh heavy in the sale but truth can more than a little balance and counterpoise the other side with generosity friendship feeling attended by boundless charity and humanity surely such qualities will more than a little prendrate with the truly religious good mind and considerate disposition i have often regretted for her miseries for when subsistence had fed and her charns for mankind had satiated her good becae nglected and forgotten as it had never been i was grieved when she was relieved by death that she was not permitted to linger a little longer hre on earth in her abode of sorrow penance petece and ffction merely to have gratified my own selflove and to have proved my true regard and esteem for her real worth lucy cooper was in the early part of her life elegantly provided for by the late sir orlando bridgeman whose settlement she in a pet threw into the fire indeed had that not been the case there is too much reason to suggest it would soon have had some fatal and unthinking finish as prudence was not in lucys catalogue of perfections and never visited her bedside until it was too late to help her on this side the grave little histories are introduced even in works of sterling merit  therefre here need not apolose for this short introduction relative to the elegant though not the beautiful lucy cooper  as the pen of nature will speak for itlf fr re forcibly and superior to that of art i wll uest permission to insert one or two lettes om that frail oject  they cannot oend the stest pruser but will be a lsson to those at snt probaly deviating from rectitude and nging in it dbauhery and xtravagance  also assrd satisfaction to those who are still iving and reember that the sid lucy coope ho was one the livly the sitd and in any  and   letter i to tate wilkinson esquire this morning at ten i had the pleasure of your letter and am happy to find my dear friend tate has still a thought to bestow on such an unfortunate being as lucy cooper not one except yourself of all my acquaintance has sent near me since i have been here which is upwards of five months now i know you are in town i shall think every day an age until i see you therefore if you do not come soon i shall think you only meant your letter to mortify me as bad as this place is i can get you something that you will like for dinner therefore hope when you do come you will oblige me with as much of your company as is convenient to yourself i cannot entertain you with india bonds as i once did and to hear my distresses i flatter myself will be disagreeable to my good friend tate so for that day i will set aside all reflection and only think how i can make such a place as this agreeable to one who i shall ever retain the greatest sense of gratitude and sincere friendship for  dear snub yours lucy cooper ps do not make any ceremony  you will be sure to find me at home   kings bench jan         from her misery in the kings bench prison after surmounting innumerable difficulties not to be described and those difficulties accompanied with variety of wretchedness by the assistance of a very few remaining friends she was released but they soon in general deserted her and many not without upbraidings  o summer friendship whose flattering leaves that shadowed us in our prosperity with the least gust drop off in the autumn of adversity  the following year    0 this afflicted unfortunate one was immersed if possible in a more deplorable situation surrounded by illness woe and calamity as the following will fully ascertain and i prophecy will give a twinge to the soul of sensibility  letter ii to tate wilkinson esquire some few days ago i heard my dear friend was in town and have much wondered at my not seeing you  sure i have not lost your friendship which always made me happy i know your goodness of heart too well to suppose it is because i am distressed  oh dear tate god only knows what i have suffered for this last month past confined to my bed without any one to assist me every thing even to my bed gown gone to support life which i am afraid is of short duration in short my mind is as much disordered as my body for it is hard when i think how much i have had it in my power to be so reduced as i am i hope i shall see you before you leave town  i am sure the sight of you will enliven me for as bad as i am at this time i think i can find strength to laugh a little bit with you   i am your much obliged humble servant l cooper bowstreet jan  0    0  i trust the wise disposer of our brittle clay tenements permitted in her last moments a forgiving angel to speak peace to her sad heart and that she by the remission of sin has partook of that bliss raciously promised to the sinner that gives joy in eaven over ninety and nine by true repentance  calistas lines may ere without impropriety be uoted as her epitaph had she a tomb stone  that fatal form which drew on thy undoing fasting and tears and hardships did destroy nor light nor food nor comfort did you know nor ought that could continue hated life thus when we  meagre wn and changd stretchd at thy  and dying in thy cave let each good mind relent and sighing say at  thy  waed thy  away at length twas time thy punishment should cease rest then poor suffring wretch and be at peace   as one grave story and reflection leads the mind to another and as moralizing is not to me very habitual i will hasten from the subject mount my hobby and once again chat on stage matters  i perceive that being under the necessity of mentioning many excellent performers it is very tiresome in so many pages to read the words much applause great applause much approbation acclamations shouts with a long list of etceteras i have therefore dropped my pen and looked into many good authors and morningpapers for more various means of expression so as to make it more palatable if possible to the reader but i fnd in all theatrical books and papers those constant repetitions with this difference many of those stage critiques have judgment and genius of which i lament my being so destitute so kind reader take the will for the deed and though i have made the remark i find my fingers tingle to be again at some monstrous applause astonishing charming delightful or amazing performer i will bein again with the great man wilkinson as the hero of the book and remark though i troubled the reader with my dublin account till some time in mr mossops first winter season as manager in     yet i must rcur to myself when i was tepping into the packet for holyhead early in march    0 previous to the occurrences menioned most part happening after    0 and left the following note a few days before for williamsons universal advertiser and mr george falkners dublin journal  mr wilkinsons speedy call to london preents his waiting on the nobility and gentry to eturn them his acknowledgments for the signal arks of favor and approbation with which they ave honored his attempts to please he can ut in this manner beg they will accept of them oping that with more experience he may herefter be able to entertain them in a manner more qual to the elegance of their taste  i got to london with my pockets well lined my worthy mother was as rejoiced to see me as if i had returned from the perils of an east india voyage i soon went to court mr garricks court paid my homage to my patron and returned him his twenty guineas which i soon repented of and do honestly declare it is the only act like a fraud i ever could have pardoned in myself but i wish i had not paid him so hastily as i afterward had a full right to have retained it as my own  he seemed really glad to see me and wished me joy a thousand times  on the saturday of the second week after i had announced my return from my granted furlough i of course was ready to mount guard had my general ordered me to do so i had his own preared article in force and was not a deserter but honorably returned before my full leave of abence had expired on my bow to the treasurer emanding my enormous salary and asking for ly one week as due after being two in town to y astonishment he refused my pittance i urged y article saw mr garrick and spoke to him on he business  he said he had more than paid my salary in permitting me to visit ireland and again refused payment as in      i found altercation would not answer any purpose and that it was in vain to persist though in fact it was in lain english a cheating low mean trick unwory not only mr garrick in his elevated situation ut must be judged ungenerous mean and disonest between man and man unblessed with his bilities genius and fortune but where avarice s the groundwork of the mind it will stoop beeath itself to gratify selflove  but little rogues must suffer fate that great ones may enjoy their state for this fixed refusal of mr garricks there could be no remedy as law would be a  experiment for a young actor which if i had hastily attempted he would have prevented my immediate compliance with the article but then when enraged he would have obliged me to appear in a menial station or forfeited all the salary so that i must have lost my periodical payment still or have paid severely indeed for it by working as his negroe slave till the end of may and that he well knew good god was it worth his while to expose such narrow principles and sacrifice all his avowed regard for such a patry sum  as to my assertions i suppose his books are in preservation and curiosity might be satisfied  after being deprived of my salary i met mr garrick in covent garden not having admittance in his house he being always denied and at the theater he hardly knew me i had behaved so ill by asking for my salary to ruin him poor man when i told him that i had spoke to the prompter to know when my benefitnight was to be fixed but had received no answer he stood gazing and like lady pentweazle called up a look not with one eye only but with two piercers meaning to intimidate me by his dignity which might have had the desired effect two years before that encounter but not then at last he said he was astonished at the unexpected absurdity as well as the unreasonableness of the request and that the business of the theater was so arranged it could not be but to cut short all intercourse on the subject he concluded with saying he would not comply with it and here i must observe was injustice merely for fear i should add to the little stock i had secured much against his wishes and he hoped by my being idle in london and not receiving y salary i should make it fly as quickly as a lor does his money on a return from a voyage and then be more within the falcons reach now my benefit was very material to me as i knew i should be favored with a very good one though in may and duty to myself made me serious with him i therefore boldly told him that i should make my loss of salary and benefit one business in a court o justice and charge my benefit at  00l which added to the breach of article would not be less than two or three hundred more and would be a good compensation and added with a bow and a smile i could not wish for a better banker to to draw upon  what i spoke was truth he then hummd and hawd and said why really now why tate why now you are d  d ridiculous and he walked me into varneys the housekeepers room at the theater and sent for cross mr lacey was also there and they settled my benefit for saturday the  d of may and desired mr fox whom mr lacey said he had a great regard for might bring in tickets to such a sum as he specified  i agreed to the request the mr fox i mention lives in bowstreet and i have often from that time to this at different periods been obliged to him and ever found him kind and attentive to serve me and i have heard mr fox who was then a young stage candidate declare that he was lucky with his tickets and pleased with mr laceys desire and allotment  the play i fixed on was the distressed mother orestes mr wilkinson hermione mrs yates andromache by a gentlewoman with the prologue to the author lady pentweazle and the upholsterer  the same reasons as in dublin for not giving my imitations proved that the like policy was necessary to be still preserved at least for that year of my adventures and theatrical exploits in london  the gentlewoman i advertised for her first appearance in andromache was no other than the mrs wier whom i have mentioned early in this multifarious history where i met luckily or unluckily as the fates will determine with that good old gentleman mr baker manager of the york company in october       if the reader will honor me with the remembrance so long back of what i fear seems not only trifling but tiresome he will recollect that i mentioned mrs wier being at that time mistress of a milliners shop near pall mall where i saw mrs roach who boldly and with the spirit of an amazon went down to york to supply mrs dancers lady townly indiana etc thinking like kecksy  who is afraid  this mrs wier had been made mistress of an ample wellfurnished milliners shop by sir francis delaval and properly supplied with all sorts of geer for gentlewomen and eke also for gentlemen mrs wiers shop by no means answered though sir francis delaval had not spared any expense or recommendation within his power to render it lucrative  i am bound to speak of this sir francis delaval with reverence and regard not only for his own partiality and friendship but for the favors i have been formerly honored with by the whole family and obligations of the most pleasing kind not only at sir franciss house then bordering on soho square but at seaton delaval a few miles from newcastle but of that family of whom i speak so warmly none remains within my knowledge but lord and lady delaval whom i have had the honor of seeing frequently at sir franciss there was no difference in sir franciss behavior whether i saw him in london or farther remote for many gentlemen wear different faces on seeing an actor in london and seeing him in the country  now the milliners shop mentioned under the patronage of sir francis not answering in all particulars and the knight being determined his gentlemans gentlewoman should be quite the thing took a house for her in suffolkstreet in the strand and furnished it as a reception for boarders that mrs wier might obtain a livelihood at that house i had the pleasure of often seeing a very sensible agreeable wellbred lady who occupied the first floor then mrs ford but after that she had the honor to be mrs colman but the foe or friend of mankind call him which we will mr death did not choose to see such an agreeable and tempting companion out of his clutches but sneeringly and enviously threw his dart and with one stroke levelled a fair one lamented by all who knew her  but even this lodginghouse did not altogether answer for mrs wier or succeed to her expectations in the round of a twelvemonths vicissitude she had ever been fond of plays and on my return from ireland seriously requested she might have a stagetrial on my benefit night this i consented to and she was to be the andromache in the distressed mother on that being settled i in three or four days after received a note from sir francis desiring to see me on particular business in sohosquare on the afternoon i called it so happened that mr foot was there with whom i had been on distant terms ever since our breach in march       this visit was almost immediately after dinner  sir francis expecting me had desired i might be shown into another room knowing his friend footes and my antipathy he instantly came and laughingly told me that the business of his note was to inform me he had collected a large party for my benefit adding he had a request to make but must be under the necessity of deferring it till the next day for says he your old friend foot is in the dining room and from your late disagreement i judge it will not be agreeable to either as the meeting will be awkward adding he did not know how to act unless wilkinson you will let me take you by the hand as my particular friend and as a supposed stranger i like peter paragraph by way of reply said i culd not resist the proposed honor of being intduced as sir francis delavals particular riend besides i added mr foot had of all sons in the world the least right to be angry with me for mimicry and indeed he had been by e interestedly the obliged person and mr  te had himself declared on drury lane stage that any imitations of himself by mr wilkinson were at the service of the public  so under the sanction of being sir franciss particular guest i entered the room where foot was and several other gentlemen foot seemed hurt at first but after the introduction as proposed he behaved with great politeness  as the circling glass went round mr foot grew more cordial and cheerful and began speaking of tables in the first style of elegance in ireland and scotland  that several noblemens houses in both places were supported with every luxury that a london table could furnish for if london had the superiority in some particular articles the other places had in greater perfection what london could not so easily purchase which made the equality of good things more upon a level than the english would readily admit but to which sir francis would not assent and as a trait i have before observed in footes character when his real best friend sir francis delaval left the room where there were not less than eight or ten persons each of whom he knew would relate again what he said he burst out into a loud laugh and turning to me said wilkinson did you ever hear such a hound giving his sentiments on good tables and living  since my return from ireland added foot i have had the mortification to dine here six times and each day a d  d large loin of pork on the table which he calls a dinner  by g  d i will not dine here again these three months for i suppose he means to run his loin of pork against the beggars opera  which had been acted a great number of nights at covent garden mr beard being macheath miss brent the polly  it was equal to the first run when it came out at lincolnsinnfields theater       when a wit said that the beggars opera made rich gay and gay rich   that piece also occasioned a material event his grace the duke of bolton was irresistibly enslaved by the siren polly miss fenton but neither persuasion riches nor settlement could relax or soften the heart of the fair one in short nothing less could purchase her hand and heart than the sharing his honors as the duchess of bolton  to the which he assented and never had cause to repent as she filled every duty of that high station with becoming dignity  as a duchess wife and mother admired by all she enjoyed her unfaded laurels for many years as the bolton family can testify  as to mr footes remark on the loin of pork it might be partly true for though sir francis was liberal and extravagant in many points nicety of food was the last thing he ever thought of if there was but plenty he never cared for the quality or the luxuries of a table  and had he actually heard foot he would only have laughed at him and with him he knew his foibles and admired all footes sallies of humor that so often set the table on a roar where be his gibes now his flashes of merriment not one now to mock his own grinning alas poor foot but sir francis was so far even with foot that he enjoyed a stroke against him to the full as much as any other person  he would laugh with foot when acting cadwalladar yet was such a mischievous wag that he would teaze mr a  ce till he was enraged at foot  and all this was giveandtake fair play  he was fond of tricks with his guest who visited him at seaton delaval mr obrien on his return from a visit there related to me many whimsical frolics which were practiced with much joke and good humor and mr obrien told them in such a manner as made the narrative very entertaining  when mr foot and the rest of the company departed sir francis detained me in order to relate the request he had hinted at in his note which was he said relative to an alteration of my play  to change the distressed mother to that of tamerlane and that he wished to introduce instead of mrs pritchard our old friend mrs wier whose welfare he had much concern for and would instruct her in the character of arpasia  sir francis delaval was greatly attached to the drama so much so that it is well remembered and universally known he acted the part of othello in march      at drury lane theater with ladies and gentlemen of fashion of his acquaintance sir franciss person was noble handsome and commanding and very proper to give a striking resemblance of the moorish general there is a strong likeness of that great patron of the actors and actresses at lord mexboroughs at methley ar pontefract to lord and lady mexborough i am under numerous obligations i could with pleasure say a great deal more but were i to expatiate on all i feel for the many persons to whom i am indebted for favors it would fill the largest book that ever was published and furh a little library  sir john now lord delaval acted iago and was pronounced incomparable in judgment and display of abilities and it was allowed by all to be a critical performance of that difficult character applause on that nights acting need not be mentioned as the reader may be assured it was commanded and not less merited sir francis hired the theater at a very considerable expense as not only that of a benefit but the supposed profits of mr garricks best character for attraction was added to that charge  the family aided sir francis to fill the theater with their own acquaintance only which included all the nobility of the three kingdoms then in london but not any one was admitted without a proper ticket from sir francis or his brothers who had calculated the number the theater would contain and that without distinction of places to prevent offense and in consequence when the best places were occupied the upper gallery was as brilliant with stars and garters as the boxes and pit below  the rehearsals were i have been told entirely conducted by my good friend macklin sir francis held that gentleman in high esteem as his private confidential friend and when he alluded to the teaching mrs  arpasia he added macklin had promised to assist him which free opinion collectively made me obeisant  i mention or rather introduce here the more readily these theatrical circumstances of sir francis delaval to account for his stage furor in teaching mrs wier the character of arpasia who had many claims on his kindness to instruct her  we must consider she was the wife of one wier who had served him faithfully for many years and had ever assisted sir francis in his various attachments for no sooner was one scheme accomplished but he was on the wing for another  so wier was never idle but was an industrious servant and it might be said truly of him that he always had his hands full and was kept in perpetual employment  i had not any objection to her playing arpasia and he gave me a genteel order for three sideboxes for which he paid most liberally and appointed two or three dozen of his friends to go into the pit  when the night came there was a very brilliant audience my own friends were numerous  lady granard lady tyrawley mrs skeleton lord verney were all there and filled their separate boxes mrs wier was well received as is generally the case with young performers from the candor of a london audience but she was languid timid and barely reached mediocrity though not by any means laughable or offensively ridiculous indeed she began her stage career too late in life being at that time as near as i can guess thirtyfive or thirtysix years of age  she wanted animation and expression for arpasia but she has quitted these earthly realms of abode and has followed her moneses and left me her bajazet to bemoan her lss  this benefit which i obtained from garrick with difficulty proved a very great and pleasing addition to my accumulating funds  the theater closed in may and i without seeing mr garrick having then obtained my freedom by the expiration of my article that had existed from october      set off once more on a journey to portsmouth where i expected open arms to receive me but was in my expectations disappointed for though my friends were as usual glad to see me the players were quite the reverse the acting what parts and reviving what plays i pleased they represented in strong terms as very great innovations on the rules and orders established in their society or commonwealth as many useul members on that account had withdrawn themselves in disgust greatly to the prejudice of their business in general  the hermoine mrs daly expressed herself as geatly injured by my having introduced miss morrison and miss white the year before who had acted several of her favorite characters she thus harangued me  the one she said had torn from her royal brows and stock of fame cleopatra and hermoine next the chaste penelope from the arms of her ulysses and not content with that had actually separated the true roxana from the love of alexander the other rival had stolen by surprise sylvia and desdemona etc  and was she to be deprived of her honors by an ignoramus  alluding to miss whites battleax as mentioned before queen daly proceeded and armed with her constant friend the brandybottle pursued her declaration of wrongs and injuries with great prowess and strength of lungs the surrounding kings and princes with the lords in waiting nodded marks of assent and approbation of their amazonian tragic queen they rose and voted their thanks and unanimously resolved in future not to permit any interloper but on consideration of my past srvices they would for the summer season admit me as a shaer as they termed it and to be restricted to only one benefit and not as the year before two clear benefits this proposal i would not by any means accept  they urged with truth that my attraction as to novelty was passed consequently my friends and the public at large who had made it a business to attend the theater to see and support me would in all probability decline their frequency of visits and reserve their cash to serve me on my benefit night merely for my particular advantage which weighed materially with their considerations so on their not complying with my expectations and proposals we parted with mutual disdain rage and anger at o p and p s the reader is to understand o p is the side of the stage opposite the prompter and p s the side on which the prompter sits   i like my brethren of the sock and buskin laid the fault as is natural on the manager in particular and to all my friends i related my grievances as well as to my best patrons and sowed the seeds of discord with propitious hands as they from their partiality to me were much enraged and it actually was the consequence of their encouraging another playhouse to be built which is the present theater  from trivial causes sometimes matters of importance issue forth and the banditti for they were really little better which existed and exulted like savage fiends in human shape on the cornwall coasts eagerly waiting for a lucky shipwreck on the spoils of war were soon dispersed by regular forces from bath and gin and brandy gave the fina period to most of their existences  at that juncture as the war still continued between france and ngland july    0 there was an encampment at winchester of no less than eight regiments of militia and the earl of essinghams regiment of regulars under the command of the present lords father the father and son were both there and there were the greatest number of officers i ever beheld assembled together this brilliant camp was to be stationed there for the whole summer unless the boasted french invasion at that time so much threatened and expected or some particular occurrence intervened and commanded a removal  the bath company headed by mr griffith and mr keasberry lured by the fair promise of a plentiful harvest built a temporary theater in that city and finding i was at variance with the grandees of portsmouth gave me a very genteel offer to join the forces under their direction which i accepted with pleasure as the change was very satisfactory and for good reasons as it promised not only to be lucrative but eligible and particularly pleasant and another strong charm which it had with me was variety and novelty two qualities ever predominant with me in all situations and at that time from my perpetual change of place was become habitual so that for the sake of variety the city or the village had at different times equal charms according to my various dispositions but either would have given me satiety if confined to it alone and could i live as i pleased now i am writing this in march    0 i would every six weeks or two months be on different ground and with a full purse think i could make the whole year very delightful by being in london paris bath edinburgh etc  however to winchester i went and found it to a high degree agreeable and the weather added to make it delightful it was one of the finest summers i ever remember and certainly with youth health spirits and money in the pocket a love of acting gratified and attended with applause and success at the age of twentyone years was an enviable situation not to be described and all these blessings at that time i enjoyed which are seldom to be equalled in any situation of life  the enthusiasm attendant on a young man possessed of public favor and being the utmost of the possessors wishes can only be felt for it is not to be described  it is a delusion of magical felicity known to the actor only  few there are who have at one time that accumulation of good gifts just mentioned and i really then was blessed with them all not that i now can boast those enviable treasures of health pleasure etc but as lady pentweazle says i have had my day mr carmine  but the stage has now no charms for me yet i cannot but remember such things were and were most precious to me and a time though past which i reflect on and react in my imagination with the greatest satisfaction  it wakes a glad remembrance of my youth calls back past joys and warms me into transport and memory sometimes gives me a great degree of credit and selfapprobation for some things  i dare not say all  who can  i was then upheld by the good and the great from which aid all proper gratifications were supplied but i never forgot the true respect and protection due to my mother so in some degree i deserved the blessings i enjoyed  at winchester i received many favors and civilities but not from any one so particularly as from the marquis of tavistock eldest son to his grace the late duke of bedford to whose generosity and kindness i was much obliged  miss ambrose better known now by the name f egerton was a most agreeable young lady as as also her sister we used to have frequent partis and have been from that time on a most riendly intimacy miss ambrose was that very sason my winchester beckey  the comedy of the minor that had met so unlucky a fate in ireland a few months before was just then printed and published and was acting with a rage astonishing it is not describable the crowds of all degrees that crushed in to that little theater in the haymarket night after night in the hottest months of the year the fashion of not publishing is quite modern and the favorite pieces not being printed but kept under lock and key is of infinite prejudice to us poor devils in the country theaters as we really cannot afford to pay for the purchase of mss  the only time i ever exercised my pen on such an occasion was on a trial of necessity  mr harris bought that excellent comic opera of the duenna from mr sheridan i saw it several times and finding it impracticable to move mr harriss tenderness i locked myself up in my room sat down first the jokes i remembered then i laid a book of the songs before me and with magazines kept the regulation of the scenes and by the help of a numerous collection of obsolete spanish plays i produced an excellent opera i may say excellent  and an unprecedented compilement for whenever mr younger or any other country manager wanted a copy of the duenna mr harris told them they might play mr wilkinsons hundreds have seen it in every town in great britain and ireland  mrs webb has acted the part of the duenna in my opera as i call it many nights at edinburgh  mr suett the jew at york etc  while i was at winchester his royal highness the duke of york who had honored my benefit at portsmouth in      was at southampton for his health and the advantage of seabathing i must remark that southampton in the year    0 was not frequented as a fashionable place of resort but it now stands in equal rank with other various duckingplaces at present in vogue for the autumn part of the summer  his royal highness frequently paid a visit to the officers at the camp and often honored the theater on those visitations he recollected first seeing me at portsmouth and after at drury lane theater in the diversions of the morning etc and having seen the minor on its first representation just before he had left london for southampton he sent col pit to mr keasberry desiring that piece might be got ready as soon as possible and mr wilkinson to perform mr footes characters and when the comedy was prepared to inform col pit and his command might be added at the top of the bill  this was accordingly done  by command of his royal highness the duke of york wednesday evening august    the minor  indeed the comedy was in study and would have been soon acted but the unexpected honor was a most flattering and lucky stroke for me the piece and mr keasberry it brought a great house and obtained uncommon applause which was increased by the attention and distinguished marks of approbation bestowed by his royal highness  i was honored with his thanks by col pit and when i with mr griffith and mr keasberry lighted his highness out of the box he said to me  very well indeed wilkinson i shall command it again  it was acted four or five times to great houses  the whole season was indeed a scene of uninterrupted harmony and prosperity with our little community  indeed mr keasberry was sometimes obstreperous and actually turned me out of his house when the morning gun fired that being the signal for sending me home to bed i will here mention a very ludicrous circumstance that happened on the benefit of mr keasberry  mr griffith at the latter end of our season departed for dublin being engaged by mr mossop the first winter of his opposition to mr barry in that city  mr keasberrys benefit was on wednesday the  st of october alexander the great was the play got up with great attention i was the alexander also the richard lear etc the constant regularity of the bath company was such that the reader may be assured there was not any neglect on mr keasberrys night but all decorations etc were ordered fully equal to what could be afforded  statira miss ambrose  all went off with great eclat till the latter part of the fourth act soon after the death of clytus  some olive leaves etc intended for decorations being twisted and interwoven with little bits of wax caught fire from the lights and the flame contiuing to blaze the burnt particles occasioned a strong stench  an universal cry of fire fire prevailed on which every person was alarmed but not one so horridly aghast as the dead clytus who had expired by the rage of alexander he rose with the agility of a tumbler that would not have disgraced the royal circus his uprise and exit were so quick that he threw the immortal alexander on his back the late noble earl of effingham who was remarkably corpulent evinced equal alacrity with dead nimblefooted clytus and gave evident proofs of superior agility for instead of making his way to the boxdoor he with one spring of the utmost ease swiftness and dexterity vaulted over the sidebox and lighted on his feet on a row in the middle of the pit standing erect the seat gave proof to the credit of the carpenter for it did not yield but firmly supported its ponderous and noble weight  in a few minutes the trifling cause that occasioned this universal panic subsided and was soon extinguished the audience called to order the ladies instead of fainting being surrounded by martial heroes smiled lord effingham returned to his box but not b the way he went into the pit no sooner was his lordship settled in slatu quo than all the gentlemen of the army for he was universally beloved gave a general salutation which his lordship returned and after a hearty laugh on all sides the play was ordered to go on and old greyheaded clytus made his second appearance after death and prostrated himself once more a victim at the feet of alexander it appeared so truly ridiculous that the convulsive fits of laughter which involuntarily ensued may easier be conceived than described it was truly whimsical and mutually entertaining joy and fear generally run into extremes as was the case for the remaining part of the fourth act of the tragicomedy was all laughter the distressed princess statira in her alarm had not caught up a blanket hecuba like but actually ran out of her thatched palace to the friendly refuge and asylum of the first claycold ditch that opened to receive her and having recovered from her fears returned well escorted to our court of babylon so harmony being restored with a pause for composure before the fifth act commenced serious faces were once more resumed and alexander ordered to be interred in the temple of jupiter ammon with all honors and without disturbance to his remains  this anecdote of winchester had escaped my memory had it not been refreshed by a gentleman of fashion who was present at that nights exhibition and with whom i had the pleasure of supping at mr broadheads in portland place march      where mr kemble was also at table  indeed the present lord effingham remembers it perfectly well as i have taken the liberty to introduce here the late and the present lord effingham i think it highly incumbent for me publicly to acknowledge the favors conferred on me by the late lord effingham at that time at winchester and in consequence thereof i have been much honored since by the present lord and lady efingham for whom i truly hold the most proound and respectful gratitude  the success of the minor made me desire a weeks furlow to see mr foot perform his characters in the meridian of its glory which request was complied with  it had received much retouching and many alterations by the ingenious hand of mr foot since i had seen it the winter before in ireland  the introduction smirk the auctioneer and dr squintums epilogue were all entirely new i went two or three nights but with great difficulty got admittance the crowds to see it were so numerous i took that opportunity of hiring a postchaise for the day to visit cowley meaning once more to claim and renew my acquaintance with mr rich who was then at his countryseat but it was not attended with the success i wished he was very civil but the playbill from winchester though aggrandized with his royal highness the duke of yorks patronage had not the effect i expected it would have had one hour was the full length of our teteatete however i did not repent my journey to london as i had mended my performances in the minor by seeing mr footes playing the parts and the better prepared for my next acting of them at winchester which happened a few days after my return  i judged though mr rich and i had not then agreed it might be brought about and if not by my utility and consequence to the company at winchester and my friendship with mr keasberry i depended to a certainty on his interest to explain and speak so favorably of me to mr arthur manager of the bath theater that i should secure a principal engagement there f the winter and believe had i been reduced to have made the experiment i should not have flattered myself with wrong conjectures as i am certain mr keasberry would have done any thing to have served me and mr arthur a fordid character would have found it such an agreement as would have answered his purpose as indeed it afterward proved though not that very year  i must not omit to mention it was the best bred audience at winchester i ever saw i do not remember when any thing went accidently wrong on the stage a single instance of sneering or illnature it was from the beginning of the season till the ending a continued scene of the most perfect good breeding that could be conceived or practiced and they were always ready to assist and relieve the performers when embarrassed and ever by loud talking and affected contempt or rudeness disturbed the theater or distressed the actor and to the credit of the bath company at winchester be it recorded though their incomes were not superabundant or fuperfluous though an amazing concourse of people in the time of war and provisions not cheap but scarce and high priced yet i do not believe one guinea was owing in the town of winchester from a single actor or the whole collected company of comedians  o tempora o mores  this trip from bath was to the advantage of the players yet the gentlemen of the army deemed it a compliment to themselves and as such requisite for them to make a return for what they esteemed a favor and indeed they were all from the general down to the ensign kept to the strictest military duty what a relief certainly must a decent wellconducted little theater have been to themselves and their variety of visitors from all parts of the kingdom who came by way of respect to see their friends in the camp and the general grand review and also as a pleasant trip of relaxation from london i do not believe in the course of twelve weeks three gentlemen ever attempted to get behind the scenes during the representation for though the stop was easy from the pit to the stage the decorum was such that i do not recollect a single infringement i did twice or thrice see lord effingham and the marquis of tavistock and that chiefly on account of benefits not that we were destitute of female attraction mrs egerton then miss ambrose the statira made strong impressions on several but on no one of note with such unmerciful havoc as on the heart of the marquis of tavistock i have entertained doubts that he subdued the fortress for to my knowledge the marquis offered large and munificent terms for capitulation with all the honors of war with such accommodation and besort as levelled with her breeding but when women stand a siege they are hard to be conquered and generally subdue the boldest if she had capitulated and yielded at discretion she would have been more envied than censured for i had then never seen the universal great and good qualities of the mind and elegance of figure so conspicuously united in one man as i did in the marquis of tavistock he was indeed when he died a loss to his illustrious family his friends and the nation and as an individual a great one to me and will y me ever while i have memory to recollect be mentioned with regard for his goodness and the partiality he honored me with those who recollect the marquis will not think i have said too much but rather given a faint drawing of the original as the marquis never forgot he was a man of quality and a soldier so he never gave his inferiors cause to imagine he was not speaking to a gentleman  having made my observations on the extraordinary elegant demeanor of that noble military audience i beg to be permitted to express what i have often felt for myself and sympathized on the same account with my fellow comedians when not only wantonly insulted but too often by the wilfully rude behavior from different parts of the theater i do not mean to confine it to the front side or stage boxes though it is no more strange than true that it too often comes from those places of most fashionable resort  there surely is nothing so barbarous so uncivilized so unlike a real gentleman as the exercising this inhuman this torturing affected disposition for after all it proceeds in fact from affectation the overflow of youthful minds primed by the circling glass even the ladies are not always blameless in this respect but excite their own mirth by the putting their fellow creatures on the rack surely the possessor of delicate feelings would shudder at knowing he or she was the cause of such misery and is it not excruciating when you work upon the mind of another the physician can admister for all ills but that and therein dr shakspeare says the patient must administer to himself   i do not mean to dictate to persons who honor the theater often that they are to be under the confinement of contant attention for most of the good houses are perhaps on fashionable nights when as to what the play is does not signify the firt of a fan but they should avoid behavior which in a foreign theater would not be tolerated and only let the feelg mind reflect what a lessening to beauty and fortune what a distortion such strange fits occasion when they so far forget themselves as to descend to a lvel with their deemed inferiors and put that eauty into the hands of an illnatured painter fr players by the bye are painters and though not bred artists can sometimes steal from shakspeares portaits and produce so strong a caricature that though they may laugh it does not give pleasure to their all seeming gaiety for acting is not confined to the stage  but all men and women are merely players they have their exits and their entrances   all the modes of distressing actors and audiences effectually baffle every effort from the performer for he is immediately told by suc insinuation that he is a person of inferiority who no body knows though possibly a real gentleman and of family though not a son of fortune but misfortune and is in consequence degraded as the player his attempts immediately vanish and the mock prince sinks suddenly to mr a or mr b and he must rest quiet without hazarding the incurring of spleen anger etc and sbmit to such usurping tyranny as would disgrace the very inflictors to practice on their most menial dependents o ladies and gentlemen only reect on the fable of the boys and the frogs  that what is sport to you is death to us   would that such laughers did more respect themselves could they behold a mirror at the moment they would soon perceive by change of counnance that dr young spoke truth when he said of woman  that heaven is pleased to make distress become her and dresses her most amiably in tears and what is more extraordinary in this mode of wantonness for i can term it no other is that these persons limit their demeanor according to the place they are in at edinburgh or bath rarely such littleness is seen from superiority so much the contrary that the twigs of fashion from every county when in the boxes at bath or london sit as gentle as lambs and are astonished at the barbarity of any noise whatever that may i the least disturb the favorite actor or actress but here let the topic rest for unless the true feelings of ladies and gentlemen will aid to constitute that amiable character and plead in their breasts in behalf of stage tragedyheroes and stageladies of quality all i can urge would be of no effect  i remember some persons being called to order in the side boxes from the pit when virginia was acting at drury lane mrs cibber acted that part after which she had to speak the following lines in the epilogue which had a most wonderful effect on the aggressors and was outrageously relished by the applauding audience  may i approach unto the boxes pray and there search out a judgment on the play in vain alas i should attempt to find it fine ladies see a play but never mind it it is vulgar to be moved by acted passion or form opinions till they are fixed by fashion   most theatrical histories are made up by pages upon pages from cibber betterton victor davies and others so in fact they are no more than compilements which makes me unwilling to give the following extract from cibber but as he is clever and i naturally wish prosperity to the sock and buskin i think a few lines from so able a master will be more acceptable than any thing i can offer on the subject  cibber says notwithstanding all my best endeavors to recommend the profession of an actor to amore general favor i doubt while he is liable to more unlimited insults as i have already mentioned i doubt i say we must still leave him adrift with his intrinsic merit to ride out the storm as well as he is able  however let us now turn to the other side of this account and see what advantages stand there to balance the misfortunes i have laid before you there we shall still find some valuable articles of credit that sometimes over pay his incidental disgraces  first if he has sense he will consider that as these indignities are seldom or ever offered him by people that are remarkable for any one good quality he ought not to lay them too close to his heart he will know too that when malice envy or brutal nature can securely hide or fence themselves in a multitude virtue merit innocence and even sovereign superiority have been and must be equally liable to their insults that therefore when they fall upon him in the same manner his intrinsic value cannot be diminished by them on the contrary if with a decent and unruffled temper he lets them pass the disgrace will return upon his aggr ssor and perhaps warm the generous spectator into a partiality in his favor that while he is conscious that as an actor he must be always in the hands of injustice it does him at least this involuntary ood that it keeps him in a settled resolution to avoid all occasions of provoking it or of even offending the lowest enemy who at the expense of a shilling may publicly revenge it that if e excels on the stage and is irreprachable in his personal morals and behaiour his pofession is so far from being an impediment that it will be oftener a just reason for his being received among people of condition with favor and sometimes with a more social distinction than the best though more profitable trade he might have followed could have recommended him to  what a blessing therefore is it  what an enjoyed deliverance after an actor has been driven by fortune to stand so many wanton buffets of unmanly fierceness to find himself at last quietly lifted above the reach of them  now though i have sometimes known these gallant insulters of audiences draw themselves into scrapes which they have less honorably got out of yet alas what has that availed  this generous publicspirited method of silencing a few was but repelling the disease in one part to make it break out in another all endeavors at protection are new provocations to those who pride themselves in pushing their courage to a defiance of humanity even when a royal resentment has shown itself in the behalf of an injured actor it has been unable to defend him from farther insults an instance of which happened in the late king jamess time mr smith whose character as a gentleman could have been no way impeached had he not degraded it by being a celebrated actor had the misfortune in a dispute with a gentleman behind the senes to receive a blow from him the same night an account of this action was carried to the king to whom the gentleman was represented so grossly in the wrong that the next day his majesty sent to forbid him the court upon it this indignity cast upon a gentleman only for having maltreated a player was looked upon as the concern of every gentleman and a party was soon formed to assert and vindicate their honor by humbling this favored actor whose slight injury had been judged equal to so severe a notice accordingly the next time smith acted he was received with a chorus of catcalls that soon convinced him he should not be suffered to proceed in his part upon which without the last discomposure he ordered the curtain to be dropped and having a competent fortune of his own thought the conditions of adding to it by his remaining upon the stage were too dear and from that day entirely quitted it i shall make no observation upon the kings resentment or on that of his good subjects how far either was or was not right is not the point i dispute for be that as it may the unhappy condition of the actor was so far from being relieved by this royal interposition in his favor that it was the worse for it while these sort of real distresses on the stage are so unavoidable it is no wonder that young people of sense though of low fortune should be so rarely found to supply a succession of good actors  why then may we not in some measure impute the scarcity of them to the wanton inhumanity of those spectators who have made it so terribly mean to appear there were there no ground for this question where could be the disgrace of entering into a society whose institution when not abused is a delightful school of morality and where to excel requires as ample endowments of nature as any one profession that of holy institution excepted whatsoever  but alas as shakspeare says  where is that palace whereinto sometime foul things intrude not  the best things are liable to corruption and the errors of a theater is no disproof of its innate and primitive utility    garrick observed that twentyfour years playing the fool claimed allowance for such tedious labor now i have been thirtythree years in this perplexing business with infirmities helping to enfeeble and it is not in my power or inclination to be much longer an actor an old man it has been observed by an eminent writer acted well by a young one is truly entertaining but performed by a real old man is lamentable and not to be borne it is therefore evident men should quit the stage if practicable at a certain time of life and women earlier lest they incur with priors lady  pity betterton in age that ridicules the godlike rage not but a good old woman is on the stage as well as in life at any time worth fifty bad young ones a gentleman likemanner being tipsey naturally exhibited is very pleasant but a real drunken man we will kindly suppose never was or ever will be seen on the stage  having been so free on the supposition of being a spectator i cannot in idea take leave of the stage with an easy mind and si quiet unless i speak of what is much more reprehensible and a more egregious fault in performers than any i have mentioned or can insert of an audience  many allowances from accident may be made for young persons of rank in their gaiete de coeur but what can be said for the outrages or rather audacious behavior of too many performers who thunder out their disapprobation and the cruel insults they receive occasionally from the audience but would such performers more strictly adhere to their duty and preserve more their own propriety they could then with more reason and real justice complain it grieves me to say the conduct of players on the stage is too often unjustifiable and not to be defended and should always be reprehended by the audience in the severest degree they should consider that mr garrick who had attained an immense fortune when on the boards laid himself liable to the censure or applause of the audience  as an instance that the audience know their power the late livelyspirited goodnatured nicholson stewart of edinburgh a man of family and fortune who knew every gentleman and lady in that city without exception when he presented himself on the stage for hamlet romeo or pierre whenever he acted it was always for a public charity the audience did not pay their money to set up their friend as an idol unless he proved himself worthy to be worshipped and though that gentleman did actually possess sterling merit yet he wanted much to make a complete hamlet or a perfect pierre but as a stagestruck genius like mr vapid they would judge of him as to his merits more or less as an actor  it is not so easy to mount the stage and pleas as many imagine for when the audience were informed mr stewart on the night of his acting pierre had fallen down a trap and thereby put a stop to the play for a short space the impanneled jury of the pit instead of commiserating his painful tumble burst out into an involuntary roar of laughter  dr franklin says the critic first we banish from our session death is his trade and damning his profession disqualified because to say no further butchers are never heard in case of murder but had that gentleman mr stewart been in a room with any of those persons and fallen down or fainted every one would have been most anxiously concerned and have run to his assistance  an actor should consider that when the first man in a county sets up for a member of parliament he is obliged to solicit and use humiliating application aye and the right application too if he hopes to gain his election but then he has the happy consolation to know and feel it is all for the good of his country  from the king to the minister and from the minister to the king at times disagreeable condescension must in some degree happen  it is humiliating when the most despotic monarch cannot carry all his points  france and germany have lately afforded striking instances  the cobbler and his last should never be forgotten  and no man by any means feels the least mortification or disappointment in a more stinging degree than the very proud man who looks down even on his equals with a haughty and supercilious eye therefore when such a great character is seen not deigning to look at or know you there yet is a certain consolation that that very great man has often checks that cut him to the soul gall his pride and make him miserable and the least trifle of slight from his superior is insupportable and irritating to the end of his life  the actor or the poor man feels it only momentarily for at the corner of the next street he possibly meets a real gentleman who makes double and treble amends and the proud man is no more thought of but as he deserves  there are many who profess to the actor great friendship by giving him an invitation for the evening but the day after do not know how to meet him with civility lest the common easy mode of behavior should occasion a contagion or appear disgraceful to themselves  indeed i have not much reason to complain of this but i have seen it often practiced  though seldom in the metropolis  i have not any right to animadvert on the private conduct of actors for there are at the theaters many whose rectitude is o praiseworthy that i might take lessons and wish to equal and emulate them  actors are too likely from their nocturnal line of revels and conviviality to be led into the love of company which begets a cheerful glass the cheerful glass begets a late hour and these habits increase into a custom as with myself and cause a thousand frilties follies and faults and too often occasion terrible neglect at the fountain head the theater from whence all their real credit and reputation must spring i therefore entreat and beseech if the performers sincerely wish the stage to be respectable that they will produce samples of regularity and attention and i will venture to affirm the reformation will not pass unobserved  if a superior is obliged to act his part in life the comedian should know his name as is in the bill to act the part announced to the public and that he should execute it to the best of his abilities more cannot be expected  but how can he or she expect attention or regard from an audience when the performers so frequently treat that audience with freedom nay apparent neglect and nothing but severe reprobation and anger will effectually cure laughing at the audience and entertertaining themselves with low indecent jokes and a volley of oaths not in the parts and often spoke of to their great discredit at the tabernacle and too often the manager blamed for not preventing such impromptus which is not in his power and even the females staring into the stageboxes and smiling at their acquaintance acting all to the pit not directing their discourse to the person on the stage and horatio though so enjoined to attend to the business of the play employs all that time by apparently numbering the house  if the actors wish for regard they should treat the theater each morning certainly with the same degree of respect they would observe in the most common schoolroom rehearse the play with serious attention and not with riot and discord thereby giving the stage opponents such full scope to exclaim that the theater proves itself a school of anarchy and disorder by the perpetual slander many performers bestow on their colleagues for  0l more in one house on a benefit than in another will raise a jealousy not to be subdued for a month  a little application to the study of authors and criticisms in general would mend many actors and actresses but rehearsals too frequently resemble a game at schoolboys play and instead of preparing for the stage like gentlemen they are acting in the style and behavior of christmasstreet country mummers  do not let the reader conceive the theater such a beargarden as to render this picture necessary for the performers in the country in general far from it i am only speaking the sentiments of liberal minds who are hurt at seeing such vulgar and unpardonable behavior from a few egregiously illbred whom reasoning would only inflame and make their company still worse and the audience have often too much patience when they pass over such repeated faults by too much indulgence which the wrongheaded actor places to approbation and his own merit  it is not arrogant or presumptive to allege that many gentlemen and ladies of the stage have deserved and received every respectful compliment and that real gentlemen of family have been actors with credit to themselves and their connections and that persons of no pedigree have proved themselves ornaments to the stage and to human nature by the assistance only of amazing genius and talents and that such have arrived to the summit of perfection is as evident as the noonday sun and will be continuing to arise occasionally like comets till time shall be no more  we all have our faults as actors and actresses in the worlds drama and without being too hard on the stage  let each go pluck the beam out of his own eye and then he will see clearly to pluck the mote out of his brothers eye actors before they wish to expose the errors of each other which when exaggerated they blazon trifles like making mountains of molehills or resembling the story of the three black crows  a gentleman in his illness having discharged something almost as black as a crow  as to the good word of a methodist it cannot be expected because if real charity or candor is wanted it is much more likely to come from the stage than from a conventicle and a methodist and a player like a spider and a toad are natural enemies each party using his lungs in hopes of a crowded benefit  actors should never run into debt a hard injunction for they may be assured a day of payment will be expected and what is worse that one such black sheep gives the idea of dishonesty to a whole troop which is very hard and might with as much propriety be thrown on any other profession that many should be blamed for the faults of a few  running into debts that can be avoided lessens in every degree the actors darling passion that is his ideal consequence and there is another that actors incur which manifests negligence and is as mr garrick told shuter not to be too comical o comical actor it is a debt and a dangerous debt not easily forgot or forgiven for how can the performer think that though perhaps the town last night laughed and gave indulgence that he is free so far from it he has lost the golden ore their good opinion and it will take a long time to regain it for the actor is dreadfully wrong who thinks because himself and friends laugh at what is termed jokes out of all time place and character it is forgiven in general and not set down against him and mentioned for a twelvemonth at least with spleen and rancour by the judicious and though this may be cruel it is in some degree just and should not be so frequently deserved i would have all thirst for applause but let the means pursued be professional and characteristic to deserve it  in london an actor must be at least near right before he is established out of london an actor seldom gets into favor and popularity but he too frequently in consequence leaves the right road for the wrong that is he studies to quit nature and endeavors to obtain fase applause by any means no matter how acquired  that is villainous and in the end it destroys the good seeds of promise and proves a pitiful ambition in the knave that uses it be it a tragedian or comedian for the same illjudged means may be practiced as much almost by the one as the other in the greenroom the jokes on this occasion are bringing them down and we have been running our lengths  laughing on the stage at our own witticisms is another lamentable not comical fault  not that i would mean to be so rigid as not to allow for an accident or once in a way a welltimed joke provided it suits time place and character if the joke be ever so good yet if the actor is performing as a spaniard or a frenchman and reprobates either all wit or sense is destroyed and the actor truly censurable  mr garrick was perhaps the most rigid man in the world as to this discipline yet i remember a ly joke whispered by mrs clive in her good humor that put mr garrick so off his guard that he was seized with a fit of laughing and that so violently that he could not finish the way to keep him but was obliged after two or three efforts to make his bow amidst a roar of electrical laughter but this was merely the effect of chance and perhaps never before occurred in his lifetime so as to be really mastered by the whim of the flying meteor it was therefore not only very justly pardoned but enjoyed and applauded had even mr garrick the next night done the same it would have been very properly judged the greatest contempt that could be offered nor would he have forgiven himself and had he been ten garricks in one he would not have escaped censure and disapprobation  for though an audience may laugh out of place yet it is the actors profession and that profession cannot be so truly degraded as when the professors turn the most difficult art in the world to arrive at excellence in into ridicule and tell the audience it is not such a character before them but the humourous negligent mr woudbe the actor  a circumstance relating to laughter on the stage once occurred to myself at the haymarket theatr in      and as i have been mentioning errors in most theaters permitted out of london from too great lenity it leads me to point out a proper cure for the fault of laughing  i was that year an established favorite in london one evening as mr foot and myself were acting tragedy alamode the farce was going on with high relish but in my dying scene of golcondas something ludicrous occurred and i laughed mr foot laughed and then the audience laughed and all was pleasantry good humor approbation and the curtain dropped with mutual satisfaction the next night as i was performing the same part at the same place i again took the same liberty to be comical but it was where i should have been sad and an universal severe hiss with strong marks of anger resounded throughout the whole theater which changed my merriment and convinced me of the impropriety and error i had been guilty of by making me feel the only effectual means and mode of correction and i have remembered the lesson ever since and wish every actor and actress who take the same presumptive freedom with an audience would read this and remember me  how foolish does a giggling man or woman appear in company when like wowski they grin show teeth and laugh without knowing for why but what can look so truly ridiculous as performers laughing out of character at they know not what  out of the metropolis actors dress many footmen like boors which would lead a cockney on seeing a play out of london to imagine many gentlemens servants in the country were as different in materials and sagacious qualities as a bath turnspit compared to a ladys italian greyhound  another reformation necessary is the great composure with which ladies and gentlemen on the stage throw elegant bound volumes etc into ponds rivers etc which cannot occur in genteel life unless by great surprise illness or unexpected insanity  stage monarchs and heroes that oerstep the modesty of nature in blank verse may be permitted to throw valuable trinkets about at pleasure  it is not out of character for the usurping richard to toss away the prayer book as disagreeable and useless after the lord mayor has taken his leave for it has served his end and is to him then like lumber fit only to be thrown aside and scorned those actions too frequently practiced and permitted in the theater as the fine gentleman in modern life are a violation of all probability character and decorum when mr reddish first performed in dublin he inserted a paragraph informing the public that he was a gentleman of easy fortune but as he was acting sir john dorilant in the school for lovers and walking in his garden perusing a book most elegantly bound on the approach of his beloved ceha he threw the handsome volume into a ditch a gentleman in the pit seeing him do so said to mr macklin who sat near him pray sir do you think that conduct natural why no sir replied macklin gravely not as sir john dorilant but strictly natural as mr reddish for you know sir he has advertised himself as a gentleman of easy fortune  letters on the stage are in general wrote in as little time as signing the name only would require and signing the name in less than the two initial letters  i fear i have tired my gracious reader  but if out of ninety and nine i can reform one actor i obtain a theatrical proselyte for his own and the public good i gain my end and solicit forgiveness for my tediousness  i have made so many professions as to my winchester partiality that i think my veracity must be doubted by having so long neglected my indispensable duty at the camptheatre and return now not as a deserter but a willing volunteer and mention that my benefit was on friday september    and was honored with every attendance i could possibly hope for  the play was the confederacy my dish of tea with the farce of lethe  i played mrs amlet lord chalkstone and the old man i had many genteel presents from lord tavistock and several of the leading gentlemen of the army about that time mr garrick had some dispute and quarrel with my friend mr macklin and had to a certainty purloined his favorite farce of love alamode then in high rage of fashion with the public both from its novelty and real attractive merits and so eager was he to hurt if possible mr macklins property in that excellent piece that he wished to do it by the means of a division of the spoils as macklin was engaged at covent garden nay it is evident to have obtained that desired object he would have run the hazard of a lawsuit though he knew it must have ended to his dishonor but in that instance his spleen outwent his policy as the insertion of the following letters to me will decidedly prove i never mentioned the matter to mr macklin as it would have caused mischief between him and mr garrick  dear sir the managers have desired me to inform you that if you play the scotchman in love alamode they will give you for every time that you shall perform the part two guineas and if you mingle in the other business you shall have your old salary besides and a benefit in course of salary when you return from ireland i wish you had called upon me when in town for i always think that matters are sooner adjusted by one meeting of the parties than by a thousand letters the managers desire their compliments to you  i am dear sir your most obedient very humble servant geo garrick    august    0 ps pray send an answer by return of the post for i am going out of town soon     dear sir i have communicated the contents of your last to the managers and they think you are too hard with them  they are willing to give you two guineas for every time that you shall play sir archy and will engage that you shall play it fifteen times at least and that you shall have your old salary be permitted to make your excursions during which time you are not to receive any salary but if you return before the benefits or shall play in any of their nights at your return that then your salary shall be continued from the time of your return and you be entitled to your benefit into the bargain  they cannot possibly do more if the terms are agreeable to you please to let my brother know for i go into derbyshire on monday next and they will send you the part directly  i am dear sir your most obedient humble servant geo garrick  th september    0  hampton sept       0 sir i received yours and shall answer it directly  i can scarcely think that you are in earnest with us from your last proposition  you must know that it is impossible from the nature of a theater to let you have a benefit before christmas you must fix with us or be off immediately mr lacey and i will agree to give the two guineas per night for the acting sir archy and during the run or as long as that farce continues to be acted we will allow you your former salary when the farce is laid aside you shall have liberty to go adventuring and when you return shall have a benefit as usual and if employed in sir archy or otherwise your salary shall be continued to you  this is proposed to you to hinder any more correspondence  say aye or no in your next by the next post and we desire that you will keep this matter a profound secret and study the part in all haste and secretly  i am dear sir your truly wellwisher and humble servant d garrick   these epistles remind me  an open foe may prove a curse but a pretended friend is worse   the terms offered in those letters were truly despicable for the considered undertaking surely the labourer deserves his hire particularly as it was really a service of danger which he artfully wished me to undertake for i was to engage and fight and if any spoils or harvest was to be acquired from the field of battle he intended like generals of former ages to have reaped all the advantages himself i therefore positively declined any engagement whatever  falstaff like i would no more into the buckbasket rather preferring a winter situation out of london than to be hampered by mr garrick as his hobbyhorse unless well paid for all his cutting and flashing notwithstanding mr rich had refused my proffered services which seldom are held in value before i made my determination how to arrange my engagements i once more steered for dear london and left winchester in the middle of october to see what was going forward in the great world but not with likelihood of any continuance there that year of our lord on the day of my departure lord tavistock honored me with a present of fruit in a hamper well packed i set off highly gratified with the gift but much more so from the very flattering kindness of the compliment than by the value of the donation and to prove how good events are sometimes produced by trifles as once on a time the cackling of geese saved a city so i on my arrival in london judged that this hamper of bury pears etc would be a genteel and very acceptable present to mr rich and more so as the fruit would keep with care for some weeks at that season of the year and i added to the said hamper a very fine hare in london these things are esteemed presents but in yorkshire i am under such constant obligations to my friends that i have not the least reason to regret i am not a sportsman to be my own provider or not possessed of a park or gamekeeper as i have constantly some kind remembrancer that supplies me  end of volume second
