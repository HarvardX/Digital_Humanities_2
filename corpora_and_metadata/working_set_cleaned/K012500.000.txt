sacred dramas chiefly intended for young persons the subjects taken from the bible to which is added sensibility a poem  all the books of the bible are either most admirable and exalted pieces of poetry or are the best materials in the world for it cowley london printed for t cadell in the strand  m dcc lxxxii  to her grace the duchess of beaufort these sacred dramas are with the most perfect respect inscribed as among the many amiable and distinguished qualities which adorn her mind and add luster to her rank her excellence in the maternal character gives a peculiar propriety to her protection of this little work written with an humble wish to promote the love of piety and virtue in young persons by her graces most obedient most obliged and most humble servant  h more  advertisement i am as ready as the most rigid critic to confess that nothing can be more simple and inartificial than the plans of the following dramas in the construction of them i have seldom ventured to introduce any persons never indeed except in daniel and that of necessity as the bible furnishes no more than two persons daniel and darius and these were not sufficient to carry on the business of the piece of my own creation still less did i imagine myself at liberty to invent circumstances i reflected with awe that the place whereon i stood was holy ground all the latitude i permitted myself was to make such persons as i selected act under such circumstances as i found and express such sentiments as in my humble judgment appeared not unnatural to their situations  some of the speeches are so long as to retard the action for i rather aspired after moral instruction than the purity of dramatic composition the very terms of act and scene are avoided because i was unwilling to awaken the attention of the reader to my deficiencies in critical exactness  it may be thought that i have chosen perhaps the least important passage in the eventful life of david for the foundation of the drama which bears his name yet even in this his first exploit the sacred historian represents him as exhibiting no mean lesson of modesty humility courage and piety virtues not only admirable but imitable and within the reach of every reader many will think that the introduction of readiness daughter would have added to the effect of the piece and i have no doubt but that it would have made the intrigue more complicated and more interesting had this drama been intended for the stage there all that is tender and all that is terrible in the passions find a proper place but i write for the young in whom it will be always time enough to have them awakened i write for a class of readers to whom it is not easy to accommodate ones subject it would not be easy i believe to introduce sacred tragedies on the english stage the scrupulous would think it profane while the profane would think it dull yet the excellent racine in a dissipated country and a voluptuous court ventured to adapt the story of athaliah to the french theater and it remains to us a glorious monument of its authors courageous piety and of the perfection of the dramatic art   a very judicious and learned friend has remarked that the reflections of king hezekiah breathe rather too much of the spirit of christianity for that it is scarcely probable he had so settled a belief in the general judgment i feel the justness of the objection without having been able to obviate it i wished to convey a strong idea of this great leading truth and have perhaps improperly ascribed sentiments to a jewish monarch merely because i wished to impress them on the christian reader  the critic and the scholar if any such should honor these pages with their attention will find ample matter on which to exercise their candor and their charity qualities so natural to genius and to learning that even the feebleness of my performance will not be able to obstruct the exertion of them in favor of my intention  the amiable poet cowley from whom i have taken my motto after showing the superiority of the sacred over the profane histories some instances of which i have noticed in my introduction concludes with the following remark which i may apply to myself with more propriety than it was used by the author  i am far from assuming to myself to have fulfilled the duty of this weighty undertaking and i shall be ambitious of no other fruit from this weak and imperfect attempt of mine but the opening of a way to the courage and industry of some other persons who may be better able to perform it thoroughly and successfully  contents the introduction page   moses page    david and goliath page    belshazzar page     daniel page     hezekiah page     sensibility page     the

vain you i invoke not now ye fabled nine i not invoke you though you well were sought in greece and latium by immortal bards whose siren song enchants and shall enchant through times widecircling round though false their faith and less than human were the gods they sung though false their faith they taught the best they knew and blush o christians lived above their faith they would have blessed the beam and hailed the day which chased the moral darkness from their souls oh had their minds received the clearer ray of true devotion they had learned to scorn their deities impure their senseless gods and wild mythologys fantastic maze pure plato how had thy chaste spirit hailed a faith so fitted to thy moral sense what had thou felt to see the fair romance of high imagination the bright dream of thy pure fancy more than realizd o sweet enthusiast thou had blessed a scheme fair good and perfect how had thy rapt soul caught fire and burnt with a diviner flame for even thy fair idea never conceived such plenitude of love such boundless bliss as deity made visible to sense unhappy brutus philosophic mind great midst the errors of the stoic school how had his kindling spirit

more wise than ours they with the gods they worshipped graced their song our song we grace with gods we disbelieve the manners we adopt without the creed shall fiction only raise poetic flame and shall no altars blaze o truth to thee shall falsehood only please and fable charm and shall eternal truth neglected lie because immortal slighted or profaned truth has our reverence only not our love our praise but not our heart a deity confessed but shunned acknowledged not adored she comes too near us and she shines too bright her penetrating beam at once betrays what we would hide from others and ourselves why shun to make our duty our delight let pleasure be the motive and allow that immortality be quite forgot where shall we trace through all the page profane a livelier pleasure and a purer source of innocent delight than the fair book of holy truth presents for ardent youth the sprightly narrative for years mature the moral document in sober robe of grave philosophy arrayed which all had heard with admiration had embraced with rapture had the shades of academe or the learned porch produced it then o then how wisdoms hidden treasures had been couched beneath fair allegorys graceful veil do not the powers of soulenchanting song strong imagry bold figure every charm of eastern flight sublime apt metaphor and all the graces in thy lovely train divine simplicity assemble all in sions songs and bold isaiahs strain why should the classic eye delight to trace how pyrrha and the famed thessalian deucalion king restored the ruined race of lost mankind yet turn incurious from the patriarch saved the righteous remnant of a deluged world why are we taught delighted to recount alcides labors yet neglect to learn how mighty sampson led a life of toil herculean pain and peril marked them both a life eventful and disastrous death can all the tales which grecian records yield can all the names the roman page records renowned for friendship and surpassing love can gallant theseus and his brave compeer orestes and the partner of his toils achates and his friend euryalus and blooming nisus pleasant in their lives and undivided by the stroke of death can each can all a lovelier picture yield of virtuous friendship can they all present a tenderness more touching than the love of jonathan and david  speak ye young you who are undebauchd by fashions lore and unsophisticate from nature judge say is your quick attention stronger drawn by wasted thebes than pharaohs smitten hosts or do the vagrant trojans yield a theme more grateful to the eager appetite of young impatience than the wandering tribes by moses through the thirsty desert led the beauteous iphigenia maid though tender is the tale whose guiltless blood on aulis altars streamed smites not the bosom with a softer pang than jephthahs daughter doomed like her to die such are the lovely themes which court the muse scarce yet essayed in verse o let me mourn that heavndescended song should ever forget its sacred dignity and high descent should ever so far its origin debase to spread corruptions bane to lull the bad with flatterys opiate strain to taint the heart of innocence and silently infuse delicious poison whose insidious charm feeds the sick mind and fondly ministers unwholesome pleasure to the feverd taste while its fell venom with malignant power strikes at the root of virtue withering all her vital energy oh for some balm of sovereign power to raise the drooping muse to all the health of virtue to infuse a generous warmth to rouse an holy pride and give her high conceptions of herself for me eternal spirit let thy word my path illume o thou compassionate god thou know our frame thou know we are but dust from dust a seraphs zeal thou will not ask an angels purity oh as i strive though with a feeble voice and flagging wing a glowing heart but powrless hand to tell the faith of favored man to heaven to trace the ways inscrutable of heaven to man may i by thy celestial guidance led fix deeper in my heart the truths i sing in my own life transcribe whatever of good to others i propose and by thy rule correct the irregular what in me is dark illumine

jochebed miriam jochebed why was my prayer accepted why did heaven in anger hear me when i asked a son ye dames of egypt happy happy mothers no tyrant robs you of your fondest hopes you are not doomed to see the babes you bore the babes you nurture bleed before your eyes you taste the transports of maternal love and never know its anguish happy mothers how different is the lot of thy sad daughters o wretched israel was it then for this was it for this the righteous arm of god rescued his chosen people from the jaws of cruel want by pious josephs care joseph the elected instrument of heaven decreed to save illustrious abrahams race what time the famine raged in canaans land israel who then was spared must perish now oh thou mysterious power who have involved thy wise decrees in darkness to perplex the pride of human wisdom to confound the daring scrutiny and prove the faith of thy presuming creatures clear this doubt teach me to trace this maze of providence why save the fathers if the sons must perish  miriam ah me my mother whence these floods of grief  jochebed my son my son i cannot speak the rest ye who have sons can only know my fondness ye who have lost them or who fear to lose can only know my pangs none else can guess them a mothers sorrows cannot be conceived but by a mother  wherefore am i one  miriam with many prayers thou did request this son and heaven has granted him  jochebed o sad estate of human wretchedness so weak is man so ignorant and blind that did not god sometimes withhold in mercy what we ask we should be ruined at our own request too well thou know my child the stern decree of egypts cruel king hardhearted pharaoh that every male of hebrew mother born must die oh do i live to tell it thee must die a bloody death my child my son my youngest born my darling must be slain  miriam the helpless innocent and must he die  jochebed no if a mothers tears a mothers prayers a mothers fond precautions can prevail he shall not die i have a thought my miriam and sure the god of mercies who inspired will bless the secret purpose of my soul to save his precious life  miriam hopst thou that pharaoh   jochebed i have no hope in pharaoh much in god much in the rock of ages  miriam think o think what perils thou already have incurred and shun the greater which may yet remain three months three dangerous months thou have preserved thy infants life and in thy house concealed him should pharaoh know  jochebed oh let the tyrant know and feel what he inflicts yes hear me heaven send thy right aiming thunderbolts  but hush my impious murmurs is it not thy will thou infinite in mercy thou permittst this seeming evil for some latent good yes i will laud thy grace and bless thy goodness for what i have and not arraign thy wisdom for what i fear to lose oh i will bless thee that aaron will be spared that my firstborn lives safe and undisturbed that he was given me before this impious persecution raged  miriam and yet who knows but the fell tyrants rage may reach his precious life  jochebed i fear for him for thee for all a doting parent lives in many lives through many a nerve she feels from child to child the quick affections spread for ever wandering yet for ever fixed nor does division weaken nor the force of constant operation ever exhaust parental love all other passions change with changing circumstances rise or fall dependant on their object claim returns live on reciprocation and expire unfed by hope a mothers fondness reigns without a rival and without an end  miriam but say what heaven inspires to save thy son  jochebed since the dear fatal morn which gave him birth i have revolved in my distracted mind each means to save his life and many a thought which fondness prompted prudence has opposed as perilous and rash with these poor hands i have framed a little ark of slender reeds with pitch and slime i have secured the sides in this frail cradle i intend to lay my little helpless infant and expose him upon the banks of nile  miriam it is full of danger  jochebed it is danger to expose and death to keep him  miriam yet oh reflect should the fierce crocodile the native and the tyrant of the nile seize the defenseless infant  jochebed oh forbear spare my fond heart yet not the crocodile nor all the deadly monsters of the deep to me are half so terrible as pharaoh that heathen king that royal murderer  miriam should he escape which yet i dare not hope each seabrn monster yet the winds and waves he cannot scape  jochebed know god is every where not to one narrow partial spot confined no not to chosen israel he extends through all the vast infinitude of space at his command the furious tempests rise the blasting of the breath of his displeasure he tells the world of waters when to roar and at his bidding winds and seas are calm in him not in an arm of flesh i trust in him whose promise never yet has failed i place my confidence  miriam what must i do command thy daughter for thy words have waked an holy boldness in my youthful breast  jochebed go then my miriam go and take the infant buried in harmless slumbers there he lies let me not see him  spare my heart that pang yet sure one little look may be indulged one kiss  perhaps the last no more my soul that fondness would be fatal  i should keep him i could not doom to death the babe i clasped did ever mother kill her sleeping boy i dare not hazard it  the task be thine oh do not wake my child remove him softly and gently lay him on the rivers brink  miriam did those magicians whom the sons of egypt consult and think all potent join their skill and was it great as egypts sons believe yet all their secret wizard arts combined to save this little ark of bulrushes thus fearfully exposed could not effect it their spells their incantations and dire charms could not preserve it  jochebed know this ark is charmed with spells which impious egypt never knew with invocations to the living god i twisted every slender reed together and with a prayer did every ozier weave  miriam i go  jochebed yet ever thou go observe me well when thou have laid him in his watery bed o leave him not but at a distance wait and mark what heavens high will determines for him lay him among the flags on yonder beach just where the royal gardens meet the nile i dare not follow him suspicions eye would note my wild demeanor miriam yes the mothers fondness would betray the child farewell god of my fathers oh protect him  moses in the bulrushes part ii scene the banks of the nile enter miriam after having deposited the child yes i have laid him in his watery bed his watery grave i fear  i tremble still it was a cruel task  still i must weep but ah my mother who shall sooth thy griefs the flags and seaweed will awhile sustain their precious load but it must sink ever long sweet babe farewell yet think not i will leave thee no i will watch thee till the greedy waves devour thy little bark i will sit me down and sing to thee sweet babe thou can not hear but twill amuse me while i watch thy fate she sits down on a bank and sings song i thou who can make the feeble strong o god of israel hear my song not mine such notes as egypts daughters raise it is thee o god of hosts i strive to praise ii ye winds the servants of the lord ye waves obedient to his word o spare the babe committed to your trust and israel shall confess the lord is just iii though doomed to find an early grave this helpless infant thou can save and he whose death is doomed by pharaohs hand may rise a prophet to redeem the land she rises and looks out who moves this way of royal port she seems perhaps sent hither by the hand of heaven to prop the falling house of levi  soft i will listen unperceived these trees will hide me she stands behind enter the princess of egypt attended by a train of ladies princess no farther virgins here i mean to rest to taste the pleasant coolness of the breeze perhaps to bathe in this translucent stream did not our holy law the ancient egyptians used to wash their bodies four times every twentyfour hours enjoin the ablution frequent and regular it still were needful to mitigate the fervors of our clime ianthe stay  the rest at distance wait they all go out except one the princess looks out sure or i much mistake or i perceive upon the sedgy margin of the nile a chest entangled in the reeds it seems discernst thou ought  ianthe something but what i know not  princess go and examine what this sight may mean  exit maid miriam behind o blessed beyond my hopes he is discovered my brother will be saved who is this stranger ah it is the princess cruel pharaohs daughter if she resemble her inhuman sire she must be cruel too yet fame reports her most merciful and mild  i will mark the event and pray that heaven may prompt her to preserve him  reenter ianthe princess have thou discovered what the vessel is  ianthe oh princess i have seen the strangest sight within the vessel lies a sleeping babe a fairer infant have i never seen  princess who knows but some unhappy hebrew woman has thus exposed her infant to evade the stern decree of my too cruel sire unhappy mothers often my heart has bled in secret anguish over your slaughtered sons  ianthe should this be one my princess knows the danger  princess no danger should deter from acts of mercy  miriam behind a thousand blessings on her princely head  princess too much the sons of jacob have endured from royal pharaohs unrelenting hate too much our house has crushed their alien race is it not enough that cruel taskmasters grind them by hard oppression and stern bondage is it not enough my father owes his greatness his palaces his fanes magnificent those structures which the world with wonder views to the hard toils of much insulted israel to them his growing cities owe their splendour their labors built fair rameses and pythom and now at length his still increasing rage to iron bondage adds the guilt of murder and shall this little helpless infant perish forbid it justice and forbid it heaven  ianthe i know thy royal father fears the strength of this still growing race who flourish more the more they are oppressed he dreads their numbers  princess apis forbid pharaoh afraid of israel yet should this outcast race this hapless people ever grow to such a formidable greatness which all the gods avert whom egypt worships this infants life can never serve their cause nor can this single death prevent their greatness  ianthe i know not that by weakest instruments sometimes are great events produced this child perhaps may live to serve his upstart race more than an host  princess how ill does it beseem thy tender years and gentle womanhood to steel thy breast to pitys sacred touch so weak so unprotected is our sex so constantly exposed so very helpless that did not heaven itself enjoin compassion yet human policy should make us kind lest we should need the pity we resuse yes i will save him  lead me to the place and from the feeble rushes well remove the little ark which cradles this poor babe  the princess and maid go out miriam comes forward how poor were words to speak my boundless joy the princess will protect him bless her heaven she looks out after the princess and describes her action with what impatient steps she seeks the shore now she approaches where the ark is laid with what compassion with what angelsweetness she bends to look upon the infants face she takes his little hand in here is  he wakes  she smiles upon him  hark alas he cries weep on sweet babe weep on till thou have touched each chord of pity wakened every sense of melting sympathy and stolen her soul she takes him in her arms  o lovely princess how goodness heightens beauty now she clasps him with sondness to her heart she gives him now with tender caution to her damsels arms she points her to the palace and again this way the princess bends her gracious steps the virgintrain retire and bear the child  reenter the princess princess did ever innocence and infantbeauty plead with such dumb but powerful eloquence if i a stranger feel these soft emotions what must the mother who exposed him feel go setch a woman of the hebrew race that she may nurse the babe and by her garb lo such a one is here  miriam princess all hail forgive the bold intrusion of thy servant who stands a charmed spectator of thy goodness  princess i have redeemed an infant from the waves whom i intend to nurture as mine own  miriam my transports will betray me aside generous princess  princess know thou a matron of the hebrew race to whom i may confide him  miriam well i know a prudent matron of the house of levi her name jochebed is the wife of amram gentle she is and famed throughout her tribe for soft humanity full well i know that she will rear him with a mothers love aside oh truly spoke a mothers love indeed to her despairing arms i mean to give this precious trust the nurse shall be the mother  princess with speed conduct this matron to the palace yes i will raise him up to princely greatness and he shall be my son his name be moses for i have drawn him from the perilous flood they go out she kneels thou great unseen who causest gentle deeds and smilst on what thou causest thus i bless thee that thou did deign consult the tender make of yielding human hearts when thou ordaindst humanity a virtue did incline the natural bias of the soul to mercy then made that mercy duty gracious power made the keen rapture exquisite as right beyond the joys of sense as pleasure sweet as reason constant and as instinct strong  moses in the bulrushes part iii enter jochebed i have almost reached the place  with cautious steps i must approach to where the ark is laid lest from the royal gardens any spy me  poor babe ever this the pressing calls of hunger have broke thy short repose the chilling waves perhaps have drenched thy little shivering limbs what  what must he have suffered  no one sees me but soft does no one listen  ah how hard how very hard for fondness to be prudent now is the moment to embrace and feed him she looks out where is miriam she has left her little charge perhaps through fear perhaps she was detected how wild is thought how terrible conjecture a mothers fondness frames a thousand fears and shapes unreal evils into being she looks toward the river ah me where is he souldistracting sight he is not there  he is lost he is gone he is drowned tossed by each beating surge my infant floats cold cold and watery is thy grave my child o no  i see the ark  transporting sight she goes toward it what do i see alas the ark is empty the caskets left the precious gem is gone you spared him pitying spirits of the deep but vain your mercy some insatiate beast cruel as pharaoh took the life you spared  and i shall never never see him more enter miriam jochebed come and lament with me thy brothers loss  miriam come and adore with me the god of jacob  jochebed miriam  the child is dead  miriam he lives he lives  jochebed impossible oh do not mock my grief see thou that empty vessel  miriam from that vessel the egyptian princess took him  jochebed pharaohs daughter then still he will be slain  miriam his life is safe for know she means to rear him as her own  jochebed falls on her knees in rapture to god the lord the glory be ascribed oh magnified for ever be thy might who can plant mercy in a heathens heart and from the depth of evil bring forth good  she rises miriam o blessed event beyond our warmest hopes  jochebed what shall my son be nurtured in a court in princely grandeur bred taught every art and every wondrous science egypt knows yet ah i tremble miriam should he learn with egypts polished arts her baneful faith o worse exchange for death yes should he learn in yon proud palace to disown his hand who thus has saved him should he ever embrace as sure he will if bred in pharaohs court the gross idolatries which egypt owns her graven images her brutish gods then shall i wish he had not been preserved to shame his fathers and deny his faith  miriam then to dispel thy sears and crown thy joy hear farther wonders  know the generous princess to thy own care thy darling child commits  jochebed speak while my joy will give me leave to listen  miriam by her commissioned thou beholdst me here to seek a matron of the hebrew race to nurse him thou my mother art that matron  i said i knew thee well that thou would rear him even with a mothers fondness she who bare him i told the princess could not love him more  jochebed fountain of mercy whose pervading eye beholds the heart and sees what passes there accept my thoughts for thanks i have no words  how poor were human language to express my gratitude my wonder and my joy  miriam yes thou shall pour into his infant mind the purest precepts of the purest faith  jochebed o i will fill his tender soul with virtue and warm his bosom with devotions flame aid me celestial spirit with thy grace and be my labors with thy influence crowned without it they were vain then then my miriam when he is furnished against the evil day with gods whole armor   thessalonians chap v also ephesians chap vi  girt with sacred truth and as a breast plate wearing righteousness armed with the spirit of god the shield of faith and with the helmet of salvation crowned inured to watching and disposed to prayer then may i send him to a dangerous court and safely trust him in a perilous world too full of tempting snares and fond delusions  miriam may bounteous heaven thy pious cares reward  jochebed o amram o my husband when thou come wearied at night to rest thee from the toils imposed by haughty pharaoh what a tale have i to tell thee yes  thy darling son was lost and is restored was dead and lives  miriam how joyful shall we spend the livelong night in praises to jehovah who thus mocks all human foresight and converts the means of seeming ruin into great deliverance  jochebed had not my child been doomed to such strange perils as a fond mother trembles to recall he had not been preserved  miriam and mark still farther had he been saved by any other hand he had been still exposed to equal ruin  jochebed then let us join to bless the hand of heaven that this poor outcast of the house of israel condemned to die by pharaoh kept in secret by my adventurous fondness then exposed even by that very fondness which preserved him is now to fill the wondrous round of mercy preserved from perishing by pharaohs daughter saved by the very hand which sought to crush him wise and unsearchable are all thy ways thou god of mercies  lead me to my child  david and goliath a sacred drama  o bienheureux mill fois lenfant que le seigneur aim

natures best and loveliest gift with which she well atones the niggard boon of fortune  jesse o my son of all the graces which adorn thy youth i with a fathers fondness must commend thy tried humility for though the seer poured on thy chosen head the sacred oil in sign of future greatness in sure pledge of highest dignity yet here thou dwellst content with toil and careless of repose and harder still for an ingenuous mind content to be obscure content to watch with careful eye thine humble fathers flock o earthly emblem of celestial things so israels shepherd watches over his fold the weak ones in his fostring bosom bears and gently leads in his sustaining hand the feeble ones with young  david know thou my father ought from the field for though so near the camp though wars proud

towering wing of eagleplumd ambition mounts so surely to fortunes highest summit as obedience a distant sound of trumpets but why that sudden ardour o my son that trumpets sound though so remote its voice we hardly catch the echo as it dies has roused the mantling blood in thy young cheek kindled the martial spirit in thine eye and my young shepherd feels an heros fire  david thou have not told the posture of the war and much my beating bosom pants to hear  jesse uncertain is the fortune of the field i tremble for thy brothers thus exposed to constant peril nor for them alone does the quick feeling agonize my heart i too lament that desolating war hangs his fell banner over my native land beloved jerusalem o war what art thou after the brightest conquest what remains of all thy glories for the vanquished chains for the proud victor what alas to reign over desolated nations a drear waste by one mans crime by one mans lust of power unpeopled naked plains and ravaged fields succeed to smiling harvests and the fruits of peaceful olive luscious fig and vine here risled temples are the cavernd dens of savage beasts or haunt of birds obscene there populous cities blacken in the sun and in the general wreck proud palaces lie undistinguished save by the dun smoke of recent conflagration when the song of dearbought joy with many a triumph swelled salutes the victors ear and sooths his pride how is the grateful harmony profaned with the sad dissonance of virgins cries who mourn their brothers slain of matrons hoar who clasp their withered hands and fondly ask with iteration shrill their slaughtered sons how is the laurels verdure stained with blood and soiled with widows tears  david thrice mournful truth yet when our countrys rights her sacred laws her holy faith are scorned

resentment  david sure virtuous friendship is a noble cause o were the princely jonathan in danger how would i die wellpleased in his desence when it was long since then but a stripling boy i made short sojourn in his fathers palace at first to sooth his troubled mind with song his armorbearer next i well remember the gracious bounties of the gallant prince how would he sit attentive to my strain while to my harp i sung the harmless joys which crown a shepherds life how would he cry blessed youth far happier in thy native worth far richer in the talent heaven has lent thee than if a crown hung over thy anxious brow the jealous monarch marked our growing friendship and as my favor grew with those about him his royal bounty lessened till at length for bethlhems safer shades i left the court nor would these altered features now be known grown into manly strength nor this changed form enlarged with age and clad in russet weed  jesse i have employment for thee my loved son will please thy active spirit go my boy haste to the field of war to yonder camp where in the vale of elah mighty saul commands the hosts of israel greet thy brothers observe their deeds note their demeanor well and mark if wisdom on their actions waits bear to them too for well the waste of war will make it needful such plain healthful viands as furnish out our frugal shepherds board and to the valiant captain of their host present such rural gifts as suit our fortune heaped on the board within my tent thou wilt find them  david with joy i will bear thy presents to my brothers and to the valiant captain of their host the rural gifts thy gratitude assigns him what transport to behold the tented field the pointed spear the blaze of shields and arms and all the proud accoutrements of war but oh far dearer transport would it yield me could this right arm alone avenge the cause of injured israel and preserve the lives of guiltless thousands doomed perhaps to bleed  jesse let not thy youth be dazzled o my son with deeds of bold emprize as valor only were virtue and the gentle arts of peace of truth and justice were not worth thy care when thou shall view the splendors of the war the gay caparison the burnished shield the plumecrownd helmet and the glittering spear scorn not the humble virtues of the shade nor think that heaven views only with applause the active merit and the busy toil of heroes statesmen and the bustling sons of public care these have their just reward in wealth in honors and the wellearnd fame their high achievements bring it is in this sense that virtue is her proper recompense wealth as its natural consequence will flow from industry toil with success is crowned from splendid actions high renown will spring such is the usual course of human things for wisdom infinite permits that thus effects to causes be proportionate and natural ends by natural means achieved but in the future estimate which heaven will make of things terrestrial know my son that no inferior recompense belongs to the mild passive virtues meek content heroic selfdenial nobler far than all thatchievements noisy fame reports when her shrill trump proclaims the proud success which desolates the nations but on earth these are not always fortunate because eternal justice keeps them for the bliss of final recompense for the dread day of general retribution o my son the oftentatious virtues which still press for notice and for praise the brilliant deeds which live but in the eye of observation these have their meed at once but there is a joy to the fond votaries of fame unknown to hear the still small voice of conscience speak its whispering plaudit to the silent soul heaven notes the sigh afflicted goodness heaves hears the low plaint by human ear unheard and from the cheek of patient sorrow wipes the tear by mortal eye unseen or scorned  david as morning dews their grateful freshness shed and cheer the herbage and the flowers renew so do thy words a quickening balm infuse and grateful sink in my delighted soul  jesse go then my child and may the gracious god who blessed our fathers bless my muchloved son  david farewell my father and of this be sure that not a precept from thy honored lips shall fall by me unnoticed not one grace one venerable virtue which adorns thy daily life but i with watchful care and due observance will in mine transplant it  exit david jesse he is gone and still my aching eyes pursue and strain their orbs still longer to behold him oh who can tell when i may next embrace him who can declare the counsels of the lord or when the moment preordaind by heaven to fill his high designs may come this son this blessing of my age is set apart for high exploits the chosen instrument of alldisposing heaven for mighty deeds still i recall the day and to my mind the scene is ever present when the seer illustrious samuel to the humble shades of bethlehem came pretending sacrifice to screen his errand from the jealous king he sanctified us first me and my sons for sanctity increased should still precede increase of dignity when he declared he came commissioned from on high to find among the sons of jesse israels king astonishment entranced my wondering soul yet was it not a wild tumultuous bliss such rash delight as promised honors yield to light vain minds no twas a doubtful joy chastisd by timorous virtue lest a gift so splendid and so dangerous might destroy him it was meant to raise my eldest born young eliab tall of stature i presented but god who judges not by outward form but tries the heart forbad the holy prophet to choose my eldest born for saul he said gave proof that fair proportion and the grace of limb or feature ill repaid the want of virtue all my other sons alike by samuel were rejected till at last on my young boy on davids chosen head the prophet poured the consecrated oil yet never did pride elate him never did scorn for his rejected elders swell his heart not in such gentle charity to him his haughtier brothers live but all he pardons to meditation and to humble toil to prayer and praise devoted here he dwells o may the graces which adorn retreat one day delight a court record his name with saints and prophets dignify his race instruct mankind and sanctify a world  david and goliath part ii scene the camp eliab abinadab abner israelites eliab still is the event of this long war uncertain still do the adverse hosts on either side protract with lingering caution an encounter which must to one be fatal  abinadab this descent thus to the very confines of our land proclaims the sanguine hope that fires the foe in ephesdammim boldly they encamp the uncircumsised philistines pitch their tents on judahs hallowed earth  eliab full forty days has the insulting giant proud goliath the champion of philistia fiercely challenged some israelitish foe but who so vain to dare such force unequal who so bent on sure destruction to accept his terms and rush on death beneath the giant force of his enorinous bulk  abinadab it is near the time when in the adjacent valley which divides the opposing armies he is wont to make his daily challenge  eliab much i marvel brother no greetings from our father reach our ears with ease and plenty blessed he little recks the daily hardships which his sons endure but see behold his darling son approaches  abinadab how david here whence this unlooked for guest  eliab a spy upon our actions sent no doubt to scan our deeds with beardless gravity affecting wisdom to observe each word to magnify the venial faults of youth and construe harmless mirth to foul offense  enter david david all hail my dearest brothers  eliab means thy greeting true love or arrogant scorn  david oh most true love sweet as the precious ointment which bedewed the sacred head of aaron and descended upon his hallowed vest so sweet my brothers is fond fraternal amity such love as my touched bosom feels at your approach  eliab still that fine glozing speech those holy saws and all that trick of studied sanctity of smoothturnd periods and trim eloquence which charms thy doting father but confess what do thou here is it to soothe thy pride and gratify thy vain desire to roam in quest of pleasures unallowd or come thou a willing spy to note thy brothers deeds where have thou lest those few poor straggling sheep more suited to thy ignorance and years the care of those than here to wander idly why came thou hither  david is there not a cause why that displeasure kindling in thine eye my angry brother why those taunts unkind not idly bent on sport not to delight mine eye with all this gay parade of war to gratify a roving appetite or fondly to indulge a curious ear with any tale of rumor am i come but to approve myself a loving brother i bring the blessing of your aged sire with gifts of such plain cates and rural viands as fuit his frugal fortune tell me now where the bold captain of your host encamps  eliab wherefore enquire what boots it thee to know behold him there great abner famed in arms  david i bring thee mighty abner from my father a simple shepherd swain in yonder vale such humble gists as shepherd swains bestow  abner thanks gentle youth with pleasure i receive the grateful offering why does thy quick eye thus wander with unsatisfied delight  david new as i am to all the trade of war each sound has novelty each thing i see attracts attention every noise i hear awakes confused emotions indistinct yet full of charming tumult sweet distraction it is all delightful hurry oh the joy of young ideas painted on the mind in the warm glowing colors fancy spreads on objects not yet known when all is new and all is lovely ah what warlike sound salutes my ravished ear sound of trumpet abner it is the philistine proclaiming by his herald through the ranks his near approach each morning he repeats his challenge to our bands  david ha what philistine who is he  eliab wherefore ask for thy raw youth and rustic ignorance twere fitter learn some rural art some secret to prevent contagion in thy flocks some better means to save their fleece immaculate these mean arts of soft inglorious peace far better suit thy low obscurity than thus to seek high things pertaining to exploits of arms  david urged as i am i will not answer thee who conquers his own spirit o my brother he is the only conqueror  again that shout mysterious pray you tell me who this proud philistine is who sends defiance to israels hardy chieftains  abner stranger youth so lovely and so mild is thy demeanor so gentle and so patient such the air of candor and of courage which adorns thy blooming features thou have won my love and i will tell thee  david mighty abner thanks  abner thrice and no more he sounds his daily rule this man of war this champion of philistia is of the sons of anaks giantrace goliath is his name his fearful stature unparalled in israel measures more than twice two cubits on his towering head a helm of burnished brass the giant wears so ponderous it would crush the stoutest man in all our hosts a coat of mailed armor guards his capacious trunk compared with which the amplest oak that spreads his rugged arms in bashans groves were small about his neck a shining corslet hangs on his vast thigh the plaited cuirass firmly jointed stands but who shall tell the wonders of his spear and hope to gain belief of massive iron its tempered frame not less than the broad beam to which the busy weaver hangs his loom not to be wielded by a mortal hand save by his own an armorbearer walks before this mighty champion in his hand bearing the giants shield thrice every morn his herald sounds the trumpet of defiance offering at once to end the longdrawn war in single combat against that hardy foe who dares encounter him  david say mighty abner what are the haughty terms of his defiance  abner proudly he stalks around the extremest bouds of elahs valley his herald sounds the note of offered battle then the furious giant with such a voice as from the troubled sky in vollied thunder breaks thus sends his challenge why do you set your battle in array ye men of israel wherefore waste the lives of needless thousands why protract a war which may at once be ended are not you servants to saul your king and am not i with triumph let me speak it a philistine choose out a man from all your armed hosts of courage most approved and i will meet him his single arm to mine the event of this shall fix the fate of israel and philistia if victory favor him then will we live your tributary slaves but if my arm be crowned with conquest you shall then live ours give me a man if your effeminate bands a man can boast your armies i desy  david what shall be done to him who shall subdue this vile idolator  abner he shall receive such ample bounties such profuse rewards as might inflame chill age or cowardice were not the odds so desperate  david say what are they  abner the royal saul has promised that bold hero who shall encounter and subdue goliath all dignity and favor that his house shall be set free from tribute and ennobled with the first honors israel has to give and for the gallant conqueror himself no less a recompense than the fair princess our monarchs peerless daughter  david beauteous michal it is indeed a boon which kings might strive for and has none answered yet this bold defiance what all this goodly host of israelites gods own peculiar people all afraid to assert gods injured honor and their own the king himself who in his early youth wrought deeds of fame the princely jonathan not so the gallant youth philistia feared at bozez and at seneh   samuel xiv  when the earth shook from her deep foundations to behold the wondrous carnage of his single hand on the uncircumsised when he exclaimed with glorious confidence  shall numbers awe me god will protect his own with him to save it boots not friends by many or by few this was an hero why does he delay to meet this boaster for thy courtesy thrice noble abner i am bound to thank thee would thou complete thy generous offices i dare not ask it  abner speak thy wishes freely my soul inclines to serve thee  david then o abner conduct me to the king there is a cause will justify this boldness  eliab braggard hold  abner i take thee at thy word and will with speed conduct thee to my royal masters presence in yonder tent the anxious monarch waits the event of this days challenge  david noble abner accept my thanks now to thy private ear if so thy grace permit i will unfold my secret soul and ease my laboring breast which pants with high designs and beats for glory  david and goliath part iii scene readiness tent saul why was i made a king what i have gained in envied greatness and uneasy power i have lost in peace of mind in virtue lost why did deceitful transports fire my soul when samuel placed upon my youthful brow the crown of israel i had known content nay happiness if happiness unmixed to mortal man were known had i still lived among the humble tents of benjamin a shepherds occupation was my joy and every guiltless day was crowned with peace but now a sullen cloud for ever hangs over the faint sunshine of my brightest hours darkning the golden promise of the morn i never shall taste the dear domestic joys my meanest subjects know true i have sons whose virtues would have charmed a private man and drawn down blessings on their humble sire i love their virtues too buttis a love which jealousy has poisoned jonathan is all a fathers fondness could conceive of amiable and good  of that no more he is too popular the people dote upon thingenuous graces of his youth cursed popularity which makes a father detest the merit of a son he loves how did their fond idolatry perforce rescue his sentenced life when doomed by lot to perish at bethaven   samuel xiv  for the breach of strict injunction that of all my bands not one that day should taste of food and live my subjects clamor at this tedious war yet of my numerous armed chiefs not one has courage to engage this man of gath o for a champion bold enough to face this giantboaster whose repeated threats strike through my inmost soul there was a time  of that no more  i am not what i was should valiant jonathan accept the challenge it would but increase his favor with the people and make the crown sit loosely on my brow ill could my wounded spirit brook the voice of harsh comparison twixt sire and son  saul abner abner what meditation holds thee thus engaged o king and keeps thine active spirit bound when busy war far others cares demands than ruminating thought and pale despair  saul abner draw near my weary soul sinks down beneath the heavy pressure of misfortune o for

greatness ever springs from low beginnings that very nile thou mentionst whose broad stream bears fruitfulness and health through many a clime from an unknown penurious scanty source took its first rise the forest oak which shades thy sultry troops in many a toilsome march once an unheeded acorn lay o king who never begins can never ought atchieve of glorious thou thyself wast once unknown till fair occasion brought thy worth to light sublimer views inspire my youthful heart than human praise i seek to vindicate the insulted honor of the god thou servst  abner it is nobly said  saul i love thy spirit youth but dare not trust thy inexperiencd arm against a giants might the sight of blood though brave thou feelst when peril is not nigh will pale thy ardent cheek  david not so o king this youthful arm has been imbrued in blood though yet no blood of man has ever stained it thy servants occupation is a shepherd with jealous care i watched my fathers flock a brindled lion and a furious bear forth from the thicket rushed upon the fold seized a young lamb and tore their bleating spoil urged by compassion for my helpless charge i felt a newborn vigor nerve my arm and eager on the foaming monsters rushed the famished lion by his griesly beard enraged i caught and smote him to the ground the panting monster struggling in my gripe shook terribly his bristling mane and lashed his own gaunt goary sides fiercely he ground his gnashing teeth and rolled his starting eyes bloodshot with agony then with a groan that waked the echoes of the mountain died nor did his grim associate scape my arm thy servant slew the lion and the bear i killed them both and bore their shaggy spoils in triumph home and shall i fear to meet the uncircumsised philistine no that god who saved me from the bears destructive fang and hungry lions jaw will not he save me from this idolater  saul he will he will go noble youth be valiant and be blessed the god thou servst will shield thee in the fight and nerve thy arm with more than mortal strength  abner so the bold nazarite sampson see judges chap xiv a lion slew an earnest of his victories over philistia  saul go abner see the youth be well equipped with shield and spear be it thy care to grace him with all the fit accoutrements of war the choicest mail from my rich armory take and gird upon his thigh my own tried sword of noblest tempered steel  abner i shall obey  david pardon o king the coat of plaited mail these limbs have never known it would not shield twoud but encumber one who never felt the weight of armor  saul take thy wish my son thy sword then and the god of jacob guard thee  david and goliath part iv scene another part of the camp david eternal justice in whose awful scale the event of battle hangs eternal mercy whose universal beam illumines all if by thy attributes i may unblamd address thee lord of glory hear me now o teach these hands to war these arms to fight thou ever present help in time of need let thy broad mercy as a shield defend and let thine everlasting arms support me then though the heathen rage i shall not fear jehovah be my buckler mighty lord thou who have deigned by humble instruments to manifest the marvels of thy might be present with me now it is thine own cause thy wisdom will foresee thy goodness choose and thy omnipotence will execute thy high designs though by a seeble arm i feel a secret impulse drive me on and my soul springs impatient for the fight it is not the heated spirits or warm blood of sanguine youth and yet i pant i burn to meet the insulting foe i thirst for glory yet not the fading glory of renown the perishable praise of mortal man  david eliab israelites eliab what do i hear thou truant thou have dared even to the awful presence of the king bear thy presumption  david he who fears the lord shall boldly stand before the face of kings and shall not be ashamed  eliab but what wild dream has urged thee to this deed of desperate rashness thou mean so have i learned to meet goliath his single arm to thine  david it is what i mean even on this spot each moment i expect his wished approach  eliab go home return for shame nor madly pull destruction on thy head thy doting father when thy shepherds coat drenched in thy blood is brought him will lament and rend his furrowed cheek and silver hair as if some mighty loss had touched his age and mourn even as the partial patriarch mourned when josephs bloody garment he received from his less dear not less deserving sons but whence that glittering ornament which hangs useless upon thy thigh  david it is the kings gift but thou art right it suits not me my brother nor sword i mean to wear nor spear to poize lest men should say i put my trust in ought save an eternal shield  eliab then thou indeed art bent to seek thy death  david and what is death is it so terrible to die my brother or grant it terrible say is it not inevitable too if by eluding death when some high duty calls us forth to die we could for ever shun it and escape the universal lot then fond selflove then human prudence boldly might produce their finespun arguments their learned harangues their cobweb arts their phrase sophistical their subtle doubts and all the specious trick of eloquent cunning laboring for its end but since however protracted death will come why fondly study with ingenious pains to put it off  to breathe a little longer is to defer our fate but not to shun it small gain which wisdom with indiffrent eye beholds why wish to drink the bitter dregs of lifes exhausted chalice whose last runnings even at the best are vapid why not die if heaven so will in manhoods opening bloom when all the flush of life is gay about us when sprightly youth with many a newborn joy solicits every sense so may we then present a sacrifice unmeet indeed ah how unmeet but more acceptable than the worlds leavings than a wornout heart by vice enfeebled and by vain desires sunk and exhausted  eliab

ample disk protends but soft what unknown prodigy appears a moving mountain cased in polished brass  eliab  getting behind david how is this thou do not tremble thy firm joints betray no fear thy accents are not broken thy cheek retains its red thine eye its luster he comes more near do thou not fear him now  david no the vast colossal statue nor inspires respect nor fear mere magnitude of form without proportioned intellect and valor nor strikes my soul with reverence nor with awe  eliab near and more near he comes i hold it rash to stay so near him and expose a life which may hereafter serve the state farewell  exit goliath advances clad in complete armor one bearing his shield precedes him the opposing armies are seen at a distance drawn up on each side of the valley

victorking what general drenched in blood claims this high privilege what are his rights what proud credentials does the boaster bring to prove his claim what cities laid in ashes what ruined provinces what slaughtered realms what heads of heroes and what hearts of kings in battle killed or at his altars slain has he to boast is his bright armoury thick set with spears and swords and coats of mail of vanquished nations by his single arm subdued where is the mortal man so bold so much a wretch so out of love with life to dare the weight of this uplifted spear which never fell innoxious

orator vain boy keep close to that same bloodless war of words and thou shall still be safe tonguevaliant warrior where is thy sylvan crook with garlands hung of idle fieldflowers where thy wanton harp thou daintyfingerd hero better strike its note lascivious or the lulling lute touch softly than provoke the trumpets rage i will not stain the honor of my spear with thy inglorious blood shall

inglorious day when your weak hosts at   samuel chap v ebenezer pitched their quickabandond tents then when your ark your talisman your charm your boasted pledge of safety and success was tamely lost and yet not tamely since by me twas won when with this good rightarm i thinnd your ranks and bravely crushed beneath a single blow the chosen guardians of this vaunted shrine hophni commentators say that the chaldee paraphrase makes goliath boast that he had killed hophni and phineas and taken the ark prisoner and phineas the famed ark itself i bore to ashdod  david i remember too since thou provokst the unwelcome truth how all your blushing priests beheld their idols shame when prostrate dagon fell before the ark and your frail god was shivered then philistia idolatrous philistia flew for succor to israels help and all her smitten nobles confessed the lord was god and the blessed ark gladly with reverential awe restored  goliath by ashdods fane thou lie now will i meet thee thou insectwarrior since thou dare me thus already i behold thy mangled limbs disseverd each from each ever long to feed the fierce bloodsnuffing vulture mark me well around my spear i will twist thy shining locks and toss in air thy head all gashd with wounds thy lips yet quivering with the dire convulsion of recent death art thou not terrified  david no true courage is not moved by breath of words but the rash bravery of boiling blood impetuous knows no settled principle a sevrish tide it has its ebbs and flows as spirits rise or fall as wine inflames or circumstances change but inborn courage the generous child of fortitude and faith holds its firm empire in the constant soul and like the steadfast pole star never once from the same fixed and faithful point declines  goliath the curses of philistias gods be on thee this finedrawn speech is meant to lengthen out that little life thy words pretend to scorn  david ha say thou so come on then mark us well thou come to me with sword and spear and shield in the dread name of israels god i come the living lord of hosts whom thou defyst yet though no shield i bring no arms except these five smooth stones i gathered from the brook with such a simple sling as shepherds use yet all exposed defenseless as i am the god i serve shall give thee up a prey to my victorious arm this day i mean to make the uncircumcised tribes confess there is a god in israel i will give thee spite of thy vaunted strength and giant bulk to glut the carrion kites nor thee alone the mangled carcasses of your thick hosts shall spread the plains of elah till philistia through all her trembling tents and flying bands shall own that judahs god is god indeed i dare thee to the trial  goliath follow me in this good spear i trust  david i

midnight arts of wizard sorcery that i could call the slumbering spirit from the shades of hell or like chaldean sages could foreknow the event of things unacted i might then anticipate my fortune how i am fallen the sport of vain chimeras the weak slave of fear and sickly fancy coveting to know the arts which foul diviners use thick blood and moping melancholy lead to baleful superstition that fell fiend whose withering charms blast the fair bloom of virtue why did my wounded pride with scorn reject the wholesome truths which holy samuel told me why drive him from my presence he might now raise my sunk soul and my benighted mind enlighten with religions cheering ray he dared to menace me with loss of empire and i for that bold honesty dismissed him another shall possess thy throne he cried a stranger this unwelcome prophecy has lined my crown and strewn my couch with thorns each ray of opening merit i discern in friend or foe distracts my troubled soul lest he should prove my rival but this morn even my young champion lovely as he looked in blooming valor struck me to the soul with jealousys barbd dart o jealousy thou ugliest fiend of hell thy deadly venom preys on my

lingering foot has long deceived me  abner king of israel hail now thou art king indeed the youth has conquered goliaths slain  saul oh speak thy tale again lest my fond ears deceive me  abner thy young champion has slain the giant  saul then god is gracious still in spite of my offenses but good abner how was it tell me all where is my champion quick let me press him to my grateful heart and

center of the camp they stood the opposing armies ranged on either side in proud array the haughty giant stalked stately across the valley next the youth with modest confidence advanced nor pomp nor gay parade nor martial ornament his graceful form adorned goliath strait with solemn state began the busy work of dreadful preparation in one place his closely jointed mail an opening left for air and only one the watchful youth marked that the beaver of his helm was up meanwhile the giant such a blow devised as would have crushed him this the youth perceived and from his welldirected sling he hurled with dextrous aim a stone which sunk deep lodged in the capacious forehead of the foe then with a cry as loud and terrible as lybian lions roaring for their young quite stunned the furious giant staggered reeled and fell the mighty mass of man sell prone with its own weight his shattered bulk was bruised his clattering arms rung dreadful through the field and the firm basis of the solid earth shook chokd with blood and dust he cursed his gods and died blaspheming strait the victor youth drew from its sheath the giants ponderous sword and from the enormous trunk the goary head furious in death he severed the grim visage looked threatening still and still frowned horribly  saul o glorious deed o valiant conqueror  abner the youth so calm appeared so nobly firm so cool yet so intrepid that these eyes neersaw such temperate valor so chastid neersaw such temperate valor so chastisd by modesty  saul thou dwellst upon his praise with needless circumstance twas nobly done but

disordered fly while shouts of loud acclaim pursue their brave deliverer lo he comes bearing the giants head and shining sword his wellearnd trophies  saul abner david david bearing goliaths head and

praise thy gallant deeds deserve  david o mighty king sweet is the breath of praise when given by those whose own high merit claims the praise they give but let not this one fortunate event by heaven

was stayed and the bright sun arrested in his course stupendously stood still  chorus of jews i what ailed thee that thou stoodst still o sun nor did thy flaming orb decline and thou o moon in ajalons dark vale why did thou long beyond thy period shine ii was it at joshuas dread command the leader of the ifraelitish band yes  at a mortal bidding both stood still twas joshuas word but twas jehovahs will iii what allcontrouling hand had force to stop eternal natures constant course the wandering moon to one fixed spot confine but he whose fiat bade the planets shine daniel oh thou who when thy discontented host tired of jehovahs rule desired a king in anger gavst them saul and then again did wrest the regal scepter from his hand to give it david  david best beloved illustrious david poet

barbaric kings behold with all their shining gems their burnished gold a fane so perfect bright and fair for god himself was wont to inhabit there between the cherubim his glory stood while the high priest alone the dazzling splendour viewed how fondly did the tyrian artist strive his name to latest time should live such wealth the stranger wondered to behold gold were the tablets and the vases gold of cedar such an ample store exhausted lebanon could yield no more bending before the ruler of the sky well might the royal founder cry filled with an holy dread a reverend fear will god in very deed inhabit here the heaven of heavens beneath his feet is for the bright inhabitant unmeet archangels prostrate wait his high commands and will he deign to dwell in temples made with hands daniel

his servants the priests of wretched idols made with hands show contumelious scorn  daniel it is heavens high will  second jew if i forget thee o jerusalem if i not fondly cherish thy loved image even in the giddy hour of thoughtless mirth if i not rather view thy prostrate walls than haughty babylons imperial towers then may my tongue refuse to frame the strains of sweetest harmony my rude right hand forget with sounds symphonious to accord the harp of jesses son to sions songs  first jew often on euphrates ever verdant banks where drooping willows form a mournful shade with all the pride which prosperous fortunes give and all the unfeeling mirth of happy men the insulting babylonians ask a song such songs as erst in better days were sung by korahs sons or heavntaught asaph set to loftiest measures then our bursting hearts feel all their woes afresh the galling chain of bondage crushes then the freeborn soul with wringing anguish from the trembling lip the unfinished cadence falls and the big tear while it relieves betrays the woefraught soul for who can view euphrates pleasant stream its drooping willows and its verdant banks and not to wounded memory recall the piny groves of fertile palaestine the vales of solyma and jordans stream  daniel firm faith and deep submission to high heaven will teach us to endure without a murmur what seems so hard think what the

affliction yes be witness heaven old as i am i will not shrink at death come in what shape it may if god so will by peril to confirm and prove my faith oh i would dare yon den of hungry lions rather

blessed use they were devoted preserve them from pollution and once more in his own gracious time restore the temple  daniel i with some favored youths of jewish race was lodged in his own palace and instructed in all the various learning of the east but he on whose great name our fathers called preserved us from the perils of a court and warned us to avoid the tempting cates pernicious luxry offered to our taste fell luxury more perilous to youth than storms or quicksands poverty or chains  second jew he who can guard against the low baits of sense will find temptations arrows hurtless strike against the brazen shield of temperance for it is thinferior appetites enthrall the man and quench the immortal light within him the senses take the soul an easy prey and sink the imprisoned spirit into brute  daniel twice daniel chap ii and iv  by the spirit of god did i expound the visions of the king his soul was touched and twice did he repent and prostrate fall before the god of daniel yet again power flattery and prosperity undid him when from the lofty ramparts of his palace he viewed the splendors of the royal city that magazine of wealth which proud euphrates wafts from each distant corner of the earth when he beheld the admantine towers the brazen gates the bulwarks of his strength the pendent gardens arts stupendous work the wonder of the world  the proud chaldean mad with the insolence of boundless wealth and power supreme conceived himself a god this mighty babylon is mine he cried  my wondrous power my godlike arm achieved it i scorn submission own no deity

but pleasure with a constant flame consumes war slays her thousands but destructive pleasure more fell more fatal her ten thousands slays the young luxurious king she fondly wooes in every shape of amorous blandishment with adulation smooth ensnares his soul with love betrays him and with wine inflames she strews her magic poppies over his couch and with delicious opiates charms him down in fatal slumbers bound though babylon is now invested by the warlike troops of the young cyrus persias valiant prince who in conjunction with the median king darius famed for conquest now prepares to storm the city not the impending horrors which ever wait a siege have power to wake to thought or sense thintoxicated king  daniel even in this night of universal dread a mighty army threatening at the gates this very night as if in scorn of danger the dissolute belshazzar holds a feast magnificently impious meant to honor belus the favorite babylonish idol lewd parasites compose his wanton court whose impious flattries soothe his monstrous crimes they justify his vices and extol his boastful phrase as if he were some god whatever he says they say what he commands implicitly they do they echo back his blasphemies with shouts of loud acclaim and when he wounds the tortured ear of virtue they cry all hail belshazzar live for ever tonight a thousand nobles fill his hall princes and all the dames who grace the court all but the virtuous queen sage nitocris ah how unlike the impious king her son she never mingles in the midnight fray nor crowns the guilty banquet with her presence the royal fair is rich in every virtue which can adorn the queen or grace the woman but for the wisdom of her prudent counsels this wretched empire had been long undone not famed semiramis assyrias pride could boast a brighter mind or firmer soul beneath the gentle reign of   kings chap xxv merodach her royal lord our nation tasted peace our captive monarch sad jehoiachin grown gray in a close prisons horrid gloom he freed from bondage brought the hoary king to taste once more the longforgotten sweets of precious liberty and cheerful light poured in his wounds the lenient balm of kindness and blessed his settting hour of life with peace  sound of trumpets is heard at a distance first jew that sound proclaims the banquet is begun  second jew hark the licentious uproar grows more loud the vaulted roof resounds with shouts of mirth and the firm palace shakes retire my friends this madness is not meet for sober ears if any of our race were found so near twoud but expose us to the rude attack of ribaldry obscene and impious jests from these mad sons of belial now inflamed to deeds of riot from the wanton feast  daniel here part we then but when again to meet who knows save heaven yet o my friends i an impulse more than human stir my breast rapt in prophetic see the prophecies of isaiah chap xlvii and others vision i behold things hid as yet from mortal sight i see the dart of vengeance tremble in the air ere long to pierce the impious king even now the fierce destroying angel stalks abroad and brandishes aloft the twoedged sword of retribution keen he soon will strike and babylon shall weep as sion wept pass but a little while and you shall see this queen of cities prostrate on the earth this haughty mistress of the kneeling world how shall she sit dishonored in the dust in tarnishd pomp and solitary woe how shall she shroud her glories in the dark and in opprobrious silence hide her head lament o virgin daughter of chaldea for thou shall sall imperial queen shall fall no more sidonian robes shall grace thy limbs to purple garments sackcloth shall succeed and sordid dust and ashes shall supply the odorous nard and cassia thou who said i am and there is none beside me thou even thou imperial babylon shall fall thy glory quite eclipsed the pleasant sound of viol and of harp shall charm no more nor song of syrian damsels shall be heard responsive to the lutes luxurious note but the hoarse bitterns cry the ravens croak the bats fell scream the lonely owls dull plaint and every hideous bird with ominous shriek shall scare affrighted silence from thy walls while desolation snatching from the hand of time the scythe of ruin sits aloft in dreadful majesty and horrid pomp glancing with sullen pride thy crumbling towers thy broken battlements and columns fallen then pointing to the mischiess she has made the fiend exclaims this once was babylon  belshazzar part ii scene the court of belshazzar the king seated on a magnificent throne princes nobles and attendants ladies of the court music  a superb banquet first courtier rises and kneels hail mighty king  second courtier belshazzar live for ever  third courtier sun of the world and light of kings all hail  fourth courtier with lowest reverence such as best becomes the humblest creatures of imperial power behold a thousand nobles bend before thee princes far famed and dames of high descent yet all this pride of wealth this boast of beauty shrinks into naught before thine awful eye and lives or dies as the king frowns or smiles  belshazzar this is such homage as becomes your love and suits the mighty monarch of mankind  fifth courtier the bending world should prostrate thus before thee and pay not only praise but adoration  belshazzar rises and comes forward let dull philosophy preach selfdenial let envious poverty and snarling age proudly declaim against the joys they know not let the deluded jews who fondly hope some fancied heaven hereafter mortify and lose the actual blessings of this world to purchase others which may never come our gods may promise less but give us more ill could my ardent spirit be content with meagre abstinence and hungry hope let those misjudging israelites who want the nimble spirits and the active soul call their blunt feelings virtue let them drudge in regular progression through the round of formal duty and of daily toil and when they want the genius to be blessed believe their harsh austerity is goodness if there be gods they meant we should be happy why give us else these appetites to be so and why the means to crown them with indulgence to burst the feeble bonds which hold the vulgar is noble daring  first courtier and is therefore worthy the high imperial spirit of belshazzar  second courtier behold a banquet which the gods might share  belshazzar tonight my friends your monarch shall be blessed with every various joy tonight is ours nor shall the envious gods who view our bliss and sicken as they view tonight disturb us bring all the richest spices of the east the odorous cassia and the dropping myrrh the liquid amber and the fragrant gums rob gilead of its balms belshazzar bids and leave the arabian groves without an odor bring freshest flowers exhaust the blooming spring twine the green myrtle with the shortlived rose and ever as the blushing garland fades well learn to snatch the fugitive delight and grasp the flying joy ere it escape us come  fill the smiling goblet for the king belshazzar will not let a moment pass unmarked by some enjoyment the full bowl let every guest partake  courtiers kneel and drink first courtier here is to the king light of the world and glory of the earth whose word is fate  belshazzar yes we are likest gods when we have power and use it what is wealth but the blessed means to gratify desire i will not have a wish a hope a thought that shall not know fruition what is empire the privilege to punish and enjoy to feel our power in making others fear it to taste of pleasures cup till we grow giddy and think ourselves immortal this is empire my ancestors scarce tasted of its joys shut from the sprightly world and all its charms in cumbrous majesty in sullen state and dull unsocial dignity they lived far from the sight of an admiring world that world whose gaze makes half the charms of greatness they nothing knew of empire but the name or saw it in the looks of trembling slaves and all they felt of royalty was care but i will see and know it of myself youth wealth and greatness court me to be blessed and power and pleasure draw with equal force and sweet attraction both i will embrace with fond delight but this is pleasures day ambition will have time to reign hereafter it is the proper appetite of age the lust of power shall lord it uncontrolled when all the generous feelings grow obtuse and stern dominion holds with rigid hand his iron rein and sits and sways alone but youth is pleasures hour  first courtier perish the slave who with officious counsel would oppose the kings desire whose slightest wish is law  belshazzar now strike the loudtond lyre and softer lute let me have music with the nobler aid of poesy where are those cunning men who boast by chosen sounds and measured sweetness to set the busy spirits in a flame and cool them at their will who know the art to call the hidden powers of numbers forth and make that pliant instrument the mind yield to the powerful sympathy of sound obedient to the masters artful hand such magic is in song then give me song yet not at first such souldissolving strains as melt the softened sense but such bold measures as may inflame my spirit to despise the ambitious persian that presumptuous boy who rashly dares even now invest our city and menaces the invincible belshazzar  a grand concert of music after which an ode in vain shall persian cyrus dare with great belshazzar wage unequal war in vain darius shall combine darius leader of the median line while fair euphrates stream our walls protects and great belshazzars self our fate directs war and famine threat in vain while this demigod shall reign let persias prostrate king confess his power and medias monarch dread his vengeful hour on duras daniel chap iii ample plain behold immortal belus see a very fine description of the temple of this idol  the towering fane of bell chaldean jove surpassing far that doric temple which the elean chiefs raised to their thunderer from the spoils of war or that ionic where the ephesian bowed to dian queen of heaven eight towers arise each above each immeasurable height a monument at once of eastern pride and slavish superstition etc etc judah restored book i  whom the nations own sublime he stands in burnished gold and richest offerings his bright altars crown tonight his deity we here adore and due libations speak his mighty power yet belus self not more we own than great pelshazzar on chaldeas throne great belshazzar like a god rules the nations with a nod to great belshazzar be the goblet crowned belshazzars name the echoing roofs rebound belshazzar enough the kindling rapture fires my brain and my heart dances to the flattering sounds i feel myself a god why not a god what were the deities our fathers worshipped what was great nimrod our imperial founder what greater belus to whose power divine we raise tonight the banquet and the song but youthful heroes mortal like myself who by their daring earned divinity they were but men nay some were less than men though now revered as gods what was anubis whom egypts sapient sons adore a dog and shall not i young valiant and a king dare more do more be greater than the rest i will indulge the thought  fill me more wine to cherish and exalt the young idea he drinks never did olympian jupiter himself quaff such immortal draughts  first courtier what could that cannan that heaven in hope that nothing in possession that airbuilt bliss of the deluded jews that promised land of milk and flowing honey what could that fancied paradise bestow to match these generous juices  belshazzar hold  enough thou have roused a thought by heaven i will enjoy it a glorious thought which will exalt to rapture the pleasures of the banquet and bestow a yet untasted relish of delight  first courtier what means the king  belshazzar the jews said thou the jews  first courtier i spoke of that undone that outcast people the tributary creatures of thy power the captives of thy will whose very breath hangs on the sovereign pleasure of the king  belshazzar when that abandoned race was hither brought were not the choicest treasures of their temple devoted to their god and held most precious among the spoils which graced the name of nebuchadnezzar not being reducible to verse i have adopted that of nebassar on the authority of the ingenious and learned author of judah restored nebassars triumph and lodged in babylon  first courtier o king they were  second courtier the jews with superstitious awe behold these sacred symbols of their ancient faith nor has captivity abated ought the reverend love they bear these holy relics though we deride their law and scorn their persons yet never have we yet to human use devoted these rich vessels set apart to sacred purposes  belshazzar i joy to hear it go  fetch them hither they shall grace our banquet does no one stir belshazzar disobeyed and yet you live whence comes this strange reluctance this newborn reverence for the helpless jews this fear to injure those who cannot revenge it send to the sacred treasury in haste let all be hither brought  who answers dies they go out the mantling wine a higher joy will yield poured from the precious flaggons which adorned their farfamd temple now in ashes laid oh twill exalt the pleasure into transport to gall those whining praying israelites i laugh to think what wild dismay will seize them when they shall learn the use that has been made of all their holy trumpery  the vessels are brought in second courtier it comes a goodly show how bright with gold and gems far fitter for a youthful monarchs board than the cold shrine of an unheeding god  belshazzar fill me that massy goblet to the brim now abraham let thy wretched race expect the fable of their faith to be fulfilled their second temple and their promised king now will they see he is impotent to save for had he power to help he would have hindered this profanation  as the king is going to drink thunder is heard he starts from the throne spies a hand which writes on the wall these words mean mean tekel upharsin he lets fall the goblet and stands in an attitude of speechless horror all start and are terrified first courtier after a long pause oh transcendent horror  second courtier what may this mean the king is greatly moved  third courtier nor is it strange  who unappalld can view it those sacred cups i doubt we have gone too far  first courtier observe the fearstruck king his starting eyes roll horribly thrice he essayed to speak and thrice his tongue refused  belshazzar in a low trembling voice ye mystic words thou semblance of an hand illusive forms ye dire fantastic images what are ye dread shadows speak explain your horrible meaning ye will not answer me  yes yes i feel i am a mortal now  my failing limbs refuse to bear me up i am no god gods do not tremble thus  support me hold me these loosendjoints these knees which smite each other betray i am but a man  a weak one too  first courtier in truth it is passing strange and full of horror  belshazzar send for the learned magicians every sage who deals in wizard spells and magic charms  some go out first courtier how fares my lord the king  belshazzar am i a king what power have i ye lying slaves i am not oh souldistracting sight but is it real perhaps it is fancy all or the wild dream of mad distemperature the fumes of wine i will look upon it no more  so  now i am well i am a king again and know not fear and yet my eyes will seek that fatal spot and fondly dwell upon the sight that blasts them again it is there it is not fancys work i see it still it is written on the wall i see the writing but the viewless writer who what is he oh horror horror horror it cannot be the god of these poor jews for what is he that he can thus afflict  second courtier let not my lord the king be thus dismayed  third courtier let not a phantom an illusive shade disturb the peace of him who rules the world  belshazzar no more ye wretched sycophants no more the sweetest note which flattery now can strike harsh and discordant grates upon my soul talk not of power to one so full of fear so weak so impotent look on that wall if thou would sooth my soul explain the writing and thou shall be my oracle my god tell me from whence it came and what it means and i will believe i am again a king friends princes ease my troubled breast and say what do the mystic characters portend  first courtier it is not in us o king to ease thy spirit we are not skilled in those mysterious arts which wait the midnight studies of the sage but of the deep diviners thou shall learn the wise astrologers the sage magicians who of events unborn take secret note and hold deep commerce with the unseen world  enter astrologers magicians etc etc belshazzar approach ye sages it is the king commands  they kneel astrologers hail

skill our empire shall be taxed for his reward and he himself shall name the gift he wishes a splendid scarlet robe shall grace his limbs his neck a princely chain of gold adorn meet honors for such wisdom he shall rule the third in rank throughout our babylon  second astrologer such recompense becomes belshazzars bounty let the king speak the secret of his soul which heard his humble creatures

where is your boasted skill they confer together keep them asunder  no confedracy  no secret plots to make your tales agree speak slaves and dare to let me know the worst  first astrologer they kneel o let the king forgive his faithful servants   second astrologer o mitigate our threatened doom of death if we declare with mingled grief and shame we cannot tell the secret of the king nor what these mystic characters portend  belshazzar off with their heads ye shall not live an hour curse on your shallow arts your lying science it is thus you practice on the credulous world who think you wise because themselves are weak but miscreants ye shall die the power to punish is all that i have left me of a king  first courtier great sir suspend their punishment awhile behold sage nitocris thy royal mother  belshazzar my mother here  enter queen queen o my misguided son well may thou wonder to behold me here for i have ever shunned this scene of riot where wild intemperance and dishonored mirth hold festival impure yet o belshazzar i could not hear the wonders which befell and leave thee to the workings of despair for spite of all the anguish of my soul at thy offenses i am thy mother still against the solemn prupose i had formed never to mix in this unhallowed crowd the wondrous story of the mystic writing of strange and awful import brings me here if happily i may show some likely means to fathom this dark mystery  belshazzar speak o queen my listening soul shall hang upon thy words and prompt obedience follow them  queen then hear me among the captive tribes which hither came to grace nebassars triumph there was brought a youth named daniel favored by high heaven with power to look into the secret page of dim futuritys mysterious volume the spirit of the holy gods is in him no vision so obscure no fate so dark no sentence so perplexed but he can solve it can trace each crooked labyrinth of thought each winding maze of doubt and make it clear and palpable to sense he twice explained the monarchs mystic dreams the holy seer saw with prophetic spirit what befell the king long after for his wondrous skill he was rewarded honored and caressed and with the rulers of chaldea ranked though now alas thrown by his services forgotten or neglected such the meed which virtue finds in courts  belshazzar dispatch with speed a message to command the holy man to meet us on the instant  nitocris i already have sent to ask his presence at the palace and lo he comes  enter daniel belshazzar welcome thrice venerable sage approach art thou that daniel whom my great forefather brought hither with the captive tribes of judah  daniel i am that daniel  belshazzar pardon holy prophet nor let a just resentment of thy wrongs and long neglected merit shut thy heart against a kings request a suppliant king  daniel the god i worship teaches to forgive  belshazzar then let thy words bring comfort to my soul i have heard the spirit of the gods is in thee that thou can look into the fates of men with prescience more than human  daniel hold o king wisdom is from above it is gods own gift i of myself am nothing but from him the little knowledge i possess i hold to him be all the glory  belshazzar then o daniel if thou indeed do boast that wondrous gift that faculty divine look there and tell me o say what mean those mystic characters remove this load of terror from my soul and honors such as kings can give await thee thou shall be great beyond thy souls ambition and rich above thy wildest dream of wealth clad in the scarlet robe our nobles wear and graced with princely ensigns thou shall stand near our own throne and third within our empire  daniel o mighty king thy gifts with thee remain and let thy high rewards on others fall the princely ensign nor the scarlet robe nor yet to be the third within thy realm can touch the soul of daniel honor fame all that the world calls great thy crown itself could never satisfy the vast ambition of an immortal spirit which aspires to an eternal crown a crown of glory  first courtier aside our priests teach no such notions  daniel yet o king though all unmoved by grandeur or by gift i will unfold the high decrees of heaven and strait declare the mystery  belshazzar speak o prophet  daniel prepare to hear what kings have seldom heard prepare to hear what these have never told thee prepare to hear the truth the mighty god who rules the sceptres and the hearts of kings gave thy renowned nebuchadnezzar forefather here to reign with such extent of empire weight of power and greatness of dominion the wide earth trembled beneath the terror of his name and kingdoms stood or fell as he decreed oh dangerous pinnacle of power supreme who can stand safe upon its treacherous top behold the gazing prostrate world below whom depth and distance into pigmies shrink and not grow giddy babylons great king forgot he was a man a helpless man subject to pain and sin and death like others but who shall fight against omnipotence or who has hardened his obdurate heart against the majesty of heaven and prosperd the god he had insulted was avenged from empire from the joys of social life he drove him forth extinguished reasons lamp quenched that bright spark of deity within compelled him with the forest brutes to roam for scanty pasture and the mountain dews fell cold and wet on his defenseless head till he confessed  let men let monarchs hear  till he confessed pride was not made for man  nitocris o awful instance of divine displeasure  belshazzar proceed my soul is wrapped in fixed attention  daniel o king thy grandsire not in vain had sinned if from his error thou had learnt the truth the story of his fall thou often have heard but has it taught thee wisdom thou like him have been elate with power and mad with pride like him thou have defied the living god nay to bold thoughts have added deeds more bold thou have outwrought the pattern he bequeathed thee and quite outgone example have profaned with impious hand the vessels of the temple those vessels sanctified to holiest use thou have polluted with unhallowed lips and made the instruments of foul debauch thou have adored the gods of wood and stone vile senseless deities the work of hands but he the king of kings and lord of lords in whom exists thy life thy soul thy breath on whom thy being hangs thou have denied  first courtier aside to the others with what an holy boldness he reproves him   second courtier such is the fearless confidence of virtue and such the righteous courage those maintain who plead the cause of truth the smallest word he utters had been death to half the court  belshazzar now let the mystic writing be explained thrice venerable sage  daniel o mighty king hear then its awful import god has numbered thy days of royalty and soon will end them the allwise has weighed thee in the even balance of his own holy law and finds thee wanting and last thy kingdom shall be wrested from thee and know the mede and persian shall possess it  belshazzar he starts up prophet when shall this be   daniel in gods own time here my commission ends i may not utter more than thou haft heard but o remember king thy days are numbered hear repent and live  belshazzar say prophet what can penitence avail if heavens decrees immutably are fixed can prayers avert our fate  daniel they change our hearts and thus dispose omnipotence to mercy it is man that alters god is still the same conditional are all heavens covenants and when the uplifted thunder is withheld it is prayer that deprecates the impending bolt good   chronicles chap xxxii also isaiah chap xxxviii hezekiahs days were numbered too but penitence and tears were mighty pleas at mercys throne they never plead in vain  he is going belshazzar stay prophet and receive thy promised gift the scarlet robe and princely chain are thine and let my heralds publish through the land that daniel stands in dignity and power the third in babylon these just rewards thou well may claim though sad thy prophecy  queen be not deceived my son nor let thy soul snatch an uncertain moments treacherous rest on the dread brink of that tremendous gulf which yawns beneath thee  daniel o unhappy king know what must happen once may happen soon remember that it is terrible to meet great evils unprepared and o belshazzar in the wild moment of dismay and death remember thou wast warned and o remember warnings despised are condemnations then  exeunt daniel and queen belshazzar it is well  my soul shakes off its load of care it is only the obscure is terrible imagination frames events unknown in wild fantastic shapes of hideous ruin and what it fears creates  i know the worst and awful is that worst as fear could feign but distant are the ills i have to dread what is remote may be uncertain too ha princes hope breaks in  this may not be  first courtier perhaps this daniel is in league with persia and bribed by cyrus to report these horrors to weaken and impede the mighty plans of thy imperial mind  belshazzar it is very like  second courtier return we to the banquet  belshazzar dare we venture  third courtier let not this dreaming seer disturb the king against the power of cyrus and the mede is babylon secure her brazen gates mock all attempts to force them proud euphrates a watery bulwark guards our ample city from all assailants and within the walls of this stupendous capital are lodged such vast provisions such exhaustless stores as a twice ten years siege could never waste  belshazzar embraces him

drama darius king of media and babylon pharnaces courtiers enemies to daniel soranus courtiers enemies to daniel araspes a young median lord friend and convert of daniel daniel scene the city of babylon  the subject of this drama is taken from the sixth chapter of the book of the prophet daniel  daniel part i pharnaces soranus pharnaces yes  i have noted with a jealous eye the power of this new favorite daniel reigns and not darius daniel guides the springs which move this mighty empire high he sits supreme in favor both with prince and people where is the spirit of our median lords tamely to crouch and bend the supple knee to this new god by mithras it is too much shall great arbaces race to daniel bow a foreigner a hebrew and a slave something must be devised and that right soon to shake his credit  soranus rather hope to shake the mountain pine whose twisting fibers clasp the earth deep rooted rather hope to shake the scythian taurus from his central base no  daniel sits too absolute in power too firm in favor for the keenest shaft of nicelyaiming jealousy to reach him  pharnaces rather he sits too high to sit securely have thou then lived in courts have thou grown gray beneath the mask a subtle statesman wears to hide his secret soul and do not know that of all fickle fortunes transient gifts favor is most deceitful it is a beam which darts uncertain brightness for a moment the faint precarious sickly shine of power given without merit by caprice withdrawn no trisle is so small as what obtains save that which loses it it is a breath which hangs upon a smile a look a word a frown the airbuilt tower of favor shakes and down the unsubstantial fabric falls darius just and clement as he is if i mistake not may be wrought upon by prudent wiles by flatterys pleasant cup administered with caution  soranus but the means for daniels life a foe must grant him that is so replete with goodness so adorned with every virtue so exactly squared by wisdoms nicest rules that twere most hard to charge him with the shadow of offense pure is his fame as scythias mountain snows when not a breath pollutes them o pharnaces i have scanned the actions of his daily life with all the industrious malice of a foe and nothing meets mine eye but deeds of honor in office pure for equitable acts renowned in justice and impartial truth the grecian themis is not more severe  pharnaces by yon bright sun thou blazonst forth his praise as if with rapture thou did read the page where these fair deeds are written  soranus thou mistakst i only meant to show what cause we have to hate and fear him i but meant to paint his popular virtues and his dangerous merit then for devotion and religious zeal who so renowned as daniel of his law observant in the extreme thrice every day with prostrate reverence he adores his god with superstitious awe his face he turns toward his beloved jerusalem as if some local partial god might there be found to hear his supplication no affair of state no business so importunate no pleasure so alluring no employ of such high import to seduce his zeal from this observance due  pharnaces there there he falls enough my friend his piety destroys him there at the very footstool of his god where he implores protection there i will crush him  soranus what means pharnaces  pharnaces ask not what i mean the new idea floating in my brain has yet received no form it is yet too soon to give it body circumstance or breath the seeds of mighty deeds are laboring here and struggling for a birth it is near the hour the king is wont to summon us to council ever that this big conception of my mind i will shape to form and being thou meanwhile convene our chosen friends for i shall need the aid of all your counsels and the weight of grave authority  soranus who shall be trusted  pharnaces with our immediate motive none except a chosen band of friends who most repine at daniels exaltation but the scheme i meditate must be disclosed to all who bear high office all our median rulers princes and captains presidents and lords all must assemble it is a common cause all but the young araspes he inclines to daniel and his god he sits attent with ravished ears to listen to his lore with reverence names jerusalem and reads the volume of the law no more he bows to hail the golden ruler of the day but looks for some great prophet greater far so they pretend than mithras from him therefore conceal whatever of injury is devised against daniel be it too thy care today to keep him from the council  soranus it is well thought it is now about the hour of daniels prayer araspes too is with him and today they will not sit in council haste we then designs of high importance once conceived should be accomplished genius to discern and courage to atchieve despise the aid of lingering circumspection the keen spirit seizes the prompt occasion and at once plans and performs resolves and executes  daniel part ii scene

this promise of the nations this great hope of anxious israel this mighty prophet this balm of gilead which shall heal the wounds of universal nature this messiah redeemer savior sufferer victim god  daniel enough to animate our faith we know but not enough to soothe the curious pride of vain philosophy were all revealed hope would have then no object god no fear and faith no exercise enough to cheer our path we see the rest is hid in clouds and heavens own shadows rest upon the veiw  araspes go on blessed sage i could for ever hear untird thy admonition tell me how i shall obtain the favor

strength unequalled and the shepherdking who slew the giant of gath why should i tell of holy prophets who by conquering faith wrought deeds incredible to mortal sense vanquished contending kingdoms quelled the rage of furious pestilence extinguished fire victorious faith others by thee endured exile disgrace captivity and death some uncomplaining bore nor be it deemed the meanest exercise of welltryd faith the bitter taunts of undeserved reproach despising shame that death to human pride  araspes how shall this faith be sought  daniel by earnest prayer solicit first the wisdom from above

sorcerer but from the piercing ken of deep foreknowledge from her sure science of the human heart weighing effects with causes ends with means and from the probable the certain forms with palpable conjecture  araspes now o prophet explain the secret doubts which rack my mind and my weak sense confound give me some lino to sound the depths of providence o say why the ungodly prosper why their root shoots deep and their thick branches flourish fair like the green bay tree why the righteous man like tender plants to shivering winds exposed is stripped and torn in naked virtue bare and nippd by cruel sorrows biting blast explain o daniel these mysterious ways to my faint apprehension for as yet i have much to learn fair truths immortal sun is sometimes hid in clouds not that her light is in itself defective but obscured by my weak prejudice imperfect faith and all the thousand causes which obstruct the growth of virtue  daniel follow me araspes within thou shall pursue the sacred page

has your wisdom ought devised to serve the common weal in our new empire subdued chaldea is there ought remains your prudence can suggest to serve the state to benefit the subject to redress and raise the injured to assist the oppressed and humble the oppressor if you know speak freely princes wherefore am i king except to poise the awful scale of justice with even hand to minister to want to bless the nations with a liberal rule vicegerent of the eternal oromasdes  pharnaces so absolute thy wisdom mighty king all counsel were superfluous  darius hold pharnaces no slattry prince it is the death of virtue who gives it is of all mankind the lowest save he who takes it monarchs are but men as feeble and as frail as those they rule and born like them to die the lydian king unhappy croesus lately sat aloft almost above mortality now see him sunk to the vile condition of a slave he swells the train of cyrus i like him to misery am obnoxious see this throne this very throne the great nebuchadnezzar nebassar filled yet hence his pride expelled him yonder wall the dread terrific writing to the eyes of proud belshazzar showed sad monuments of heavens tremendous vengeance and shall i unwarnd by such examples cherish pride yet to their dire calamities i owe the brightest gem that glistens in my crown sage daniel if my speech have ought of worth or if my life with ought of good be graced to him alone i owe it  soranus aside to pharnaces now pharnaces will he run over and dwell upon his praise as if we never had heard it nay will swell the nauseous catalogue with many a virtue his own fond fancy coins  pharnaces o great darius let thine unworthy servants words find grace and meet acceptance in his royal ear who subjugates the east let not the king with anger hear my prayer  darius pharnaces speak i know thou love me i but meant to chide thy flattery not reprove thee for thy zeal speak boldly friends as man should speak to man perish the barbarous maxims of the east which basely would enslave the freeborn mind and plunder it of the best gift of heaven its liberty  pharnaces then o darius hear me thy princes and the captains of thy bands thy presidents the governors who rule thy provinces and i thine humble creature less than the least in merit but in love in zeal and duty equal with the first we have devised a measure to confirm thy infant empire to establish here thy power with firm dominion and secure thy growing greatness past the power of change  darius i am prepared to hear thee speak pharnaces  pharnaces the wretched babylonians long have groaned beneath the rule of princes weak or rash the rod of power was falsely swayed alike by feeble merodach and sierce belshazzar one let the slackened reins too loosely float upon the peoples neck and lost his power by nerveless relaxation he who followed held with a tyrants hand the cruel curb and checked the groaning nation till it bled on different rocks they met one common ruin their edicts were irresolute their laws were feebly planned their councils illadvisd now so relaxed and now so overstraind that the tired people wearied with the weight they long have borne will soon disdain control tread on all rule and spurn the hand that guides em  darius but say what remedy pharnaces  pharnaces know that too thy servants have provided hitherto they bear the yoke submissive but to fix thy power and their obedience to reduce all hearts to thy dominion yet avoid those deeds of cruelty thy nature starts at  thou shoudst begin by some imperial act of absolute dominion yet unstained by ought of barbarous for know o king wholesome severity if wisely ruled with sober discipline procures respect more than the lenient counsels and weak measures of frail irresolution  darius now proceed to thy request  pharnaces not i but all request it be thy imperial edict issued strait and let a firm decree be this day passed irrevocable as our median laws ordain that for the space of thirty days no subject in thy realm shall ought request of god or man except of thee o king  darius wherefore this strange decree  pharnaces twill fix the crown with lasting safety on thy royal brow and by a bloodless means preserve the obedience of this new empire think how much twill raise thy high renown twill make thy name revered and popular beyond example what to be as heaven dispensing good and ill for thirty days with thine own ears to hear thy peoples wants with thine own liberal hands to bless thy suppliant subjects o darius thou wilt seem as bounteous as a giving god and reign in every heart in babylon as well as media what a glorious state to be the blessed arbiter of good the first efficient cause of happiness to scatter mercies with a plenteous hand and to be blessed thyself in blessing others  darius is this the general wish  the princes and courtiers kneel chief president of one of all behold thy princes presidents and lords thy counselors and captains see o king presenting the edict behold the instrument our zeal has drawn the edict is prepared we only wait the confirmation of thy gracious word and thy imperial signet  darius say pharnaces what penalty awaits the man who dares transgress our mandate  pharnaces instant death o king this statute says should any subject dare petition for the space of thirty days of god or man except of thee o king he shall be thrown into yon dreadful den of hungry lions  darius hold methinks a deed of such importance should be wifely weighed  pharnaces we have revolved it mighty king with care with closest scrutiny  darius i am satisfied then to your wisdom i commit me princes behold the royal signet see it is done  pharnaces aside there daniel fell that signet sealed his doom  darius after a pause let me reflect  sure i have be too rash why such intemperate haste but you are wise and would not counsel this severe decree but for the wisest purpose yet methinks i might have weighed and in my mind revolved this statute ever the royal signet stamped it had been past repeal sage daniel too my counselor my venerable friend he should have been consulted for his wisdom i still have found oracular  pharnaces mighty king it is as it should be the decree is past irrevocable as the steadfast law of mede and persian which can never change those who observe it live as is most meet high in thy grace who violate it die  daniel part iv scene daniels house daniel araspes araspes oh holy daniel prophet father friend i come the wretched messenger of ill thy foes complot thy death for what can mean this newmade law extorted from the king almost by force what can it mean o daniel but to involve thee in the toils they spread to snare thy precious life  daniel how was the king consenting to this edict  araspes they surprised his easy nature took him when his heart was softened by their blandishments they wore the mask of public virtue to deceive him beneath the specious name of general good they wrought him to their purposes no time allowed him to delibrate one short hour another moment and his soul had gained her natural tone of virtue  daniel that great power who suffers evil only to produce some unseen good permits that this should be and he permitting i well pleased resign retire my friend this is my second hour of daily prayer anon well meet again here in the open face of that bright sun thy fathers worshipped will i offer up as is my rule petition to our god for thee for me for solyma for all  araspes oh stay what mean thou sure thou hasy not heard the edict of the king i thought but now thou knewst its purport it expressly says that no petition henceforth shall be made for thirty days save only to the king nor prayer nor intercession shall be heard of any god or man but of darius  daniel and think thou then my reverence for the king good as he is shall tempt ne to renounce my sworn allegiance to the king of kings have thou commanded legions tempted death in various shapes and shrinkst at danger now come learn of me i will teach thee to be bold though sword i never drew fear not araspes the feeble vengeance of a mortal man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein is he to be accounted of but fear the awakened vengeance of the living lord he who can plunge the everlasting soul in infinite perdition  araspes then o daniel if thou persist to disobey the edict retire and hide thee from the prying eyes of busy malice  daniel he who is ashamed to vindicate the honor of his god of him the living lord shall be ashamed when he shall judge the tribes  araspes yet o remember often have i heard thee say the secret heart is fair devotions temple there the saint even on that living altar lights the flame of purest sacrifice which burns unseen not unaccepted  i remember too when syrian naaman   kings chap v by elishas hand was cleansd from foul pollution and his mind enlightened by the miracle confessed the almighty god of jacob that he deemed it no flagrant violation of his faith to bend at rimmons shrine nor did the seer forbid the rite external  daniel know araspes heaven deigns to suit our trials to our strength a recent convert feeble in his faith naaman perhaps had sunk beneath the weight of so severe a duty but shall i shall daniel shall the servant of the lord a vetran in his cause one trained to know and do his will one exercised in woe bred in captivity and born to suffer shall i from known from certain duty shrink to shun a threatened danger o araspes shall i advanced in age in zeal decline grow careless as i reach my journeys end and slacken in my pace the goal in view perish discretion when it interferes with duty perish the safe policy of human wit where gods eternal name is put in competition shall his law be set at naught that i may live at ease how would the heathen triumph should i fall through coward fear how would gods enemies insultingly blaspheme  araspes yet think a moment  daniel no  where evil may be done it is right to ponder where only suffered know the shortest pause is much too long had great darius paused this ill had been prevented but for me araspes to deliberate is to sin  araspes think of thy power thy favor with darius think of thy lifes importance to the tribes scarce yet returned in safety live o live to serve the cause of god  daniel god will sustain himself his righteous cause he knows to raise fit instruments to serve him as for me the spacious earth holds not a bait to tempt me what would it profit me if i should gain imperial ecbatan the extended land of fruitful media nay the worlds wide round if my eternal soul must be the price farewell my friend time presses i have stolen some moments from my duty to confirm and strengthen thy young faith let us fulfill what heaven enjoins and leave to heaven the event  daniel part v scene the palace pharnaces soranus pharnaces it is done  success has crowned our scheme soranus and daniel falls into the deeplaid toils our prudence spread  soranus that he should fall so soon astonishes even me what not a day no not a single moment to deser his rash devotions madly thus to rush on certain peril quite transcends belief when happened it pharnaces  pharnaces on the instant scarce is the deed accomplished as he made his oftentatious prayer even in the face of the bright god of day all babylon beheld the insult offered to darius for as in bold desiance of the law his windows were not closed our chosen bands whom we had placed to note him strait rushed in and seized him in the warmth of his blind zeal ere half his prayer was finished young araspes with all the wild extravagance of grief prays weeps and threatens daniel silent stands with patient resignation and prepares to follow them  but see the king approaches  soranus how is this deep sorrow sits upon his brow and stern resentment fires his angry eye  darius pharnaces soranus darius o deeplaid stratagem o artful wile to take me unprepared to wound my heart even where it feels most tenderly in friendship to stab my fame to hold me up a mark to future ages for the perjured prince who slew the friend he loved o daniel daniel who now shall trust darius not a slave within my empire from the indian main to the cold caspian but is more at ease than i his monarch i have done a deed will blot my honor with eternal stain pharnaces o thou hoary sycophant thou wily politician thou have snared thy unsuspecting master  pharnaces great darius let not resentment blind thy royal eyes in what am i to blame who could foresee this obstinate resistance to the law who could foresee that daniel would perforce oppose the kings decree  darius thou thou foresawst it thou knewst his righteous soul would never endure so long an interval of prayer but i deluded king twas i should have foreseen his steadfast piety i should have thought your earnest warmth had some more selfish source something that touched you nearer than your love your counterfeited zeal for me  thou knewst how dear i held him how i prized his truth did i not choose him from a subject world unblessed by fortune and by birth ungracd a captive and a jew and yet i loved him was he not rich in independent worth there there he fell if he had been less great he had been safe thou could not bear his brightness the luster of his virtues quite obscured and dimmed thy fainter merit rash old man go and devise some means to set me free from this dread load of guilt go set at work thy plotting genius to redeem the life of venerable daniel  pharnaces it is too late he has offended against the new decree has dared to make petition to his god although the dreadful sentence of the act full well he knew and by the established law of media by that law irrevocable which he has dared to violate he dies  darius impiety presumption monstrous pride  irrevocable is there ought on earth deserves that name the eternal laws alone of oromasdes claim it but alas all human projects are so faintly framed so feebly planned so liable to change so mixed with error in their very form that mutable and mortal are the same but where is daniel wherefore comes he not to load me with reproaches to upbraid me with all the wrongs my barbarous haste has done him where is he  pharnaces he prepares to meet his fate this hour he dies for so the act decrees  darius suspend the bloody sentence bring him hither or rather let me seek him and implore his dying pardon and his parting prayer  daniel part vi scene daniels house daniel araspes araspes still let me follow thee still

blessed haven of repose in view  araspes and must i lose thee daniel must thou die  daniel and what is death my friend that i should fear it to die why it is to triumph it is to join the great assembly of the good and just immortal worthies heroes prophets saints oh it is to join the band of holy men made perfect by their sufferings it is to meet my great progenitors it is to behold the illustrious patriarchs they with whom the lord deigned hold familiar converse it is to see blessed noah and his children once a world it is to behold oh rapture to conceive those we have known and loved and lost below bold azariah and the band of brothers who sought in bloom of youth the scorching flames nor is it to behold heroic men alone who fought the fight of faith on earth but heavenly conquerors angelic hosts michael and his bright legions who subdued the foes of truth to join their blessed employ of love and praise to the high melodies of choirs celestial to attune my voice accordant to the golden harps of saints to join in blessed hosannahs to their king whose face to see whose glory to behold alone were heaven though saint or seraph none there were beside and only he were there this is to die who would not die for this who would not die that he might live for ever  darius daniel araspes darius where is he where is daniel let me see him let me embrace that venerable form which i have doomed to glut the greedy maw of furious lions  daniel king darius hail  darius o injured daniel can i see thee thus thus uncomplaining can i bear to hear that when the russian ministers of death stopped thy unsinishd prayer thy pious lips had just invoked a blessing on darius on him who sought thy life thy murdrers dropped tears of strange pity look not on me thus with mild benignity oh i could bear the voice of keen reproach or the strong flash of fierce resentment but i cannot stand that touching silence nor that patient eye of meek respect  daniel thou art my master still  darius i am thy murderer i have signed thy death  daniel i know thy bent of soul is honorable thou have been gracious still had it been otherwise i would have met the appointment of high heaven with humble acquiescence but to know thy will concurred not with thy servants fate adds joy to resignation  darius here i swear by him who sits enthroned in yon bright sun thy blood shall be atoned on these thy foes thou shall have ample vengeance  daniel hold o king vengeance is mine the eternal lord has said and i will recompense with even hand the sinner for the sin the wrath of man works not the righteousness of god  darius i had hoped we should have trod this busy stage together a little longer then have sunk to rest in honorable age who now shall guide my shattered bark in safety who shall now direct me o unhappy state of kings it is well the robe of majesty is gay or who would put it on a crown what is it it is to bear the misries of a people to hear their murmurs feel their discontents and sink beneath a load of splendid care to have your best success ascribed to fortune and fortunes failures all ascribed to you it is to sit upon a joyless height to every blast of changing fate exposed too high for hope too great for happiness for friendship too much feared to all the joys of social freedom and the endearing charm of liberal interchange of soul unknown fate meant me an exception to the rest and though a monarch blessed me with a friend and i  have murdered him  daniel my hour approaches hate not my memory king protect araspes encourage cyrus in the holy

health of strength of time of youths fair promise and of pleasures prime shall i no more behold the face of morn the cheerful daylight and the springs return must i the festive bower the banquet leave for the dull chambers of the darksome grave have i considered what it is to die in native dust with kindred worms to lie to sleep in cheerless cold neglect to rot my body loathed my very name forgot not one of all those parasites who bend the supple knee their monarch to attend what not one friend no not an hireling slave shall hail great hezekiah in the grave where is he who falsely claimed the name of great whose eye was terror and whose frown was fate who awed an hundred nations from the throne see where he lies dumb friendless and alone which grain of dust proclaims the noble birth which is the royal particle of earth where are the marks the princely ensigns where which is the slave and which great davids heir alas the beggars ashes are not known from his who lately sat on israels throne how stands my great account my soul survey the debt eternal justice bids thee pay should i frail memorys records strive to blot will heavens tremendous reckoning be forgot can i alas the awful volume tear or raze one page of the dread register prepare thy house thy heart in order set prepare the judge of heaven and earth to meet so spoke the warning prophet  awful words which fearfully my troubled soul records am i prepared and can i meet my doom nor shudder at the dreaded wrath to come is all in order set my house my heart does no besetting sin still claim a part does no one cherished vice with lingering pace reluctant leave me to the work of grace did i each day for this great day prepare by righteous deeds by sinsubduing prayer did i each night each days offense repent and each unholy thought and word lament still have these ready hands the afflicted fed and ministered to want her daily bread the cause i knew not did i well explore friend advocate and parent of the poor did i to gratify some sudden gust of thoughtless appetite some impious lust of pleasure or of power such sums employ as would have crowned pale penury with joy did i in groves forbidden altars raise or molten gods adore or idols praise did my firm faith to heaven still point the way did charity to man my actions sway did meekeyd patience all my steps attend did generous candor mark me for her friend did i unjustly seek to build my name on the pild ruins of anothers fame did i like hell abhor the insidious lie the low deceit the unmanly calumny did my fixed soul the impious wit detest did my firm virtue scorn the unhallowed jest the sneer profane and the poor ridicule of shallow infidelitys dull school did i still live as born one day to die and view the eternal world with constant eye if so i lived if so i kept thy word in mercy view in mercy hear me lord my holiest deeds indulgence will require the best but to forgiveness will aspire if thou my purest services regard twill be with pardon only not reward how imperfections stamped on all below how sin intrudes in all we say or do how late in all the insolence of health i charmed the assyrian this is an anachronism hezekiah did not show his treasures to the assyrian till after his recovery from his sickness by my boast of wealth how fondly with elabrate pomp displayed my glittering treasures with what triumph laid my gold and gems before his dazzled eyes and found a rich reward in his surprise o mean of soul can wealth elate the heart which of the man himself is not a part o poverty of pride o foul disgrace disgusted reason blushing hides her face mortal and proud strange contradicting terms pride for deaths victim for the prey of worms of all the wonders which the eventful life of man presents of all the mental strife of warring passions all the raging fires of furious appetites and mad desires not one so strange appears as this alone that man is proud of what is not his own how short is human life the very breath which frames my words accelerates my death of this short life how large a portions fled to what is gone i am already dead as dead to all my years and minutes past as i to what remains shall be at last can i my cares and pains so far forget to view my vanished years with fond regret can i again my wornout fancy cheat indulge fresh hope solicit new deceit of all the vanities weak man admires which greatness gives or sanguine youth desires of these my soul which have thou not enjoyed with each with all thy sated powers are cloyed what can i then expect from length of days more wealth more wisdom pleasure health or praise more pleasure hope not that deluded king for when did age increase of pleasure bring is health of years prolonged the common boast and dearearnd praise is it not cheaply lost more wisdom that indeed were happiness that were a wish a king might well confess but when did wisdom covet length of days or seek its bliss in pleasure wealth or praise no  wisdom views with an indifferent eye all finite joys all blessings born to die wisdom on earth is an immortal guest compelled to starve at an unreal feast a spark which upward tends by natures force a stream diverted from its parent source a drop disseverd from the boundless sea a moment parted from eternity a broken ray which seeks its central soul a part which longs to mingle with its whole a pilgrim panting for the rest to come an exile anxious for his native home why should i ask my forfeit life to save is heaven unjust which dooms me to the grave was i with hope of endless days deceived or of loved life am i alone bereaved let all the great the rich the learned the wise let all the shades of judahs monarchs rise and say if genius learning empire wealth youth beauty virtue strength renown or health has

guilty land must die as wise and good thou had not been as nebats son who taught the land to sin and shall i then be spared o monstrous pride shall i escape when solomon has died if all the worth of

have oftnest felt you who for many a friend and hero mourn who bend in anguish over the frequent urn you who have found how much the feeling heart shapes its own wound and points itself the dart you who from tender sad experience feel the wounds such minds receive can never heal that grief a thousand entrances can find where parts superior dignify the mind would you renounce the pangs those feelings give secure in joyless apathy to live for though in souls where taste and sense abound pain through a thousand avenues can wound yet the same avenues are open still to casual blessings as to casual ill nor is the trembling temper more awake to every wound which misery can make than is the finelyfashiond nerve alive to every transport pleasure has to give for if when homefelt joys the mind elate it mourns in secret for anothers fate yet when its own sad griefs invade the breast abroad in others blessings see it blessed even the soft forrow of remembered woe a not unpleasing sadness may bestow let not the vulgar read this pensive strain their jests the tender anguish would profane yet these some deem the happiest of their kind whose low enjoyments never reached the mind who never a pain but for themselves have known nor ever felt a sorrow but their own who call romantic every finer thought conceived by pity or by friendship wrought ah wherefore happy where is the kindred mind where the large soul that takes in human kind where the best passions of the mortal breast where the warm blessing when anothers blessed where the soft lenitives of others pain the social sympathy the sense humane the sigh of rapture and the tear of joy anguish that charms and transports that destroy for tender sorrow has her pleasures too pleasures which prosperous dullness never knew she never knew in all her coarser bliss the sacred rapture of a pain like this nor think the cautious only are the just who never was deceived i would not trust then take ye happy vulgar take your part of

weighs not ever it serves and softeyd pity and forgiveness bland and melting charity with open hand and artless love believing and believed and generous confidence which never deceived and mercy stretching out ere want can speak to wipe the tear from pale afflictions cheek these ye have never known  then take your part of sordid joy which never touched the heart ye who have melted in bright glorys flame or felt the spiritstirring breath of fame ye noble few in whom her promised meed wakes the great thought and makes the wish the deed ye who have tasted the delight to give and gods own agents bid the wretched live who the chill haunts of desolation seek raise the sunk heart and flush the fading cheek ye who with pensive petrarch love to mourn or weave fresh chaplets for tibullus urn who cherish both in hammonds plaintive lay the provence myrtle and the roman bay ye who divide the joys and share the pains which merit feels or heavenborn fancy feigns would you renounce such joys such pains as these for vulgar pleasures or for selfish ease would you to scape the pain the joy forego and miss the transport to avoid the woe would you the sense of real sorrow lose or cease to woo the melancholy muse no greville beautiful ode to indifference  no  thy song though steeped in tears though all thy soul in all thy strain appears yet would thou all thy wellsung anguish choose and all the inglorious peace thou beggst refuse or you boscawen when you fondly melt in raptures none but mothers ever felt and view enamored in your beauteous race all levesons sweetness and all beauforts grace yet think what dangers each loved child may share the youth if valiant and the maid if fair that perils multiply as blessings flow and constant sorrows on enjoyments grow you who have felt how fugitive is joy that while we clasp the phantom we destroy that lifes bright sun is dimmed by clouded views and who have most to love have most to lose yet from these fair possessions would you part to shield from future pain your guarded heart would your sond mind renounce its tender boast or wish their opening bloom of promise lost yield the dear hopes which break upon your view for all the quiet dullness ever knew debase the objects of your tenderest prayer to save the dangers of a distant care consent to shun the anxious fears you prove they less should merit or you less should love yet while i hail the sympathy divine which makes o man the wants of others thine i mourn heroic justice scarcely owned and principle for sentiment dethroned while feeling boasts her evertearful eye stern truth firm faith and manly virtue fly sweet sensibility thou soothing power who sheddst thy blessings on the natal hour like fairy favors art can never seize nor affectation catch thy power to please thy subtle essence still eludes the chains of definition and defeats her pains sweet sensibility thou keen delight thou hasty moral sudden sense of right thou untaught goodness virtues precious seed thou sweet precursor of the generous deed beautys quick relish reasons radiant morn which dawns soft light before reflexions born to those who know thee not no words can paint and those who know thee know all words are faint it is not to mourn because a sparrow dies to rave in artificial ecstasies it is not to melt in tender otways fires it is not to faint when injured shore expires it is not because the ready eye overflows at clementinas or clarissas woes forgive o richardson nor think i mean with cold contempt to blast thy peerless scene if some faint love of virtue glow in me pure spirit i first caught that flame from thee while soft compassion silently relieves loquacious feeling hints how much she gives laments how often her wounded heart has bled and boasts of many a tear she never shed as words are but the external marks to tell the fair ideas in the mind that dwell and only are of things the outward sign and not the things themselves they but define so exclamations tender tones fond tears and all the graceful drapery pity wears these are not pitys self they but express her inward sufferings by their pictured dress and these fair marks reluctant i relate these lovely symbols may be counterfeit celestial pity why must i deplore thy sacred image stamped on basest ore there are who fill with brilliant plaints the page if a poor linnet meet the gunners rage there are who for a dying sawn display the tenderest anguish in the sweetest lay who for a wounded animal deplore as if friend parent country were no more who boast quick rapture trembling in their eye if from the spiders snare they save a fly whose wellsung sorrows every breast inflame and break all hearts but his from whom they came yet scorning lifes dull duties to attend will persecute a wife or wrong a friend alive to every woe by fiction dressed the innocent he wronged the wretch distressed may plead in vain their sufferings come not near or he relieves them cheaply with a tear not so the tender moralist of tweed his man of feeling is a man indeed oh blessed compassion angel charity more dear one genuine deed performed for thee than all the periods feeling ever can turn than all thy soothing pages polished stern not that by deeds alone this loves expressed if so the affluent only were the blessed one silent wish one prayer one soothing word the precious page of mercy shall record one soulfelt sigh by powrless pity given accepted incense shall ascend to heaven since trifles make the sum of human things and half our misery from our foibles springs since lifes best joys consist in peace and ease and few can save or serve but all may please oh let the ungentle spirit learn from hence a small unkindness is a great offense large bounties to bestow we wish in vain but all may shun the guilt of giving pain to bless mankind with tides of flowing wealth with power to grace them or to crown with health our little lot denies but heaven decrees to all the gift of ministring to ease the gentle offices of patient love beyond all flattery and all price above the mild forbearance at anothers fault the taunting word suppressed as soon as thought on these heaven bade the bliss of life depend and crushed illfortune when he made a friend a solitary blessing few can find our joys with those we love are interwind and he whose helpful tenderness removes the obstructing thorn which wounds the breast he loves smooths not anothers rugged path alone but scatters roses to adorn his own the hint malevolent the look oblique the obvious satire or implied dislike the sneer equivocal the harsh reply and all the cruel language of the eye the artful injury whose venomed dart scarce wounds the hearing while it stabs the heart the guarded phrase whose meaning kills yet told the listner wonders how you thought it cold small slights contempt neglect unmixed with hate make up in number what they want in weight these and a thousand griefs minute as these corrode our comfort and destroy our ease as this strong feeling tends to good or ill it gives fresh power to vice or principle it is not peculiar to the wife and good it is passions flame the virtue of the blood but to divert it to its proper course there wisdoms power appears there reasons force if illdirected it pursues the wrong it adds new strength to what before was strong breaks out in wild irregular desires disordered passions and illicit fires but if the virtuous bias rule the soul this lovely feeling then adorns the whole sheds its sweet sunshine on the moral part nor wastes on fancy what should warm the heart cold and inert the mental powers would lie without this quickening spark of deity to draw the rich materials from the mine to bid the mass of intellect refine to melt the sirm to animate the cold and heavens own impress stamp on natures gold to give immortal mind its sinest tone oh sensibility is all thy own this is the etherial flame which lights and warms in song transports

the keen inspection of her eye makes portlands face its brightest rapture wear when her large bounty smooths the bed of care it is this that breathes through sevignes sweet page that nameless grace which soothes a second age it is this whose charms the soul resistless seize and gives boscawen half her power to please yet why those terrors why that anxious care since your last admiral boscawens
