enter sidney who comes forward   song  sidney often wealth or ambition will tempt us to dare all the toils all the perils that mortals can bear but the sigh of remembrance wherever we roam will fancy waft back to our dear native home though rude be the clime and though humble the cot the early idea is never forgot and the sigh etc  chellingoe this is the hour when the princess alminah usually walks this way  sidney goes back into his prison locks the door she has had interviews with my prisoner the young english officer and is certainly in love with him if so i must show him favor now how

husband   chellingoe and is there really any poor fellow in existence so unfortunate as to be your husband   margaret sir i have the honor to be a serjeants lady  nay more he is a sergeant of grenadiers and an irishman  need i add that he is a man of courage   chellingoe no you need not  his courage cannot be doubted if he has been bold enough to venture on you   margaret i followed the example of my dear mistress the wife of your prisoner captain sidney in contempt of every danger she accompanied him on this expedition for convenience we assumed male attire my mistress indeed chose to be habited like an indian servant but for my part i always had a partiality for wearing the breeches   chellingoe retire  the princess is here   chellingoe and margaret retire severally at a sign made to chellingoe by orsana who enters with alminah alminah orsana are we observed   orsana no madam  chellingoe understands how to take a hint there is sidneys window   alminah how provoking that he does not appear   orsana madam here is chellingoe who guards the captives   alminah bid him approach  chellingoe comes forward from a cell  the english captives are still in your care   chellingoe yes madam   alminah i hope you treat the brave men with humanity   chellingoe with the utmost tenderness   alminah the honor of our nation requires that we should respect the virtues of an enemy   chellingoe very true madam so i have said   alminah especially when unfortunate  poor wretches how i pity them at a distance from their native country  separated from all they hold dear in friendship in love   chellingoe alas madam these considerations have but too painfully touched my heart   alminah i hope so for remember your life must answer for their ill treatment mark me chellingoe  if any one should die while in your keeping a most strict account of the cause will be required   chellingoe i live but to obey your illustrious family   orsana her highness is curious to converse with their commander   chellingoe i will prepare him for the honor   alminah i will still conceal my rank from this captive that awe may not restrain him from gratifying my inquiries let him attend me on the terrace  exit chellingoe into a cell how my heart beats govinda your friendship must assist me in this interview   govinda illustrious princess   alminah oh govinda this illustrious princess as you call her the favorite daughter of a powerful monarch surrounded by her guards in a palace where her word is fate  this mighty princess is in love and no more than a poor timid woman trembling with apprehension at an interview with a captive stranger  exit alminah and orsana govinda alone yes alminah i will fulfill your commands at the risk of my life you have claims on my gratitude which must be obeyed   song  govinda how lost the mind which cold and dark from gratitudes celestial fire in vain receives the hallowed spark falling alas but to expire often be my fervent vows renewed at the shrine of gratitude honor abhors the darksome cell unblessed by gratitudes bright flame there pale distrust and treachery dwell there fraud asserts her wily claim often be my fervent vows renewed at the shrine of gratitude exit enter chellingoe and sidney from the cell chellingoe you are permitted to walk on this terrace  i have no orders to this effect but the indulgence is mine entirely my

hour approaches when your chains shall be removed   sidney astonishment my chains removed by whom   alminah by me  often have i listened to the melancholy sounds which gave vent to your sorrows till my heart vibrated in unison raising her veil   sidney charming creature but how is it possible    alminah be content to know the extent of my power without questioning the means enquire no further at midnight govinda shall come to you in your prison  he can remove every obstacle to your release  follow him in silence  he will conduct you to me and we will fly together   quartette  alminah orsana

for prey govinda fearless of all but slaverys power the moon shall light us on our way exeunt alminah orsana and govinda sidney reenters his prison chellingoe locks the door after him and comes forward chellingoe this flirtation of the princess may be turned to good account it is fortunate to be in office when our superiors fall in love  a wise man may always profit by it  to margaret who comes forward why dont you retire go back to your prison   margaret be calm  be contented  i will not go back to my prison till i think proper   chellingoe what am i to be braved thus retire instantly or    margaret you had better not  i may possibly be hurt in the scuffle perhaps mortally hurt  and if i should die    chellingoe well   margaret why then you know as the princess told you your life must answer for it   chellingoe how unfortunate that she should overhear the conversation   margaret dont provoke me or i will certainly attempt something dangerous  how do you know that a mine is not now ready to spring under you   chellingoe will you please to retire   margaret for aught you know you may have taken poison at your last meal   chellingoe i wish she was out of the prison with all my soul   margaret or should that fail i might poison myself and swear you did it   chellingoe aside i shall not think myself safe till this vixen is disposed of a thought strikes me  to her i tell you what  you are a brave wench and ought not to remain in confinement   margaret i agree with you for the first time   chellingoe have you a mind to escape   margaret you wish to get rid of me   chellingoe i should have no objection   margaret and suppose i should be inclined to indulge you so far what do you offer me   chellingoe why i offer you your freedom what more would you have   margaret i would have the rupees you stole  my property   chellingoe how unconscionable when i give you liberty   margaret true but liberty and property should not be separated  so if you refuse talking loud    chellingoe hush the princess may overhear us   margaret i mean it i will proclaim your villainies and demand justice   chellingoe dont talk so loud you shall escape on your own terms if you will but go quietly zemaun   enter zemaun i commit this prisoner to your care whispers zemaun   margaret aside that zemaun is a proud ferocious fellow the terror of all the prisoners and famed for his implacable hatred to europeans yet surely chellingoe dares not play me a trick   chellingoe aside to zemaun if destroyed beyond the bounds of the prison you know it is no fault of mine  to margaret adieu my friend zemaun will take care of you early in the morning follow him in silence   margaret to zemaun lead on  i will follow you  exit zemaun but first my friend chellingoe i must have my money   duet  chellingoe and margaret margaret what do you think i will be robbed of my money chellingoe your liberty  margaret without my cash i value not a rush chellingoe trust to my honor margaret in vain you give your honey i will tell aloud your villainy  chellingoe hush hush hush chellingoe here take your money and now let us say good bye margaret not yet awhile my purse is low and yours in cash is flush now as they say all have their price chellingoe faith yours is much too high and i will not bribe a vile informer  margaret hush hush hush chellingoe zounds i will give no more and so your course pursue margaret shake hands  a quarrel now your hopes as well as mine would crush chellingoe to prison you would go again margaret and what becomes of you chellingoe aside the devil take ye margaret what do you say chellingoe hush hush hush margaret aside the devil take ye chellingoe what do you say margaret hush hush hush exeunt scene ii  a plain with a distant view of the rajahs hillfort enter liffey from a wood liffey oh liffey barney liffey what an unhappy sergeant of grenadiers art thou an irishman by birth and a soldier by choice i who never turned my back upon an enemy  no nor a friend whether man or woman  that it should be my fate to play at bopeep in a thicket like a hunted tiger but how can i help it with such a charge committed to my care such an innocent sweet creature whom i have pledged my honor to protect  and then to leave my wife my dear margaret behind me  there is another misfortunate for though we constantly quarrel when we meet i always find a violent affection for her when she is absent indeed i think we agree best at a distance the moment the parson made us one we became two and indeed we have not been much together since we were united   eliza without liffey where are you   liffey here my good lady this way madam you may venture to peep out of your hidingplace   enter eliza in male attire eliza after passing two tedious days in that gloomy forest how delightful is the open air this change of prospect  oh liffey can that be the prison of my husband   liffey it is that is ramah droog fortress that is my master captain sidneys prison oh i shall never forget this valley here our detachment was surrounded  here some brave fellows fell and all the rest were taken prisoners  except myself  no no  i was not amongst the slain nor was i taken prisoner oh i shall never forget how the black rascals came pouring down upon us on every side when my master turned to me suddenly liffey said he all is lost  make your escape as fast as possible  run away with my wife i entreat you and then you know maam    eliza i know not what passed at the sight of my sidneys danger my boasted courage forsook me   liffey run away sir cried i alas poor liffey never disobeyed your orders before but it is impossible to run away  upon my soul i cannot turn my back upon an enemy  i cannot muster up courage to do it   eliza but you could not disobey your master    liffey that is my only consolation for behaving like a coward leave me my good fellow if you have any friendship for me said he by my honor thought i that seems to be an odd way of showing friendship though not unusual to desert a friend when he stands most in need of assistance   eliza who are those men armed with spears and javelins   liffey tiger hunters madam beating among the jungle in search of the game  a thought strikes me and yet    eliza your fidelity entitles you to my attention what would you propose   liffey why look ye madam we are two hundred miles from the british settlement and our whole stock of provisions is one poor little solitary potatoe in the corner of my knapsack   eliza good heavens liffey did you not tell me that you had rice enough for a week   liffey so i thought till i looked into the bag just now and in faith i find instead of a bag of rice i had in my hurry carried off a full suit of clothes belonging to old sampan our commissarys clerk   eliza well proceed   liffey that is what i cannot do i cannot proceed and therefore i think the wisest way is to stay where we are and yield ourselves prisoners to these tiger hunters   eliza if you are known to be a soldier you will be either imprisoned or obliged to enlist in their service what is to be done can you pass for a musician   liffey madam  to be sure i can sing a little but i could never turn a tune in my life even on the jews harp   eliza is there no situation in which you could be useful to an indian prince   liffey why yes i think i could take care of his wives but i am afraid they will not trust me to do that   eliza i have heard that the character most respected throughout the east is that of an european physician   liffey and would you have me pretend to be a doctor   eliza we can think of no better scheme and i shall be secure in passing for your servant you may easily conceal your ignorance i dare say they never had an european physician among them   liffey most likely not for they seem to be a hale hearty set of people   eliza but then these regimentals    liffey suppose madam i change them for old sampans suit of clothes   eliza a lucky thought   liffey and by my soul i shall then be a curiosity worth your seeing  exit eliza yes my beloved sidney i shall once more rejoin thee and share thy fate  perhaps effect thy rescue   song  eliza with trembling steps and sinking heart i urge my weary way at every whispering breeze i start all terror and dismay still hope with magic mirror tries my sinking heart to cheer and points where smiling prospects rise of many a circling year or when the sandy desert bright reflects the burning noon or when the chilling damps of night arise and dim the moon still hope etc  reenter liffey dressed in the clothes he has mentioned liffey here i am madam  what do you think of me  a bugle horn sounds eliza hark the hunters approach now remember i am to pass for your servant   liffey then in token of servitude carry the knapsack  you will not find it very heavy there is nothing in it but the poor little potatoe that has traveled with us so far   eliza now be very careful how you answer their questions they are here why do you loiter thus liffey   liffey i was only admiring myself madam how lucky it is that i blundered upon this suit of clothes  i could not have made a more fortunate mistake had it even been on purpose  exeunt scene iv  a view in the fort the same as the first scene enter chellingoe chellingoe his highness the great rajah taken ill suddenly ill  violently ill  and a suspicion of poison his doctors disagree as usual so between the malady and the medicine he will give us the slip what a blow to my hopes what a check to my rising ambition my former disgrace forgot  worming myself into favor further and further every day and now to lose the fruits of my toils   enter an attendant attendant some more european prisoners are brought in will you please to examine them   chellingoe no  i am not in a humor to examine prisoners  the rajah will certainly die what with the doctors and the disease his constitution will be knocked about like a shuttlecock between battledores till the parties grow tired of the contention and he falls to the ground   attendant will you please to have the europeans closely confined in the dungeon or in the castle   chellingoe are they rich   attendant i dont know  we have not examined them   chellingoe right always leave that to me   attendant one of them says he is a physician   chellingoe a physician and from europe i will send him to the rajah  bring him in directly  exit attendant if his highness should be cured by a doctor of my recommendation what a brilliant career of honors and dignities will open to me  then if the european should kill him  but i will make it his interest not to kill him aye but if he should give too strong a dose by mistake no matter i dare say the doctor knows enough of his profession to keep that a secret from everybody   reenter attendant and converses aside with chellingoe enter liffey and eliza as prisoners eliza my husband yet living and a prisoner in the tower oh liffey my heart beats high with expectation   liffey oh madam and my heart sinks low with disappointment no intelligence to be gained of poor margaret whether living or dead it would be a comfort to be ascertained of the fact either way but she is certainly no more were she alive her tongue would proclaim the circumstance to the whole prison   chellingoe coming forward this must be the doctor loosen his chains never fetter the hands of genius  you are luckily arrived and in good time   liffey i hope it will prove so your honor   chellingoe i am told you are a physician   liffey i am glad you are told so for i am not fond of speaking of myself   chellingoe how did it happen that you came into the territories of the great rajah   liffey i have always been partial to traveling  traveling for improvement hearing you had a battle in the neighborhood i came to offer my assistance   chellingoe well and discreetly answered may i ask if you are eminent in your profession   liffey you may ask it but my modesty will not let me give you an answer   chellingoe you seem to enjoy strong health yourself a hopeful object for a sick person to look on   liffey enjoy my health  no wonder  i never tasted a drop of physic in my life   chellingoe give me your hand  now i know you are a true doctor  they are never so selfish as to deprive their patients of medicines by taking it themselves  to the attendant remember that all possible respect must be shown to this learned man and his follower may i crave your name   liffey my name is liffey  doctor oliffey  apart to eliza i shall tack the o to

and moon and cousin to all the stars in the firmament   liffey then what blessed weather you must have in this country if he and his relations are on good terms together i suppose a foggy day or a dark night is a sure sign of a quarrel in the family   chellingoe he is the immortal and allpowerful rajah who when he has dined gives leave to all the princes of the earth to go to dinner   liffey how gracious and condescending if they are as hungry as i am they must feel it to be a singular favor   chellingoe now as i told you i am a favorite at court  i can introduce you to be one of the state physicians   liffey is his highness indisposed   chellingoe yes the immortal rajah    liffey is going to die i suppose   chellingoe i hope not but this allpowerful potentate    liffey is in a very weak condition   chellingoe you shall attend his highness and judge of his malady by the symptoms   eliza that is totally unnecessary sir my master can prescribe just as well without seeing the patient he has one sovereign remedy upon which he depends   chellingoe a nostrum he is a desperate fellow  kill or cure i perceive   govinda enters and speaks to chellingoe apart liffey apart i say madam  who the devil do you mean what have i to prescribe   eliza anything will answer the purpose   liffey will it   eliza yes provided the remedy is not known here   liffey then what say you to the

dead ah would it were so  zemaun no princess brighter prospects court your view the strains of loyalty from yonder grove inspired by heaven are omens of success  zelma they soothe my soul with their sweet mournful sound as evening breezes close a happy day mingling regret with pleasure  zemaun the people ever faithful ever loyal in secret mourn their monarch and their father let but the moment
