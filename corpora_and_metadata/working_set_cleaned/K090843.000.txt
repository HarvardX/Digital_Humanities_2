sir henry lee knt portrait of sir henry lee  of london  domine dirige nos   london printed for robt faulder no    new bond street mdccxc  advertisement this work is composed from the observations of perhaps half my life made without the lest original view of publication from the numberless walks taken in and about our capital with a mind occupied with more ideas than the frivolous visit or the mere object of the hour  some were made in company of different friends stricken like myself with the love of the science of antiquities and with the desire of tracing the progress of perhaps the first city comparing all its advantages in the universe  the remarks made in these latter walks were committed to my tablets till they became rather considerable in that state i determined to lay them before the public not urged by desire of friends nor the wish of the people or any similar motives but by my own continued propensity to writing  i have two things to apologize for in this performance first its irregularity but i do assure my friends it is given nearly in the same manner in which the materials were collected and quite according to the course of the walk of the day  secondly let me request the good inhabitants of london and westminster not to be offended at my having stuffed their iliad into a nutshell the account of the city of london and liberties of westminster into a quarto volume i have condensed into it all i could omitted nothing that suggested itself nor amplified any thing to make it a guinea book in a word it is done in my own manner from which i am grown too old to depart  i feel within myself a certain monitor that warns me to hang up my pen in time before its powers are weakened and rendered visibly impaired i wait not for the admonition of friends i have the archbishop of grenada in my eye and fear the imbecility of human nature might produce in longworn age the same treatment of my kind advisers as poor gil blas had from his most reverend patron my literary bequests to future times and more serious concerns must occupy the remnant of my days this closes my public labors  to every particular friend and correspondent i send my most cordial thanks for their candid and unremitted attention to my various enquiries and for their bearing so long with my yearning after information and with my uncommon curiosity without which no writer can proceed with the confidence of accuracy or ought to lay any thing before the public unsanctioned by local information so much for acknowlegement of private favors  i take leave of a partial public with the truest gratitude for its long endurance of my very voluminous writings for its kind fostering my few merits for its affected blindness to my numerous defects the last act concluded  valete et plaudite

from their native dens in depth of woods and to form society they cleared a spot in the midst of their forests and founded their towns similar to those which the first discoverers of the new world met with occupied by the savages of america de bries virginia tab xix xx  similar to but probably inferior in economy to those of the more polished race of pholey negroes moores travels into africa    of guinea the britons soon found the danger of living in families separated and undefended they sought for security in places surrounded with woods or morasses and added to the natural strength by

iv p  0   but they preferred spots fortified by nature and made artificial works only where nature showed herself deficient within such precincts they formed their towns their buildings were most mean and simple covered with reeds or sticks like american wigwams or like modern hovels of the peasants of lohaber or the cabins of the irish commonalty to this moment as rude as the british aborigines to these precincts the britons resorted with their cattle their wives and children dioderus siculus lib v c     whom they left thus protected while they sallied out to war or to the employments of the chase for their clothing was the skins of beasts and their food the flesh with the addition of milk and farinaceous diet the britons soon became acquainted with one great use of the cow notwithstanding they remained ignorant of the making of cheese till the arrival of the romans agriculture was soon introduced among those who earliest formed towns or communities possibly by strangers who visited them from the continent they cleared the land in the neighborhood of their dwellings they sowed corn they reaped and deposited it in granaries under ground as the sicilians practice to this very day but the latter lodged it in the grain our predecessors in the ear out of which they picked the grains as they wanted them and ignorant of mills at first bruised and then made them into a coarse bread conjuges et liberos in loca tuta transferrent tacitus in vit agric  the same nation who taught them the art of agriculture first introduced a change of dress from the gauls of the continent they received the first cloth the dress called the bracha a coarse woollen manufacture but probably it was long before they learned the use of the loom or became their own manufacturers this intercourse laid the foundation of commerce which in early times extended no farther than to our maritime places they first received the rudiments of civilization while the more remote remained in proportion to their distance more and more savage or in a state of nature in the same degree as the neighboring gauls became acquainted with the arts they communicated them to the nearest british colonists who derived from the same stock and retaining the same language and manners were more capable and willing to receive any instructions offered by a congenerous people for this reason cantium the modern kent and probably the country for some way up the thames was as caesar informs us far the most civilized of any part of britain and that the inhabitants differed very little in their manner of life from the gauls it was from the merchants who frequented our ports he received the first intelligence of the nature of our country which induced him to undertake the invasion of britain and which in aftertimes laid the foundation of its conquest by the romans  there is not the lest reason to doubt but that london existed at that period and was a place of much resort london it stood in such a situation as the britons would select according to the rule they established an immense forest originally extended to the river side and even as late as the reign of henry ii covered the northern neighborhood of the city and was filled with various species of beasts of chase fitzstephens descr london     it was defended naturally by fosses one formed by the creek which ran along fleetditch the other afterward known by that of walbrook the south side was guarded by the thames the north they might think sufficiently protected by the adjacent forest  london stone near st swithins church is a remnant of antiquity which some have supposed to have been british a stone which might have formed a part of a druidical circle or some other object of the ancient religion as it is placed near the center of the roman precincts others have conjectured it to have been a milliary stone and to have served as a standard from which they began to compute their miles this seems very reasonable as the distances from the neighboring places coincide very exactly at all times it has been preserved with great care was placed deep in the ground and strongly fastened with bars of iron it seems preserved like the palladium of the city it is at present cased like a relic within freestone with a hole left in the middle which discovers the original certainly superstitious respect had been paid to it for when the notorious rebel jack cade passed by it after he had forced his way into the city he struck his sword on london stone saying now is mortimer lord of this city holinshed      as if that had been a customary ceremony of taking possession  when founded there is every reason to suppose that the romans possessed themselves of london in the reign of claudius under whom aulus plautius took camalcdunum the present maldon in essex and planted there a colony consisting of veterans of the fourteenth legion about a hundred and five years after the first invasion of our island by caesar this was the first footing the romans had in britain it seems certain that london and verulam were taken possession of about the same time but the last clames the honor of being of a far earlier date more opulent populous and a royal seat before the conquest of britain camalodunum was made a colonia or a place governed entirely by roman laws and customs verulamium a municipium in which the natives were honored with the privileges of roman citizens and enjoyed their own laws and constitutions and londinium only a praefectura only a praefectura the inhabitants a mixture of romans and britons being suffered to enjoy no more than the name of citizens of rome being governed by praefects sent annually from thence without having either their own laws or magistrates it was even then of such concourse and such vast trade that the wise conquerors did not think fit to trust the inhabitants with the same privileges as other places of which they had less reason to be jealous  there is no mention of this important place till the reign of tiberius when tacitus speaks of it as not having been distinguished as a colony but famous for its great concourse of merchants and its vast commerce this indicates at lest that london had been at that time of some antiquity as a trading town the exports from hence were cattle hides and corn dogs made a small article and let me add that slaves were a considerable object our internal parts were on a level with the african slave coasts and wars among the petty monarchs were promoted for the sake of a traffic now so strongly controverted strabo lib iv p      the imports were at first salt earthen ware and works in brass imports polished bits of bones emulating ivory horsecollars toys of amber and glasses and other articles of the same material the same p  0   we need not insist on the commerce of this period for there was a great trade carried on with the gauls in the days of caesar that celebrated invader assigning as his reason for attempting this island the vast supplies which we gave to his gaulish enemies bell gall lib iv  and which interrupted his conquests on the continent  when first mentioned the first mention of london was occasioned by a calamity in the year    in the reign of nero which nearly occasioned the extinction of the roman power in britain the heroine boadicia indignant at the personal insult offered to her and her family and the cruelties of the conquerors to the unhappy britons made a sudden revolt and destroyed camolodunum after putting all the colonists to the sword tacitus gives us the prediction of the ruin of that city with all the majesty of historical superstition nulla palam causa delapsum camaloduni simulacrum victoriae ac retro conversum quasi cederet hostibus et foeminae in furore turbatae adesse exitium canebant externosque fremitus in curia eorum auditos consonuisse ululatibus theatrum visamque speciem in aestuario notam esse subversae coloniae jam oceanum cruento aspectu dilabente aestu humanorum corporum effigies relictas ut britanni ad spem ita veterani ad metum trahebant annals lib xiv c      the roman general paulinus suetonius on this news suddenly marched across the kingdom from his conquests in north wales to london which finding himself unequal to defend with his small army he evacuated to the fury of the enemy after reinforcing his troops with all the natives who were fit to serve neither the tears nor prayers of the inhabitants could prevale on him to give them his protection destroyed by the briton the enraged boadicia destroyed all who continued behind verulamium met with the same fate in all the three places seventy thousand romans and british allies perished tac annals lib xiv c      when the romans became masters of london enlarged by the romans they enlarged the precincts and altered their form it extended in length from ludgate hill to a spot a little beyond the tower the breadth was not half equal to the length and at each end grew considerably narrower mr maitland suspects that the walls were not built till a very late period of the empire and that it was an open town because the city happened to be surprised long an open town in the days of dioclesian and maximilian by a party of banditti who were cut off by a band of roman soldiers who fortunately had at the very time they were engaged in the plunder come up the river in a fog the time in which the wall was built is very uncertain some ascribe the work to constantine the great when walled maitland to theodosius governor of britain in     as to the last we know no more than that after he had cleared the country of the barbarians he redressed grievances strengthened the garrisons and repaired the cities and forts ammianus marcellinus lib xxviii c   which had been damaged if london was among those it certainly implies a prior fortification possibly their founder might have been constantine as numbers of coins of his mother helena have been discovered under them placed there by him in compliment to her to support this conjecture we may strengthen it by saying that in honor of this empress the city about that time received from her the title of augusta which for some time superseded the ancient one of londinium long before this period it was fully romanized and the customs manners buildings and arts of the conqueror adopted the commerce of the empire flowed in regularly came in a direct channel from the several parts then known not as in the earlier days when described by strabo by the intervention of other nations for till the settlement of the roman conquest nothing could come immediately from italy the ancient course of the walls was as follows  it began with a fort near the present site of the tower extent and form was continued along the minories and the back of houndsditch across bishopsgate street in a strait line by londonwall to cripplegate then returned southward by crowders well alley where several remnants of lofty towers were lately to be seen to aldersgate thence along the back of bull and mouth street to newgate and again along the back of the houses in the old bailey to ludgate soon after which it probably finished with another fort where the house late the kings printing house in black friars now stands from hence another wall ran near the riverside along thames street quite to the fort on the eastern extremity in another place i shall have occasion to mention that the river at present is moved considerably more to the south than it was in the times in question  towers the walls were three miles a hundred and sixtyfive feet in circumference guarded at proper distances on the land side with fifteen lofty towers some of them were remaining within these few years and possibly may still maitland mentions one twentysix feet high near gravellane on the west side of houndsditch another about eighty paces southeast toward aldgate and the bases of another supporting a modern house at the lower end of the street called the vineyard south of aldgate but since his publication they have been demolished so that there is not a trace left the walls when perfect are supposed to have been twentytwo feet high the towers forty these with the remnants of the wall proved the roman structure by the tiles and disposition of the masonry londonwall near moorfields is now the most entire part left of that ancient precinct  i must not omit the barbican a specula the specula or watchtower belonging to every fortified place this stood a little without the walls to the northwest of cripplegate  the gates which received the great military roads were four the gates the praetorian way the saxon watling street passed under one on the site of the late newgate vestiges having been discovered of the road in digging above holbornbridge it turned down to dowgate or more properly dwrgate or watergate where there was a trajectus or ferry to join it to the watling street which was continued to dover the hermin street passed under cripplegate and a vicinal way went under aldgate by bethnal green toward oldford a pass over the river lee to duroleiton the modern leiton in essex  in most parts of ancient london antiquities roman antiquities have been found whenever it has been thought necessary to dig to any considerable depth beneath the old saint mary le bow were found the walls windows and pavement of a roman temple and not far from it eighteen feet deep in adventitious soil was the roman causeway the great elevation of the present ground above its former state will be taken notice of in another place  in digging the foundation for the rebuilding of st pauls was found a vast coemetery first lay the saxons in graves lined with chalkstones or in coffins of hollowed stones beneath them had been the bodies of the britons placed in rows abundance of ivory and boxen pins about six inches long marked their place these were supposed to have fastened the shrouds in which the bodies were wrapped parentalia p      these perishing left the pins entire in the same row but deeper were roman urns intermixed lamps lacrymatories fragments of sacrificial vessels were also discovered in digging toward the northeast corner and in      not far from the east corner at a considerable depth beneath some flinty pavement were found numbers of vessels of earthen ware and of glass of most exquisite colors and beauty some inscribed with the names of deities heroes or men of rank others ornamented with variety of figures in bas relief of animals and of rosetrees tesulae of jasper porphyry or marble such as form the pavement we so often see were also discovered also glass beads and rings large pins of ivory and bone tusks of boars and horns of deer sawn through also coins of different emperors among them some of constantine which at once destroys the conjecture of mr maitland who supposes that this collection were flung together at the sacking of london by our injured boadicia  in      another coemetery was discovered in camomile street adjoining to bishopsgate it lay beneath a handsome tesselated pavement and contained numbers of urns filled with ashes and cinders of burnt bones with them were beads rings a lacrymatory a fibula and a coin of antoninus  in spittlefields in spittlefields was another roman buryingplace of which many curious particulars are mentioned by old stow in p     of his survey of london and camden gives a brief account of another discovered in goodmans fields among those sound in spittlefields was a great ossuary made of glass encompassed with five parallel circles and containing a gallon and a half it had a handle a very short neck and wide mouth of a whiter metal this was presented to sir christopher wren who lodged it in the museum of the royal society parentalia p     grews museum   0  i point out these as means of discovering the ancient roman precincts of the city the coemeteries must have been without the walls it being a wise and express law of the xii tables that no one should be buried within the walls i cannot think that the urns found near st pauls were funebrial if that should have been the case the roman walls must have been much farther to the east than they have been placed which by no means appears to have been the fact  i will only mention two other antiquities found here very few indeed have been preserved out of the multitude which must have been found in a place of such importance and the capital of the roman empire in britain the first is a sepulchral monument in memory of vivins marcianus a roman soldier of the second legion quartered here erected by his wife januaria matrina his sculpture represents him as a british soldier probably of the cohors britonum dressed and armed after the manner of the country with long hair a short lower garment fastened round the waist by a girdle and fibula a long sagum or played flung over his breast and one arm ready to be cast off in time of action naked legs and in his right hand a sword of vast length like the lymore of the later highlanders the point is represented resting on the ground in his left hand is a short instrument with the end seemingly broken off this sculpture was found in digging among the ruins after the fire in     in the vallum of the prtion camp near ldgate the soldiers were always buried in the ll the citizens in the perium parentalia p      the pmerium was a space on the outside of fortified towns on which all buildings were prohibited  without the gates it is very differently represented by mr gale the hair in his figure is short the sword also short and held with the left hand across his body the instrument is placed in the left hand and resembles an exact bet the ss also differs i give the preference to the figure given by mr hersly gales iter anton    britannia romana     tab     which he corrected after the figure given by doctor pridx from the arundelian marbles but mr hsely fairly confesses that the representation is far more elegant than in the mutilated original  saxon invation after the romans deserted britain a new and fierce race succeeded the warlike saxons under their leaders hengest and horsa landed in     at upwines fleot the present ebbsflete in the isle of thanet the britons remained masters of london at lest nine years after that event for receiving a defeat in     at creccanford crayford they evacuated kent and fled with great fear to the capital sax chron  by the year  0  it seems to have recovered from the ravages of the invaders it became the chief town of the kingdom of essex sebert was the first christian king and his maternal uncle ethelbert king of kent founded here a church dedicated to st paul at this time bid informs us that it was an emporium of a vast number of nations who resorted there by sea and by land  in the reign of that great prince alfred london or to use the saxon name lundenburg was made by him capital of all england in consequence of a vow he had made he sent sighelm bishop of sherbourn first to rome and from thence to india with alms to the christians of the town of st thomas now called bekkeri or meliapour who returned with various rich gems some of which were to be seen in the church of sherbourn in the days of william of malmesbury sax chron    will melsh lib ii      it must not be omitted that he was the first who from this island had any commerce with that distant country our commerce by sea even in the next century was not very extensive the wise monarch athelstan being obliged for the encouragement of navigation to promise patents of gentility to every merchant who should on his own bottom make three voyages to the mediterranean  the succeeding ravages of the danes reduced london norman conquest and its commerce to a low ebb yet it seems in some measure to have recovered itself before the conquest we are wonderfully in the dark respecting its state of government both in the saxon period and that of the conquest in respect to the former we know no more than that it was governed by a portreve or portgrave long governed by a portgrave or guardian of the port and this we learn from the concise charter granted to the city by william the conqueror in which he salutes william the bishop and godfrey the portreve and all the burgesses willm king griet willm bishop and godfreg porteren

portgrave were united in the government for in the saxon charters they are mentioned together in the time of edward the confessor alswar the bishop and wolfgar my portgrave william bishop and swerman my portgrave  london certainly could not have been in the very low condition which some writers represent it to have been at the time of the conquest it had ventured to sally out on the conqueror but without success it fell more by internal faction than its own weakness yet there was strength enough left to make william think proper to secure their allegiance by building that strong fortress the tower in seventy years from that event an historian fitzstephen of that period pretends that london mustered sixty thousand foot and twenty thousand horse if this is any thing near the truth is it possible but london must have been very powerful at the time of the conquest for the reigns between that period and of stephen were not well calculated for a great increase of population i rather concur with them who think that the muster must have been of the militia of the neighboring counties and london the place of rendezvous a writer peter de blois archdeacon of london see fitzstephen p    in the note of that period and at the very time resident in the capital with more appearance of truth makes the number of inhabitants only forty thousand  during the time of the conqueror and till the reign of richard i the name of the civil governor continued the same that monarch to support the madness of the crusade received from the citizens a large sum of money and in return permitted them to choose annually two officers under the name of bailiffs or sheriffs who were to supersede the former the names of the two first upon record are wolgarius and geffry de magnum  in the next reign was added the office of mayor changed to a mayor a title borrowed from the norman maire as well as the office henry fitzalwyn was the first elected o that trust he had been before mayor but only by the nomination of his prince  in the reign of henry iii after the citizens had suffered many oppressions he restored a form of government and appointed twentyfour citizens to share the power in his sons reign we find the city divided into twentyfour wards the supreme magistrate of which was named alderman aldermen an exceeding ancient saxon title aelderman a man advanced in years and accordingly supposed to be of superior wisdom and gravity in the time of edgar the office was among the first in the kingdom ailwyn ancestor to the first mayor was alderman of all england what the duties of his office were does not appear  he must be a briarcus in literature who would dare to attempt a history of our capital on the great the liberal the elegant plan which it merits i a puny adventurer animated with a mind incapable of admitting a vacant hour restless when unemployed in the rural scenes to which my fortunate lot has destined me must catch and enjoy the idea of the minute in the pursuit of my plan i wish to give a slight view of the shores i am about to launch from the account must be brief and confined limited to what i shall say of their ancient state to the period bounded by the revolution intermixed with the greater events which have happened in nearer days  the choice of the situation of this great city was most judicious it is on a gravelly soil and on a declivity down to the borders of a magnificent river the slope is evident in every part of the ancient city and the vast modern buildings the ancient city was defended in front by the river on the west side by the deep ravine since known by the name of fleetditch on the north by morasses on the east as i suspect by another ravine all the land round westminster abbey was a flat sen which continued beyond fulham but a rise commences opposite to it and forms a magnificent bend above the curvature of the thames even to the tower the surry side was in all probability a great expanse of water a lake a llyn as the welsh call it which an ingenious countryman of mine mr william owen of barmouth now resident in london  not without reason thinks might have given a name to our capital llyn din or the city on the lake this most probably was the original name and that derived from llong a ship and din a town might have been bestowed when the place became a seat of trade and famous for the concourse of shipping the expanse of water might have filled the space between the rising grounds at deptfor and those at clapham and been bounded to the south by the beautiful surry hills lambeth marsh and the bank side evidently were recovered from the water along lambeth are the names of narrow walls or the mounds which served for that purpose and in southwark bankside again shows the means of converting the ancient lake into useful land even to this day the tract beyond southwark and in particular that beyond bermondsey street is so very low and beneath the level of common tides that the proprietors are obliged to secure it by embankments  i begin my account by crossing over the thames into surry surry which with sussex formed the country of the ancient regni being part of this island to which the romans permitted a kingly government merely to enjoy the insolent boast of having kings as their slaves the saxons bestowed on this part their own names of suthry or suthrea from its situation on the southern part of the river i proceed to my accustomed walk of lambeth lambeth in the earlier times it was a manor possibly a royal one for the great hardiknut died here in  0   in the midst of the jollity of a wedding dinner and here without any formality the usurper harold is said to have snatched the crown and placed it on his own head at that period it was part of the estate of goda wife to walter earl of mantes and eustace earl of boulogne who presented it to the church of rochester but reserved to herself the patronage of the church it became in      the property of the sea of canterbury by exchange transacted between glanville bishop of rochester and the archbishop hubert walter glanville reserved out of the exchange a small piece of land on which he built a house called rochester place for the reception of the bishops of rochester whenever they came to attend parliament in      john de shepey built stangate stairs for the convenience of himself and retinue to cross over into westminster fisher and hilsley were the last bishops who inhabited this palace after their deaths it fell into the hands of henry viii who exchanged with aldridge bishop of carliste for certain houses in the strand its name was changed to that of carlisle house ducarels lambeth     the small houses built on its site still belong to that see it had been the design of archbishop walter a college of secular monks projected here to have erected here a college of secular monks independent of those of canterbury it was originally designed by archbishop baldwyn to have been built at hackington near that city but such a jealousy did those holy men conceive at the thought of a rival house so near to their own that by their interest with the pope the project was laid aside it was afterward resumed by hubert walter who thought he could give no offense by erecting the college on this distant manor but the monks obtaining a bull from the pope in their favor and such humiliating terms prescribed to the archbishop that from thenceforth he entirely desisted from the design      the mortifications which the primates met with in the prosecution seem to have first determined them in fixing their residence here walter and langton successively lived at the manorhouse of lambeth the last improved it but the building was afterward neglected and became ruinous no pious zeal restored the place but the madness of priestly pride boniface a wrathful and turbulent primate elected in      took it into his head to become a visitor of the priory of st bartholomew to which he had no right the monks met him with reverential respect but assured him the office did not belong to the bishop the meek prelate rushed on the subprior knocked him down kicked beat and buffeted him tore the cope off his back and stamped on it like one possessed while his attendants paid the same compliments to all the poor monks the people enraged at his unpriestly conduct would have torn him to pieces when he retired to lambeth and by way of expiation rebuilt it with great magnificence  this palace was very highly improved by the munificent henry chichely who enjoyed the primacy from      to      i lament to find so worthy a man to have been the founder of a building so reproachful to his memory as the lollards tower at the expense of near two hundred and eighty pounds neither protestants or catholics should omit visiting this tower the cruel prison of the unhappy followers of wickliffe the vast staples and rings to which they were chained before they were brought to the stake ought to make protestants bless the hour which freed them from so bloody a religion catholics may glory that time has softened their zeal into charity for all sects and made them blush at these memorials of the misguided zeal of our ancestors  this palace suffered greatly in the civil wars after those of york and lancaster it was restored by archbishop morton he also built the gateway in the lower room of which are still to be seen the rings to which the overflowings of the lollards tower were chained  after the civil wars of the last century fanatical fury when fanatical was united with political fury it was found that every building devoted to piety had suffered more than they had done in all the rage of family contest the fine works of art and the sacred memorials of the dead were except in a few cases sacrificed to puritanical barbarism or to sacrilegious plunder lambeth tell to the share of the miscreant regicide scot he turned the chapel into a hall and levelled for that purpose the fine monument of archbishop parker he pulled down the noble hall the work of chichely and sold the materials for his own profit juxon on the restoration found the palace of his predecessors a heap of ruins his piety rebuilt a greater part than could have been expected from the short time he enjoyed the primacy he rebuilt the great hall on the ancient model when the archbishop with his particular friends sat at the high table the steward with the servants who were gentry of the better rank sat at the table on the right hand side the almoner the clergy and others occupied the table on the left none but nobility or privy counselors were admitted to the table of the archbishop the bishops themselves sat at the almoners the other guests at the stewards all the meat which was not consumed was regularly given to the idle poor who waited in crowds at the gate it is not the defect of charity in modern prelates that this custom is difused but the happy change in the times every one must now eat the bread of his own industry a much more certain support than the casual bounty of the great which misfortunes often prevented and left the object a prey to misery and famine what is styled the luxury of the times has by no means superseded deeds of alms wealth is more equally diffused but charity is equally great it passes now through many channels and makes less noise than when it was poured through fewer streams  library the fine library in this palace was founded by archbishop bancroft who died in    0 and left all his books to his successors for ever the succeeding archbishop abbot bequeathed all his books in his great study marked c c in the same unlimited manner  on the suppression of episcopacy this valuable library was preserved by the address of the celebrated mr seldom it seems that archbishop bancroft had left his books to his successors on condition that the immediate successor was to give bond that they should not be embezzled but delivered entire from one to the other for ever on failure of this article they were to go to chelsea college in case it was built in six years after his decease the college never was finished but whether any of bancrofts successors gave the security does not appear the books were remaining at lambeth in      two years after the execution of archbishop laud when probably fearing for their safety in times so inimical to learning mr seldom suggested to the university of cambridge their right to the books and the whole were delivered into their possession on the restoration archbishop juxon demanded the return of the library which was repeated by his successor sheldon as founded on the will of the pious founder and they were restored accordingly archbishop sheldon added a considerable number and archbishop tenison augmented it with part of his books  that very worthy prelate archbishop secker besides a considerable sum expended on making catalogues to the old registers of the sea left to the library all such books from his own as were not in the former which comprehended much the largest and most valuable part of his own collection  archbishop cornwallis bestowed many valuable books in his lifetime and the present archbishop has given a considerable sum for fitting up a proper repository for the valuable collection of manuscripts the whole number of printed books amounts to twentyfive thousand  the other apartments have within these few years received considerable improvements gs the great gallery which is near ninety feet long by fifteen feet nine inches broad has lately had the addition of a bow window by the present amiable primate an opening has been made toward the river by the cutting down of a few trees which admits a most beautiful view of the water part of the bridge and of the venerable abbey this gallery is filled with portraits of primates or prelates among others that of cardinal pole the founder of this very room over the chimney are the heads of those of the earlier times such as archbishop warham by holbein st dunstan and archbishop chichely the first imaginary the last probably taken from painted glass among these distinguished characters katherine parr has found a place and not without just clame it being reasonable to suppose but for the death of her tyrant she would have been devoted to the stake for the favor she bore to the reformed religion i must not omit mention of the two portraits of archbishop parker second primate of the protestant religion one is by holbein the other by richard line who jointly practiced the arts of painting and engraving in the service of this great patron of science granger i  0    in the dining room is a succession of primates from the violent and imprudent laud to the quiet and discreet cornwallis the portrait of laud is admirably done by vandyke juxon from a good original which i saw last year at longleate tenison by simon dubois herring by hogarth hutton by hudson secker by reynolds and cornwallis by dance here are besides in the gallery by the last master portraits of terrick late bishop of london and thomas late bishop of winchester and another of bishop hoadley which does honor to the artist his wife sarah curtis when i looked into the garden i could not but recall the scene of conference between the great the wise earl of clarendon and the unfortunate laud hyde laid before him the resentment of all ranks of people against him for his passionate and illmannered treatment even of persons of rank the primate attended to the honest chancellor with patience and palliated his faults life of edward earl of clarendon octavo ed i     the advice was forgotten nor his folly cured till he had involved himself and master in destruction  a more phlegmatic cohabitant of the garden longevity of a tortoise enjoyed his situation during many successions to this selfdevoted metropolitan a tortoise introduced here in his days in      lived till the year      the time of archbishop herring and possibly might have lived till the present had it not been killed by the negligence of the gardener  in the vestry is a portrait of luther and his wife the lady appears pregnant this great reformer left three sons john martin and paul  in one of the apartments of the palace is a performance that does great honor to the ingenious spouse of a modern dignitary a copy in needlework of a madonna and child after a most capital performance of the spanish murillo there is most admirable grace in the original which was sold last winter at the price of eight hundred guineas in mr vanderguchts sale  it made me lament that this excellent master had wasted so much time on beggars and ragged boys beautiful as it is the copy came improved out of the hand of our skilful countrywoman a judicious change of color of part of the drapery has had a most happy effect and given new excellence to the admired original  church the parish church of lambeth is at a small distance from the palace has a plain tower and the architecture of the gothic of the time of edward iv it has very little remarkable in it except the figure of a pedlar and his dog painted in one of the windows tradition says that the parish was obliged to this man for the bequest of a piece of land which bears the name of the pedlars acre  before i go any farther let me mention the sad example of fallen majesty in the person of mary deste the unhappy queen of james ii who flying with her infant prince from the ruin impending over their house after crossing the thames from the abdicated whitehall took shelter beneath the ancient walls of this church a whole hour from the rain of the inclement night of december  th      here she waited with aggravated misery till a common coach procured from the next inn arrived and conveyed her to gravesend from whence she sailed and bid an eternal adieu to these kingdoms rapin  d ed folio ii       in this place rest from their labors several of the later primates without any remarkable monument except their good works to preserve them from oblivion among them is bancroft tenison hutton and in a passage leading to the palace are the remains of secker  here likewise was interred the mild amiable bishop tunstal and polished prelate cuthbert tunstal bishop of durham who deprived on account of his attachment to the old religion by edward vi was restored by mary and again deprived by elizabeth here he found an asylum in the family of archbishop parker so highly was he esteemed even by the protestants here he passed his days with honor and tranquillity till his death in       in the same church are the remains of thirlebye bishop thirlebye once bishop of ely deprived for the same cause by elizabeth by the charity of the abovementioned great prelate he found the same protection as his fellowsufferer tunstal to show the humanity of protestantism he was indulged with the company of his secretary he merited every favor being joined in commission with bonner for the degradation of cranmer he performed his office with as much tenderness as his associate did with brutality and melted into tears over fallen greatness his body was found in digging the grave for archbishop cornwallis his long and venerable beard and every part was entire and of a beautiful whiteness a slouched hat was under his left arm his dress that of a pilgrim as he esteemed himself to be upon earth  a neat bust with the body in armor and with artillery robert scot drums and trophies around exhibits the military character of robert scot who entered into the service of gustavus adolphus and brought with him two hundred men he was made mustermaster general to that hero afterward he went into the service of denmark and finally in      closed his life in that of charles i who made him gentleman of his privy chamber and bestowed on him a pension of six hundred a year he was of the family of the ancient barons of bawtrie in north britain but his character surpassed his origin inventor of leathern artillery he was the inventor of leathern artillery which he introduced into the army of gustavus and by that means contributed highly to the glorious victory of leipsic heart and other historians of that illustrious prince speak of the invention and its important services but were either ignorant of the inventor or chose to suppress his merit hartes hist gustavus adelphus  d ed i    ii     tilly himself confesses the superiority of these portable cannons after his own heavy artillery so admirably served as they were sunk under the vivacity of the fire of these light pieces  tomb of the tradescants in the churchyard is a tomb which no naturalist should neglect visiting that of old john tradescant who with his son lived in this parish the elder was the first person who ever formed a cabinet of curiosities in this kingdom the father is said to have been gardener to charles i but parkinson says sometimes belonging to the right honorable lord robert earl of salisbury lord treasurer of england in his time and then unto the right honorable the lord wotton at canterbury in kent and lastly unto the late duke of buckingham parkinson s paradiur terrestris      both father and son were great travelers the father is supposed to have visited russia and most parts of europe turkey greece many of the eastern countries egypt and barbary out of which he introduced multitudes of plants and flowers unknown before in our gardens his was an age of florists the chief ornaments of the parterres were owing to his labors parkinson continually acknowleges the obligation many plants were called after his name these the linnaean system has rendered almost obsolete but the great naturalist has made more than reparation by giving to a genus of plants the title of tradescantia species plantarum i      museum tradescantianum the museum tradescantianum a small book adorned by he hand of hollar with the heads of the father and the son is a proof of their industry it is a catalogue of their vast collection not only of the subjects of the three kingdoms of nature but of artificial rarities from great variety of countries the collection of medals coins and other antiquities appears to have been very valuable zoology was in their time but in a low state and credulity far from being extinguished among the eggs is one supposed to have been of the dragon and another of the griffin you might have found here two feathers of the tail of the phoenix and the claw of the ruck a bird able to trusse an elephant notwithstanding this the collection was extremely valuable especially in the vegetable kingdom in his garden at his house in south lambeth their garden was an amazing arrangement of trees plants and flowers it seems to have been particularly rich in those of the east and of north america his merit and assiduity must have been very great for the eastern traveller must have labored under great difficulties from the barbarity of the country and north america had in his time been but recently settled yet we find the names of numbers of trees and plants still among the rarer of much later times to him we are also indebted for the luxury of many fine fruits for as parkinson observed the choysest for goodness and rarest for knowledge are to be had of my very good friend master john tradescante who has wonderly labored to obtain all the rarest fruits he can hear off in any place of christendom turkey yea or the whole world parkinsons paradisus terrestris p      he lived at a large house in this parish and had an extensive garden much visited in his days after his death which happened about the year      his collection came into the possession of the famous mr elias ashmole by virtue of a deed of gift which mr tradescant junior had made to him of all his rarities in true astrological form being dated december           hor  0 minutes post merid ashmoles diary     mr ashmole also purchased the house which is still in being the garden fell to decay in the year      it was visited by two respectable members of the royal society the late sir william watson and doctor mitchel  see ph trans vol xlvi p   0  who found among the ruins some trees and plants which evidently were introduced here by the industrious founder the collection of curiosities were removed by mr ashmole to his museum at oxford where they are carefully preserved many very curious articles are to be seen among others several original dresses and weapons of the north americans in their original state which may in some period prove serviceable in illustrating their manners and antiquities  monument described the monument of the tradescants was erected in      by hester relict of the younger it is an altar tomb at each corner is cut a large tree seeming to support the slab at one end is an hydra picking at a bare scull possibly designed as an emblem of envy on the other end are the arms of the family on one side are ruins grecian pillars and capitals an obelisk and pyramid to denote the extent of his travels and on the opposite a crocodile and various shells expressive of his attention to the study of natural history time had greatly injured this monument but in      it was handsomely restored at the parish expense and the inscription which was originally designed for

cumberland teagardens and several other buildings  from lambeth i returned by the waterside near the end of westminster bridge along a tract once a dreary marsh and still in parts called lambeth marsh about the year    0 there was not a house on it from lambeth palace as far as southwark sir william dugdale dugdales embankments p    makes frequent mention of the works for securing it in old times by embankments or walls as they are styled to restrain the ravages of the tide the embankments in southwark must have been the work of the romans otherwise they never could have erected the buildings or made the roads of which such frequent vestiges have been found most of this tract is become firm land and covered with most useful buildings even to the edge of the river mrs coades artificial stone in a street called narrow wall from one of the ancient embankments is mrs coades manufacture of artificial stone her repository consists of several very large rooms filled with every ornament which can be used in architecture the statue the vase the urn the rich chimneypieces and in a few words every thing which could be produced out of natural stone or marble by the most elegant chisel is

church in essex and which was formed on a most admirable antique model was denied to the public eye in a place where liberality ought to have enjoyed the freest reign  english wines notwithstanding the climate of great britain has at lest of late years been unfavorable to the production of wines yet in the year      we began to make some from the raisins or dried grapes of spain and portugal francis chamberlayne made the attempt and obtained a patent for fourteen years in which it is alleged that his wines would keep good during several years and even in a voyage under the very line rymers foedera xix      the art was most successfully revived several years ago by mark beaufoy and the foreign wines most admirably mimicked such is the prodigality and luxury of the age that the demand for many sorts exceeds in a great degree the produce of the native vineyards we have skilful fabricators who kindly supply our wants it has been estimated that half of the port and fivesixths of the white wines consumed in our capital have been the produce of our home winepresses the product of duty to the state from a single house was in one year from july  th      to july  th      not

frontiniac to the more elegant tables the madeira the caleavella and the lisbon into every part of the kingdom  this great work and that for the making of vinegar and vinegar is at a small distance from mrs coades i can scarcely say how much i was struck with the extent of the undertaking there is a magnificence of business in this ocean of sweets and sours that cannot fail exciting the greatest admiration whether we consider the number of vessels or their size great tons the boasted ton at heydelberg does not surpass them on first entering the yard two rise before you covered at the top with a thatched dome between them is a circular turret including a winding staircase which brings you to their summits which are above twentyfour feet in diameter one of these conservatories is full of sweet wine and contains fifty eight thousand one hundred and nine gallons or eighteen hundred and fifteen barrels of winchester measure its superb associate is full of vinegar to the amount of fifty six thousand seven hundred and ninetynine gallons or seventeen hundred and seventyfour barrels of the same standard as the former the famous german vessel yields even to the last by the quantity of forty barrels according to mr keysler the heydelberg vessel holds two hundred and four tons   besides these is an avenue of lesser vessels which hold from thirtytwo thousand five hundred to sixteen thousand nine hundred and seventyfour gallons each after quitting this brobdignagian scene we pass to the acres covered with common barrels we cannot diminish our ideas so suddenly but at first we imagined we could quaff them off as easily as gulliver did the little hogsheads of the kingdom of lilliput  this ground so profitable to the proprietors and so productive of revenue to the state was in my memory the scene of low dissipation cupers garden here stood cupers garden noted for its fireworks and the great resort of the profligate of both sexes this place was ornamented with several of the mutilated statues belonging to thomas earl of arundel which had been for that purpose begged from his lordship by one boyder cuper a gardener in the family howard memoirs     the more valuable part were bought by lord lemster father of the first earl of pomfret and presented by the earls widow to the university of oxford these grounds were then rented by lord arundel on the pulling down of arundelhouse to make way for the street of that name these and several others of the damaged part of the collection were removed to this place numbers were left on the ground near the riverside and overwhelmed with the rubbish brought from the foundation of the new church of st pauls these in aftertimes were discovered dug up and conveyed to the seat of the duke of norfolk at worksop manor injured as they are they appear from the etchings given by doctor ducarel to have had great merit  the great timberyards great timberyards beneath which these antiquities were found are very well worthy of a visit one would fear that the forests of norway and the baltic would be exhausted to supply the want of our overgrown capital were we not assured that the resources will successively be increasing equal to the demand of succeeding ages  in this parish are the vast distilleries great distillery till of late the property of sir joseph mawhey there are seldom less than two thousand hogs constantly grunting at this place which are kept entirely on the grains i lament to see the maxim of private vices being public benefits so strongly exemplified in the produce of the duty on this stygian liquor from july  th      to july  th      it yielded l   0000 and i have been told of a single distiller who contributed to that sum l   000  to the south are st georges fields st georges fields now the wonder of foreigners approaching by this road to our capital through avenues of lamps of magnificent breadth and goodness i have heard that a foreign ambassador who happened to make his entry at night imagined that these illuminations written before the shameful adulteration of the oil has almost given to this once glorious splendour as well as that of most of our streets little better than a darkness visible were in honor of his arrival and as he modestly expressed more than he could have expected on this spot have been found remains of tesselated pavements coins and an urn full of bones gales in anton     possibly the site of a summer camp of the romans in this place it could have been no other it was too wet for a residentiary station its neighbor lambeth marsh was in the last century overflown with water but st georges fields might from their distance from the river admit of a temporary encampment   on approaching st georges fields from westminsterbridge are two charities of uncommon delicacy and utility the first is the westminster lyingin hospital this is not instituted merely for the honest matron who can depose her burden with the consciousness of lawful love but also for the unhappy wretches whom some villain in the unguarded moment has seduced and then left a prey to desertion of friends poverty want and guilt least such may be driven to despair by such complicated misery and be tempted to destroy themselves and murder their infants see the account of the institution  here was founded in      this humane preventative the westminster new lyingin hospital to obviate all objection to its being an encouragement to vice no one is taken in a second time but this most excellent charity is open to the worthy distressed matron as often as necessity requires none are rejected who have friends to recommend and of both descriptions upwards of four thousand have experienced its salutary effects  farther on is another institution of a most heavenly nature asylum or house of refuge calculated to save from perdition of soul and body the brighter part of the creation such on whom providence has bestowed angelic faces and elegant forms designed as blessings to mankind but too often debased to the vilest uses the hazard that these innocents constantly are liable to from a thousand temptations from poverty from death of parents from the diabolical procuress and often from the stupendous wickedness of parents themselves who have been known to sell their beauteous girls for the purpose of prostitution induced a worthy band to found in the year      the asylum or house of refuge long may it flourish and eternal be the reward of those into whose minds so amiable a conception may have entered  for the salvation of those unhappy beings who had the ill fortune to lose the benefits of this divine institution at a small distance is the magdalen hospital magdalen hospital for the reception of the penitent prostitutes to save from vice is one great merit to reclame and restore to the dignity of honest rank in life is certainly not less meritorious the joy at the return of one sinner to repentance is esteemed by the highest authority worthy of the heavenly host that ecstasy i trust this institution has often occasioned since its foundation in the same year with the former to december   th      not fewer than      have been admitted of these it is not to be wondered that long and evil habits are often incurable  00 have been discharged uneasy under constraint    proved lunatics and afflicted with incurable fits  0 have died    never returned from hospitals they were sent to     discharged for faults and irregularities  how to be dreaded is the entrance into the bounds of vice since the retreat from its paths is so difficult finally   0  prodigals have been returned to their rejoicing parents or placed in reputable services or to honest trades banes to idleness and securities against a future relapse  ian tres in this neighborhood are two theaters of innocent recreation in which every government should indulge its subjects as preservations from worse employs and as relaxations from the cares of life of a nature unknown to every other part of europe the british hippedromes belonging to messrs astley and hughes where the wonderful gacity of that most useful animal the horse is fully evinced while we admire its admirable docility and apprehension we cannot less admire the powers of the riders and the graceful attitudes the human frame is capable of receiving but there is another species of amusement usually reckoned of a despicable kind yet ever since i read doctor delaneys thoughts observations upon lord orrerys remarks on the life and writings of doctor swft p     to     on the subject i have looked on the art of tumbling with admiration it shows us how fearfully and wonderfully we are made what infinite misfortunes would befall us which almost every step is liable to was it not for that wise construction of parts that pliability of limb that unperceived by us protects us in every contrived motion or accidental slip from the most dire and disabling calamities  borough of southwark the borough of southwark joins to the parish of lambeth on the east and consists of the parishes of st olaves st saviors st georges and st thomass  it was called by the saxons suthverke or the south work in respect to some fort or fortification bearing that aspect from london it was also called the borough or burg probably for the same reason it was long independent of the city of london but in consideration of the inconveniences arising from the escape of malefactors from the great capital into this place it was in      granted by edward iii to the city on payment of ten pounds annually it was then called the village of southwark it was afterward styled the bailiwick of southwark and the mayor and commonalty of london appointed the bailiff this power did not seem sufficient to remedy the evil a more intimate connection was thought necessary in the reign of edward vi on a valuable consideration paid to the crown it was formed into a twentysixth ward by the title of bridge ward without and sir john ayliff was its first alderman it had long before enjoyed the privilege of sending members to parliament it is mentioned among the boroughs in the time of edward iii but the names of the first members which appear are robert acton and thomas bulle in      the members are elected by the inhabitants paying scot and lot and returned by the bailiff  the first time that southwark is mentioned in history is on occasion of earl godwins sailing up the river to attack the royal navy of fifty ships lying before the palace of westminster this was in  0   when we are told he went ad suthwecree and stayed there till the return of the tide simeon dunelm in x script i       st georges church is of considerable antiquity it is mentioned in      when thomas of arderne and his son bestowed it on the neighboring monks of bermondsey stows survae      it was rebuilt in      by price with a spire steeple most aukwardly standing upon stilts   of charles brandn not far from this church stood the magnificent palace of charles brandon duke of suffolk the deserved favorite of henry viii after his death in      it came into the kings hand who established here a royal mint it at that time was called southwark place and in great measure preserved its dignity edward vi once dined in it his sister and successor presented it to heath archbishop of york as an inn or residence for him and his successors the mint whenever they repaired to london as to the mint it became a sanctuary to insolvent debtors at length becoming the pest of the neighborhood by giving shelter to villains of every species that awakened the attention of parliament which by the statutes   and   william iii c      george i c    and    george i c    entirely took away its abused privileges  kings bench prison the kings bench prison in this parish is of great antiquity to this prison was committed henry prince of wales afterward henry v by the spirited and honest judge gascoigne for striking or insulting him on the bench it is difficult to say which we should admire most the courage of the judge or the peaceful submission of the prince to the commitment after he was freed from the phrenzy of his rage the truth of the fact has been doubted but it is delivered by several grave historians such as hall who died in      who mentions it folio   grafton perhaps his copyist at p     and the learned sir thomas elyot a favorite of henry viii in his book called the governor relates the same in p  0  book ii c   of that treatise these were all long prior to shakespeare or the author of another play in the time of queen elizabeth styled henry v it must have been the poets that took up the relation from the historians and not the historians from the poets as some people have asserted this was not the only time of his commitment in      he was confined by john hornesby dugdales hist of warwickshire i      mayor of coventry in the cheleysmor in that city and arrested with his two brothers in the priory probably for a riot committed there the reform of this great prince was very early for i never can believe him to have been a hypocrite when he wrote in that strain of piety to his father on the subject of a victory obtained at usk over the famous glyndwr tour in wales i      the other play of henry v which i allude to was written before the year      in the scene in which the historical account of the violence of the prince against the chief justice is introduced richard tarlton a famous comedian and mimic acts both judge and clown one knell another drole comedian of the time acted the prince and gave the chief justice such a blow as felled him to the ground to the great diversion of the audience tarlton the judge goes off the stage and returns tarlton the clown he demands the cause of the laughter o says one had thou beenst here to have seen what a terrible blow the prince gave the judge what strike a judge says the clown terrible indeed must it be to the judge when the very report of it makes my cheek burn br biog iii        marshaleen the prison of the marshalsea which belongs to that court and also to the kings palace at westminster stands here this court had particular cognizance of murders and other offenses committed within the kings court such as striking which in old times was punished with the loss of the offending hand here also persons guilty of piracies and other offenses on the high seas were confined in      it was broke open by a mob of sailors who murdered a gentleman confined in it for killing one of their comrades and who had been pardoned by the count stows survaie      it was again broke open by wat tyler and his followers in      it escaped in the infamous riots of    0 but the kings bench and the borough prison and another borough prison called the clink were nearly at the same instant sacrificed to their fury  parisgarden in this parish near the water on bankside stood parisgarden one of the ancient playhouses of our metropolis ben johnson is reproached by one decker an envious critic with his ill success on the stage and in particular with having performed the part of zuliman at parisgarden it seems to have been much frequented on sundays this profanation was at length fully punished by the dire accident which heavendirected befell the spectators in      when the scaffolding suddenly fell and multitudes of people were killed or miserably maimed the omen seems to have been accepted for in the next century the manor of parisgarden was erected into a parish and a church founded under the name of christs this calamity seems to have been predicted by one crowley a poet of the reign of henry viii who likewise informs us that in this place were exhibited bearbaitings as well as dramatical entertainments and upon sundays as they are to this time at the combat des animaux at paris  what folly is this to keep with danger a great mastive dog and foul ouglie bear and to this an end to see them two fight with terrible tearings a full ouglie sight and methinkes those men are most fools of al whose store of money is but very small and yet every sunday they will surely spend one penny or two the bearwards living to mend at paris garden each sunday a man shall not fail to find two or three hundred for the bearwards vale one halfpeny a piece they use for to give when some have not more in their purses i believe well at the last day their conscience will declare that the poor ought to have all that they may spare if you therefore give to see a bear fight be sure god his curse upon you will light beyond this place of brutal amusement were the beargarden and place for baiting of bulls the british circi herein says stow survaie   0  were kept bears bulls and other beasts to be bayted as also mastives in several kenels nourished to bayt them these bears and other beasts are there kept in plots of ground scaffolded about for the beholders to stand safe in the old maps these circi are engraven  bearbaiting bearbaiting made one of the amusements of the romantic age of queen elizabeth for there was still left a strong tincture of those of the savage and warlike period it was introduced among the princely pleasures of kenilworth in      where the drole author of the account introduces the bear and dogs deciding their ancient grudge per

ambassadors to be carried to this theater to divert them with these bloody spectacles strypes annals i       not far from these scenes of cruel pastime was the bordello the stews or stews permitted and openly licensed by government under certain laws or regulations they were farmed out even a lord mayor the great sir william walworth did not disdain to own them and he rented them to the froes i e the bawds of flanders among other regulations no stewholder was to admit married women nor like pious calvinists in holland to this present day were they to keep open their houses on sundays nor were they to admit any women who had on them the perilous infirmity of burning etc etc stows survaie     these infamous houses were suppressed in the reign of henry viii the pretense of these establishments was to prevent the debauching the wives and daughters of the citizens so that all who had not the gift of continence might have places to repair to perhaps in days when thousands were tied up by vows of celibacy these haunts might have been necessary for neither cowl nor cope had virtue sufficient to annihilate the strongest of human passions old latimer complains bitterly that the offense was not taken away with the suppression of the houses one thing i must here says the zealous preacher desire you to reform my lords you have put down the stews but i pray you whow is the

peculiarly protected by any coeval member of the sacred college neither would i by any means insinuate that the bishops of winchester and rochester or the abbots of waverley or of st augustines in canterbury or of battle or of hyde or the prior of jews had here their temporary residences for them or their trains for the sake of these conveniences in that period of cruel and unnatural restriction  besides these temporary mansions of holy men were others for those who preferred the monastic life the first religious house was that of st mary overie st mary overie said to have been originally founded by a maiden named mary for sisters and endowed with the profits of a ferry cross the eye or river thames swithen a noble lady changed it into a college of priests but in the year   0  it was refounded by william pont de larche and william dauncy norman knights for canons regular the last prior was bartholomew linsted alias foul who surrendered the convent to henry in october

built the conventual church it certainly was not the present church for in the days of giffard the round arch and clumsy pillar was in full fashion this church was probably burnt in the fire which consumed the priory in   0  for we know it was rebuilt in the time of richard ii or henry iv the whole is a beautiful pile of gothic architecture in form of a cross but much deformed by a wooden

dowgate and probably was the continuation of the watlingstreet road this is supposed to have been a roman trajectus and the ferry from londinum into the province of cantium marks of the ancient causey have been discovered on the london side on this the name evinces the origin the saxons always give the name of street to the roman roads and here they gave it the addition of stein or stoney from the pavement they found it composed of  deadmans place lies a little farther tradition says that it took its name from the number of dead interred there in the great plague soon after the restoration  from the calamity which destroyed this church and the religious house in the year   0  arose one of our noblest hospitals that of st thomas st thomass hospital after the fire the canons built at a small distance from the priory an occasional building for their reception till their house could be rebuilt but in      peter de rupibus bishop of winchester disliking the situation removed it to a place on which richard a norman prior of bermondsey had in      erected a hospital for converts and poor children which he called the almery peter de rupibus new founded it for canons regular and endowed it with three hundred and fortyfour pounds a year it was held from the prior and abbot of bermondsey till the year      when a composition was made between the abbot and the master of the hospital of st thomas for all the lands and tenements held of the abbey for the old rent to be paid to the said abbot at the dissolution it was surrendered into the hands of the king in      it was founded a third time by the citizens of london who purchased the suppressed hospital in july they began the reparation and in november following opened it for the reception of the sick and poor not fewer than two hundred and sixty were the first objects of the charity the patron was at the same time changed the turbulent thomas becket very properly giving place to the worthy apostle st thomas  toward the end of the last century the building fell into decay in the year      the governors solicited the benevolence of the public for its support and with such success that they were enabled to rebuild it on the magnificent and extensive plan we now see it consists of three courts with colonnades between each three wards were built at the sole cost of thomas frederic esquire of london and three by thomas guy citizen and stationer the whole containing eighteen wards and     beds the expenses attending this foundation are about l  0000 a year in the middle of the second court is a statue in brass of edward vi and beneath him the representation of the halt and maimed  in that of the third court is a stone statue of sir robert clayton knight lord mayor of london dressed in character in his gown and chain he gave l  00 toward rebuilding this hospital and left l   00 toward the endowing it the statue was erected before his death which happened in       this excellent institution has

total in the year         mr guys hospital mr guy not satisfied with his great benefactions to the hospital of st thomas determined to be the sole founder of another the relation is very remarkable at the age of seventysix he took a lease of the governors of the former of a piece of ground opposite to it for the term of nine hundred and ninetynine years and on it in      at the expense of l          s began to build the hospital which bears his name and left to endow it the prodigious sum of l        amassed from a very small beginning chiefly by purchasing seamens tickets in the reign of queen anne and by his great success in the buying and selling south sea stock in the memorable year    0 and also a vast sum by the sale of bibles he seems to have profited both of god and mammon i think he was a native of tamworth and representative for that borough his death happened on december   th      before which he saw his hospital covered with the roof in the first court is his statue in brass dressed in his livery gown besides his public expenses he gave during life to many of his poor relations l  0 or l  0 a year and to others money to advance them in life to his aged relations l   0 in

marble he is represented standing in his livery gown with one hand raising a miserable sick object and with the other pointing to a second object on a bier carried by two persons into his hospital this superfluity cost a thousand pounds a proof of the exuberant wealth of the foundation which could spare such a sum to be wasted on an idle needless occasion i was told that at this time there were only two hundred beds three wards being out of use undergoing certain alterations but i could not obtain the lest account of the annual number of patients or of expenditure or revenue which other hospitals never fail of laying before the public  in the laboratory is a large medallion in white marble of the great and pious boil  the other religious house in southwark was bermondsey bermondsey abbey founded in  0   by aylwin child a citizen of london for monks of the cluniac order a cargo of which were imported hither by favor of archbishop lanfranc in the year  0   from the priory de caritate on the loire in nivernois soon after the resumption of the alien priories it was converted into an abbey by richard ii in      tanner  it was surrendered into the kings hands by robert de wharton who had his reward not only of a pension of l       s   d but also the bishopric of st asaph williss abbeys i   0 in commendam the revenues of the house at the dissolution were l        s   d the poor monks received the annual pension of from ten to about five pounds apiece  the conventual church was then pulled down by sir thomas pope who built a magnificent house on the site this became the habitation of the ratcliffs earls of sussex thomas the great rival of the favorite earl of leicester breathed his last within its walls  the present parochial church of st mary magdalen was founded by the priors of bermondsey for the use of their adjoining tenants  the remains of antiquity in this neighborhood are the ancient gate of the abbey with a large arch and a postern on one side adjoining is part of a very old building and on passing beneath the arch and turning to the left is to be seen within a court a house of very great antiquity called for what reason i know not king johns court  bermondsey street may at present be called the great wool staple of our kingdom here reside numbers of merchants who supply rochdale leicester derby exeter and most other weaving countries in this kingdom with that commodity as southwark may be considered as a great suburb to london numbers of other trades are carried on there to a vast extent the tanners curriers hatters dyers ironfounders ropemakers sailmakers and blockmakers occupy a considerable part of the borough  the most eastern parish in southwark is that of st olave or olaf so named from the danish prince who was massacred by his pagan subjects st olave or olafs church the church appears to have been founded near five hundred years ago maitland ii       the parish extends from the spot on london bridge on which was the drawbridge and stretches along the waterside as far as st saviors dock in this parish near the church was the inn or lodging of the abbot of jews in sussex the chapel is still remaining converted into a cellar and by the accumulation of earth sunk under ground and a gothic building now turned into a wine vault belonging to the kingshead tavern may have been part of the mansion  on sellengers wharf stood the townhouse of the abbot of st augustines at canterbury which being granted to sir anthony saintleger the wharf was named after him but corrupted according to the modern spelling maitland ii        the abbot of battle had also here his citymansion battlebridge or rather stairs took its name from the house as did the streets called the mazes from the luxurious intricacies in his magnificent gardens strypes stow i book iv p      st saviors dock or as it is called savory st saviors dock bounds the eastern end of this parish st saviors dock may be considered as the port of southwark it is in length about four hundred yards but of most disproportionable breadth not exceeding thirty feet the borough will certainly give it a more useful magnitude and also rebuild the warehouses and magazines on each side it is at present solely appropriated to barges which discharge coals copperas from writtlesea in essex pipeclay corn and various other articles of commerce if the dock was deepened and correspondent wharfs erected sloops and lesser vessels might come from different seaports and here discharge their cargoes without the expense of reloading lesser craft in order to reland them at this dock  it anciently belonged to the priory of st saviors bermondsey as did certain adjacent mills which in      were let by the monks to one john curlew for l   then the value of eighteen quarters of good wheat and he was besides bound to grind gratis all the corn used in that religious house  rothephithe on the east side of the dock commences the parish of rotherhithe or redriff which consists chiefly of one street of a vast length running along the shore and winding with the great bend of the river to a very small space from deptford the church dedicated to st mary is remarkable for its steeple a fluted spire terminating in the ionic scroll i introduce this parish because it is comprehended in the bills of mortality having been taken in in the year      with five other parishes near the extremity of this parish are the docks for the greenland ships a profitable nuisance very properly removed to a distance from the capital the greater dock is supposed to have been the mouth of the famous canal cut in  0   by king canute in order to avoid the impediment of london bridge and to lay siege to the capital by bringing his fleet to the west side  the look hospital the look in southwark was a hospital for leprous persons it was dedicated to st leonard and existed in the time of edward ii till lately it was under the care of the hospital of st bartholomew appropriated to the cure of another loathsome disease the word changed into lock possibly has allusion to the necessity of their being locked or kept apart from all other patients  as the borough high street was the great passage into a great part of our kingdom to and from our capital tabard chaucers inn it was particularly well furnished with inns i shall only mention one immortalized by chaucer the sign is now perverted into the talbot it originally was the tabard so called from the sign  a sleeveless coat open on both sides with a square collar and winged at the shoulders worn by persons of rank in the wars with their arms painted on them that they might be known the use is now transferred to the heralds this was the rendezvous of the jolly pilgrims

higher character than the ghost in his own play of hamlet it appears to have been of an octagonal form and is said to have been covered with rushes see an engraving of it in vol i of johnsons shakespeare  i have been told that the door was very lately standing james i granted a patent to laurence fletcher william shakespeare richard burbage augustine philippes john heminges henry condell william sly robert armin and richard cowlie and others of his majestys servants to act here or in any other part of the kingdom notwithstanding the modesty of shakespeare made him decline taking any considerable part in his own productions his goodnature and friendship for the morose ben johnson induced him to act both in the sejanus and every man in his humor a benevolence that greatly contributed to bring the latter into public notice but in shakespeares own plays dick burbage as he was familiarly called was the favorite actor condell and heminges were his intimate friends and published his plays in folio seven years after his death  the playhouses in and about london were by this time extremely numerous there not being fewer than seventeen between the year    0 and       westminster i now return to the extremity of the western part of our capital on the opposite shore in the time of queen elizabeth the shore correspondent to lambeth was a mere marshy tract millbank millbank the last dwelling in westminster is a large house which took its name from a mill which once occupied its site here in my boyish days i often experienced the hospitality of the late sir robert grovenour its worthy owner who enjoyed it by the purchase by one of his family from the mordaunts earls of peterborough all the rest of his vast property about london devolved on him in right of his mother mary daughter and heiress of alexander davies of ebury in the county of middlesex i find in the plan of london by hollar a mansion on this spot under the name of peterboroughhouse it probably was built by the first earl of peterborough it was inhabited by his successors and retained its name till the time of the death of that great but irregular genius charles earl of peterborough in      it was rebuilt in its present form by the grovenour family  a little farther was the ancient horseferry between westminster and lambeth horseferry suppressed on the building of westminsterbridge  a little beyond the horseferry stands the church of st john the evangelist one of the fifty voted by parliament to give this part of the town the air of the capital of a christian country it was begun in      and finished in      the architect was sir john vanbrugh notwithstanding it is deservedly censured for its load of ornaments they are by no means destitute of beauty the aim at excess of magnificence is not a fault peculiar to the builder  at a small distance to the east is that noble specimen of gothic architecture westminster abbey the conventual church of st peters abbey of westminster the church is said to have been founded about the year   0 by sebert king of the east saxons founded by sebert on the ruins of the temple of apollo flung down quoth legend by an earthquake the king dedicated his new church to st peter who descended in person with a host of heavenly choristers to save the bishop of mellitus the trouble of consecration the saint descended on the surry side in a stormy night but prevaling on edric a fisherman to waft him over performed the ceremony and as a proof left behind the chrism and precious droppings of the wax candles with which the astonished fisherman saw the church illuminated he conveyed the saint safely back who directed him to inform the bishop that there was no farther need of consecration he likewise directed edric to fling out his nets who was rewarded with a miraculous draft of falmons the saint also promised to the fisherman and his successors that they never should want plenty of salmon provided they presented every tenth to his church this custom was observed till at lest the year      the fisherman that day had a right to sit at the same table with the prior and he might demand of the cellerer ale and bread and the cellerer again might take of the fishs tail as much as he could with four fingers and his thumb erect  the place in which it was built was then styled thornie island from its being overrun with thorns and briers and it was besides insulated by a branch of the thames this church was burnt by the danes burnt by the danes rebuilt by edgar and restored by the incontinent king edgar in     under the influence of st dunstan the most continent of men and such a lover of celibacy that he drove out of the church every married priest edgar ravished nuns but he founded or refounded fifty monasteries and planted with very poor endowments in this twelve monks of the benedictine order  again by edward the confessor it was reserved for the pious confessor to rebuild both church and abbey he began the work in  0   and finished it in a most magnificent manner in  0   and endowed it with the utmost munificence an abbey is nothing without relics reliqus here was to be found the veil and some of the milk of the virgin the bladebone of st benedict the finger of st alphage the head of st maxilla and half the jaw bone of st anastasia the good edward was buried in his own church william the conqueror bestowed on his tomb a rich pall and in      henry ii lodged his body in a costly ferretry translating it from its pristine place  whether from the decay of the building rebuilt a third time by henry iii or a particular zeal and affection henry iii had for the royal confessor i cannot say but that prince pulled down the saxon pile and rebuilt it in the present elegant and magnificent style in      he began this great work in the mode of architecture which began to take place in his days he did not live to complete his design which was carried on by his successor and finished in his fourteenth year a casual fire destroyed the roof but by the piety of edward and several of the abbots it was restored to the beauty and splendour we so justly admire  henry performed two acts of pious respect to the remains of the founders of this abbey which must not be omitted he translated those of sebert into a tomb of touchstone beneath an arch made in the wall above were paintings long since defaced done by order of the king who was strongly imbued with the love of the arts mr walpole anecdotes of painting i   and seq has preserved several of the precepts for number of paintings in this church and other places among them is directions for painting duos cherumbinos cum hilar i vultu et jocoso  shrine of edward the confessor by cavalini but what does that prince the most honor is the shrine engraven by mr virtue and published among the vetusta monumenta ab xvi  which he caused to be made in honor of the confessor placed in a chapel which bears his name this beautiful mosaic work was the performance of peter cavalini inventor of that species of ornament it is supposed that he was brought into england by the abbot ware who visited rome in      weever expressly says he brought from thence certain workmen and rich porphery stones whereof he made that curious singular rare pavement before the high altar and with these stones and workmen he did also frame the shrine of edward the confessor funeral monuments      this beautiful memorial consists of three rows of arches the lower pointed the upper round and on each side of the lower is a most elegant twisted pillar an ornament the artist seems peculiarly fond of children or childish age has greatly injured this beautiful shrine by picking out the mosaic through the shameful connivance of the attendant vergers  another by the same artist this is not the only specimen of cavalinis skill which we possess in this kingdom mr walpole has at his beautiful villa near town another shrine of his workmanship brought in      from the church of santa maria maggiore in rome and placed in a chapel in his gardens it was erected in      over the bodies of the holy martyrs simplicius faustina and beatrix by john james capoccio and vinia his wife it differs in form from the shrine of st edward but is formed of the same materials and adorned with the same twisted columns  along the freeze of the screen of the chapel are fourteen legendary sculptures respecting the confessor they are so rudely done that we may conclude that the art at this time was at a very low ebb the first is the trial of queen emma the next the birth of edward another is his coronation the fourth tells us how our saint was frightened into the abolition of the danegelt by his seeing the devil dance upon the money bags the fifth is the story of his winking at the thief who was robbing his treasury the sixth is meant to relate the appearance of our savior to him the seventh shows how the invasion of england was frustrated by the drowning of the danish king eighthly is seen the quarrel between the boys tosti and harold predicting their respective fates in the ninth sculpture is the confessors vision of the seven sleepers tenthly how he meets st john the evangelist in the guise of a pilgrim eleventhly how the blind were cured by their eyes being washed in his dirty water twelfthly how st john delivers to the pilgrims a ring in the thirteenth they deliver the ring to the king which he had unknowingly given to st john as an alms when he met him in the form of a pilgrim this was attended with a message from the saint foretelling the death of the king and the fourteenth shows the consequential haste made by him to complete his pious foundation all these are accurately engraven and fully explained in the first volume of mr carters antiquities   in this very chapel is a third proof of the skill of either cavalini or some of his pupils henry iii his tomb by the e it is an altar tomb of henry himself enriched like the shrine and with wreathed columns at each corner see sandfrds genealogies     dart tab    vol ii  goughs sepulch mon i    tab xx xxi  the figure of this prince who died in      is of brass and placed recumbent this is supposed to have been the first brazen image known to have been cast in our kingdom the little book sold to the visitors of this solemn scenery at the door will be a sufficient guide to the fine and numerous funebrial memorials of the place let me only observe that here may be read an excellent lecture on the progress of these efforts of human skill from the simple altar tomb to the most ostentatious proofs of human vanity the humble recumbent figure with uplifted hands as if deprecating the justice of heaven for the offenses of this mortal state or the proper kneeling attitude supplicating that mercy which the purest must stand in need of may be seen here in various degrees of elegance the careless lolling attitude of heroes in long gowns and flowing perriwigs next succeed and after them busts or statues vaunting their merits and attended with such a train of pagan deities that would almost lead to suppose oneself in a heathen pantheon instead of a christian church  in the ancient tombs there is a dull uniformity the sides are often embellished with figures of the offspring of the deceased often with figures of mourners pleureurs or weepers see the curious contract in dugdales warwickshire p     between the executors of richard beauchamp earl of warwick and john essex marbler william austin founder and thomas stevens coppersmith

instance one of the six sons of henry lord norris who appear kneeling round his magnificent cenotaph for he was buried at rycot in the chapel of st andrew this figure has one hand on his breast the other a little removed from it in attitude of devotion inexpressibly fine lord norris died in      dugdales baronage ii  0   dart by mistake calls this nobleman francis who was grandson to henry and left only one child a daughter he fell a suicide in a fit of proud resentment for an imaginary affront on account of a lord scrope which he had not the sense or the courage to accommodate in a proper manner   another proof is in the monument of sir francis vere who died in   0  distinguished by thirty years of able service in the low countries in the reign of elizabeth he lies in a gown recumbent over him four ne figures of armed knights kneeling on one knee support a marble slab on which are strewed the various parts of his armor at bredah is the tomb of ingelbert ii count of nassau who died

he is placed dressed like a grecian warrior on an altar in a manner that did great credit to nicholas stone or rather to the earl to whom mr walpole justly attributes the design  the figure of doctor busby master of westminster school who died in      is elegant and spirited he lies resting on one arm a pen in one a book in the other hand his countenance looking up his loose dress is very favorable to the sculptor who has given it most graceful flows the close cap alone is inimical to his art  i cannot go through the long series of tombs nor will i attempt like the egyptians of old to bring the silent habitants to a posthumous trial or bring their frailties to light i will only mention the crowned heads who here repose till that day comes which will level every distinction of rank and show every individual in his proper characters qualis erat says a beautiful and modest inscription iste dies indicabit  edward i the second of our monarchs who lies here is the renowned edward i in an altar tomb as modest and plain as his fame was great a long inscription in monkish lines imperfectly records the deeds of the conqueror of scotland and of the ancient britons in    0 antiquarian curiosity was so urgent with the respectable dean of westminster as to prevale on him to permit certain members of the society under proper regulations to inspect the remains of this celebrated hero and discover if possible the composition which gave such duration to the human body  in the minute relation given by that able and worthy antiquary the late sir joseph ayloffe bart almost every particular is given on lifting up the lid of the tomb the royal body was found wrapped in a strong thick linen cloth waxed on the inside the head and face were covered with a sudarium or facecloth of crimson sarcenet wrapped into three folds conformable to the napkin used by our savior in his way to his crucifixion as we are assured by the church of rome on flinging open the external mantle the corpse was discovered in all the ensigns of majesty richly habited the body was wrapped in a fine linen cerecloth closely fitted to every part even to the very fingers and face the writs de cera renovanda circa corpus regis edwardi primi archaelogia iii              similar warrants were issued on account of edward iii richard ii and henry iv being extant gave rise to this search over the cerecloth was a tunic of red silk damsk above that a stole of thick white tissue crossed the breast and on this at six inches distant from each other quatrefoils of philligreework of gilt metal set

and covered over with silver on an altar tomb the head was as the guide tells us of solid silver which in the reign of henry viii was sacrilegiously stolen away the wooden headless trunk still remains  on each side of this royal chapel is a winding staircase enclosed in a turret of open ironwork which leads into a chauntry founded for the purpose of masses for the repose of the soul of this great prince the front looks over the shrine of the confessor here is kept a parcel of human figures which in old times were dressed out and carried at funeral processions but at present very deservedly have got the name of the ragged regiment more worthy of notice is the elegant termination of the columellae of the two staircases which spread at the top of the turrets into roofs of uncommon elegance  one end of this chauntry rests against that of the chapel of henry vii among the stone statues placed there is the french patron st dennis most composedly carrying his head in his hand  on the south side of the chauntry over his monument is the representation of his coronation the figure of henry is distinguished by a wen under his chin it is probable that it was belonging to that monarch as it

paid to her remains she had sunk from the bed of the conqueror of france to that of a common gentleman yet gave to these kingdoms a long line of princes she died in      and was interred in the chapel

duke of york in the reign of charles ii certain small bones were found in a chest under a staircase in the tower these by order of charles were removed here and under the supposition of their

popular sign of the white rose abbot islip on the part of the king laid the first stone on february   th   0  the royal miser scrupled no expense in this piece of vanity by his will it appears that he

william benson subscribed to the kings supremacy and in      surrendered his monastery into the royal hands and received as a reward the office of first dean to the new foundation consisting of a dean and twelve prebendaries he also erected it into a bishopric but its only bishop was thomas thirleby it being suppressed in    0 on his translation to norwich when the protector somerset ruled in the fullness of power this magnificent this sacred pile narrowly escaped a total demolition it was his design to have pulled it down to the ground and to have applied the materials toward the palace he was then erecting in the strand known by the name of somerset house he was diverted from his design by a bribe of not fewer than fourteen manors  mortals should be very delicate in pronouncing the vengeance of heaven on their fellow creatures yet in this instance without presumption without superstition one may suppose his fall to have been marked out by the almighty as a warning to impious men he fell on the scaffold on tower hill lamented only because his overthrow was effected by a man more wicked more ambitious and more detested than himself in their ends there was a consent of justice both died by the ax and both of their headless bodies were flung within a very short space into the same place among the attainted herd  in the reign of queen mary the former religion of the place experienced a brief restoration she with great zeal restored it to the ancient conventual state collected many of the rich habits and insignia of that splendid worship established fourteen monks and appointed for their abbot john feckenham a man of great piety and learning who on his expulsion in the succeeding reign finished his days in easy custody in wisbech castle  in    0 it was changed into a collegiate church consisting of a dean and twelve secular canons and thirty petty canons and other members two schoolmasters and forty kings or queens scholars twelve almsmen and many officers and servants tanner  but there seems to have been a school there from the first foundation of the abbey ingulphus abbot of crowland speaks of his having been educated at it and of the disputations he had

the floor of the former is supported by a short round pillar quite hollow the top spreads into massy plain ribs the supports of the roof the walls are not less than eighteen feet thick and form a most firm base to the superstructure they had been pierced with several small windows which are now lost by the vast increase of earth on the outside this crypt is only accessible through the house of mr barrow  one is just visible in the garden belonging to mr barrow  the jerusalem chamber was part of the abbots lodgings and built by littlington it is noted for having been the place where henry iv breathed his last he had been seized with a swoon while he was paying before the shrine of st edward and being carried into this room asked on recovering where he was being informed he answered i will speak his reply in the words of shakespeare borrowed from history laud be to god  even there my life must end it has been prophesied to me many years i should not die but in jerusalem which vainly i supposed the holy land the devil is said to have practiced such a delusion on pope sylvester ii having on consultation assured his holiness that he should die in jerusalem and kept his word by taking

innocent who was instantly carried to his brother in the tower where they were soon after involved in one common fate  to the west of the sanctuary stood the eleemosynary or almory where the alms of the abbey were wont to be distributed but it is still more remarkable for having been the place where the first printing press ever known in england was erected it was in the year      when william caxton probably encouraged by the learned thomas milling then abbot produced the game and play of the chesse the first book ever printed in these kingdoms there is a slight difference about the place in which it was printed but all agree that it was within the precincts of this religious house would the monks have permitted this could they have foreseen how certainly the art would conduce to their overthrow by the extension of knowledge and the longconcealed truths of christianity  beneath the shadow of the abbey stands the church of st margeret built originally by edward the confessor st margarets church the parish church had been in the abbey to the great inconveniency of the monks it was rebuilt in the time of edward i and again in that of edward iv this church is honored with the remains of the great sir walter raleigh who was interred here on the same day on which he was beheaded in old palace yard it was left to a sensible churchwarden to inform us of the fact who inscribed it on a board about twenty years ago  the east window is a most beautiful composition of figures its fine window it was made by order of the magistrates of dort and by them designed as a present to

from its use was called the clock tower this may be seen in hollars print no   and in the old plan of london as it was in the beginning of the reign of queen elizabeth  westminster hall many parts of this ancient palace exist to this day sunk into other uses succeeding monarchs added much to it the great hall was built by william rufus or possibly rebuilt a great hall being too necessary an appendage to a palace ever to have been neglected the entrance into it from new palace yard was bounded on each side by towers kip has given a view of it no  0  most magnificently ornamented with numbers of statues in rows above each other now lost or concealed by modern buildings a mutilated figure of an armed man supposed to have been one was discovered under the exchequer staircase in

eight years and nine months in completing at the expense of l     00 its length is      feet the number of arches fourteen that in the center seventysix feet wide in this bridge grandeur and simplicity are united fault has been found with the great height of the balustrades which deny to the passengers a clear view of the noble expanse of water and the fine objects especially to the east which are scattered with no sparing hand i cannot agree with the happy thought of the french traveller m grosleys tour to london i        who assures us that the cause was to prevent the suicide to which the english have so strong a propensity particularly in the gloomy month of november for had they been low how few could resist the charming opportunity of springing over whereas at present the difficulty of climbing up these heights is so great that the poor hypochondriac has time to cool and desisting from his glorious purpose think proper to give his days their full length and end them like a good christian in his peaceful bed  the tide has been known to rise at this bridge twentytwo feet tide much to the inconveniency of the inhabitants of the lower parts of westminster for at such times their cellars are laid under water but its height depends much on the force and direction of the wind at the time of flood  beyond this palace to the north canon or channel row stood some streets and lanes by the waterside distinguished in older times by the residence of some of our nobility in canon row so named from being inhabited by the canons of the church but corrupted into channel row was the stately house built by the termagant anne stanhope wife to the protector somerset whose dispute about some point of female precedence is said to have contributed in some degree to her husbands fall she left this house to her son edward earl of hertford here william earl of derby had in   0  a fair mansion and henry clinton earl of lincoln another and in this row anne clifford tell us that on the first of may      she was begotten by her most valiant father george earl of cumberland on the body of her most virtuous mother margaret daughter of francis earl of bedford astonishing accuracy  in this part of the town were some other houses of our nobility in the remote tothil street stood the houses of lord gray and of lord dacres mentioned in nordens map of london in

new view of london ii       palace of whitehall immediately beyond these buildings began the vast palace of whitehall it was originally built by hubert de burgh earl of kent the great the persecuted justiciary of england in the reign of henry iii he bequeathed it to the black friars in holborn and they disposed of it to walter de gray archbishop of york in      it became for centuries the residence of the prelates of that see and was styled yorkhouse in it wolsey took his final leave of greatness the profusion of rich things hangings of cloth of gold and of silver thousands of pieces of fine holland the quantities of plate even of pure gold which covered two great tables see fiddess life of wolsey      all of which were seized by his cruel rapacious master are proofs of his amazing wealth splendour and pride henry deigned to purchase the palace from his fallen servant the ancient palace of westminster having some time before suffered greatly by fire from this time it became the residence of our princes till it was almost wholly destroyed by the same element in       henry had an uncommon composition his savage cruelty could not suppress his love of the arts his love of the arts could not soften his savage cruelty the prince who could with the utmost sang froid burn catholics and protestants take off the heads of the partners of his bed one day and celebrate new nuptials the next had notwithstanding a strong taste for refined pleasures he cultivated architecture and painting and invited from abroad artists of the first merit to holbein was owing the most beautiful gate at whitehall built with bricks of two colors fine gate glazed and disposed in a tesselated fashion the top as well as that of an elegant tower on each side were embattled on each front were four busts in baked clay in proper colors which resisted to the last every attack of the weather possibly the artificial stone revived in this century these i have been lately informed are preserved in a private hand this charming structure fell a sacrifice to convenience within my memory as did another in      built at the same time but of far inferior beauty both these gates are engraven in plates xviixviii of the vetusta monumenta published by the society of antiquaries  and also by kip  the last blocked up the road to king street and was called kingsgate henry built it as a passage to the park the tenniscourt bowlinggreen the cockpit and tiltingyard for he was extremely fond of athletic exercises they suited his strength and his temper  it was the intention of william duke of cumberland to rebuild the beautiful gate first mentioned at the top of the long walk at windsor and for that purpose had all the parts and stones numbered but unfortunately the design was never executed  tiltyard the tiltyard was equally the delight of his daughter elizabeth as singular a composition for with the truest patriotism and most distinguished abilities were interwoven the

that he had undertaken the voyage to see her majesty who for beauty and wisdom excelled all other beauties in the world she labored at an audience to make melvil acknowledge that his charming mistress was inferior in beauty to herself memoirs     the artful scot evaded her question she put on a new habit of every foreign nation each day of audience to attract his admiration so fond was she of dress that three thousand different habits were found in her wardrobe after her death mortifying reflection in finding such alloy in the greatest characters  she was very fond of dancing i admire the humor she showed in using this exercise whenever a messenger came to her from her successor james vi of scotland for sir roger aston assures us that whenever he was to deliver any letters to her from his master on lifting up of the hangings he was sure to find her dancing to a little fiddle affectedly that he might tell james by her youthful disposition how unlikely he was to come to the throne he so much thirsted after weldons court of king james     hentzner who visited this palace in      her library informs us that her royal library was well stored with greek italian latin and french books

anjou visited england and was received with every species of coquetry on the first of january      in the tiltyard of this palace great tournament held in honor of the duc danjou the most sumptuous tournament ever celebrated was held here in honor to the commissioners sent from france to propose the marriage a banqueting house most superbly ornamented was erected at the expense of above a thousand seven hundred pounds the gallerie adjoining to her majestys house at whitehall says the minute holinshed whereat her person should be placed was called romantic fooleries and not without cause the castle or fortress of perfect beauty her majesty at the time aged fortyeight received every flattery that the charms of fifteen could clame this fortress of perfect beauty was assailed by desire and his four foster children the combatants on both sides were persons of the first rank a regular summons was first sent to the possessor of the castle with the delectable song of which this is part yield yield o yield you that this fort do hold which seated is in spotless honors feeld  desires great force no forces can with hold then to desires desire o yield o yield which ended two canons were fird off one with sweet powder and the other with sweet water and after there were store of pretty scaling ladders and then the footmen threw flowers and such fancies against the walls with all such devises as might seem fit shot for desire in the end desire is repulsed and forced to make submission and thus ended an amorous foolery which if the reader is endowed with more patience than myself he may find to fill near six great pages in the historian aforesaid from p      to p        noble band of knights tilters two principal heroes of the time were sir henry lee knight of the garter the faithful devoted knight of this romantic princess sir henry lee the queens champion and george earl of cumberland the first had made a vow to present himself armed at the tiltyard on the   th of november annually till he was disabled by age this gave rise to the annual exercises of arms during the reign the society consisted of twentyfive of the most distinguished personages about the court the list is given in the appendix  among them was sir christopher hatton and even the lord chancellor disabled by age resigns in great form i think sir thomas bromley age overtook sir henry in the thirtythird year of her majesty when he retired with great ceremony and recommended as his successor the famous hero the earl of cumberland of whom i have given an ample account in another place tour in scotland      vol ii  sir henry in the year    0 invested his successor with much form and in the true spirit of chivalry and romance in the presence of the queen and the whole court armed the new champion and mounted him upon his horse his own armor he offered at the foot of a crowned pillar near her majestys feet after which he clothed himself in a coat of black velvet pointed under the arm and instead of a helmet covered his head with a buttoned cap of the country fashion see mr walpoles miscellaneous antiquities no   p     he died aged  0 in the year      and was interred in the once elegant little church of quarendon near aylesbury it is difficult to say whether that or the tomb is most ruinous the figure of the knight appears in armor reclining with one hand supporting his head the other on his sword on his neck is a rich collar with the george pendant his hair is short and curled his face bearded and whiskered he lies beneath a rich canopy supported by suits of armor like ancient trophies the epitaph tell us the wars abroad with honor he did pass in courtly justs his sovereigns knight he was six princes he did serve in a work which furnished so few architectural subjects for the engraver i present the reader with the portrait of this venerable knight taken from an original in possession of the late mrs sydney lee of chester who with great politeness obliged me with a reduced copy he was sprung from a cheshire family the same which produced the lees earls of lichfield sir henry has by him a large dog to which he once was indebted for his life by accident it was left one night in his bedchamber unknown to a faithless servant who entered the room with an intent to rob and murder his master but was seized on his entrance by the affectionate animal  the other print is one of sir henrys associates in the gallant society robert earl of leicester clad for the tiltyard in complete armor the knights of this gallant band were drawn at the time in their proper armor the book was in possession of the late duchess dowager of portland who with her usual condescension and friendship permitted me to have any copies i chose   other amusements of elizabeth rowland white has left us a curious account of the amusements of this reign and with what spirit her majesty pursued her pleasures as late as her sixtyseventh year her majesty says she is very well this day she appoints a frenchman to do feate upon a rope in the conduit court tomorrow she has commanded the bears the bull and the ape to be bayted in the tiltyard upon wednesday she will have solemn dawncing sydneys state papers i       origin of the present banqueting house in the time of james i whitehall was in a most ruinous state he determined to rebuild it in a very princely manner and worthy of the residence of the monarchs of the british empire he began with pulling down the banqueting rooms built by elizabeth that which bears the name at present was begun in      from a design of inigo jones in his purest manner and executed by nicholas stone mastermason and architect to the king it was finished in two years and cost seventeen thousand pounds but was only a small part of a vast plan left unexecuted by reason of the unhappy times which succeeded the note to inigo jones surveyor of the works done about the kings houses   s   d per diem and l    per ann for houserent a clerk and other incidental expenses  mr walpole will show the small pay of this great architect  the cieling of this noble room cannot be sufficiently admired it was painted by rubens who had three thousand pounds for his work the subject is the apotheosis of james i it forms nine compartments one of the middle represents our pacific monarch on his earthly throne turning with horror from mars and other of the discordant deities and as if it were giving himself up to the amiable goddess he always cultivated to her attendants commerce and all the fine arts this fine performance is painted on canvass and is in fine preservation but a few years ago underwent a repair by mr cipriani who as i am told had two thousand pounds for his trouble near the entrance is a bust of the royal founder  little did james think that he was erecting a pile from which his son was to step from the throne to the scaffold he had been brought in the morning of his death from st jamess across the park and from thence to whitehall where ascending the great staircase he passed through the long gallery to his bedchamber the place allotted to him to pass the little space before he received the fatal blow it is one of the lesser rooms marked with the letter a in the old plan of whitehall he was from thence conducted along the galleries and the banqueting house through the wall in which a passage was broken herberts memoirs      warwicks memoirs      to his last earthly stage this passage still remains at the north end of the room and is at present the door to a small additional building of late date at the time of the kings death contiguous to the banqueting house was a large building with a long roof and a small cupola rising out of the middle represented in one of hollars prints  the late duchess of portland did me the honor of showing to me a rich pearl surmounted with a crown which was taken out of the ear of the murdered monarch after his head was struck off this is figured in one of the private plates engraven at the expense of her grace   the banqueting house has been many years past converted into a chapel george i appointed a salary of l  0 a year to he paid to certain select preachers to preach here every sunday  cabinet of charles i the collection of paintings formed by this most accomplished prince was esteemed the first in europe they were kept in a room called the cabinetroom in this palace which was built by order of prince henry from a design of inigo jones i have a view of it and some of the ancient parts of whitehall which stood next to st jamess park this building is distinguished by the venetian window it stood on the fite of the duke of yorks house vanderdort was appointed keeper with a salary of l  0 a year on the death of henry it was confirmed to him by charles at the reduced salary of forty the view is taken from a drawing by levines an artist who had worked under rembrandt this i owe to the liberality of doctor combs  the pictures were sold by order of the ruling powers as a proof of his majestys judgment in collecting several were sold for a thousand pounds apiece a price seldom known in these days when money bears so far less a value  in    0 a complete plan of this great palace was taken by john fisher and engraven by virtue in      plan of whitehall it appears that extended along the river and in front along the present parliament and whitehall street as far as scotland yard and on the other side of those streets to the turning into spring garden beyond the admiralty looking into st jamess park the merry king his queen the royal brother prince rupert the duke of monmouth and all the great officers and all the courtly train had their lodgings within these walls and all the royal family had their different offices such as kitchens cellars pantries spiceries cyderhouse bakehouse woodyards and coalyards and slaughterhouse we see among the fair attendants of queen catherine many names which make a great figure in grammont and other chronicles of the time such as the countess of castlemaine mrs kirk and mrs killegrew as to nell gwynne nell gwynne not having the honor to be on the good queens establishment she was obliged to keep her distance at her house in what was then called pall mall it is the first good one on the left hand of st jamess square as we enter from pall mall the back room on the ground floor was within memory entirely of looking glass as was said to have been the cieling over the chimney was her picture and that of her sister was in a third room at the period i mention this house was the property of thomas brand esquire of the hoo in hertsordshire  the other royal favorites had the sanction of offices such as maids of honor and the like which in all ages like charity were sure to cover a multitude of sins  i must not omit that from the palace into the thames were two stairs one public the other the privy stairs for the use of majesty alone the first is still in use the other is made up in the old wall adjacent to the earl of fifes but the arch of the portal remains entire henry and his daughter elizabeth made all their parties by water or on horseback or now and then the last went mounted on a litter carried on mens shoulders coaches had been introduced into england by henry fitzalan earl of arundel one of her admirers but the spirited princess seems to have disdained the use she rode in a dress of form and magnificence equal to what she appeared in at the drawing room but never put on breeches or boots like the late czarina nor yet the equivocal dress of the ladies of the present age  no one is unacquainted with the noble and commodious improvements which succeeded the space occupied by the former palace most part of privy garden is covered with houses of nobility or gentry commanding most beautiful views of the river among the first on the site of the smallbeer cellar of which a view is preserved in no   of hollars prints of whitehall is the house of the earl of fife earl of fifes from his judicious embankment is a matchless view of its kind of the two bridges with the magnificent expanse of water somerset house st pauls and multitudes of other objects less magnificent but which serve to complete the beautiful scene  in the great room is some very fine gobelins tapestry i never can sufficiently admire the expression of passions in two of the subjects the fine history of joseph disclosing himself to his brethren and that of susanna accused by the two elders here are also great numbers of fine paintings by foreign masters but as i old horse guards confine myself to those which relate to our own country i shall only mention a small threequarters of mary stuart with her child an infant standing on a table before her this beautiful performance is on white marble  a head of charles i when prince of wales done in spain when he was there in      on his romantic expedition to court the infanta it is supposed to have been the work of velasco  a portrait of william earl of pembroke lord high chamberlain in the beginning of the reign of charles i a small full length in black with his white rod in one hand his hat in the other standing in a room looking into a garden such is the merit of this piece that notwithstanding it is supposed to have been the performance of jameson the scotch vandyck yet it has been often attributed to that great flemish painter mr walpole   in the vacant part of privy garden is still to be seen a noble statue in brass of our abdicated monarch executed by grinling gibbons the year before he deserted his throne  the horseguards had their stables in the place they occupy at this time but the present elegant building was erected in the reign of his late majesty after a design i think by vardy i have given a print from a painting in possession of the earl of hardwick of the horseguards as they were in the time of charles ii in it is the merry monarch and his dogs and in the back view the banqueting house one of the gates the present treasury in its ancient state and the top of the cockpit  the admiraltyoffice stood originally in dukestreet westminster but in the reign of king william was removed to the present spot to the house then called wallingfordhouse i believe from its having been inhabited by the knollyss viscounts wallingford from the roof the pious usher archbishop of armagh then living here with the countess of peterborough was prevaled on to take the last sight of his beloved master charles i when brought on the scaffold before whitehall he sunk at the horror of the sight and was carried in a swoon to his apartment  the present admiraltyoffice was rebuilt in the late reign it is a clumsy pile but properly veiled from the street by mr adamss handsome skreen mr walpole   palace for kings of scotland a little farther to the north stood in the place now occupied by scotlandyard a magnificent palace built for the reception of the scottish monarchs whenever they visited this capital it was originally given by king edgar to king ken for the humiliating purpose of his making to this place an annual journey for the purpose of doing homage for the kingdom of scotland and in after times for cumberland and huntingdon and other fiefs of the crown here margaret widow of james v of scotland and sister to henry viii resided for a considerable time after the death of her husband and was entertained with great magnificence by her royal brother as soon as he was reconciled to her second marriage with the earl of angus  charing cross a little above stood one of the celebrated memorials of the affection of edward i for his beloved elianor being the cross erected on the last spot on which the body rested in the way to the abbey the place of sepulture this and all the others were built after the designs of cavalini this was destroyed by the religious fury of the reformers from a drawing communicated to me by doctor combs it appears to have been of an octagonal form and in an upper stage ornamented with eight figures but the gothic parts far from being rich  the cross was in the next century replaced by a most beautiful and animated equestrian statue in brass fine statue of charles i of charles i cast in      by le soeur it was not erected till the year      when the parliament had ordered it to be sold and broke to pieces but john river the brazier who purchased it having more taste or more loyalty than his masters buried it unmutilated and showed to them some broken pieces of brass in token of his obedience m d archenholz gives a diverting anecdote of this brazier that he cast a vast number of handles of knives and forks in brass which he sold as made of the broken statue they were bought with great eagerness by the loyalists from affection to their monarch by the rebels as a mark of triumph over the murdered sovereign see m archenholzs tableau d angleterre i       on the site of part of northumberlandhouse st mary rounceval stood the chapel of st mary rounceval a cell to the priory of rouncevaux in navarre it was founded by william marshal earl of pembroke in the time of henry iii it was suppressed by henry v among the alien priories but rebuilt by edward iv who fixed a fraternity in it newcourt i      in the reign of edward vi a grant was made of the site to sir thomas cawarden tanner   not far from hence opposite to charing cross was an hermitage with a chapel dedicated to st catherine stowes survaie      this in      belonged to the sea of llandaff for i find in that year that william de radnor then bishop had leave from the king to lodge in the cloister of his hermitage at charing whenever he came to london williss landaff      on the north side of charing cross stand the royal stables called from the original use of the buildings on their site the mews having been used for keeping the kings falcons at lest from the time of richard ii in that reign the accomplished sir simon burley knight of the garter was keeper of the kings falcons at the meuse near charing cross this office was by charles ii granted to his son by nell gwyn charles duke of st albans and the heirs male of his body in the reign of henry viii the kings horses were kept here in      an accident by fire destroyed the building with a great quantity of hay and several great horses it was rebuilt in the reigns of edward vi and queen mary in the year      the present handsome edifice arose  st jamess palace st jamess palace was originally a hospital founded and dedicated to st james by some pious citizens before the conquest for fourteen leprous females and eight brethren were added afterward to perform divine service on the quarrel between the great earl of warwick and lord cromwell about the cause of the first battle of st albans lord cromwell fearing the rage of that violent peer was at his own desire lodged here by way of security by john talbot earl of shrewsbury at that time lord treasurer of england fenns letters i   0  it was surrendered to henry viii in      who sounded on its site the present palace which stowe calls a goodly manor his majesty also enclosed the park which was subservient to the amusement of this and the palace of whitehall charles ii was particularly fond of it planted the avenues made the canal and the aviary adjacent to the birdcage walk which took its name from the cages which were hung in the trees charles says cibber was often seen here amidst crowds of spectators feeding his ducks and playing with his dogs apology for the life of colley cibber     and passing his idle moments in affability even to the meanest of his subjects which made him to be adored by the common people so fascinating in the great are the habits of condescension  duck island was erected into a government and had a salary annexed to the office in favor of m st evremond who was the first and perhaps the last governor s pegge esquire  and the island itself is lost in the late improvements  it does not appear that the palace was inhabited by any of our monarchs till after the fire at whitehall james i presented it to his accomplished son henry who resided here till his lamented death in      charles i was brought here from windsor on january   th whitelock  by the power of the army which had determined on his death his apartment was hastily furnished by his servant mr kinnersley of the wardrobe herberts memoirs  0   some of the eleven days which he was permitted to live were spent in westminster hall and of the nights in the house of sir robert cotton adjacent to his place of trial on the   th he was carried back to st jamess where he passed his three last days in exemplary piety on the  0th he was brought to the place of execution and walked unmoved at every insult with a firm and quick pace supported by the most lively sentiments of religion  his son the bigoted james sent to the prince of orange when he had approached in force near to the capital a most necessitated invitation to take his lodgings at this palace the prince accepted it but at the same time hinted to the frightened prince that he must leave whitehall it was customary to mount guard at both the palaces the old hero lord craven was on duty at the time when the dutch guards were marching through the park to relieve by order of their master from a point of honor he had determined not to quit his station and was preparing to maintain his post but receiving the command of his sovereign he reluctantly withdrew his party and marched away with sullen dignity dalrymples memoirs   during the reign of king william st jamess was fitted up for the residence of the princess anne afterward queen and her spouse prince george of denmark from that time to the present it has been regularly the court of our monarchs  james the son of james ii who so long made pretensions to the british throne was born in the room now called the old bedchamber at present the antichamber to the levee room the bed stood close to the door of a backstairs which descended to an inner court it certainly was very convenient to carry on any secret design and might favor the silly warmingpan story was not the bed surrounded by twenty of the privy council four other men of rank twenty ladies besides pages and other attendants james with imprudent pride neglected to disprove the tale it was adopted by party and firmly believed by its zealots but as james proved false to his high trust and his son showed every symptom of following his example there was certainly no such pretense wanting for excluding a family inimical to the interests of the great whole  uncreditable as the outside of st jamess palace may look it is said to be the most commodious for regal parade of any in europe every one knows that the furniture of this palace is unbecoming the place portraite yet in a ramble i once made through the apartments i saw several portraits of personages remarkable in their day among others in one of the rooms behind the levee rooms is a small fulllength of henry prince of wales son of james i he is dressed in green standing over a dead stag and sheathing a sword a youth the accomplished lord harrington of exton is kneeling before him each of them have hunting horns and behind the prince is a horse and on the bough of a tree are the arms of england and behind the young lord another coat of arms perhaps his own another fine small piece of arthur elder brother to henry viii painted very young with a bonnet on his head henry stands by him and his sister margaret of infant ages this picture is by mabuse who visited england in the reign of their father  henry vii and viii fulllengths and each of them with a queen before an altar the fortunate jane seymour who died in her bed is the consort of the son here represented this is a copy from holbein in small by van lemput n      taken by order of charles ii the original was painted on the wall in the privy chamber of whitehall and destroyed in the fire of       two halflengths by lely of the duchess of york and her sister  a child in the robes of the garter perhaps the youngest knight known he was the second son of james ii while duke of york by anne hyde his duchess on december  d      he was elected knight of the garter at the age of three years and five months the sovereign put the george round his neck and prince rupert the garter round his little leg death in the following year prevented his installation sandford       the diminutive manhood of the dwarf geoffry hudson is to be seen in another picture he appears less by being placed walking under some very tall trees  in the lords old waitingroom is henry darnley in black tall and genteel his hand is resting on his brother charles stuart earl of lenox dressed in a black gown  in another room is charles ii of spain at the age of four in black with a scepter in his hand strutting and playing the monarch he was inaugurated in      his reign was unhappy spain at no period was in so low so distressful a condition his dominions were parcelled out in his lifetime but he disappointed the allies and after some struggle the designation of his will in favor of the house of bourbon took place  here is to be seen the famous picture by mabuse of adam and eve mr evelyn justly remarks the absurdity of painting them with navels and a fountain with rich imagery amidst the beauteous wilds of paradise raphael and michael angelo made the same mistake of the navel on which the learned sir thomas brown vulgar errors p     wastes a long page and a half to disprove the possibility  in the queens library built by queen caroline queens library and ornamented by kent now a lumberroom i saw a beautiful view from greenwich park with charles i his queen and a number of courtiers walking and two others of the same prince and his queen dining in public and another of the elector palatine and his spouse at public table with a carver looking most ridiculous a monkey having in that moment reared from the board and seized on his beard possibly this feast was at guildhall where he was most nobly entertained by the hospitable city in      when he made the match with the daughter of our monarch which ended so unhappily for both parties  to the east of st jamess palace in the reign of queen anne marlboroughhouse was built marlboroughhouse at the expense of the public it appears by one of kips views of st jamess published before the existence of this house that it was built in part of the royal gardens granted for that purpose by her majesty the present duke added an upper story and improved the ground floor which originally wanted the great room this national compliment cost not less than forty thousand pounds  in pall mall the duke schomberg had his house pall mall it was in my time possessed by astley the painter who divided it into three and most whimsically fitted up the center for his own use  to take a review of the space between this palace and charing cross as it was about the year    0 it will appear a tract of fields there were no houses excepting three or four on the east side of the present pall mall and a little farther on the opposite side a small church the name of which i cannot discover  by the year      cockspurstreet filled up the space between those houses and charing cross pall mall was also laid out as a walk or a place for the exercise of the mall a game long since disused the north side was also planted with a row of trees on the other side was the wall of st jamess park charles ii removed it to its present place planted the park and made all those improvements which we now see it was le notre the famous french gardener the director of taste under louis xiv who ordered the disposition of the trees of late the french have endeavored to borrow taste from us in the days of charles haymarket hedgelane the haymarket and hedgelane had names but they were literally lanes bounded by hedges and all beyond to the north east and west was entirely country in the fine plan of london published by faithorn in      no traces of houses are to be met with in the former any more than a single one named the gaminghouse at the end next to piccadilly windmillstreet consisted of disjoined houses and a windmill standing in a field on the west side proves from what its name was derived all the space occupied by the streets radiating from the seven dials was at that period open ground  leicesterhouse leicesterfields was also unbuilt but the house of that name is found in the same plan and on the site of the present it was founded by one of the sydnies earls of leicester it was for a short time the residence of elizabeth daughter of james i the titular queen of bohemia who on february   th      here ended her unfortunate life sandford      it has been tenanted for a great number of years it was successively the poutingplace of princes the late king when prince of wales after he had quarrelled with his father lived here several years his son frederick followed his example succeeded him in his house and in it finished his days no one is ignorant of the magnificent and instructive museum exhibited in this house by the late sir ashton lever it was the most astonishing collection of the subject of natural history ever collected in so short a space by any individual to the disgrace of our kingdom after the first burst of wonder was over it became neglected and when it was offered to the public by the chance of a guinea lottery only eight thousand out of thirtysix thousand tickets were sold finally the capricious goddess frowned on the spirited possessor of such a number of tickets and transferred the treasure to the possessor of

 this house is said to be on the site of one called in the old plans of london the gaminghouse  piccadilly lord clarendon mentions a house of this name in the following words mr hyde says he speaking of himself going to a house called piccadilly which was a fair house for entertainment and gaming with handsome gravelwalks with shade and where were an upper and lower bowlinggreen whither very many of the nobility and gentry of the best quality resorted for exercise and conversation clarendons hist oxford ed   0  i     sub anno    0   at the upper end of the haymarket stood piccadillahall where piccadillas or turnovers were sold which gave name to that vast street called from that circumstance piccadilly this street was completed in      as far as the present berkeleystreet the first good house which was built in it was burlingtonhouse the noble founder father to the late earl of burlington said he placed it there because he was certain no one would build beyond him nobody is ignorant of the vast town that since that period has extended itself beyond this palace after this rose clargeshouse and two others adjacent inhabited says strype by lord sherbourne and the countess of denby  the pesthousefields were surrounded with buildings before the year   00 but remained a dirty waste till of late years when carnabymarket occupied much of the west part goldensquare of dirty access was built after the revolution or before   00 in these fields had been the lazareto during the period of the dreadful plague of the year      it was built by that true hero lord craven who stayed in london during the whole time and braved the fury of the pestilence with the same coolness as he fought the battles of his beloved mistress elizabeth titular queen of bohemia or mounted the tremendous breach at creutznach he was the intrepid soldier the gallant lover the genuine patriot  in   00 bondstreet was built no farther than the west end of cliffordstreet new bondstreet was at that time an open field called conduit mead from one of the conduits which supplied this part of the town with water and conduitstreet received its name for the same reason  george street hanoversquare and its church rose about the same time the church was built by john james st georges hanoversquare and finished in      its portico would be thought handsome had you space to admire it it now looks brobdignagian this was one of the fifty new churches and the parish stolen out of that of st martin in the fields it is the last parish in this part of westminster excepting the distant marybonne every part besides was open ground covered with dunghills and all sorts of obscenity may fair was kept about the spot now covered with may fair chapel may fair and several fine streets the fair was attended with such disorders riots thefts and even murders that in   0  it was presented by the magistrates it revived again and i remember the last celebrations the place was covered with booths temporary theaters and every enticement to low pleasure  at the time of sir thomas wiats insurrection in february      part of the army marched to make their attack on london over this tract then an open country as far as charing cross on the spot called hayhill near the present berkeleysquare there was a skirmish between a party of the insurgents and another of the royal army in which the former were repulsed after the execution of sir thomas his head on that account was set up on a gallows at that place strypes memorials iii   0  and his parboiled quarters in different parts of the neighborhood of the capital three of the insurgents were also hung in chains near the head of their leader  this extensive tract at present a vast seat of the most elegant population is far from being destitute of places of devotion but chapels arose instead of churches subordinate to their respective rectors in this enlightened age it was quickly discovered that godliness was profitable to many the projector the architect the mason the carpenter and the plasterer united their powers a chapel was erected wellpewed wellwarmed dedicated and consecrated a captivating preacher is provided the pews are filled and the good undertakers amply repayed by the pious tenantry  hanover and cavendish squares in      hanoversquare and cavendishsquare were unbuilt but their names appear in the plans of london of    0 oxfordstreet from princesstreet eastward as far as high street st giless was almost unbuilt on the north side i remember there a deep hollow road and full of sloughs there was here and there a ragged house the lurkingplace of cutthroats insomuch that i never was taken that way by night in my hackneycoach to a worthy uncles who gave me lodgings at his house in georgestreet but i went in dread the whole way the south side was built as far as swallowstreet sohosquare was begun in the time of charles ii the duke of monmouth lived in the center house facing the statue originally the square was called in honor of him monmouthsquare and afterward changed to that of kingsquare i have a tradition that on his ath the admirers of that unfortunate man changed it to soho being the word of the day at the field of sedgemoor the house was purchased by the late lord bateman and let by the present lord to the comte de guerchy the french ambassador after which it was leased on building leases the name of the unfortunate duke is still preserved in monmouthstreet  after this digression let me return into piccadilly berkeleyhouse  before the date of burlingtonhouse was built a fine mansion belonging to the berkelies lords and afterward earls berkeley it stood between the south end of berkeleysquare and piccadilly and gave name to the square and an adjacent street the misery and disgrace which the profligacy of one of the daughters brought on the house by an intrigue with her brotherinlaw lord gray afterward engaged in the monmouth rebellion is too lastingly recorded in our state trials ever to be buried in oblivion  on the site of this house fronting piccadilly devonshirehouse stands devonshirehouse long after the year   00 it was the last house in this street at that time the portion of piccadilly the old house which was built by the first duke was burnt in the reign of george ii it was rebuilt by the third duke after a design by kent here is an excellent library and a very fine collection of medals i once saw the house by the favor of my friend the reverend doctor lort at that time librarian to whose liberal communications i have been invariably indebted the portraits are so numerous in this noble house that i must leave the complete list to those who have more opportunities of forming it than i had among others is a fine portrait of marc antonio de dominis the vain desultory archbishop of spalato who abjuring the roman catholic religion came over to england and was appointed master of the savoy he had not been here long but he publicly retracted all he had wrote against the church of rome james ordered him to depart the kingdom in three days he had the folly to trust himself at rome where his sincerity being doubted he was flung into prison where he ended his days he is painted by tintoret represented in his study sitting in black and with a square cap  arthur goodwin the friend of mr hampden and like him active in the cause of liberty a fine full length by vandyck      in long hair his dress a yellow cloak and jacket and white boots  his daughter jane second wife of philip lord wharton in black enriched with chains

and his lady are in black one child is on her lap two stand before him on whom he looks with great affection when i thought of a passage in his famous book i could but smile at the number of children his sentiments on the consequence of matrimony are most singular i dare not quote the passage but must refer the reader to the strangeness of his ideas on the subject religio medici part ii sect    let it be remembered he was a bachelor when he wrote  the delightful portrait of the jewish rabbi by rembrandt  a head of titian by himself and another of the painter carlo cignani also by himself  the unfeeling philip ii by titian a fulllength in armor enriched with gold the only time he ever buckled it on was when he showed himself to his troops going on the assault of st quintin he merited to be stripped of the honorable dress he never appeared in the field and carried on his wars like an assassin  i will close this very imperfect list with the famous countess of desmond a popular subject with the painters and refer the reader to the account i have given of her in my visits to that worthy peer the late earl of kinnoul in both my tours in scotland  the collection of pictures by the great italian masters is by far the finest private collection now in england  the house of that monster of treachery that profligate minister the earl of sunderland who by his destructive advice premeditatedly brought ruin on his unsuspecting master james ii stood on or near the site of the present melbournehouse at the very time that he sold him to the prince of orange he encouraged his majesty in every step which was certain of involving him and his family in utter ruin  piccadilly is continued near half a mile farther to the west all the west part was originally called portugalstreet  the north side only consists of houses most of them mean buildings but it finishes handsomely with the magnificent new house of lord bathurst at hydepark corner on the south side is the greenpark bounded by a wall but in many places are rows of benevolent railings which afford a most elegant view of that park the trees in that of st jamess the majestic venerable abbey soaring far above and the more remote rural view of the surry hills beyond the turnpikehouse stood the house of a noble celebrated by mr pope for his passion for dancing who demanded an audience from queen anne after the death of george prince of denmark to advise her majesty to dispel her grief by applying to that exercise the sober laneshrow dancing in the gout i have heard it said that this was only his country house which might possibly have been at that time  st georges hospital in      arose on its site that great charity st georges hospital founded by the voluntary contributions of the inhabitants of westminster the subscriptions in      were l        s but the benevolence of the governors or increase of accidents caused an increase of expense which threatened most serious consequences till the house was happily relieved by the bounty received from the third of the profits arising from the musical entertainments of the abbey  this hospital has discharged from it since it was opened on the first of the year      not fewer than a hundred and sixtyfour thousand seven hundred and fortysix patients  hydepark was in the late century and the early part of the present celebrated by all our dramatical poets for its large space railed off in form of a circle the ring round which the beaumonde drove in their carriages and in their rotation exchanging as they passed smiles and nods compliments or smart repartees  opposite to this hospital at hydepark corner stood a large fort with four bastions which formed one of the many flung up in the year      it is incredible with what speed the citizens flung a rampart of earth all round the city and suburbs of london and again round southwark and lambeth strengthened with batteries and redoubts at proper intervals this was occasioned by an alarm of an attack from the royal army men women and children assisted by thousands the active part which the fair sex took in the work is admirably described by the inimitable author of hudibras who says he marched rank and file with drum and ensign to entrench the city for defense in raised rampires with their own soft hands to put the enemy to stands from ladies down to oysterwenches labored like pioneers in trenches fallen to their pickaxes and tools and helped the men to dig like moles have not the handmaids of the city chosn of their members a committee for raising of a common purse out of their wages to raise horse and do they not as triers fit to judge what officers are fit   there were a few more great houses berkshire or clevelandhouse not remote from st jamess palace which merit mention berkshirehouse belonging to the howards earls of berkshire stood very near the royal residence it was afterward purchased and presented by charles ii to that beautiful fury barbara duchess of cleveland and its honorable name changed into that of her dishonored title it was then of great extent she sold part which was built into various houses she built a large one for herself which still remains and may be distinguished by the row of round windows in the upper story  tarthall tarthall stood near the present buckinghamgate it was built in      by nicholas stone for alathea countess of arundel wife to thomas earl of arundel after the death of the countess it became the property of her second son the unfortunate william lord stafford a most gentle and amiable character who fell an innocent victim to the detestable violence of party and the perjured suborned evidence of the ever infamous oats dugdale and tuberville good men who had no share in that part hurried away by intemperate passion were at the period disgraced by their rage against this inoffensive peer even the virtuous lord russel committed in this cause the single opprobrium of his life when the unhappy lord was condemned russel could wish to deny the king the amiable prerogative of taking away the cruel the disgraceful part of the penalty within three years this excellent man himself tasted the bitter cup but cleared by royal indulgence from the aggravating dregs with which he wished to agonize the dying moments of the devoted stafford  here were kept the poor remains of the arundelian collection they were buried during the madness of the popish plot the mob would have mistaken the statues for popish saints they were sold in the year    0 and the house soon after was pulled down mr walpole who saw the house at the time of the second sale informed me that it was very large and had a very venerable appearance  arlingtonhouse henry bennet earl of arlington one of the famous cabal had a house near the site of the present buckinghamhouse which went by his name it was afterward purchased by john sheffield duke of buckingham who after obtaining an additional grant of land from the crown rebuilt it in a magnificent manner in   0  buckinghamhouse he describes it most minutely as well as his manner of living there in a letter to the duke of shrewsbury london and its environs  he has omitted his constant visits to the noted gaminghouse at marybone the place of assemblage of all the infamous sharpers of the time his grace always gave them a dinner at the conclusion of the season and his parting toast was may as many of us as remain unhanged next spring meet here again i remember the facetious quin telling this story at bath within the hearing of the late lord chesterfield when his lordship was surrounded by a crowd of worthies of the same stamp with the above lady mary wortley alludes to the amusement in this time some dukes at marybone bowl time away anciently there was a park at marybone for i find that in queen elizabeths time the russian ambassadors were entertained with the amusement of hunting within its pale the duke died in    0 his duchess daughter to james ii by catherine sedley lived here till her death she was succeeded by the dukes natural son charles herbert sheffield on whom his grace had entailed it after the death of the young duke who died a minor it was purchased from sir charles by his present majesty is the retreat of our good king and queen and dignified with the title of the queens house  the virtuous chancellor the earl of clarendon clarendonhouse had a house facing the upper end of st jamess street on the site of the present graftenstreet it was built by himself with the stones intended for the rebuilding of st pauls he purchased the materials but a nation soured with an unsuccessful war with fire and with pestilence imputed every thing as a crime to this great and envied character his enemies called it dunkirkhouse calumniating him with having built it with the money arising from the sale of that town which had just before been given up to the french for a large sum by his master clarendon was so sensible of his vanity of his imprudence in building so large a house and of the envy it drew upon him that he thinks fit to apologize for that act of his which he declares so far exceeded the proposed expense as to add greatly to the embarrassment of his affairs continuation of the life of the earl of clarendon octavo vol iii p      the house is engraven by dunstal  it cost fifty thousand pounds and three hundred men were employed in the building it was purchased from his lordship by george mk duke of albemarle and afterward by another nobleman inferior indeed in abilities but not inferior in virtues in    0 attack on the duke of ormond by blood james duke of ormond in his way to clarendonhouse where his grace at that time lived was dragged out of his coach by the infamous blood and his associates who intended to hang his grace at tyburn in revenge for justice done under his administration in ireland on some of their companions this refinement in revenge saved the dukes life he had leisure to disengage himself from the villain on horseback to whom he was tied by which time he was discovered by his affrighted domestics and rescued from death blood was soon after taken in the attempt to steal the crown the court had use for so complete a villain and sunk follow as to apply to his grace for pardon for the offense against him the duke granted it with a generous indignation blood had a pension of five hundred a year and was constantly seen in the presence chamber as is supposed to show to the great uncomplying men of the time what a ready instrument the ministry had to revenge any attempt that might be made against them in the cause of liberty  i would not make this little work a tyburn chronicle murder of mr thynne yet i cannot omit the horrible assassination in      of thomas thynne esquire of longleat by the instigation of count koningsmark in revenge for his having married lady elizabeth ogle the rich heiress on whom the count had a design the three assassins were executed in pall mall on the bloody spot but the court in love with profligacy contrived to save the principal reresbys memoirs      the gallant william earl of devonshire would have avenged the death of his friend the count accepted the challenge but his conscience prevented him from meeting the earl he afterward met with a fate suited to his actions he attempted an intrigue in      in germany with a lady of distinguished rank he was one night waylayed by order of the jealous husband was literally cut to pieces and his remains flung into a privy which was instantly bricked up  jermyn jermynhouse and st albans streets took their names from the gallant henry jermyn earl of st albans who had a house at the head of the last he was supposed to have been privately married to the queen dowager henrietta maria by this time misfortunes had subdued that spirit which had contributed to precipitate her first husband into the ruin of his house she was awed by her subjectspouse reresby    her fear of him was long observed before the nearness of the connection was discovered  st jamess church on the ground of this gay peer was built the present church of st james founded in the latter part of the reign of charles ii and consecrated in the first of james ii and named in honor of both saint and monarch london was so vastly increased about this period that a new church in this place was necessary accordingly as much was taken from the parish of st martin in the fields as to form another it is a rectory to which at first the bishop of london had a right of two turns in the presentation lord jermyn nephew to the earl had the third but the last was fully resigned to the bishop fine font by gibbons the most remarkable thing in the church is the fine font of white marble the work of grinlin gibbons it is supported by the tree of life the serpent is offering the fruit to our first parents who stand beneath on one side of the font is engraven the baptist baptizing our savior on another st philip baptizing the eunuch and on the third noahs ark with the dove bringing the olive branch the type of peace to mankind see this font engraven by virtue tab iii of the vetusta monumenta   the chancel above the altar is enriched with some beautiful foliage in wood by the same great artist  the strand its ancient state the further progress of this part of the town i shall defer mentioning till i have reached the most eastern part of westminster i shall resume my account at the opening of the strand into charing cross by observing that in the year      that fine street the strand was an open highway with here and there a great mans house with gardens to the waterside in that year it was so ruinous that edward iii by an ordinance directed a tax to be raised upon wool leather wine and all goods carried to the staple at westminster from temple bar to westminsterabbey for the repair of the road and that all owners of houses adjacent to the highway should repair as much as lay before their doors mention is also made of a bridge to be erected near the royal palace at westminster for the convenience of the said staple rymers foedera v      but the last probably meant no more than a stairs for the landing of the goods which i find sometimes went by the name of a bridge  there are several instances of grants for building in this extensive road in very early times edward i granted to walter le barbur a void space in the high street in the parish of st clement danes and st mary strand and robert le spencer had from the same prince another grant  there was no continued street here till about the year      the street completed in      before that it entirely cut off westminster from london and nothing intervened except the scattered houses and a village which afterward gave name to the whole st martins stood literally in the fields but about the year    0 a street was formed loosely built for all the houses on the south side had great gardens to the river were called by their owners names and in aftertimes gave name to the several streets that succeeded them pointing down to the thames each of them had stairs for the convenience of taking boat of which many to this day bear the names of the houses as the court was for centuries either at the palace at westminster or whitehall a boat was the customary conveyance of the great to the presence of their sovereign the north side was a mere line of houses from charing cross to temple bar all beyond was country the gardens which occupied part of the site of conventgarden were bounded by fields and st giless was a distant country village these are circumstances proper to point out to show the vast increase of our capital in little more than two centuries  in the same century was a second epoch respecting the buildings of this part of the town the first was at the time we have mentioned or to speak from strong authority as they appear in the plan of london made about the year      by ralph aggas see the plan of london as it was in the year   00 published by john bowls  our capital found itself so secure in the glorious government of elizabeth that by the year   00 most considerable additions were made to the north of the long line of street just described st martinslane was built on both sides st giless church was still insulated but broad street and holborn were completely formed into streets with houses all the way to snowhill conventgarden and lincolnsinnfields were built but in an irregular manner drury lane clarestreet and longacre arose in the same period  northumberlandhouse the present magnificent palace northumberlandhouse stands on the site of the hospital of st mary rounceval henry viii granted it to sir thomas caverden it was afterward transferred to henry howard earl of northampton who in the time of james i built here a house and called it after his own name he left it to his kinsman the earl of suffolk lord treasurer and by the marriage of algernoon percy earl of northumberland with elizabeth daughter of theophilus earl of suffolk it passed into the house of the present noble owner the greater part of the house was built by bernard jansen an architect in the reign of james i the portal since altered by the late duke of northumberland by a cotemporary architect gerard christmas who left on it his mark c ae mr walpole  i must not omit that in this house is the noble picture of the cornaro family by titian it is very unfortunate that nothing can be more confined than the situation of this great house the noble front is pent up by a very narrow part of the strand and behind by a cluster of mean houses coalwharfs and other offensive objects as far as the banks of the thames fortunately by the favor of government it enjoys the power of giving the place the most magnificent improvement the late duke received a lease from the crown of all the intervening ground as far as the river and within these very few years an absolute exchange for certain lands in northumberland to erect batteries on against foreign invasion at the period when the project of universal fortification prevaled a little time may see every nuisance removed and a terrace arise in their stead emulating that of somerset house  a little farther is hungerford stairs and market hungerford stairs which take their name from the great family of the hungerfords of fairleigh in wiltshire sir edward created knight of the bath at the coronation of charles ii had a large house on the site which he pulled down and multiplied into several others  on the other side of the strand st martins in the fields almost opposite to hungerfordmarket stands the church of st martin in the fields once a parish of vast extent but much reduced at present by the robbing it of the tract now divided into the parishes of st james st anne and st paul covent garden we cannot trace the time of its foundation it was early bestowed on the abbot and convent of st peter westminster in      there was a dispute between the abbot and the city of london about the jurisdiction of this church and in      we first find the name of a vicar in room of thomas skyn who had resigned in the reign of henry viii a small church was built here at the kings expense by reason of the poverty of the parishioners who possibly were at that period very few in   0  it was enlarged because of the increase of buildings in      it was found necessary to take the whole down and in five years from that time this magnificent temple it is engraven by h hulsebergh was completed at the expense of near thirtyseven thousand pounds this seems the best performance of gibbs the architect of the ratcliff library the steeple is far the most elegant of any of that style which i named the pepperbox and with which i beg pardon of the good people of glasgow i marked their boasted steeple of st andrew  yorkhouse heath archbishop of york about the year      purchased a house a little beyond hungerfordmarket which had originally been the inn or lodgings of the bishops of norwich when henry viii had dispossessed the primates of york of their house at whitehall the daughter by way of reparation made to them a grant of suffolkhouse in southwark which he sold and with the ncourt i     money purchased norwichhouse which afterward was called yorkhouse when george villiers duke of buckingham became owner of it on his disposal of it several streets were laid out on the site and ground belonging to it these go under the general appellation of yorkbuildings but his name and title is preserved in george yorkbuildings villiers duke and buckingham streets and even the particle of is not forgotten being preserved in ofalley  the gate to yorkstairs is the work of inigo jones and deserving of all the praises bestowed on it by the author of the critical review  durhamyard takes its name from a palace durhamplace built originally by the illustrious thomas de hatfield elected bishop of durham in      designed by him for the town residence of him and his successors it was called durhamplace i e palace be it known to all whom it concerns that the word is only applicable to the habitations of princes or princely persons and that it is with all the impropriety of vanity bestowed on the houses of those who have luckily acquired money enough to pile on one another a greater quantity of stones or bricks than their neighbors great feasting here in    0 at this place in    0 was held a most magnificent feast given by the challengers of england who had caused to be proclaimed in france flanders scotland and spain a great and triumphant justing to be holden at westminster for all comers that would undertake them but both challengers and defendants were english after the gallant sports of each day the challengers rode unto this durhamhouse where they kept open household and feasted the king and queen  anne of cleves with her ladies and all the court in this time of their housekeeping they had not only feasted the king queen ladies and all the court as is aforeshewed but also they cheered all the knights and burgesses of the common house in the parliament and entertained the mayor of london with the aldermen and their wives at a dinner etc the king gave to every of the said challengers and their heirs for ever in reward of their valiant activity  00 marks and a house to dwell in of yearly revenue out of the lands pertaining to the hospital of s john of jerusalem stows survaie       in this a part of the following year is most strongly exemplified the unfeeling heart of this cruel prince his sudden transitions from nuptials and joyous festivities to the most tyrannical executions often for offenses of his own creation in that small space of time he married one queen and put her away because he thought her a flanders mare he espoused another and not without cause put her and the confident to her incontinence to death he caused to be executed a hopeful young peer and three young gentlemen for a common manslaughter resulting from a sudden fray he burnt numbers for denying the religion of rome and inflicted all the barbarous penalties of high treason on multitudes for denying a prerogative which he had wrested from the pope the head of that very worship which he supported with such rigor  in the reign of edward vi the mint was established in this house under the management of sir william sharrington and the influence of the aspiring thomas seymour lord admiral here he proposed to have money enough coined to accomplish his designs on the throne his practices were detected and he suffered death his tool was also condemned but sacrificing his master to his own safety received a pardon and was again employed under the administration of john dudley earl of northumberland it afterward became the residence of that ambitious man who in may      in this palace caused to be solemnized with great magnificence three marriages his son lord guildford dudley with the amiable lady jane gray lord herbert heir to the earl of pembroke with catherine younger sister of lady jane and lord hastings heir to the earl of huntingdon with his youngest daughter lady catherine dudley holinshed  0    from hence he dragged the reluctant victim his daughterinlaw to the tower there to be invested with regal dignity british biog iii p       in eight short months his ambition led the sweet innocent to the nuptial bed the throne and the scaffold  durhamhouse was reckoned one of the royal palaces belonging to queen elizabeth who gave the use of it to the great sir walter raleigh  durhamyard is now filled with a most magnificent mass of building called the adelphi adelphi in honor of two brothers its architects before the front to the thames is a terrace commanding a charming view to the river when not obscured by the damps and poisonous fogs which too often infest the air of the lower part of our capital  to the north of durhamplace fronting the street the new exchange stood the new exchange which was built under the auspices of our monarch in   0  the king queen and royal family honored the opening with their presence and named it britains bursse it was built somewhat on the model of the royal exchange with cellars beneath a walk above and rows of shops over that filled chiefly with milleners sempstresses and the like this was a fashionable place of resort in      a fatal affair happened here mr gerard a young gentleman at that time engaged in a plot against cromwell was amusing himself in the walk beneath when he was insulted by don pantaleon de saa brother to the ambassador of portugal who disliking the return he met with determined on revenge he came there the next day with a set of bravos who mistaking another gentleman for mr gerard instantly put him to death as he was walking with his sister in one hand and his mistress in the other don pantaleon was with impartial justice tried and condemned to the axe mr gerard who about the same time was detected in the conspiracy was likewise condemned to die by singular chance both the rivals suffered on the same scaffold within a few hours of each other mr gerard with intrepid dignity the portuguese with all the pusillanimity of an assassin clarendon whitelocke       the white millener above stairs sat in the character of a millener the reduced duchess of tyrconnel wife to richard talbot lord deputy of ireland under james ii a bigoted papist and fit instrument of the designs of the infatuated prince who had created him earl before his abdication and after that duke of tyrconnel a female suspected to have been his duchess after his death supported herself for a few days till she was known and otherwise provided for by the little trade of the place had delicacy enough to wish not to be detected she sat in a white mask and a white dress and was known by the name of the white millener  this exchange has long since given way to a row of good houses which form a part of the street  a little beyond was ivybridge which crossed the strand and had beneath it a way leading to the thames this was the boundary between the liberties of the duchy of lancaster and those of westminster near this bridge the earls of rutland had a house at which several of the noble family breathed their last the earls of worcester had a very large house between durhamplace and the savoy with gardens to the waterside the great earl of clarendon lived in it before his own was built and paid for it the extravagant rent of five hundred pounds a year this was pulled down by their descendant the duke of beaufort and the present beaufortbuildings rose on its site this had originally been the townhouse of the bishops of carlisle fullers chapter hist book iii p     opposite to these was the garden belonging to the abbot of westminster which extended quite to st martins church it was called the convent garden and retains the name to this day it was granted after the dissolution by edward vi first to the protector somerset and afterward to lord russel created earl of bedford about      francis earl of bedford began to clear away the old buildings and formed the present handsome square the arcade and the church were the work of inigo jones bedfordhouse the former townhouse of the noble family stood in the strand but has long since given way to little bedfordstreet  great part of the palace called the savoy

treasurer burleigh who died here in      it was built with brick and adorned with four square turrets it was afterward called exeterhouse from the title of his son and successor on its site was erected exeterexchange it had been a very handsome pile with an arcade in front a gallery above and shops in both the plan did not succeed for the new exchange had the preference and stole away both tenants and customers a part of the old house is still to be seen all originated in sacrilege on the site stood a house belonging to die parson of st martins sir thomas palmer a creature of the duke of somerset obtained it by composition in the time of edward vi and began to build there a magnificent house of brick and timber stows survai      this afterward came into the hands of lord burleigh who finished it in the magnificent manner we have mentioned  wimbledonhouse a little farther where doyleys warehouse now stands was wimbledonhouse built by sir edward cecil son to the first earl of exeter and created by charles i viscount wimbledon  not far from hence stood the strand bridge which crossed the street and received the water which ran from the high grounds through the present catherine street and delivered it into the thames  other ancient buildings on the south side of the strand stood a number of buildings which fell victims to sacrilege in the reign of edward vi st mary le strand was a very ancient church and parish a rectory in the gift of the bishops of worcester who had near it their inn or town residence the bishops of litchfield and coventry had another built by walter de langton elected bishop of that see in      it was also called chester inn chester inn as that bishopric was at the time annexed to the former the bishops of landaff had also another house or inn finally the strand inn an inn of chancery belonging to the temple dugdales origines judiciales   0  i must stop a moment to say that occleve the poet of the reign of henry v studied the law here the place of his education is called chestres inn mr thomas warton  but as that was never appropriated to the study of the law i little doubt but it is a mistake for this adjacent house every one of these were levelled to the ground by the protector somerset to make way for the magnificent palace which bears his name somerset house the architect is supposed to have been one john of padua who had a salary in the preceding reign under the title of devizor of his majestys buildings anecdotes of painting i      which was continued to him in the reign of the son no atonement was made no compensation to the owners part of the church of st john of jerusalem and the tower were blown up for the sake of the materials the cloisters on the north side of st pauls underwent the same fate together with the charnelhouse and chapel the tombs were destroyed and the bones impiously carried away and flung into finsbury fields this was done in      when the building was first began possibly the founder never enjoyed the use of this palace for in      he fell a just victim on the scaffold the crime of sacrilege is never mentioned among the numerous articles brought against him this is no wonder since every great man in those days protestant and papist showed equal rapacity after the goods of the church  after his death his palace fell to the crown queen elizabeth lived here at certain times most probably at the expense of her kinsman lord hunsdon to whom she had given the use anne of denmark kept her court here and catherine queen of charles ii lived here for some time in the life of her unfaithful spouse and after his death till she retired into her native country  ancient bing the architecture of old somerset house was the mixture of grecian and gothic introduced into england in the reign preceding its erection the backfront and the watergate were built from a design of inigo jones after the year      a chapel was begun by him in that year and afterward finished it was intended for the use of his catholic spouse the infanta of spain but on the failure of that romantic match it served for the uses of the professors of her religion  as charles ii did not find it compatible with his gallantries that his spouse catherine should be resident at whitehall he lodged her during some part of his reign in this palace this made it the haunt of the catholics and possibly during the phrenetic rage of the nation at that period against the professors of her religion occasioned it to have been made the pretended scene of the murder of sir edmonbury godfrey murder of sir edmonbury godfrey in the year      the infamous witnesses against his supposed murderers declared that he was waylaid and inveigled into the palace under pretense of keeping the peace between two servants who were fighting in the yard that he was there strangled his neck broke and his own sword run through his body that he was kept four days before they ventured to remove him at length his corpse was first carried in a sedanchair to sho and then on a horse to primrosehill between kilburn and hampstead there it certainly was found transfixed with the sword and his money in his pocket and his rings on his fingers the murder therefore was not by robbers but the effect of private revenge but it is not probable that it was committed within these walls for the assassins would never have hazarded a discovery by carrying the corpse three miles when they could have so safely disposed of it into the thames the abandoned characters of the evidences prance and bedloe the former of whom had been treated with most horrid cruelties to compel him to confess what he declared he never was guilty of together with the absurd and irreconcilable testimony they gave on the trial has made unprejudiced times to doubt the whole that he was murdered there is no doubt he had been an active magistrate and had made many enemies the marks of strangling round his throat and his broken neck evince the impossibility of his having put an end to his own existence as some have insinuated but the innocence of the three poor convicts would not avail the torrent of prejudice prevaling against them and they were executed denying the facts in the moment of death one was a protestant the other two roman catholics and belonging to the chapel so probably were fixed on by the instigators of the accusation in order to involve the queen in the uncharitable suspicion  this tragedy became at the time the subject of many medals see evelyns medals              on one is the bust of sir edmondbury and two hands strangling him on the reverse the pope giving his benediction to a man strangling another on the ground on a second with the same bust is the representation of the carrying the

the service of religion by deeds of newcourts repertorium i     arms hugo de paganis geoffry of st omers and seven others began the order by binding themselves after the manner of the regular canons of st augustines to chastity and obedience and professing to protect the pilgrims to the holy land from all wrong and robbery on the road at first they subsisted on alms and had only one horse between two of them a rule was appointed for them and they wore a white habit afterward distinguished by a red cross on their left shoulder by their devotion and the fame of their gallant actions they became very popular in all parts of europe and so enriched by the favor of princes and other great men that at the time of their dissolution the order was found possessed of sixteen thousand manors it became at last so infected with pride and luxury fall of the knights templars as to excite general hatred a persecution founded on most unjust and fictitious accusations was formed against them in france under philip le bell their riches seem to have been their chief crime numbers of innocent and heroic knights suffered in the flames with the piety and constancy of martyrs some of them at the stake summoned their chief enemies clement v and philip to appear in a certain time at the divine tribunal both of those princes died about the time prescribed which in an age of superstition proved the validity this potent order came into england in the reign of king stephen and had their first house in holborn which was called the old temple they founded the new temple in      where they continued till the suppression of the order in    0 when they were condemned to perpetual penance and dispersed into several monasteries edward ii granted this house and all their other possessions in london to thomas earl of lancaster and after his rebellion and forfeiture to aymer de valence earl of pembroke on his death they reverted to the crown and were given to the knights hospitallers of the order of st john of jerusalem a few years after they had so valiantly driven the turks out of the isle of rhodes these knights again granted the temple to the students of the common law in the reign of edward

fascia above each arch is a window with a rounded top with a gallery and rich saxon arches intersecting each other on the outside of the pillars is a considerable space preserving the circular form on

some templars was dressed by them in the habit of the order and carried from the spot as he died excommunicated they wrapped his body in lead and hung it on a crooked tree in the temple orchard on being absolved by the pope it being proved that he expressed great penitence in his last moments he was taken down and buried first in the cemetery and afterward in the place where we find this

coffin of a ridged shape conjectured to have been the tomb of william plantagenet fifth son of henry iii  in the second group are other figures but none of them crosslegged except the outmost all are armed in mail the helmets much resemble the former but two are mailed one figure is in a spirited attitude drawing a broad dagger one leg rests on the tail of a cockatrice the other in the action of being drawn up with the head of the monster beneath none of the eight figures except geoffry de magnaville are ascertained but cambden conjectures that three are intended to commemorate william earl of pembroke who died in      and his sons william and gilbert likewise earls of pembroke and marshals of england cambden i      the others are engraven in plate xix  in the first group one of them

with buildings henry lacy earl of lincoln built an inn as it was in those days called for himself in which he died in      the ground did belong to the black friars and was granted by edward i to that great earl the whole has retained his name one of the bishops of chichester in after times did grant leases of the buildings to certain students of the law reserving to themselves a rent and lodgings for themselves whenever they came to town this seems to have taken place about the time of henry vii  the chapel was designed by inigo jones chapel it is built upon massy pillars and affords under its shelter an excellent walk this work evinces that inigo never was designed for a gothic architect the lord chancellor holds his sittings in the great hall this like that of the temple had its revels and great christmasses ancient revels instead of the lord of misrule it had its king of the cocknies they had also a jack straw but in the time of queen elizabeth he and all his adherents were utterly banished i must not omit that in the same reign sumptuary laws were made to regulate the dress of the members of the house who were forbidden to wear long hair or great ruffs cloaks boots or spurs regulations about beards in the reign of henry viii beards were prohibited at the great table under pain of paying double commons his daughter elizabeth in the first year of her reign confined them to a fortnights growth under penalty of   s   d but the fashion prevaled so strongly that the prohibition was repealed and no manner of size limited to that venerable excrescence  lincolnsinnfields would have been one of our most beautiful squares had it been built on a regular plan lincolnsinnfields the disposition of it was in      committed to the care of the lord chancellor the earls of worcester pembroke arundel and others inigo jones drew the groundplot and gave it the exact dimensions of the base of one of the pyramids of egypt in the side called portugal row is lindeseyhouse once the seat of the earls of lindesey and of their descendants the dukes of ancaster built after a beautiful design of that great architect the view of this side of the square and of lincolns end gardens is most particularly pleasing when shone on by the western sun here also was in the time of king william a playhouse erected within the walls of the tenniscourt under the royal patronage in this theater betterton and his troop of actors excited the admiration of the public if we may credit cibber as much as roscius did the people of rome or grrick those of england in recent days  execution of lord russel on another stage of a different nature was performed the sad tragedy of the death of the virtuous lord russel who lost his head in the middle of the square on july   st      party writers assert that he was brought here in preference to any other spot in order to mortify the citizens with the sight in fact it was the nearest open space to newgate the place of his lordships confinement otherwise the dragging him to tower hill the usual concluding scene on these dreadful occasions would have given his enemies full opportunity of indulging the imputed malice  newcastlehouse in the same square at the corner of queen street stands a house inhabited by the well known minister the late duke of newcastle it was built about the year      by the marquis of powis and called powishouse and afterward sold to the late noble owner the architect was captain william wind  in the last century queen street was the residence of many of our people of rank among others was conwayhouse the residence of the noble family of that name paulethouse belonging to the marquis of winchester and the house in which lord herbert of cherbury finished his romantic life  on the back part of portugal row is claremarket close to which the second john earl of clare had a palace of his own building in which he lived about the year      in a most princely manner howels hist london       i shall pursue from queen street my journey westward and point out the most remarkable places which rose into being between the years      and   00 and incidentally of some others of later date i have before mentioned the streets which rose in that period let me add longacre that longacre was built on a piece of ground once belonging to westminsterabby called the seven acres and which in      were granted to john earl of bedford  st giless church and a few houses to the west of it st giless in the fields in the year   00 was but barely separated from broadstreet the church is supposed to have belonged to an hospital for lepers founded about the year      by matilda queen to henry i in ancient times it was customary to present to malefactors on their way to the gallows which about the year      was removed from smithfield and placed between st giless high street and hoglane a great bowl of ale as the last refreshment they were to receive in this life newcourt i      on the door to the churchyard is a curious piece of sculpture representing the last day containing an amazing number of figures set up about the year       here was executed in the most barbarous manner the famous sir john oldcastle baron cobham his crime was that of adopting the tenets of wycliffe he was misrepresented to our heroic prince henry v by the bigoted clergy as a heretic and traitor and that he was actually at the head of thirty thousand lollards in these very fields about a hundred inoffensive people were found there cobham escaped but was taken some time after in wales he suffered death on this spot was hung on a gallows by a chain fastened round his body and thus suspended burnt alive he died not with the calm constancy of a martyr but with the wildest effusions of enthusiastic ravings  church this church was rebuilt in      by the amazing raising of the ground by filth and various adventitious matter the floor in the year    0 was eight feet below the surface acquired in the intervening time this alone made it necessary to rebuild the church in the present century the first stone was laid in    0 it was finished in      at the expense of ten thousand pounds in a manner which does great credit to its architect mr henry flitcraft  in the churchyard i have observed with horror a great square pit with many rows of coffins piled one upon the other all exposed to sight and smell some of the piles were incomplete expecting the mortality of the night i turned away disgusted at the view and scandalized at the want of police which so little regards the health of the living as to permit so many putrid corpses tacked between some flight boards dispersing their dangerous effluvia over the capital  near the church was the house of alice duchess dudley who died here in      aged ninety she was the widow of the great sir robert dudley son to robert earl of leicester who by various untoward circumstances was denied legitimacy and his paternal estates he assumed the title of duke of northumberland and lived and died in great estimation in tuscany this lady was advanced to the title of duchess by charles i she merited the honor by the greatness of her mind and extent of her charities her body was interred at stonely in warwickshire the place of her family she being third daughter of sir thomas leigh of stonely ancestor of the late lord leigh a fine monument was erected to her honor at stonely see dugdales warwickshire i   0 in which is a print of the tomb and a list of her great charities  and a grateful memorial of her in this church  the mention of st giless bowl naturally brings one to the late place of the conclusion of human laws it was called in the time of edward iii when the gentle mortimer finished his days here the elms but the original as well as present name was tybourne tybourne not from tie and burn as if it was called so from the manner of capital punishments but from bourne the saxon word for a brook which gave name to a manor before the conquest here was also a village and church denominated st john the evangelist which fell to decay and was succeeded by that of mary bourne corrupted into marylabonne about the year      this brook furnished nine conduits for supplying the city with water but the introduction of the new river superseded the use of them here the lord mayor had a banqueting house to which his lordship and brethren were wont to repair on horseback attended by their ladies in wagons and after viewing the conduits they returned to the city where they were magnificently entertained by the lord mayor maitland ii        in      queen henrietta maria was compelled by her priests to take a walk by way of penance to tyburn what her offense was we are not told but charles was so disgusted at this insolence that he soon after sent them and all her majestys french servants out of the kingdom whitelock     i shall return through the mile and a quarter of country at this time formed into

chapel the cloisters formed a square on the south side  the several buildings belonging to this palace falling into ruin it was thought proper to enable by act of parliament in      the bishop to alienate the whole it was accordingly sold to the crown for the sum of six thousand five hundred pounds together with an annuity of two hundred pounds a year to be paid to the bishop and his successors for ever out of the first five thousand six hundred was applied toward the purchase of albemarlehouse in doverstreet with other messuages and gardens the remainder together with three thousand pounds paid as dilapidations by the executors of bishop mawson was applied toward building the handsome house at present occupied in doverstreet by my respected friend the present prelate this was named elyhouse and is settled on the bishops of ely for ever it was the fortune of that munificent prelate edmund keen to rebuild or repair more ecclesiastical houses than any churchman of modern days he bestowed most considerable repairs on the parsonagehouse of stanhope in the bishopric of durham he wholly rebuilt the palace at chester he restored almost from rain that at ely and finally elyhouse was built under his inspection  to revert to ancient times john duke of lancaster styled usually john of gaunt resided in this palace and died here in      possibly it was lent to him

bourreau and with his own hands gave force to the rack ballards lives of british ladies     he was created earl of southampton just before the coronation of edward vi but obstinately adhering to the old religion he was dismissed from his post and confined to southamptonhouse where he died in    0  the wellknown party tool doctor sacheverel was rector of this church he had the chance of meeting in his parish a person as turbulent as himself the noted mr whiston that singular character took it into his head to disturb the doctor while he was in his pulpit venting some doctrine contrary to the opinion of that heterodox man the doctor in great wrath descended from on high and fairly turned wicked will whiston into the street  in ascending to west smithfield cocklane is left to the right cocklane ghost a ridiculous scene of imposture in the affair of the cocklane ghost which was to detect the murderer of the body it lately inhabited by its appearance in the vault of st johns church clerkenwell the credulity of the english nation was most fully displayed by the great concourse of people of all ranks to hear the conversation held by one of the cheats with the ghost it ended in full detection and exemplary punishment of the several persons concerned in the villainy  smithfield is celebrated on several accounts at present smithfield and long since for being the great market for cattle of all kinds bartholomewfair for being the place where bartholomewfair was kept which was granted during three days annually by henry ii to the neighboring priory it was long a season of great festivity theatrical performances by the better actors were exhibited here and it was frequented by a great deal of good company but becoming the resort of the debauched of all denominations certain regulations took place which in later days have spoiled the mirth but produced the desired decency the humors of this place will never be lost as long as the inimitable print of bartholomewfair of our hogarth shall exist  place for tournaments for a long series of reigns smithfield was the field of gallant tilts and tournaments and also the spot on which accusations were decided by duel derived from the kampfight ordeal of the saxons here in      the doting hero edward iii in his sixtysecond year infatuated by the charms of alice pierce placed her by his side in a magnificent car and styling her the lady of the sun conducted her to the lifts followed by a train of knights each leading by the bridle a beautiful palfrey mounted by a gay damsel and for seven days together exhibited the most splendid justs in indulgence of his disgraceful passion  his grandson richard ii in the same place held a tournament equally magnificent there issued out of the tower of london says the admiring froissart first threescore coursers apparelled for the justes and on every one a squire of honor riding a soft pase than issued out threescore ladies of honor mounted on fair palfreyes and every lady led a knight by a cheyne of sylver which knights were apparelled to just i refer to my author froissart tom iv chapter xxii lord berners translation ii p ccix for the rest of the relation of this splendid spectacle certainly there was a magnificence and spirit of gallantry in the dissipation of those early times which cherished a warlike and generous spirit in the nobility and gentry of the land something like is now arising in the brilliant societies of archers in most parts of britain which it is to be hoped will at lest share the hours consumed in the enervated pleasures of music or the dangerous waste of time in the hours dedicated to cards  for trials by duel i will not trespass on my readers patience any more on this subject than just to mention one instance of duel it was when the unfortunate armourer entered into the lists on account of a false accusation of treason brought against him by his apprentice in the reign of henry vi the friends of the defendant had so plied him with liquor that he fell an easy conquest to his accuser shakespeare has worked this piece of history into a scene in the second part of henry vi but has made the poor armourer confess his treasons in his dying moments for in the time in which this custom prevaled it never was even suspected but that guilt must have been the portion of the vanquished let me add that when people of rank fought with sword and lance plebeian combatants were only allowed a pole armed with a heavy sandbag with which they were to decide their guilt or innocence  in smithfield was also held our autos de fe but for executions to the credit of our english monarchs none were ever known to attend the ceremony even philip ii of spain never honored any of the many which were celebrated by permission of his gentle queen with his presence notwithstanding he could behold the roasting of his own subjects with infinite selfapplause and sangfroid the stone marks the spot in this area on which those cruel exhibitions were executed here our martyr latimer preached patience to friar forest agonizing under the torture of a slow fire for denying the kings supremacy and to this place our martyr cranmer compelled the amiable edward by forcing his reluctant hand to the warrant to send joan bocher a silly woman to the stake yet latimer never thought of his own conduct in his last moments nor did cranmer thrust his hand into the fire for a real crime but for one which was venial through the frailty of human nature  the last person who suffered at the stake in england was bartholomew legatt who was burnt here in      as a blasphemous heretic according to the sentence pronounced by john king bishop of london the bishop consigned him to the secular arm of our monarch james who took care to give to the sentence full effect see part iv of the history of the first fourteen years of king james   this place as well as tyburn was called the elms and used for the execution of malefactors even before the year       in the year    0 there was a most severe and singular punishment inflicted here on one john roose a cook who had poisoned seventeen persons of the bishop of rochesters family two of whom died by a retrospective law he was sentenced to be boiled to death which was done accordingly  in      margret davie a young woman suffered in the same place and manner for the same species of crime  in smithfield the archrebel wat tyler met with in      the reward of his treason and insolence the youthful king no longer able to bear his brutality ordered him to be arrested when the gallant walworth lord mayor of london struck him off his horse and the attendants of the monarch quickly put him to death  i cannot help indulging myself with the mention of william pennant an honest goldsmith my great great great great great great uncle who at his house the queenshead in smithfield acquired a considerable fortune in the latter end of the reign of elizabeth and the beginning of that of james i it appears by his will dated may  th   0  that he was employed by the court for numbers of his legacies were to the royal servants his legacy to sir william fortescue knight his wifes brother has now a singular appearance  one chain of gold and pearl weighing about    ounces and a quarter one billament of gold and pearl being    pieces a round salt of silver and a cover thereto weighing    ounces and somewhat more six white silver spoons one feather bed bolster two pillows two blankets one blue rug a testearn of satin figured russet and black and vallance to the same   curtains of taffety sarcenet one chair and a stool with a back of satin figured russet ten black and six stools covered with black wrought velvet and also a great chest covered with black leather with an inlock and all things in it excepting certain plate hereafter bequeathed he left to his nephew hugh pennant of bychton flintshire the manor of moxhall in essex with a considerable estate but the fruits of the labors of this industrious tradesman were all dissipated by a gentleman of the family who fortunately quitted this life before he had wasted our paternal acres but the charities of william pennant to the poor of whiteford flintshire are more permanent for to this day they completely cloth twenty poor people and in a few years more the trustees of the bequeathed lands flatter themselves with the hopes of doubling the number  we now reach a great extent of holy ground consecrated for the purposes of monastic life or for the humane purpose of affording relief to our distressed brethren in their passage through this world i have not in view a conventual history of london but only mean to give a brief account of those foundations which have a clame to preeminence the church of st bartholomew the greater is a small distance from smithfield church of st bartholomew it is only the choir of the ancient building and the center on which stood the great tower in the choir are the remains of the old architecture massy columns and round arches part of the cloisters are still preserved in a neighboring stable and consists of eight arches adjacent is part of the south transept now converted into a small buryingground priory of st bartholomew this was a conventual church belonging to a priory of black canons founded in   0  by one rahere minstrel or jester to henry i who quitting his profligate life became the first prior of his own foundation legend relates that he had a most horrible dream out of which he was relieved by st bartholomew himself who directed him to found the house and to dedicate it to him rahere has here a handsome monument beneath an arch divided by elegant tabernaclework his figure is recumbent with an angel at his feet and a canon in a great hood kneeling on each side as if praying over him it was afterward repaired by william bolton the last prior at the dissolution its revenues according to dugdale were l       s it was granted by henry to sir richard rich queen mary repeopled it with black or preaching friars but on the accession of elizabeth they were turned out rich who was made lord chancellor in the reign of edward vi made it his place of residence as did sir walter mildmay chancellor of the exchequer to queen elizabeth  st bartholomews hospital st bartholomews hospital will ever be a monument of the piety of rahere for from him it took its origin on a waste spot he obtained a grant of a piece of ground from his master and built on it an hospital for a master brethren and sisters and for the entertainment of poor diseased people till they got well of distressed women big with child till they were delivered and were able to go abroad and for the support of all such children whose mothers died in the house till they attained the age of seven years it was given to the neighboring priory who had the care of it its revenues at the dissolution were l  0  according to dugdale the good works of rahere live to this day the foundation was continued through every reign the present handsome building which surrounds a square was begun in      the extent of the charity is shown by saying that in the last year there were under the care of the hospital three thousand seven hundred and fifty inpatients and eight thousand one hundred and twenty three out patients  the great staircase is admirably painted by hogarth at his own expense the subjects are the good samaritan and the pool of bethesda in another part is rahere laying the foundation stone a sick man carried on a bier attended by monks the hall is at the head of the staircase a very large room ornamented with a fulllength of henry viii who had good reason to be complimented as he presented this house to the citizens doctor ratcliff is also here at fulllength he left five hundred pounds a year to this hospital for the improvement of the diet and one hundred a year for buying of linen happy had it been had all his wealth been so directed instead of wasting it on that vain mausoleum his library at oxford the patron saint has over the chimneypiece his portrait but not in the offensive circumstances which spagnolet would have placed it in for he is clothed and has only the knife the symbol of his martyrdom in his hand in the windows is painted henry viii delivering the charter to the lord mayor by him is prince arthur and two noblemen with white rods  at no great distance from this hospital stands within the walls of the city that of christchurch christchurch hospital a royal foundation for orphans and poor children who are taken care of and apprenticed once the gray friars at different ages to proper trades it was originally the house of the gray friars or mendicants of the order of st francis founded by john ewin its fine church mercer about the year      the church was reckoned one of the most superb of the conventual and rose by the contributions of the opulent devout margaret daughter of philip the hardy and second queen to edward i in   0  began the choir isabella queen to edward ii gave threescore and ten pounds and queen philippa wife of edward iii gave threescore and two pounds toward the building john de bretagne duke of richmond built the body of the church at a vast expense and gilbert de care earl of gloucester gave twenty great beams out of his forest at tunbridge no order of monks seem to have the powers of persuasion equal to these poor friars they raised vast sums for their buildings among the rich and few of their admirers when they came to die who did not console themselves with the thought of lying within their expiating walls and if they were particularly wicked thought themselves secure against the assault of the devil if their corpse was wrapped in the habit and cowl of a friar  personages interred here multitudes therefore of all ranks were crowded in this holy ground it boasts of receiving four queens margaret and isabella four queens above

before him by ridley bishop of london he founded three great hospitals in this city judiciously adapted to the necessities of the poor divided into three classes the hospital of st thomas southwark for the sick or wounded poor this for the orphan and that of bridewell for the thriftless charles ii founded also here a mathematical school for the instruction of forty boys and training them up for

at catworth in huntingdonshire about the reign of edward iii sir wolstan was the founder of the family of baronets settled at marketbosworth in leicestershire which was bestowed by him on his great nephew in the reign of queen elizabeth collinss baronets iii  0   sir wolstan was distinguished by the magnificent pageantry of his mayors day and by the poetical incense bestowed on the occasion by george peele a m of christchurch college oxford who among other things wrote the life of our last prince llewelyn the loves of king david and the fair bathsheba and the tragedy of absalom woods athenae oxon i  00  but sir wolstan immortalized himself by his good deeds and the greatness of his charities at bosworth he founded a free school every prison in the capital felt his bounty he portioned poor maidens in marriage contributed largely to build a pesthouse established two fellowships in emanuel college cambridge and two scholarships and left to this hospital an annual endowment of fortytwo pounds for ever  but a lady dame mary ramsay wife of sir thomas ramsay lord mayor in      greatly surpassed sir wolstan in her charitable deeds by the gift of twenty pounds a year to be annually paid to the master and usher of the school belonging to this hospital and also to the hospital the reversion of a hundred and twenty pounds annually she was complimented with having her picture placed in this room she is dressed in a redbodied gown and petticoat she augmented fellowships and scholarships clothed ten maimed soldiers at the expense of twenty pounds annually she did not forget the prisoners in the several gaols she gave the sum of twelve hundred pounds to five of the companies to be lent to young tradesmen for four years she gave to bristol a thousand pounds to be laid out in an hospital she married and portioned poor virgins and besides other charities i omit left three thousand pounds to good and pious uses this excellent woman died about the year      and

interring the dead at a time in which a dreadful pestilence raged not fewer than fifty thousand people were buried in it during the time of this dreadful calamity which shows how very populous london must have been at that period in the preceding year ralph sratford bishop of london had bought another piece of land adjoining to this which he enclosed with a brick wall built on it a chapel and applied to the same use under the name of pardon churchyard here also were buried suicides and such who had been executed they were brought here in what was called the friars cart which was tilted and

boys eighty decayed gentlemen who had been soldiers or merchants besides physician surgeons register and other officers and servants of the house each decayed gentleman has fourteen pounds a year a

times ever bestowed by a single man till we come to the time of the foundation of guys hospital in southwark  there is scarcely any vestige of the conventual building which is said to have stood in

celebrated for his learning and equally so for the spirit with which he resisted the obtrusion of a roman catholic into the office by james ii he was the author of the famous sacred theory of the

with other persons of his religious turn assumed a black garment with a white cross on it with eight spikes and undertook the care of an hospital before founded at jerusalem for the use of the pilgrims and also to protect them from insults on the road either in coming or returning godfrey of bologne first instituted the order and in reward of the valor of gerardus at the battle of ascalon endowed the knights with great estates to enable them to support the end of their order the kings of france were the sovereigns after the loss of jerusalem they retired from place to place but having taken rhodes fixed there and were then styled knights of rhodes but in      on the loss of that island they retreated to malta and were afterward known by the name of knights of malta the order before the separation of england from the church of rome consisted of eight nations the world is filled with their prodigious valor  jordan briset and mriel his wife persons of rank founded this house in the year   00 and it received consecration from heraclius patriarch of jerusalem this order at first styled itself servant to the poor servants of the hospital at jerusalem but their vast endowments infected them with an uncommon degree of pride the whole order had in different parts of christendom nineteen thousand manors in      the revenues of the english knights templars were bestowed on them this gave them such importance that the prior was ranked as first baron of england and lived in the highest state their luxury gave offense to the rebels of kent and essex in      these levellers burnt their house to the ground but it soon rose with double splendour the first prior was garnerius de neapoli the last sir william weston who on the suppression by henry viii had a pension of a thousand a year but died on ascensionday    0 the very day that the house was suppressed newcourt i      entirely of a broken heart his monument is preserved by a drawing in the collection of doctor

mansion before he attained his fullness of power and lived in regal state at whitehall  new river head in the fields at a small distance from clerkenwell is the new river head the great repository which supplies the largest portion of our capital with water to give a greater extent of service of late years another reservoir has been made on the heights at a little distance to the north of the former this is supplied with water from the first by means of an engine which is worked by horses forcing the water up the ascent from hence it streams down to places which the other had not the power of benefiting these reservoirs may be called the heart of the work the element essentially useful as the vital fluid at first rushes through veins of vast diameter divides into lesser and again into thousands of ramifications which support the life of this most populous city  no one ought to be ignorant that this unspeakable benefit is owing to a welshman sir hugh middelton of denbigh who on september  0th   0  began and on september   th      completed the great work he brought the water from amwell in hertfordshire a distance of twenty but from the necessity of making a detour to avoid hills and valleys it was increased to thirtyeight miles threequarters and sixteen poles yet it was impossible to escape difficulties his daring spirit penetrated the hills in several places and carried the river over two valleys over one it extended six hundred and sixty feet in length and thirty in height and over another four hundred and sixtytwo feet in length the original source of this river was by the vast increase of london found inadequate to its wants the new river company found it necessary to have recourse to another supply they applied to parliament for powers to obtain it from the river lee the property of the city london opposed the benefit intended its inhabitants but in vain parliament wisely determined against their objections so the blessing was forced upon them and the river lee supplies the greater part of the wants of the city sir hugh middelton was ruined by the execution of his project so little was the benefit understood that for above thirty years the seventytwo shares it was divided into shared only five pounds apiece each of these shares was sold originally for a hundred pounds within this twelvemonth they were sold at nine thousand pounds a share and lately at ten thousand and are increasing because their profits increase on which their dividends are grounded half of the seventytwo shares are called kings shares and are in less estimation than the others because subject to a grant of five hundred pounds a year made so long ago as the reign of james i when the water was first brought to london or soon after  i now descend to

painting engraving and music from the following lines it appears that he was the inventor of the aeolian harp st dunstans harp fast by the wall upon a pin did hang a the harp itself with ly and all untouched by hand did twang a new view of london i      for this he was represented to king athelstan as a conjuror he was an excellent workman in brass and iron it was when thus employed at his forge that he seized the devil by the nose with the redhot tongs till he roared again the demon had visited him in a female form and suffered for intruding on this womanhating saint  his church is probably of very ancient foundation yet the first mention of it is in      when the abbot and convent of westminster bestowed it on henry iii who bestowed the profits on the domus conversorum or the house for converted jews the two figures of savages on the outside of the clock striking the quarters with their clubs were set up in      and are much admired by the gaping populace  next to the temple is

carmelites or white friars founded in      by sir richard gray ancestor of the lord greys of codnor edward i bestowed on them more ground that they might enlarge their buildings the order originated

moresque and the chapter house and other parts to his physician william butts immortalized by shakespeare edward vi bestowed the house inhabited by doctor butts together with the church to the bishop

but lost in the various houses of the street st brides church stands farther on on the south side it was dedicated to st bridget whether she was irish or whether she was scotch whether she was maiden or whether she was wife i will not dare to determine the contest her church was originally small but by the piety of william viner warden of the fleet about the year    0 was enlarged with a body and sideailes and ornamented with grapes and vineleaves in allusion to his name it was destroyed by the great fire and rebuilt soon after in its present form  not far from this church lived the famous

the emperor charles v who visited england in      after all the expense the emperor lodged in black friars and his suite in the new palace and a gallery of communication was flung over the ditch and a passage cut through the city wall into the emperors apartments the king often lodged here particularly in      when the question of his marriage with queen catherine was agitated at black friars it

reached as far as holbornbridge at the foot of holbornhill and received into it the little river fleet turnmill brook and another called oldbourn which gave name to that vast street the tide flowed up as high as holbornbridge and brought up barges of considerable burden over it were four stone bridges and on the sides extensive quays and warehouses it was of such utility that it was scoured and kept open at vast expense and not later than   0  near twentyeight thousand pounds were expended for that purpose  in the performing of this work at the depth of fifteen feet were found several roman utensils and a little deeper a great quantity of roman coins in silver copper brass and other metals but none in gold at holbornbridge were found two brazen lares about four inches long one a bacchus the other a ceres it is a probable conjecture that these were thrown in by the affrighted romans at the approach of the enraged boadicia who soon took ample revenge on her insulting conquerors here were also found numbers of saxon antiquities spurs weapons keys seals etc also medals crosses and crucifixes which might likewise have been flung in on occasion of some alarm  this canal was afterward neglected and became a nuisance was filled up and a sewer formed beneath to convey the water to the river the fine market which extends the whole length of the old ditch rose in its place in      in which year an act was passed to empower the lord mayor and citizens to fill up the ditch at their own expense and to vest the seesimple of the ground in them and their successors for ever i recollect the present noble approach to blackfriarsbridge the well built opening of chathamplace a muddy and genuine ditch this had been the mouth of the creek which as stow informs us in   0  was of depth and width sufficient that ten or twelve ships navies at once with merchandises were wont to come to the aforesaid bridge of fleet survay of london p     it must be recollected that at this period there were drawbridges upon london bridge through which ships of a certain size might pass and discharge their cargoes in the mouth of the fleet  this end of blackfriarsbridge now fills the filthy mouth of

obligation  on the east side of fleetmarket stands the fleetprison fleetprison for debtors founded at lest as early as the first of richard i it was also the place of confinement for such who had incurred the displeasure of that arbitrary court the star chamber this prison became such a scene of cruelty that in the year      a most benevolent set of gentlemen prototypes of the good howard formed themselves into a committee to search into the horrors of the gloomy gaol  unpitied and unheard where misery moans where sickness pines where thirst and hunger burns and poor misfortune feels the lash of vice while in the land of liberty the land whose every street and public meeting glow with open freedom little tyrants raged snatched the lean morsel from the starving mouth tore from cold wintry limbs the tattered weed even robbed them of the last of comforts sleep the freeborn briton to the dungeon chained or as the lust of cruelty prevailed at pleasure marked him with inglorious stripes and crushed out lives by secret barbarous ways thomson all these barbarities were realized the house of commons the year preceding had taken up the enquiries see state trials vol ix page  0   and found that huggins warden of the fleet and bambridge his deputy and william acton turnkey had exercised most shocking cruelties those monsters were tried for the murder of five unhappy men who died under the most horrid treatment from them yet notwithstanding the prosecution was recommended from the throne and conducted by the ablest lawyers to the concern of all good men these wretches escaped their merited punishment the same pages              0   0       for farther particulars respecting this prison see mr howard on prisons octavo       profligate marriages in walking along the

misery and disgrace which would be entailed by these extemporary thoughtless unions  i shall now give a general view of the walls city walls the ancient defense of the city and of the townditch a work of considerable labor in my progress i shall point out whatsoever was remarkable in the adjacent suburbs or the parts within the city which border on the walls there never was any alteration made in the course of this first precinct which was preserved through all succeeding ages and in every reparation or additional strength which was thought necessary its direction was from the first irregular the romans as was frequently the case consulted the necessity of the ground vegetius  it commenced at the palatinetower ran in a strait line along the eminence of ludgate hill and above fleetditch as far as newgate then suddenly was carried northerly to a spot a little beyond aldersgate and at that place ran strait in a northern direction almost to cripplegate from whence it resumed a strait eastern course as far as bishopsgate in which a long remnant of the wall still called london wall is to be seen from bishopsgate it assumes a gentle curvature pointed to the tower over the site of which it originally passed and probably finished in a castellum in this as it did in the western extremity another wall guarded the river and ran the whole length of the south side of the city on the direction of the vast street called thames street but all this i shall particularize in my walk round the ancient walls  townditch i shall first mention another considerable addition to the strength of those fortifications the townditch was a stupendous piece of work began in the reign of king john in      by the londoners themselves possibly as a protection against their own monarch who in resentment to them had just removed the exchequer to northampton it was two hundred feet broad and extended on the outside of the walls from towerditch quite to christs hospital notwithstanding the multitude of hands employed it was not finished in less than two years it was filled with water as is evident from the quantity of good fish stow informs us was taken in it survaie i p     the citizens for some centuries were at great expense in cleansing and keeping it open but after the last attempt in      the work was given over it became stable land and was soon covered with buildings  the western wall terminated near the river with a sort which i apprehend to have been the castle of montfitchet soon to be mentioned  black friars within the walls opposite to bridewell stood the great house of black friars or dominicans founded by the interest and exhortations of robert kilwarby archbishop of canterbury about      when gregory rocksley and the barons of london presented him with the ground edward i and his queen elianor became great benefactors by the assistance of whom the archbishop built the monastery and a large church richly ornamented this obtained every immunity which any religious house had its precinct was very large had four gates and contained numbers of shops the inhabitants of which were subject only to the king the superior of the house and their own justices it also became a sanctuary for debtors and even malefactors a privilege which it preserved even long after the suppression of religious houses  to make way for this foundation two lanes were pulled down and part of the city wall which last was rebuilt immediately by a charter granted by edward i for that purpose castle of montfichet the castle of montfichet also fell a sacrifice to this house it was built by gilbert de montfichet a follower of the conqueror and growing ruinous by gift of the king the materials were used for the building of the church on the site of this ancient tower the church became a fashionable place of interment of people of rank and to be buried in the habit of the order was thought to be a sure preservative against the attacks of the devil among other

same church were also held several parlements the remarkable one of    0 in the reign of henry vi was adjourned from westminster to this place here the weak monarch vainly endeavored to divert the storm raised by his subjects against the favorite of his queen william de la pole duke of suffolk and by a poor expedient a simulated exile drove him to instant death  here in      henry viii held another in order to oppress his subjects with an aid of eight hundred thousand pounds to carry on his imprudent wars the virtue of the commons resisted the demand and gave him any a moderate tax this was called the black parliament as it began amongst the black monks at westminster and ended among the black friars  here cardinal campeggio and cardinal wolsey sat in      as judges and legates on the question of divorce between henry and the illfated princess catherine of arragon henry and his queen at that time residing in the palace of bridewell ready to attend the farcical citations of that court and in this place wolsey himself fell from all his greatness for here began the parliament which gave the sentence of praemunire the last stroke to all his prosperity  with all the great events which honored this house its revenues at the dissolution were only one hundred pounds fifteen shillings and five pence bishop fisher held it in commendam and in      with fifteen brethren surrendered it to the king edward vi afterward granted it to sir thomas cawarden  in the reign of queen elizabeth the black friars became a place much inhabited by people of fashion among others lord herbert son of william fourth earl of worcester had a house here which queen elizabeth in   00 honored with her presence on occasion of his nuptials with the daughter and heiress of john lord russel son of francis earl of bedford the queen was met at the waterside by the bride and carried to her house in a lectica by six knights her majesty dined there and supped in the same neighborhood with lord

vespers gave a sermon to a large audience of british subjects in a spacious room up three pair of stairs in the midst of the discourse the floor fell and ninetyfour persons besides the preacher perished it is disgusting to reflect on the uncharitable bigotry of the times the protestants considered the accident as a judgment on the catholics for their idolatry the catholics attributed it to a plot of the protestants to bring destruction on their dissenting brethren  apothecarieshall is within this precinct apothecarieshall a large and handsome building in which medicines of all kinds are prepared and sold at a cheap rate here also are made up the chests of medicines for the army and navy it was finished in    0 but i am not acquainted with the time of the first establishment of this

first gate in this southern part of the walls is ludgate which stood on the middle of ludgate hill this and every other gate in the city are at present pulled down temple bar excepted ludgate was built during the wars of the barons with king john in      they entered the city and destroyed the houses of the devoted jews and with their houses repaired the walls and built this gate when it was taken down to be rebuilt in      a stone with this inscription in hebrew was found lodged in the wall this is the ward of rabbi moses the son of the honorable rabbi isaac it was in my memory a wretched prison for debtors it commenced what was called a freeprison in      but soon lost that privilege it was enlarged and had the addition of a chapel by sir stephen forster on a very romantic occasion he himself had been confined there and begging at the grate was accosted by a rich widow who asked him what sum would purchase his liberty she paid it down took him into her service and afterward married him in the chapel was an inscription in honor of him and agnes his wife dated      the year in which he enjoyed the honor of being lord mayor of the city  this gate gave a conclusion to the rebellion of sir thomas wyat when he had with some loss led his forces along the strand and fleet street in hopes of being joined by the citizens he found it shut against him and strongly manned seized with despondency he retreated a little down the hill and flinging himself on a bench opposite to the inn called the bell savage began to repent the rashness of his enterprise and lament his folly he was summoned by a herald to submit which he agreed to requesting that it might be to a gentleman and accordingly yielded himself into the hard of sir maurice berkely or sir clement parton fullers church history book xvi p      the bell savage continues an inn to this day bell savage but the sign is disused stow says that it received its name from one isabella savage who had given the house to the company of cutlers the painter gave it a very diverting origin deriving it from a bell and a wild man so painted a bell with a savage man standing by it the spectator alone gives the real

romans but the place had been made up and no vestiges of it left the gate which supplied its place is supposed by stow to have been erected between the years   0  and      when richard beauveyes

surgeonshall which is esteemed one of the best works of inigo jones the theater for the operations is elliptical and finely contrived since the separation of the company of the surgeons from that of the barbers the building is in a manner deserted originally the chirurgic art and that of shaving went in this city hand in hand as they do to this day in several parts of europe the barbers were first incorporated by edward iv in      but prior to that they had been formed into a body by thomas morestead surgeon to henry iv v and vi who died in    0 and the grant had been solicited by him

physicians and martyrs the company prospered for some time till finding that numbers had crept in among them less skilled in the lancet than the razor from the want of power of examining into the skill of the chirurgical members they obtained a new charter from henry viii in which both professions were united a fine picture by holbein picture by holbein preserved in this hall commemorates the

drawing of teeth and surgeons were strictly prohibited from the feat or craft of barbery or shaving use was to make both perfect but by the year      it having been discovered that the above arts were foreign to and independent of each other the barbers and the surgeons were by act of parliament separated and made distinct corporations it was very fit that an association which was now become ludicrous should be dissolved our surgeons began at that period to rise into great fame true it is that pupils then went to paris to improve in the art at present europe looks up to our surgeons as on the summit of the profession  it will be curious to turn back from these times to those of henry viii to compare the state of surgery when at one time there were very few as gale tells us worthy to be called surgeons his account of those employed in the army is very humorous i remember says he when i was in the wars at muttrel montreuil in the time of that most famous prince king henry viii there was a great rabblement that took on them to be surgeons some were sowgelders and some horsegelders with tinkers and cobblers this noble sect did such great cures that they got themselves a perpetual name for like as thessaluss sect were called thessalions so was this noble rabblement for their notorious cures called dogleaches for in two dressings they did commonly make their cures whole and found for ever so that they neither felt heat nor cold nor no manner of pain after but when the duke of norfolk who was then general understood how the people did die and that of small wounds he sent for me and certain other surgeons commanding us to make search how these men came to their death whether it were by the grievousness of their wounds or by the lack of knowledge of the surgeons and we according to our commandment made search through all the camp and found many of the same good fellows which took upon them the names of surgeons not only the names but the wages also we asking of them whether they were surgeons or no they said they were we demanded with whom they were brought up and they with shameless faces would answer either with one cunning man or another which was dead then we demanded of them what surgery stuff they had to cure men withal and they would show us a pot or a box which they had in a budget wherein was such trumpery as they did use to grease horses heels withal and laid upon scabbed horses backs with rewal and such like and others that were cobblers and tinkers they used shoemakers wax with the rust of old pans and made therewithal a noble salve as they did term it but in the end this worthy rabblement was committed to the marshalsea and threatened by the dukes grace to be hanged for their worthy deeds except they would declare the truth what they were and of what occupations and in the end they did confess as i have declared to you before atkins memoirs of medicine p     i must not overlook another picture dr scarborough it is of doctor scarborough

people who inhabited it the bishops of bath and wells once had it in lieu of their mansion in the strand and in      henry gray duke of suffolk possessed it by patent from edward vi on his attainder it reverted to the crown in which it continued till the restoration soon after a new house was built on it called the kings for what reason is unknown charles granted it to colonel william leg who resided there died in it in      and was buried from thence with great funeral pomp in the adjoining church that of trinity minories and his descendants of the dartmouth family still continue to make it the place of their interment  now a fine street this street from being as despicable as any in the city has of late years been most excellently rebuilt is filled with several spacious shops is become a fine street and on one side has its square its circus and its crescent  goodmans fields behind this street is goodmans fields or rather square stow in his simple manner tells that in his time one trolop and afterward goodman were the farmers there and that the fields were a farm belonging to the said nunrie at the which farm i myself says he in my youth have fetched many a half penny worth of milk and never had less then   ale pints for a half penny in the summer nor less then one ale quart for a half penny in the winter always hot from the kine his survaie       the theater in goodmans fields will always be remembered by my cotemporaries as the stage where garrick first showed those powers which for such a number of years astonished and charmed the public his first appearance was on october   th      one odel founded the playhouse in this square in      as sir john hawkins expresses it a halo of brothels life of doctor johnson    soon incircled that as it does all theaters and drove away the industrious inhabitants this theater was rebuilt in an expensive manner by henry giffard in      but was suppressed by the excellent act for the licensing of places of dramatical entertainment yet it was supported a few years by an evasion during which time mr garrick entered himself of the company he drew an audience of nobility and gentry whose carriages filled the whole space from temple bar to whitechapel life of garrick i      on the west side of this portion of the walls house of crossed friars stood the house of the crutched or crossed friars or fratres sanctae crucis the order was instituted or at lest reformed about the year      by gerard prior of st mary de morello at bologna they astonished the english by appearing among them in      and requiring from the opulent a house to live in telling them they were privileged by the pope to be exempt from being reproached by any body and that they had from him power to excommunicate those who were hardy enough to reprove them two citizens ralph hosier and william sabernes were wise enough to accommodate them with a house in this place and became friars in it originally they carried in their hands an iron cross which they afterward changed into one of silver they wore a cross made of red cloth on their garment which at first was gray and in later times altered to blue one adams was the first prior edmund streatham the last their annual income was only l       s   d henry viii granted their house to sir thomas wyat granted to sir thomas wyat the elder who built a handsome mansion on part of the site this was the gentleman whom anthony wood athenae ox i    not without justice calls the delight of the muses and of mankind he had the honor to be in great intimacy with the congenial peer henry earl of surry they were the refiners of our poetry the elegant effusions of their muses are united in a little book published in      entitled songs and sonnets by the right honorable henry howard late earl of surry and others sir thomas died in      of a violent fever in dorsetshire contracted by hard riding to conduct to court the emperors ambassador who had landed at falmouth he was highly celebrated by his noble friend and by every person of genius in the age in which he lived  lumleyhouse this house afterward became the residence of john lord lumley a celebrated warrior in the time of henry viii who distinguished himself greatly at the battle of floddon by his valor and the number of men he brought into the field notwithstanding this his zeal for the old religion engaged him in the pilgrimage of grace from which he with much dexterity extricated himself and followers but his only son soon after lost his head for his concern in a fresh insurrection john lord lumley grandson of the first was among the few nobility of that time who had a taste for literature he had the good fortune to marry his sister barbara to my illustrious countryman humphrey llwyd of denbigh tour in wales vol ii     and by his assistance formed a considerable library which at present makes a most valuable part in the british museum  the navy office in the place of this rose the navy office a building of no beauty in which the comptroller of the navy used to reside and all business respecting the payment of seamens wages and many other naval matters were transacted but this office is now removed to somerset house in the place of the old navy office the india company have erected a most magnificent warehouse a regular oblong square of about two hundred and fifty feet by a hundred and sixty enclosing a court of a hundred and fifty by sixty entered by an arched gateway this is the great repository of the teas i am told that the searchers who have frequent occasions to thrust their arms deep into the chests often feel numbnesses and paralytic affections  the friars hall was converted into a glasshouse a glasshouse for the making of drinking glasses which with forty thousand billets of wood was destroyed by fire in      stows survaie      the manufacture was set up in      and was the first of the kind known in england i may add here that the finest flint glass was first made at the savoy and the first glass plates for lookingglasses and coach windows in      at lambeth under the patronage of george villiers duke of buckingham  i find among the list of persons interred in the church belonging to these friars the name of sir rhys gryffydd a welshman who lost his head on tower hill in      his servant john hughes was hanged at tyburn the same afternoon

northumberlandhouse in the reign of henry vi by two of the earls of northumberland one lost his life in the battle of st albans the other his son in that of towton being deserted by the percies the gardens were converted into bowlingallies and other parts says stow into dicinghouses this i imagine was the first of those pernicious places of resort for he calls it their ancient and only patron of misrule  in marklane near this place stood the magnificent house strype i book ii    built by sir william sharrington a chief officer of the mint sharringtonhouse in the reign of edward vi he was the instrument of the ambition of thomas seymour lord admiral he fell with his master was condemned and attained and sharringtonhouse bestowed on the earl of arundel being thought a fit habitation for that great peer on account of its size and splendour let me add that sir william was pardoned emerged from his misfortunes and soon raised another considerable estate under the favor of seymours rival dudley duke of northumberland carte i      possibly at the price of the admirals blood against whom he was chief evidence mr walpole has a drawing of sir william after holbein  all hallows barking at the bottom of this lane in towerstreet stands the church of all hallows barking legend says that edward i when prince of wales was admonished by a vision to erect an image here to the glorious virgin and in case he visited it five times in the year he was to be victorious over all nations and in particular over scotland and wales the image grew into great repute and vast were the pilgrimages to it

his friend sir thomas more weever  0   the remains of laud beheaded in      lay here till      when they were removed to st johns college oxford over which he had presided newcourt       in this parish was designed a hospital for poor priests and for lunatics of both sexes as early as the time of edward iii but not taking effect it was granted to the hospital of st katherine which was to find a chaplain to pray for the soul of robert denton who had piously intended the first foundation the same       from aldgate the walls ran southward to the thames and ended as is generally supposed with a fort on the site of which arose the present tower of london to the north of it was a postern for the benefit of foot passengers it was originally a fair and strong gate built of stone brought out of kent postern gate and caen in normandy it stood till the year    0 when it fell down not as is conjectured from the pulling down of three hundred feet of the adjacent wall in      for the purpose of enlarging and strengthening the tower but from decay the tower of london it being made at the same time with that fortress which was built by the conqueror in his first year and strongly garrisoned with normans to secure the allegiance of his new and reluctant subjects  the first work seems to have been suddenly flung up in  0   on his taking possession of the capital this included in it a part of the ancient wall for soon after the murder of sir thomas overbury a dispute arose whether he was poisoned in the liberties of the city or in the county of middlesex on examination part of the ancient wall was discovered and his apartment found to be to the west of it and in consequence the criminals were tried within the jurisdiction of the city had it been on the other side it would have been adjudged to have been within the county there is another proof of this fortress having been built upon the remains of another more ancient for in    0 in digging on the south side of what is called cesars chapel were discovered some old foundations of stone three yards broad so strongly cemented that it was with the utmost difficulty they were forced up  white tower the great square tower called the white tower and by the welsh twr gwyn or twr y bryngwyn was erected in the year  0   when it arose under the directions of the great military architect gundulph bishop of rochester guillelm pictav inter script normann p  0   who gave this noble specimen of innovation in the art of castlebuilding and which was pursued by him in the execution of rochestercastle on the banks of the medway stow tells us from edmund de haddenham that during the time gundulph was employed in this work he was lodged in the house of one edmere a citizen of london survai     this building was long dignified with the name of cesars tower but that illustrious invader probably never saw london originally it stood by itself fitzstephen gives it the name of arx palatina the palatine tower and says with his usual romance that the mortar of the foundation was tempered with the blood of beasts the commander had the title of palatine bestowed on him being as was the case with several of the great men of that time who had places of importance trusted to their care endowed with regal powers such for example as the earl palatine hugh lupus had in the county palatinate of chester lord lytteltons henry ii iii       within this tower is a very ancient chapel for the use of such of our kings and queens who wished to pay their devotion here by stows description for i never saw it it seems coeval with the building he described it as having a long flight of steps to it as being darksome and venerable for the pillars which are very plain but that it was in his time filled with our valuable old records strypes stow i book i p      in  0   a violent tempest did great injury to the tower but it was repaired by william rufus and his successor the first added another castellated building on the south side between it and the thames which was afterward called st thomass tower beneath that was traitorsgate through which state prisoners were brought from the river and under another properly enough called the bloody for till these happier ages there was little difference between confinement and the scaffold or private assassination  ye towers of julius londons lasting shame with many a foul and midnight murder fed here fell the meek usurper henry vi by the dagger of the profligate gloucester here full of horrors died murders within the tower by the hands of hired ruffians the unsteady clarence here the sweet innocents edward v and his brother duke of york perished victims to the ambition of their remorseless uncle and the empoisoning of sir thomas overbury makes up the sum of the known murders the reproaches of our ancient fortress we have here a strait room or dungeon called from the misery the unhappy occupier of this very confined place endures the little ease but this will appear a luxurious habitation when compared with the inventions of the age of louis xi of france with his iron cages in which persons of rank lay for whole years or his oubliettes dungeons made in form of reversed cones concealed with trapdoors down which dropped the unhappy victims of the tyrant brought there by tristan lhermite his companion and executioner in ordinary sometimes their sides were plain sometimes set with knives or sharpedged wheels but in either case they were true oubliettes the devoted were certain to fall into the land where all things were forgotten  the tower was first enclosed by william longchamp bishop of ely and chancellor of england in the reign of richard i this haughty prelate having a quarrel with john third brother to richard under pretense of guarding against his designs surrounded the whole with walls embattled and made on the outside a vast ditch ditch into which in after times the water from the thames was introduced different princes added other works the present contents within the walls are twelve acres and five rods the circuit on the outside of the ditch one thousand and fiftytwo feet it was again enclosed with a mudwall by henry iii this was placed at a distance from the ditch and occasioned the taking down of part of the city wall which was resented by the citizens who pulling down this precinct of mud were punished by the king with a fine of a thousand marks  lions tower edward iv built the lions tower it was originally called the bulwark but received the former name from its use royal menagery a menagery had very long been a piece of regal state henry i had his at his manor of woodstock where he kept lions leopards lynxes porcupines and several other uncommon beasts they were afterward removed to the tower edward ii commanded the sheriffs of london to pay the keepers of the kings leopards six pence a day for the sustenance of the leopards and three halfpence a day for the diet of the keeper out of the feefarm of the city i should have mentioned before that henry issued his order to the sheriffs to supply four pence a day for the maintenance of his white bear urso nostro albo and his keeper in the tower of london they were also to provide a muzzle and an iron chain to hold the said bear out of the water and a long cord to hold it during the time it was fishing in the thames they were besides ordered to build a small house in the tower for the kings elephant elefantem nostrum and to make provision both for beast and keeper madox antiq excheq i       the royal menagery is to this day exceedingly well supplied in april      there was a leopard of a quite unknown species brought from bengal it was wholly black but the hair was marked on the back sides and neck with round clusters of small spots of a glossy and the most intense black the tail hung several inches beyond the length of the legs and was very full of hair here were also two tigers one had been here some time and its groundcolor had faded into a pale sickly sandiness the other young and vigorous and almost fresh from its native woods was almost of an orange color and its black stripes and the white parts were most pure in their kinds engraved and described by m de la metherie dans le journal de physique jllet      p    tab ii   the little book sold in the tower will give a very satisfactory account of all its curiosities natural and artificial to that i refer my reader  tower hill for a considerable time there was a dispute between the crown and the city about the right to the tower hill the gwynfryn of the welsh in the reign of edward iv the kings officers erected there a gallows and a scaffold for the execution of offenders the citizens complained and edward immediately disavowed the act by public proclamation from that time the fatal apparatus is always provided by the city the condemned are delivered to the sheriffs by the lieutenant who receives from the former a receipt for their delivery the sheriffs then see execution done as in other places  the first person beheaded on tower hill the first whom i recollect to have suffered here by the more honorable death of the ax was in      when sir simon de burley knight of the garter tutor of richard ii and the most accomplished man of his time fell a victim to the malice of the potent faction which had usurped the regal authority queen anne the good queen anne went on her knees to the luke of gloucester the kings uncle to implore mercy and continued in that attitude three hours before the inexorable tyrant  the former rough treatment of prisoners there was during a very long period a barbarous meanness a species of insult to the unhappy criminals which is in our days happily changed into every species of tenderness and humanity consistent with public justice and security in revenge for the death of sir simon and many others who suffered in the same cause the great earl of arundel richard fitzalan was hurried instantly from the place of trial the palace at westminster to tower hill his arms and his hands were bound and the king glutted his eyes with the bloody scene that great peer thomas duke of norfolk who was confined here in the last year of henry viii was reduced to beg for sheets he was to have lost his head but was saved by the death of the tyrant on the very day ordered for his execution he was kept in custody during the next short reign but was released on the accession of queen mary he mounted his horse at the edge of fourscore to assist in quelling the insurrection of sir thomas wyat in      this served to fill the tower with new subjects for the mean insults of the times sir thomas and the rest of the prisoners were brought into the tower through the traitorsgate the lieutenant received them one by one with insults and gross abuse when sir thomas appeared gallantly dressed the lieutenant actually collared him sir thomas gave him a fierce and reproachful look bravely telling him this is no masterie now  one person of rank suffered here by the more infamous way of the halter i should not mention sir gervis elwayes sir gervis elwayes lieutenant of the tower who suffered here in      for his concern in the murder of sir thomas overbury but for the great instruction which may be gathered from his end and his excellent dying speech for there is something very peculiar in his admonition to the spectators against appealing to heaven by a rash vow for having been greatly addicted to gaming he had said seriously in his prayers lord let me be hanged if ever i play more and yet he broke it a thousand times see the whole in the first xiv years of king jamess reign p   0  of what utility would be a sensible collection of these proofs of the finger of god exemplified to mankind in the detection and punishment of every species of crime  chapel of the to the church of st petrus ad vincula within the tower has been the undistinguishing repository of the headless bodies of numbers who ended their days on the adjacent hill or when greatly favored within the fortress the ancient church was much more splendid it being occasionally the place at which the kings of england performed their orisons in henry iiis time here were stalls for the king and queen a chancel dedicated to st peter and another to st mary the church was adorned with a fine cross images of saints and

you would never have heard of the unhappy love of elizabeth  duke of monmouth beneath the communion table reposes the handsome restless ungrateful son of charles ii the duke of monmouth his ambition like that of many of those he followed to this place occasioned his death he is said to have died calmly and to have acknowleged the guilt of rebellion but love preserved her influence to the last moment he was married very young and for interested motives he had made a connection of the most tender nature with lady harriet wentworth who lived with him as his wife he could not with all the arguments of our best divines be convinced of the sin of adultery he called her the choice of his ripened years i have been told a tradition that lady harriet had placed herself in a window to take a last and farewell look he was master enough of himself to make her a graceful bow with more certainty can i say that the king on the evening of the execution visited the widowed duchess to give assurance of his attention to her and her children consolation she did not want for she had been separated from him and when at the dukes earnest request she had an interview with him in the tower

associates he seized on the old man whom he had requested to show the jewels to his friends gagged him and on his resisting struck him on the head with a mallet and gave him several stabs edwards thought it prudent to counterfeit death blood put the crown under his parsons gown another put the globe in his breeches a third not being able to conceal the scepter by reason of its length broke off the rich ruby and put it in his pocket as soon as they were gone edwards forced out the gag and gave the alarm they were instantly pursued and three of them soon taken blood struggled hard for his prize saying when it was wrested from him it was a gallant attempt though unsuccessful it was for a crown  the curiosity of the king was excited to see a man engaged in so many important villainies under pretense of obtaining discoveries his majesty made the wretch a visit from that moment the artful blood dated his security he told the king so many plausible tales such indifference he showed for his own life such anxiety for that of his majesty for he insinuated that his comrades would certainly revenge his death even on his sacred majesty that in a short time he obtained his pardon it was necessary to apply to the duke of ormond for permission the ruffian having made the attempt on his graces life not long before the duke nobly answered if his majesty could forgive him stealing the crown he might easily forgive the attempt upon his life and if such was his majestys pleasure that was a sufficient reason for him and his lordship the earl of arlington who brought the message might spare the rest blood was not only pardoned but received into favor had a pension of five hundred a year and was perpetually seen at court enjoying the smiles of majesty and even successfully employing his interest as a most respectable patron but all good men looked on him with horror and considered him as a sicarius to a profligate set of men to overawe any who had integrity enough to resist the

accomplished lord hastings his fidelity to the children of his late master edward iv was the cause of his death he was dragged from the council table by order of their ambitious protector gloucester who swore he would have his head before he dined and such was his haste that the unfortunate lord had only time to make a short shrift to a priest who casually passed by and his head was taken off on a log which happened to lie in the way so little did he expect death that scarcely an hour before he was exulting in the fate of his enemies lord rivers lord richard gray and sir thomas vaughan at

here his days despair seized him on his confinement and forsaken by heaven he put an end to his existence by the razor he was of a party charged with equal freedom in religious as political principles he vindicated and practiced suicide his death was charged on the court but without the lest grounds the prince who could bring lord russel to the block by a legal course need never have incurred the odium of assassination on a less important partner of the conspiracy  sir john perrot here died in september      sir john perrot the supposed son of henry viii by mary wife to thomas perrot esquire of haroldstone in the county of pembroke in his great stature and high spirit he bore a strong resemblance to that monarch young perrot first attracted his notice by a quarrel he had with two of the

reformed religion when queen elizabeth succeeded he experienced the smiles of his sovereign and sister at length was constituted lord deputy of ireland where he grew very unpopular by reason of his

accident befell henry wriothsly earl of southampton the friend and companion of the earl of essex in his fatal insurrection after he had been confined there a small time he was surprised by a visit from his favorite cat which had found its way to the tower and as tradition says reached its master by descending the chimney of his apartment i have seen at bulstrode the summer residence of the late duchess of portland an original portrait of this earl in the place of his confinement in a black dress and cloak with the faithful animal sitting by him in the same collection is another portrait of the same nobleman out of confinement richly dressed with a rich helmet and armor lying by him  perhaps this picture might have been the foundation of the tale  lord chancellor jeffries the fallen lord chancellor the cruel instrument of despotism under james ii died imprisoned here of a broken heart aided by intemperance he was first interred in the church belonging to the tower and afterward was

hospital and its collegiate church a posthumous work of that able antiquary the late andrew coltee ducarel ll d he was interred in the collegiate church where a plain piece of marble informs us of little more than the period of his existence  church the church is a handsome gothic building but almost quite lost in the various houses which shut it up from public view the east window is very elegant and in the modern improvements there is the utmost propriety preserved in the imitation of the ancient architecture the wooden pulpit is a curiosity on its eight sides are represented the

first wife anne daughter of edmund earl stafford and widow of edmund mortimer earl of march and another of his sister constance first wife to thomas mowbray duke of norfolk and afterward to sir john gray eldest son of reginald lord gray of ruthen this potent peer was a great benefactor to the hospital founded in it a chauntry and bequeathed to the high altar in the church a cup of byroll garnished with gold perles and precious stones to be put in the sacrament and numbers of other valuable effects he died in peace in      a wonderful thing in his family not fewer than four of this great house in little more than a century fell by violent deaths  below st catherines on the river side the berehouse stood the great breweries or berehouse as it is called in the map published in the first volume of the civitates orbis they were subject to regulations as early as the reign of henry vii who in      licenses john merchant a fleming to export fifty tons of ale called berre rymer xii      and in the same reign one geffry gate probably an officer of the kings spoiled the brewhouses at st catherines twice either for sending too much abroad unlicensed or for brewing it too weak for their home customers maitland ii  0    the demand for this article from foreign parts increased to a high degree in the reign of queen elizabeth five hundred tons were exported at once as is expressed for the queens use at one time probably for the service of her army in the low countries three hundred and fifty barrels to embden three hundred to amsterdam and again eight hundred to embden at this time there seems to have been a free exportation except when checked by proclamation for fear of enhancing the price of corn by excess of brewing in scarce times but even then it was permitted by the

at the very eastern extent of london as it was in the age of queen elizabeth a small village or two might be found in the remaining part of the county of middlesex but bordered by marshes which frequently experienced the ravages of the river stey this tract had been a manor in the saxon times called stibbenhedde i e stibbenheath in later days it belonged to john de pulteney who had been four times lord mayor viz in    0           and      the bishops of london had here a palace as appears from ancient records given from our palace of stebonbyth or stebonheath which is supposed to have filled the space now covered with several tenements newcourt i      it appears that the side next to the thames had been embanked to resist the fury of the floods from the   th of edward i several inquisitions were made to examine the state of the banks and ditches and the tenants who were found negligent were presented as delinquents dugdale on embanking     the church which stands far from the river was originally called ecclesia omnium sanctorum but was afterward styled that of st dunstan for the whole body of saints was obliged to give way to him who had the courage to take the devil himself by the nose lives of the saints  the church is by no means distinguished by its architecture in it were interred the remains of the illustrious sir thomas spert comptroller of the navy in the time of henry viii and to whom this kingdom was indebted for that salutary foundation the trinityhouse he died september  th       here also may be found that curious epitaph mentioned by the spectator here thomas saffin lies interred ah why born in new england did in london dye etc this vast parish is at present divided into eight others yet the mother parish still remains of great extent  the dock and ship yard the property of mr perry the greatest private dock in all europe is at the extremity of this parish at blackwall the upper part of the eastern side of the isle of dogs it may be called the eastern end of london being nearly a continued succession of six miles and a half of streets from hence to tyburn turnpike  the great extent of wapping wapping which stretches along the river side from st katherines arose from the opinion of the commissioners of sewers in      that nothing could secure the manor from the depredations of the water more effectually than the building of houses for they thought the tenants would not fail being attentive to the safety of their lives and property the plan succeeded and in our days we see a vast and populous town added to the ancient precincts which had stagnated for ages a long narrow street well paved and handsomely flagged on both sides winding along the banks of the thames as far as the end of limehouse an extent of near two miles and inhabited by multitudes of seafaring men alternate occupants of sea and land their floating tenements lie before them in fact the whole river from the bridge for a vast way is covered with a double forest of masts with a narrow avenue in midchannel these give importance and safety to the state and supply the mutual wants of the universe we send the necessaries and luxuries of our island to every part and in return receive every pabulum which should satiate the most luxurious wealth that ought to make avarice cry hold enough and matters for speculation for the laudable and delicate longings of the intellectual world  shadwell the hamlet of shadwell is a continuation of the buildings along the river between the houses and the water in all this long tract of street are frequent docks and small building yards the passenger is often surprised with the sight of the prow of a ship rising over the street and the hulls of new ones appearing at numbers of openings but all that filth and stench which stow complains of exists no longer execution dock stills remains at wapping and is in use as often as a melancholy occasion requires the criminals are to this day executed on a temporary gallows placed at low water mark but the custom of leaving the body to be overflowed by three tides has long since been omitted  radcliff the village of radcliff to which wapping now joins is of some antiquity from hence the gallant sir hugh willoughby on may the  0th      took his departure on his fatal voyage for discovering the northeast passage to china he sailed with great pomp by greenwich where the court then lay mutual honors were paid on both sides the council and courtiers appeared at the windows and the people covered the shores the young king alone lost the noble and novel sight for he then lay on his deathbed so that the principal object of the parade was disappointed hackluyt i       limehouse limehouse is a continuation of the town along the riverside it is a new creation and its church one of the fifty new churches was finished in      this may be called the end of london on the waterside but it is continued by means of poplar a chapelry in the parish of stepney anciently a regal manor so named from its abundance of poplar trees across the upper part of the isle of dogs in a strait line to the river lea the division of this county from essex  wapping shadwell and limehouse have their respective churches and poplar its chapel the two first have nothing to attract the eye limehouse has its awkward tower a dull square rising out of another embellished with pilasters heavy pinnacles rise out of the uppermost the whole proves how unhappily mr hawksmoor the architect of bloomsbury church exerted his genius in the obsolete art of steeplebuilding the church in question is one of the new fifty in the year    0 it was added to the bills of mortality  in our walk through limehouse we crossed the new cut or poplar canal near its discharge into the river this was begun about twenty years ago runs by bromley and joins the river lea near bow where barges enter by means of a lock called bowlock this canal is about a mile and a quarter in length and serves to bring to our capital corn malt and flour from the neighborhood of hertford and several other counties which put their productions on board the barges at that town it is also of great use to convey to the thames the produce of the great distilleries near bow and also to the internal counties coals and several articles from the metropolis this canal saves the great circuit of passing down to leamouth and thence round the isle of dogs a navigation often impeded by contrary winds and tides which frequently fall out so adverse as to occasion great delays yet this canal by no means annihilates the use of the river lea to and from its mouth but barges go indifferently either way as convenience or the circumstances abovementioned occur besides many barges will enter the river lea to save the navigation expenses of the new cut  limehouse dock is a little farther to the southeast and is much used  we finished our walk and dined at a small house called the folly on the waters edge almost opposite to the splendid hospital at greenwich where we sat for some hours enjoying the delicious view of the river and the moving picture of a succession of shipping perpetually passing and repassing  bills of mortality it is wonderful that in this great city there should have been no regular census but that we must depend on the account of the number of inhabitants from the uncertain calculation of the bills of mortality i will allow them to be delivered annually by the only censors we have the company of parishclerks with all possible accuracy as far as their knowledge extends but as it is admitted that a number of people find their burials in coemeteries without the bills equal nearly to those which are annually reported to be interred within their jurisdiction the uncertainty of the enumeration collected from them must be allowed in the last year       were buried within the bills if the above assertion mr richardson is well founded the sum must be       i refer the decision of the numbers of inhabitants to the skilful in calculation i have heard it averred that the present number is a million maitland gives the total in the time of his publication      to have been        maitland ii      this book is dedicated to slingsby bethel esquire who was lord mayor in that year  the increase of london since his days gives a probability that the enumeration is not much exaggerated  bills of mortality took rise in      in which began a great pestilence which continued till the   th of december      during this period they were kept in order to ascertain the number of persons who died but when the plague ceased the bills were discontinued they were resumed again in   0  at the original institution there were only a hundred and nine parishes others were gradually added and by the year      the number was a hundred and thirtytwo since that time fourteen more have been added so that the whole amounts to a hundred and fortysix viz

mortality i have printed that of      at the end of this book    among the multitudes who fall victims to disease is a melancholy account of the rural youth which crowd here in numbers laboring under the delusion of preferment some perish soon without even attaining a service and urged by want fall under the cognizance of justice others get admission into shops or into places where they experience hard work hard wages hard lodgings and scanty food they soon fall ill are neglected or flung into an hospital when passed all relief where they perish their native villages want their innocent labor and the whole rustic community i may say the whole kingdom suffers for the indiscrcet ambition of these unhappy youths or of their simple parents  radcliff highway we varied our road on our return by taking that of radcliff highway a broad and very long street ending in east smithfield on the north side stands another of the new fifty churches st georges middlesex square rises out of square to

respect to its situation it was founded by edward iii in      in the new churchyard of the holy trinity and filled with cistertians that churchyard was made by john corey clerk on occasion of the dreadful pestilence which raged in that reign so that there was not room in the common churchyards to inter the dead edward was moved to his piety by a fright he was seized with in a violent storm in

the year      by john churchman strypes stow ii book iv      one of the sheriffs of london but at that period and long after the customs were collected in different parts of the city and in a very irregular manner about the year      the loss to the revenue was first discovered and an act passed to compel people to land their goods in such places as were appointed by the commissioners of the revenue and this was the spot fixed on a customhouse was erected which being destroyed by the great fire was rebuilt by charles ii in      it underwent the same fate and was restored in its present form before the customhouse was established here the principal place for receiving the duties was at billingsgate customs in     as early as     or the reign of etheldred a small vessel was to pay ad

the year of its foundation is not settled the first mention of it is in the laws of ethelred which fix the tolls of vessels coming to billingsgate or ad pontem it could not be prior to the year     when unlaf the dane sailed up the river as high as stains saxon chron      without interruption nor yet after the year  0   in which ethelred died and the great canute king of denmark when he besieged london was impeded in his operations by a bridge which even at that time must have been strongly fortified to oblige him to have recourse to the following vast expedient  he caused a prodigious ditch to be cut on the south side of the thames at rotherhithe or redriff a little to the east of southwark which he continued at a distance from the south end of the bridge in form of a semicircle opening into the western part of the river through this he drew his ships and effectually completed the blockade of the city the same  but the valor of the citizens obliged him to raise the siege evidences of this great work were found in the place called the dock head at redriff where it began fascines of hazels and other brushwood fastened down with stakes were discovered in digging that dock in      and in other parts of its course have been met with in ditching large oaken planks and numbers of piles maitland i      when built the bridge originated from the public spirit of the college of priests of st mary overie before there had been a ferry left by her parents to their only daughter mary who out of the profits founded a nunnery and endowed it with the profits of the boat this house was afterward converted into the college of priests who not only built the bridge but kept it in repair but it must be understood that the first bridge was of timber first of timber the materials at hand and most probably rudely put together this account is given by stow from the report of bartholomew linsted alias foul last prior of st marie overie but was doubted because the work has been supposed to be too great and too disinterested for a college of priests who were to give up the certain profits of the ferry for those resulting precariously from an expensive undertaking even the existence of a religious house before the conquest has been suspected but the domesday book puts that out of doubt by informing us ipse episcopus habet unum monasterium in sudwerche numbers of useful as well as pious works in early days originated from the instigation of the churchmen who often had the honor of being called the founders when the work itself was performed by their devotees neither is it to be supposed that they could keep it in repair the same zeal which impelled people to contribute to the building operated in the vestiture of land for its future support and this appears to have been done by several instances yet the endowments were so small that a supplementary tax was often raised  in      the bridge was burnt down by the year      it grew so ruinous as to occasion its being rebuilt under the care of one peter curate of st mary colechurch a celebrated architect of those times it was soon after determined to build a bridge of stone and about the year      rebuilt in      with stone the same peter was employed again it proved a work of thirtythree years the architect died four years before it was completed and another clergyman isenbert master of the schools of xainctes was recommended to the citizens by king john for the honor of finishing it but they rejected their princes choice and committed the work to three merchants of london who completed it in   0  peter was buried in a beautiful chapel probably of his own construction dedicated to st thomas cp in one of the piere which stood on the east side in the ninth pier from the north end and had an entrance from the river as well as the street by a winding staircase it was beautifully paved with black and white marble and in the middle was a tomb supposed to contain the remains of peter the architect  this great work was founded on enormous piles driven as closely as possible together on their tops were laid long planks ten inches thick strongly bolted and on them were placed the base of the pier the lowermost stones of which were bedded in pitch to prevent the water from damaging the work round all were the piles which are called the sterlings designed for the preservation of the foundation piles these contracted the space between the piers so greatly as to occasion at the retreat of every tide a fall of five feet or a number of temporary cataracts which since the foundation of the bridge have occasioned the loss of many thousand lives the water at springtides rises to the height of about eighteen feet the length of this vast work is nine hundred and fifteen feet the exact breadth of the river the number of arches was nineteen of unequal dimensions and greatly deformed by the sterlings and the houses on each side which overhung and leaned in a most terrific manner in most places they hid the arches and nothing appeared but the rude piers i well remember the street on london bridge narrow darksome and dangerous to passengers from the multitude of carriages frequent arches of strong timber crossed the street from the tops of the houses to keep them together and from falling into the river nothing but use could preserve the rest of the inmates who soon grew deaf to the noise of the falling waters the clamors of watermen or the frequent shrieks of drowning wretches most of the houses were tenanted by pin or needle makers pinmakers and oeconomical ladies were wont to drive from the st jamess end of the town to make cheap purchases fuller tells us that spanish needles were made here first in cheapside by a negro who died without communicating the art elias crowse a german in the reign of elizabeth was more liberal and first taught the method to the english fullers definition of a needle is excellent quasi ne idle  in the bridge were three openings on each side with ballustrades to give passengers a sight of the water and shipping in one part had been a drawbridge useful either by way of defense drawbridge or for the admission of ships into the upper part of the river this was protected by a strong tower it served to repulse fauconbridge the bastard in his general assault on the city in      with a set of banditti under pretense of rescuing the unfortunate henry then confined in the tower sixty houses were burnt on the bridge on the occasion holinshed   0  it also served to check and in the end annihilate the illconducted insurrection of sir thomas wiat in the reign of queen mary the top of this tower in the sad and turbulent days of this kingdom used to be the shambles of human flesh and covered with heads or quarters of unfortunate partisans even so late as the year      hentzner the german traveller with german accuracy counted on it above thirty heads fugitive pieces vol ii      the old map of the city in      represents them in a most horrible cluster  at the south end of the bridge one peter corbis a dutchman stows survaie  london and its environs iv      in the year      invented an engine to force the water of the thames into leaden pipes to supply many of the adjacent parts of the city it has since that time been so greatly improved by the skill of the english mechanics as to become a most curious as well as useful piece of machinery and to be extremely worthy the attention of that branch of science  dreadful calamity by fire i must not quit the bridge without noticing an unparalleled calamity which happened on it within four years after it was finished a fire began on it at the southwark end multitudes of people rushed out of london to extinguish it while they were engaged in this charitable design the fire seized on the opposite end and hemmed in the crowd above three thousand persons perished in the flames or were drowned by overloading the vessels which were hardy enough to attempt their relief  a brave action the gallant action of edmund osborne ancestor to the duke of leeds when he was apprentice to sir william hewet clothworker must by no means be forgotten about the year      when his master lived in one of these tremendous houses a servantmaid was playing with his only daughter in her arms in a window over the water and accidentally dropped the child young osborne who was witness to the misfortune instantly sprung into the river and beyond all expectation brought her safe to the terrified family several persons of rank paid their addresses to her when she was marriageable among others the earl of shrewsbury but sir william gratefully decided in favor of osborne osborne says he saved her and osborne shall enjoy her stow ii book v      and collinss peerage i

was dreadful as it was premeditated he had a week before accepted from king william the office of secretary of war on the   th of april      he hired a boat on the thames and directed the waterman to shoot the bridge at that instant he flung himself into the torrent and having filled his pockets with stones to destroy all chance of safety rereshys memoirs      instantly sunk in the boat was found a note to this effect my folly in undertaking what i could not perform whereby some misfortunes have befallen the kings service is the cause of my putting myself to this sudden end i wish him success in all his undertakings and a better servant i hope his fathers reflection on the occasion was a parental apology not his real sentiments that a wise man might dispose of himself and make his life as short as he pleased how strongly did this great man militate against the precepts of christianity and the solid arguments of a most wise and pious heathen cicero in his somnium scipionis   church of st magnus very near to the northern end of the bridge is the church of st magnus it is probably a church of great antiquity yet the first mention is in      it was consumed in the great fire but

in the front of one is still preserved the memory of the sign the boars head cut in stone notwithstanding the house is gone we shall laugh at the humor of the jovial knight his hostess bardolph and

what lies within a line drawn from the north part of colemanstreet and just to the southwest of leaden hall and from thence to the tower its ravages were also extended without the walls to the west as far as fetterlane and the temple as it begun in puddinglane it ended in smithfield at pyecorner which might occasion the inscription with the figure of a boy on a house in the last place now almost erased which attributes the fire of london to the sin of gluttony i leave the reader to consult the second volume of the city remembrancer for the melancholy detail  sir christopher wren was coeval to this misfortune the plans his great genius offered to the public for rebuilding the city with genuine taste and a splendour worthy of ancient rome were unfortunately rejected perhaps the times are not greatly to be blamed there were a thousand difficulties in respect to the division of property there was in a vast commercial city such as london a hurry to resume their former occupations and a prejudice for ancient sites it was difficult to persuade people to relinquish for a mere work of taste a spot productive of thousands to them or their predecessors these things considered it is not to be wondered that we are left to admire on paper only the vast designs of our great architect but still he was the restorer of several of our public buildings many of our temples arose with improved beauty from his plans and several other buildings which we have had or shall have occasion of mentioning  the monument that astonishing proof of his genius the monument is placed on the side of fishstreet very near to the spot where the calamity began where londons column pointing at the skies like a tall bully lifts its head and lies it is a doric column two hundred and two feet high fluted and finished with a trifling urn with flames instead of a noble statue of the reigning king as the great architect proposed on the west side of the pedestal is a bas relief cut by gabriel cibber in admirable taste it represents emblematically this sad catastrophe charles is seen surrounded with liberty genius and science giving directions for the restoring of the city here the sculptor found luckily one example to compliment the attention of the thoughtless monarch toward the good of his subjects for during the horrors of the conflagration and after it was subdued his endeavors to stop the evil and to remedy the effect were truly indefatigable the king was seriously affected by this calamity and many emotions of piety and devotion were excited in him there was for a short time great reason to expect the fruits of this his brief return to heaven but they were quickly blasted by the uncommon wickedness of the people about him who by every profane witticism on the recent calamity and even by suggesting that it was the blessing of god to humble this rebellious city and to prepare it for his yoke soon removed every good thought from the royal breast continuation of lord glarendons life      this noble column was begun in      and finished in      at the expense of l    00 a melancholy period of party rage and the inscription was permitted the damage sustained by the cruel element was computed at ten millions seven hundred and sixteen thousand pounds but providence mingling mercy with justice suffered only the lost of a very few lives  great as this calamity was yet it proved the providential cause of putting a stop to one of a far more tremendous nature the plague which for a series of ages had with very short intervals visited our capital in its most dreadful forms never appeared there again after the rebuilding of the city in a more open and airy manner which removed several nusanoes which if not the actual origin of a plague was assuredly one great pabulum when it had seized our streets the last was in the year      when in about six months by the smallest computation a hundred and threescore thousand people fell by the destroying angel  almost opposite to the place where the monument now stands was a large stone house the habitation of edward our famous black prince the flower of english chivalry in stows time it was altered to a

destruction of the old hall by the great fire it faces the river and commands a fine view of the water and the bridge in the courtroom are several pictures of the various sorts of vendible fishes a printed catalogue of the species and varieties with their seasons was presented to me when i visited the place at this and every other hall i met with the utmost urbanity as an humble historian of the

inns warwickinn w palace of the great kingmaker and many others had the same addition in feudal days the town had no pleasures to attract the great they seldom came there but to support a cause as now

of wheat rye and other grain cables masts tar flax hemp linen cloth wainscot wax steel and other merchandise imported by the easterlings or germans here was the guildhalda teutonicorum or guildhall of

article but from staelhoff contracted from stapelhoff or the general house of trade of the german nation the powerful league of the hanse towns and the profits we made of their trade for they were for

keep in repair the gate called bishopsgate in      they were called on to perform their duty the gate being at that time in a ruinous state they refused but being compelled by law gerard marbod their alderman advanced the necessary sum in      it was even rebuilt in a most magnificent manner by the merchants of the steelyard as they decreased in strength and we grew more powerful and more politic we began to abridge their privileges we found that this potent company by their weight interfered with the interest of the natives and damped their spirit of trade after several revocations and renewals of the charter the house in      was shut up by our wise and patriotic queen and the german inhabitants expelled the kingdom  at this time it is the great repository of the imported iron

supposed to have given it the name of dwr or dwy water and the saxons added the word gate which signifies way it became a noted wharf and was called the port of downgate in the time of henry iii and

whosoever that were willing to play at dice and hazard in like manner the lady margaret his wife did also keep her chamber to the same intent the king of cipres playing with henry picard in his hall did win of him fifty marks but henry being very skillful in that art altering his hand did after win of the same king the same fifty marks and fifty marks more which when the same king began to take in ill part although he dissembled the same henry said unto him my lord and king be not agreeued i court not your gold but your play for i have not bidd you hither that i might grieve but that amongst other things i might your play and gave him his money again plentifully bestowing of his own amongst the retinue besides he gave many rich gifts to the king and other nobles and knights which dined

selected as patron of the company i know not except they imagined that the saint actuated by good wine had been inspired with good thoughts which according to the argument of james howel producing good works brought a man to heaven and to show the moral in a contrary effect here is a picture of lot and his incestuous daughters exemplifying the danger of the abuse of the best things  this hall was built on ground given by sir john stodie vintner lord mayor in      it was called the manor of the vintre the vintners or vintonners were incorporated in the reign of edward iii they were originally divided into vinetarii et tabernarii vintners who imported the wine and taverners who kept taverns and retailed it for the former the company flourished so much that from its institution till the year      it produced not fewer than fourteen lord mayors many of which were the keepers of taverns yet in the time of edward iii the gascoigne wines were not sold at the rate of above   d a gallon nor the rhenish above   d in      red wine was   d a gallon and a little after the price of a tun l   as late as the year      the gunne and gascoigne wines were sold at   d a gallon and no

duke marquess earl viscount or baron of the realm should keep in his house any vessel of wine for his family use exceeding ten gallons under penalty of ten pounds  our great wine trade was at first with bourdeaux and the neighboring provinces it commenced as early as the conquest perhaps sooner cambden i      but it became very considerable in the reign of henry ii by reason of his marriage with elianor daughter of the duke of aquitaine our conquest of that and other great wineprovinces of france increased the trade to a high degree and made great fortunes among the adventurers of this

street of the same name a little beyond this church must not pass unnoticed it was supposed to have been founded by henry i and according to stow it was the residence of king stephen whether it was destroyed by any accident does not appear but in the reign of edward i it was no more than a simple tenement held by one simon beawmes in that of edward iii it acquired the title of royal and the inn royal as having been the residence of the king under that name he bestowed it on the college of st stephen westminster but it reverted to the crown and in the time of richard ii was called the queens

or other altars and now and then a portrait witness that of richard ii and the portraits of the great john talbot and his wife preserved at castle ashby journey to london  in the year      they found that plaisterers and all sorts of unskilful persons intermeddled in their business and brought their art into disrepute by the badness and slightness of their work they determined as the surgeons in later days to keep their mystery pure from all pretenders they were incorporated in      had their master warden and common seal george gower was queen elizabeths sergeant painter strypes stow ii book v p      but as i do not find his name in mr walpoles anecdotes i suspect his art was confined to the humbler part this corporation extended only to such artists who practiced within the city as art is unconfined numbers arose in different parts and settled in westminster the seat of the court they for a long time remained totally unconnected even with each other about the year      they solicited and received the royal patronage and were incorporated under the title of master wardens and commonalty of painterstainers the majority are independent of any other body corporate but several among them are regular freemen of the city under the ancient company  the next remarkable place is baynard castle baynard castle one of the two castles built on the west end of the town with walls and ramparts mentioned by fitzstephens it took its name from its founder a nobleman and follower of the conqueror and who died in the reign of william rufus it was forfeited to the crown in

fitzwalter in time of peace and to his heirs in the city of land in the time of peace are these that is to say the said robert has a soken or ward in the city that is a wall of the canonrie of saint paul as a man goes down the street before the brewhouse of saint paul unto the thames and so to the side of the mill which is in the water that comes down from the fleetbridge and goes so by london walls betwixt the friars preachers and ludgate and so returns back by the house of the said friars unto the said wall of the said canonrie of saint paul that is all the parish of saint andrew which is

to feed annually thirty thousand men but baynard castle was the scene of a still more important action in    0 the youthful edward assumed the name and dignity of king confirmed by a number of persons of rank assembled in this place after it had been conferred on him by a mixed and tumultuary multitude  the usurper richard in the very same castle took on him the title of king here he was waited on

scene cut of this part of our history richard iii act iii sc vii  his successor repaired or perhaps rebuilt baynard castle and as if foreseeing a long series of peaceful years changed its form into that of a palace for quiet times according to the view i have seen it included a square court with an octagonal tower in the center and two in the front between which were several square projections

that in the year      a considerable sum of money had been subscribed by the fellows for the erection of a new college the old one having been consumed in the great fire eight years before it also appears that sir john cutler a near relation of doctor whistler the president was desirous of becoming a benefactor a committee was appointed to wait upon sir john to thank him for his kind intentions he accepted their thanks renewed his promise and specified the part of the building of which he intended to bear the expense in the year    0 statues in honor of the king and sir john were voted by the college and nine years afterward the college being then completed it was resolved to borrow money of sir john cutler to discharge the college debt but the sum is not specified it appears however that in      sir johns executors made a demand on the college of l  000 which sum was supposed to include the money actually lent the money pretended to be given but set down as a debt in sir johns books and the interest on both lord radnor however and mr boulter sir john cutlers executors were prevaled on to accept l  000 from the college and actually remitted the other five so that sir johns promise which he never performed obtained him the statue and the liberality of his executors has kept it in its place ever since but the college wisely have obliterated the inscription which in the

restorer sir christopher wren his opinion that there had been a church on this spot built by the christians in the time of the romans was confirmed when he searched for the foundations for his own design he met with those of the original presbyterium or semicircular chancel of the old church they consisted only of kentish rubblestone artfully worked and consolidated with exceeding hard mortar in the roman manner much excelling the superstructure parentalia      he explodes the notion of there having been here a temple of diana and the discovery of the horns of animals used in the

destroyed by fire in  0   this church was burnt the bishop mauritius began to rebuild it and laid the foundations which remained till its second destruction from the same cause in the last century notwithstanding mauritius lived twenty years after he had begun this pious work and bishop beauvages enjoyed the sea twenty more yet such was the grandeur of the design that it remained unfinished the first had the ruins of the palatine tower bestowed on him as materials for the building and henry i bestowed on beauvages part of the ditch belonging to the tower which with purchases made by himself enabled him to enclose the whole with a wall the same monarch granted besides that every ship which brought stone for the church should be exempted from toll he gave him also all the great fish taken in his precincts except the tongues and lastly he secured to him and his successor the delicious tithes of all his venison in the county of essex  the steeple was finished in      the noble

horsey and his accomplices the bishop fitzjames defended them the king interfered and ordered the murderers to make restitution to the children of the deceased to the amount of fifteen hundred pounds

head fixed on a pole borne before the cross in the procession until they issued out of the west door where the keeper that brought it blowed the death of the bucke and then the horners that were about

mysteries the boys of st pauls were famous for acting of the mysteries or holy plays and even regular dramas they often had the honor of performing before our monarchs their preparations were

iii and his queen lodged here i think on occasion of their nuptials there was goodly daunsyng in the queens lodging in presence of the king and his uncles and other barons of england and ladies and damoyselles till it was day which was time for every person to draw to their lodgings except the king and queen who lay there in the byshoppes palayce for there theye lay all the feasts and justes

pauls cross before this cathedral was the famous pauls cross a pulpit formed of wood mounted upon steps of stone and covered with lead in which the most eminent divines were appointed to preach every sunday in the forenoon to this place the court the mayor and aldermen and principal citizens used to resort the greatest part of the congregation sat in the open air the king and his train had covered galleries and the better sort of people if i may judge from the old prints were also protected from the injury of the weather but the far greater part stood exposed in the open air for which reason the preacher went in very bad weather the shrowds to a place called the shrowds a covered space on the side of the church to protect the congregation in inclement seasons considerable contributions were raised among the nobility and citizens to support such preachers as were as was often the case called to town from either of the universities in particular the lord mayor and aldermen ordered that every preacher who came from a distance should be freely accommodated during five days with sweet and convenient lodgings fire candle and all necessaries and notice was given by the bishop of london to the preacher appointed by him of the place he was to repair to  the origin of the custom of preaching at crosses was probably accidental the sanctity of this species of pillar often caused a great resort of people to pay their devotion to the great object of their erection a preacher seeing a large concourse might be seized by a sudden impulse ascend the steps and deliver out his pious advice from a station so fit to inspire attention and so conveniently formed for the purpose the example might be followed till the practice became established by custom  it certainly at first was a common cross and coeval with the church when it was first covered and converted into a pulpitcross we are not informed we are given to understand that it was overthrown by an earthquake in      and that william courtney then archbishop of canterbury collected great sums for the rebuilding which says dean nowel in a sermon he preached at this cross he applied to his own use courtney was a most munificent prelate and not likely to abuse the charity of his flock yet it was not rebuilt till the time of thomas kemp elected bishop of london in      who finished it in the form says godwin in which we see it at present praesul angl      godwin published his book in       and so it stood till it was demolished in      by order of parliament executed by the willing hands of isaac pennington the fanatical lord mayor of that year who died in the tower a convicted regicide  we hear of this being in use as early as the year      it was used not only for the instruction of mankind by the doctrine of the preacher but for every purpose political or ecclesiastical for giving force to oaths for promulging of laws or rather the royal pleasure for the emission of papal bulls for anathematizing sinners for benedictions for exposing of penitents under censure of the church for recantations for the private ends of the ambitious and for the defaming of those who had incurred the displeasure of crowned heads  in      henry iii commanded the lord mayor to swear before the aldermen every person of twelve years and upwards to be true to him and his heirs  in      the same monarch

kirtle only yet went she so fair and lovelie namely while the woondering of the people cast a comely rud in her cheeks of which she before had most miss that her great shame wan her much praise among those that were more amorous of her body than curious of her soul and many good folks that hated her living and glad were to see sin corrected yet pitied they more her penance than rejoised therein when they considered that the protector procured it more of a corrupt intent than any virtuous affection holinshed       row has flung this part of her sad story into the following poetical dress but it is far from depreciating the moving simplicity of the old historian  submissive sad and lowly was her look a burning taper in her hand she bore and on her shoulders carelessly confused with loose neglect her lovely tresses hung upon her cheek a faintish flush was spread feeble she seemed and sorely smit with pain while barefoot as she trod the flinty pavement her footsteps all along were marked with blood yet silent still she passed and unrepining her streaming eyes bent ever on the earth except when in some bitter pang of sorrow to heaven she seemed in fervent zeal to raise and beg that mercy man denied her here the poet has adopted the fable of her being denied all sustenance and of her perishing with hunger but that was not fact she lived to a great age but in great distress and miserable poverty deserted even by those to whom she had during prosperity done the most essential services she dragged a wretched life even to the time of sir thomas more who introduces her story into his life of edward v the beauty of her person is spoken of in high terms proper she was and fair nothing in her body that you would have changed but you would have wished her somewhat higher thus

pinke an augustine both says stow doctors of divinity both great preachers both of more learning than virtue as his engines they addressed the people and inferred the bastardy of his brothers children and enlarged on the great qualities of their ambitious employers but pinke lost his voice in the middle of his sermon and was forced to descend and shaw was afterward struck with such remorse finding himself despised by all the world that he soon after died of a broken heart see fabian     holinshed     stows annals       royal contracts of marriage were notified to the people from this place thus

london to send up to pauls cross from sunday to sunday preachers to preach down the popes authority to show to the people that he was no more than the simple bishop of rome and that his usurpations were only the effect of the negligence of the princes of this realm weevers funeral monuments        and thus his holinesss bulls were fairly baited out of the kingdom by his own dogs  penitence of henry viii from this pulpit was proclaimed to the people by henry holbetch bishop of rochester the deathbed remorse of the same tyrant who finding the stroke inevitable he ordered the church of the gray friars which he had converted into a storehouse to be cleared of the goods and opened for divine service and presented by patent to the city for the relieving of the poor stowes urvaie       recantations many are the examples of persons bearing the faggot and of making public recantation of their faith of both religions at this place the reformers bore that badge as a mark of their escape

the faggot here on a singular occasion for singing mass with good ale to this place henry gray duke of suffolk sent his chaplain harding to dissuade the people from revolting from their allegiance to queen mary foxs martyrs  yet actuated by weakness and ambition concurred in setting up his unhappy daughter jane gray in opposition to his rightful sovereign  we are told in strypes memorials iii    that queen mary made use of the same arts in the same place and appointed several of her best divines to preach the old religion and her design of restoring the ancient worship but so averse were the people that the attempt was attended with great tumults these she allayed by the temporary expedients of fire and faggot  the reign of queen elizabeth was wisely ushered in by the appointment of good and able men to preach from this cross the doctrine of the reformation and rejection of the papal power strypes annals i      the reformation preached from hence in which politics were naturally

husband philip of spain over the french and of the succeeding capture of st quintin before which that monarch the only time in his life appeared clad in armor  in      levies incited while the lord mayor and aldermen were attending a sermon at this place they received an order from the queen to levy a thousand ablebodied men they quitted their devotions and performed their commission before eight at night and had them ready armed for their march before morning the service they were designed for was to assist the french in raising the siege of calais then besieged by the spaniards but the place being taken by the time they reached dover they returned to the city after a weeks absence from the usual policy of elizabeth it is possible the sermon and order were both preconcerted the moment of devotion being the aptest to inspire zeal and promote an enthusiastic ardor in the people to fly to a standard raised against a nation so detested and so inimical to our religion and liberties as the spaniards  james i hears a sermon at the cross the last sermon which was preached at this place was before james i who came in great state on horseback from whitehall on midlent sunday    0 he was received at temple bar by the lord mayor and aldermen who presented him with a purse of gold at st pauls he was received by the clergy in their richest vestments divine service was performed attended with organs cornets and sagbots after which his majesty went to a prepared place and heard a sermon at the cross preached by john king bishop of london the object of the sermon was

maitlands london  strypes edition of stow etc  sir christopher made a model in wood of his first conception for rebuilding this church in the roman style he had in it an eye to the loss of the pulpitcross and had supplied its place by a magnificent auditory within for the reception of a large congregation this was approved by men of excellent judgment but laid aside under the notion it had not sufficiently a templelike form a second was made selected out of various sketches he had drawn on this design sir christopher set a high value but this also was rejected parentalia      the third which produced the present noble pile was approved and executed a singular accident happened at the beginning while the great architect was setting out the dimensions of the dome he ordered a common laborer to bring him a flat stone to be laid as a direction to the masons he brought a fragment of a gravestone on which was the word resurgam this was not lost on sir christopher he caught the idea of the phoenix which he placed on the south portico with that word cut beneath  the first stone was laid on june         and the building was completed by him in    0 the same      but the whole decorations were not finished till      maitland ii  it was a most singular circumstance that notwithstanding it was thirtyfive years in building it was begun and finished by one architect and under

not as often mistaken built after the model of that famous temple it is the entire conception of our great countryman and has been preferred in some respects by a judicious writer to even the roman basilica its dimensions are less the comparative view is given in the parentalia and copied in london and its environs  i will only mention the great outlines  the height of st peters to the top of the cross is four hundred and thirtyseven feet and a half that of st pauls three hundred and forty feet so that from its situation it is lofty enough to be seen from the sea the length of the first is seven hundred and twentynine feet of the latter five hundred the greatest breadth of st peters is three hundred and sixtyfour of st pauls one hundred and eighty  in the reigns of james i and charles i the body of this cathedral was the common resort of the politicians the newsmongers and idle in general it was called pauls walk and the frequenters known by the name of pauls walkers it is mentioned

content to shine like other monarchs of the stuart line in digging the foundation for the rebuilding of this cathedral it was discovered beneath the graves mentioned at p   that the foundation of the old church rested on a layer of hard and close pot earth curiosity led sir christopher wren to search farther he found that on the north side it was six feet thick that it grew thinner toward the south and on the decline of the hill was scarcely four on advancing farther he met with nothing but loose sand at length he came to water and sand mixed with periwinkles and other seashells and by boring came at last to the beach and under that the natural hard clay which evinced that the sea had once occupied the space on which st pauls now stands this sand had been one of those sandhills frequent on many coasts not only on those of holland and flanders but on our own it was the opinion of our great architect that all the space between camberwell hill and the hills of essex had been a

they did not seem to like trusting henry iv on his bond so took the customs in pawn for their loan  the business of goldsmiths was confined to the buying and selling of plate and foreign coins of gold and silver melting them and coining others at the mint the banking was accidental and foreign to their institution  regular banking by private people resulted in      from the calamity of the time

of the state many lives were lost on the occasion at st pauls hubert the great justiciary summoned long beard to appear before him but found him so well supported that he thought it prudent to forbear punishment this served but to increase his insolence he grew so outrageous that the citizens were resolved to bring him to justice a resolute band made the attempt when he and a few desperate fellows fled to the tower of bow steeple which they fortified the besiegers seeing the mob assemble from all parts to his rescue made a fire at the bottom which forced him and his companions to sally out but they were taken and the next day he and eight more were dragged by their heels to the elms at smithfield and there hanged it was said that finding himself deserted by heaven he at the gallows forsook marys son as he called our savior and called upon the devil to help and deliver him yet notwithstanding this a cunning priest a relation of his stole his body and pretended many miracles were wrought

entry it was new gilt for the magnificent processions took this road after the reformation the images gave much offense the goddess diana was substituted instead of the virgin after the symbols of superstition had been frequently mutilated queen elizabeth disapproved of those attacks on the remnants of the old religion and offered a large reward for the discovery of the offenders she thought

our religion that a certain number of ecclesiastics in hurry to take possession of the vacant sees assembled here where they were to undergo the ceremony from anthony kitchen alias dustan bishop of llandaff a sort of occasional conformist who had taken the oaths of supremacy to elizabeth bonner bishop of london then confined in the tower hearing of it sent his chaplain to kitchen threatening him with excommunication in case he proceeded on this the prelate refused to perform the ceremony on which say the catholics parker and the other candidates rather than defer possession of their dioceses determined to consecrate one another which says the story they did without any sort of scruple and icorey began with parker who instantly rose archbishop of canterbury the refutation of this tale may

three days a scaffold was erected for queen philippa and her gay troop of ladies all most richly attired to behold the knights collected from all quarters to show their skill in deeds of arms the upper part of the scaffold on which the ladies were seated brake in sunder and as stow says whereby they were with some shame forced to fall down and many knights and others which stood beneath much hurt the carpenters were saved from punishment by the intercession of the queen but to prevent such accidents in future the king ordered a building of stone to be erected near the church of st mary le

sums raised for pardons of offenses and by fines its gothic front terminates the end of king street its length is a hundred and fiftythree feet its breadth fortyeight its height fiftyfive so that it is capable of holding thousands of people elections and every species of city business is transacted here  within are portraits of numbers of our judges who frequently try causes under this roof i must direct the readers attention to twelve of that order of peculiar merit these are the portraits of the able and virtuous sir matthew hale and his eleven cotemporary judges who after the dreadful calamity of     regulated the rebuilding of the city of london by such wise rules as to prevent the endless train of vexatious lawsuits which might ensue and been little less chargeable than the fire itself had been this was principally owing to sir matthew hale who conducted the business and sat with his brethren in cliffords inn to compose all differences between landlord and tenant these portraits were painted by michael wright a good painter in the time of charles ii and james ii and who died in the year   00 it was designed that sir peter lely should draw these pictures but he fastidiously refused to wait on the judges at their chambers wright received sixty pounds apiece for his work anecdotes of painting iii  0  in the year      they were found to be in so bad a condition

so that they may remain another century a proof of the gratitude of our capital these were proofs of a sense of real merit but in how many places do we meet instances of a temporary idolatry the

and bloodybones to the good folks at st jamess which while remonstrances were in fashion annually haunted the court in terrific forms the eloquence dashed in the face of majesty alas proved in vain the spectre was there condemned to silence but his patriotism may be read by his admiring fellowcitizens as long as the melancholy marble can retain the tale of the affrighted times  great feasts the first time that this hall was used on festive occasions was by sir john shaw goldsmith knighted in the field of bosworth after building the essentials of good kitchens and other offices in the year   00 he gave here the mayors feast which before had usually been done in grocershall none of their bills of fare have reached me but doubtlessly they were very magnificent they at length grew to such excess that in the time of philip and mary a sumptuary law was made to restrain the expense both of provisions and liveries but i suspect as it lessened the honor of the city it was not long observed for in      the city thought proper to renew the order of council by way of reminding their fellowcitizens of their relapse into luxury among the great feasts given here on public occasions may be reckoned that given in      on occasion of the unhappy marriage of the prince palatine with elizabeth daughter of james i who in defiance of the remonstrances of his betterjudging fatherinlaw rushed on the usurpation of the dominion of another monarch and brought great misery on himself and his amiable spouse the next was in      when charles i returned from his imprudent inefficacious journey into scotland in the midst of the most factious and turbulent times when every engine was set to work to annihilate the regal power the city under its lord mayor sir william acton made a feast unparalleled in history for its magnificence all external respect was paid to his majesty the last he ever experienced in the inflamed city of the entertainment we know no more than that it consisted

which you perhaps think mad yet numbers feel the want of what he had   this company follows the mercers they were originally called pepperers from their dealing so greatly in pepper but in      they were incorporated by the name of grocers either because they fold things by or dealt in grossi or figs survaie     but from the beginning they trafficked in all the good things which the trade does to this day  i forgot bucklesbury bucklesbury a street which opens on the south side of cheapside a little to the west of the grocers hall it took its name from one buckle who had in it a large manourhouse of stone this man lost his life in a strange way near his house stood an old tower built by edward i called the cornets tower possibly a watch tower from the summit of which signals might have been given by the blowing of a horn this buckle intended to pull down and to have built a handsome house of wood or according to the expression of the times a goodly frame of timber but in greedily demolishing this tower a stone fell on him and crushed him to death and another who married his widow set up the newprepared frame of timber and finished the work this street in stows time

is relieved amply by another building behind it st stephens walbrook a small church the chef daeuvre of sir christopher wren of most exquisite beauty perhaps italy itself says a judicious writer can produce no modern building that can vie with this in taste and proportion there is not a beauty which the plan would admit of that is not to be found here in the greatest perfection and foreigners

take the middle way  the royal exchange that concourse of all the nations of the world arises before us with the full majesty of commerce royal exchange whether we consider the grandeur of the edifice or the vast concerns carried on within its walls we are equally struck with its importance but we are more astonished when we find that this expensive princely pile was the effect of the munificence of a private citizen sir thomas gresham let the pride of my country not be suppressed when i have opportunity of saying that the original hint was given to him by a welshman by richard clough afterward knighted originally his servant and in the year      by his merit and industry advanced by sir thomas to be his correspondent and agent in the then emporium of the world antwerp clough wrote to his master to blame the city of london for neglecting so necessary a thing bluntly telling that they studied nothing else but their own private profit that they were content to walk about in the rain more like pedlars than merchants and that there was no kind of people but had their place to transact business in in other countries thus stimulated sir thomas purchased some tenements on the site of the royal exchange and on june        laid the foundation and in november      completed what was then called the bourse in    0 queen elizabeth went in great state from her palace at somerset house to make sir thomas a visit at his own house after dinner she went to the bourse visited every part and then by sound of trumpet dignified it with the title of the royal exchange all the upper part was filled then and even to this century with shops on this occasion they were filled with the richest productions of the universe to show her majesty the prosperity of the commercial parts of her dominions i cannot learn what the expense of this noble design was only that the annual product of the rents to his widow was l       s i am equally unacquainted with the form of the original building which perished in the great fire it was rebuilt in its present magnificent form by the city and the company of mercers strypes stow i book ii p      at the expense of eighty thousand pounds

merchants on the occasion the following inscription does grateful honor to the original founder hoc greshamii peristyllium gentium commercium sacrum flammis extinctum      augustius e cinere resurrexit      wll turnero milite praetore   the statue of sir thomas gresham is in one corner in the dress of the times another of that worthy citizen sir john barnard graces another part the rest are kings which as far as king charles with that of sir thomas were chiefly executed by gabriel cibber that of charles ii in the center by gibbons anecdotes of painting iii      and above stairs are the statues of charles i and ii and another of the illustrious founder by john buchnell an artist of inferior merit in the reign of william iii on the top of the tower in front of the exchange is a grasshopper the crest of sir thomas gresham the allusion to that and the dragon on bow steeple makes a line in that inexcusable performance of dean swifts a profane imitation of the style of the bible wonderful prophecy etc  which dullness itself could execute and which nothing but the most indefensible wantonness could have produced from a person of his profession and of his allacknowleged wit  i must direct the readers attention to the beautiful gothic tower of st michaels on the south side of cornhill at each corner is an angulated turret as high as the belfry where they become fluted and the capital ornamented with sculptures of heman faces from them they spire into very elegant pinnacles the body of this church was burnt in the great fire it was begun to be built in      stows survaie i      but the church was of far greater antiquity it appears to have existed in      this church had its pulpitcross like that of st pauls built by sir john rudstone mayor in      who was interred in a vault beneath in      it may be added that robert fabian alderman the celebrated historian was buried in this church in      after passing the dignity of sheriff  the king had a royal

the uses of a foundation for a warden six secular priests six clerks and two choristers and besides three schoolmasters for this purpose he left three thousand marks to the drapers company to fulfill

artillery and other arms of the city preparations for any triumph or pageantry in the city were made here from its strength it was considered as the chief fortress within the city in case of popular tumults and also as the place from which doles largesses or pious alms were to be distributed here in      while henry viii lay putrefying in state heath bishop of winchester his almoner and others his ministers distributed great sums of money during twelve days to the poor of the city the same was done at westminster strypes stow i book ii p       but i greatly fear his majesty was past ransom the market here was of great antiquity considerable as it is at present it is far inferior to what it has been by reason of the numbers of other markets which have been established still it is the wonder of foreigners who do not duly consider the carnivorous nation to which it belongs  the slaughter made of the horned cattle for the support of the metropolis is evinced by the multitudes of

much acrimony and much profane humor in his canterburys doom book ii p       as first when the bishop approached near the communion table he bowed with his nose very near the ground some six or seven times then he came to one of the corners of the table and there bowed himself three times then to the second third and fourth corners bowing at each corner three times but when he came to the side of the table where the bread and wine was he bowed himself seven times and then after the reading many prayers by himself and his two fat chaplins which were with him and all this while were upon their knees by him in their sirplisses hoods and tippits he himself came near the bread which was cut and laid in a fine napkin and then he gently lifted up one of the corners of the said napkin and peeping into it till he saw the bread like a boy that peeped into a birds nest in a bush and presently clapped it down again and flew back a step or two and then bowed very low three times toward it and the table when he beheld the bread then he came near and opened the napkin again and bowed as before then he laid his hand upon the gilt cup which was full of wine with a cover upon it so soon as he had pulled the cupp a little nearer to him he let the cupp go flew back and bowed again three times toward it then he came near again and lifting up the cover of the cupp peeped into it and seeing the wine he let fall the cover on it again and flew nimbly back and bowed as before after these and many other apish anticke gestures he himself received and then gave the sacrament to some principal men

the church of st augustine papey belonged to this fraternity these priests the brotherhood of threescore priests of leaden hall and the company of parish clerks who were skilled in singing diriges and funeral office were accustomed to attend the solemn burials of the rich or great these are frequently represented on the sides of ancient tombs and were called pleureurs weepers and mourners this house became after the suppression the habitation of sir francis walsingham  in winchesterstreet stood also a great house called the spanish ambassadors which was occupied by sir james houblon knight and alderman and at the same period it was the residence of several of our most eminent merchants  sir thomas greshams house to the east side of the same street stood the house of our first of merchants sir thomas gresham originally built with brick and timber and fronting to bishopsgatestreet by his will he appointed four lecturers in divinity astronomy music and geometry and three readers in civil law physic and rhetoric each with a salary of fifty pounds a year payable out of the rent issuing out of the royal exchange this house was the place where the professors had their apartments and where the lectures were to be read which were begun in      but they are now quite deserted this arose in a great degree from the institution of the royal society the meetings of which were for a considerable time held here  the origin of that respectable body was from the meeting of a few illustrious persons at the lodgings of doctor wilkins origin of the royal society afterward bishop of chester and others worthy of record doctor seth ward afterward bishop of salisbury mr boil sir william petty and the doctors wallis goddard willis and bathurst sir christopher wren and a few more in      they assembled in gresham college by permission of the professors of the foundation of sir thomas gresham and on the restoration were incorporated by royal charter a most instructive and wellfounded museum was established here in      by henry colwall its museum consisting of natural and artificial curiosities collected with great expense and judgment the society had a benefit never known at any other time the assistance of the great mr boil the most accomplished most learned and most religious virtuoso who pointed out the proper objects of their collection and gave them the most finished instructions these were collected and published in      this little book is a most necessary companion for all travelers and voyagers for procuring them from every quarter of the globe at that period there were in both the indies persons capable of understanding and pursuing with success the plan laid down for them at home it was the good fortune of the museum to have coexistent with its formation a philosopher for its curator fully qualified to describe its various articles doctor nehemiah grew not only performed that part but illustrated every one in cases where the subject admitted with the most learned and pertinent remarks he published his museum regalis societatis in      and dedicated it to the founder mr colwall at the expense of whom the plates were engraven it is a work equal to the museum wormianum and any other admired foreign performance of that age its defects arise only from the want of system the misfortune of the time for our ray had not then cleared the rich ore of natural history from the surrounding rubbish about the year      the society removed from hence to cranecourt in fleet street for numbers of years the museum was neglected my respected friend the honorable daines barrington with most disinterested zeal undertook the restoring it as far as the ravages of time would permit this he did in the most effectual manner and enriched it with a number of new specimens especially from our late colonies it being his design to have formed it into a repository of every thing relative to the natural history of great britain and its dependencies a most noble plan and worthy of being carried into full execution by singular chance gresham college escaped the flames in      but i believe very little of the original house remains it having been

 created in france by edward iii knightbanneret with allowance out of the customs of hull for the support of his dignity vincents discovery etc  00  he was a great merchant and being very opulent used to supply the kings pecuniary wants he was at the same time the kings merchant an office that gave him the lucrative privilege of supplying his master with different sorts of merchandise and also with money the office seems to have been continued to later days under another name henry viii had his kings factor and sir thomas gresham bore the title of the queens richard williams elder brother a merchant at hull had the same employ under edward iii who calls him dilectus mercator ricardus de la pole pincerna noster the same   from william sprung a numerous race of nobility distinguished by their ambition and unfortunate ends his son michael was created earl of suffolk yet continued in his office of kings merchant and lived in his fathers house stows survaie      he at length became lord high chancellor but being accused of embezzling the public money and diverse other crimes was banished the kingdom and died at paris in      of a broken heart his son michael was restored and died of a flux at the siege of harfleur in sept      and in the very following month his son and successor another michael fell in the battle of agincourt his brother william succeeded and was afterward created marquis and then duke of suffolk he was the favorite of the spirited margaret of anjou he was of distinguished abilities but by his insolence enraged the nobility so greatly that on an accusation of his being the cause of the loss of france they banished him the kingdom on his passage to calais he was seized by a vessel sent expressly to intercept him and was brought into dover beheaded by the captain of the ship in the cockboat without ceremony and his body flung upon the sands where it was found by his chaplain and buried at wingfield in suffolk the nobility dreaded his return therefore took this method to free themselves from so formidable an enemy see the curious particulars in sir john fenns i       truly stated see also shakespeares henry vi part ii act iv scene

reign was in      executed for treason but his chief crime with that tyrant seems his relation to the house of york his mother being sister to edward iv the venerable margaret countess of salisbury was barbarously brought to the block for the same reason her son cardinal pole would not have been spared could henry have got him into his power henry pole lord montacute suffered for corresponding with him and thus ended this illfated race  denmarkhouse in fenchurchstreet a continuation of the former stood denmarkhouse in it was lodged the ambassador sent in      as holinshed expresses it from the emperor of cathaie muscovia and russeland this was in consequence of the new discovery of the white sea by chancellor for till that time russia was quite impervious by any other way the merchants were well acquainted with the importance of the new commerce they met him at tottenham with all the splendour that was likely to make an impression on the mind of a barbarian they were dressed in velvet coats and rich chains of gold and bore all his expenses lord montacute with the queens pensioners met him at islington and the lord mayor and aldermen in scarlet robes received him at smithfield and from thence rode with him to this house then master dimmocks in fenchurch street holinshed       our russian company was formed three years previous to the arrival of this ambassador

should speak with the prejudices of a true englishman was i to dignify the thames with the title of the chief of rivers i must qualify my patriotism with its just clame to that of first of islandrivers but in respect to our rival kingdom it must yield the palm to the garonne only we must not make comparison of length of course the contracted space of our island must limit that species of grandeur but there are none in any part of europe which can boast of more utility in bringing farther from the ocean the largest commercial ships nor are there any which can bring the riches of the universe to their very capital the ships of the seine discharge themselves at havre those of the loire reach no farther than portlannai far below its emporium nantes and the garonne conveys no farther than pouillac the fullloaden ships there they are obliged to be eased of part of their cargoes before they can reach the opulent bourdeaux  the thames rises beneath suffertonhill just within the borders of glocestershire a little to the southwest of cirencester which it instantly quits and enters for a short space into the county of wilts bends a little into it and reenters its parent province near lechlade where by means of locks it first becomes navigable and as is said for barges of seventy tons it here leaves glocestershire and becomes the whole southern boundary of oxfordshire or the northern of berkshire and from thence is the southen limit of buckinghamshire at great marlow in that county is the last lock from thence to the sea it requires no farther an to aid its navigation at a small distance from windsor it divides middlesex from surry just above kingston it feels the last feeble efforts of a tide tide from thence is a most important increase just below london bridge eighteen feet and at deptford twenty the preceding brings ships of three hundred and fifty tons drawing sixteen feet water to the customhouse the last those of a thousand tons even the largest drawing twentythree feet which import the treasures of india this noble river continues fresh as low as woolwich where brackish and even there is brackish only at springtides thus at our capital it is perfectly pure salubrious and subservient to vast articles of commerce with which that stupendous city abounds   length the whole course of the thames to its mouth is considerably above two hundred miles i contract its length very considerably in comparison of the usual estimation its proper mouth for i limit its mouth to the spot between the west end of the isle of grain in kent and the eastern part of that of canvey in essex from those plates to the naze in the latter county and the north foreland in that of kent which have hitherto been considered as its entrance it ceases to flow in a single channel it becomes a vast estuary filled with sandbanks many of which appear above water at the recess of the tides  the whole course of the river is through a country which furnishes every idea of opulence fertility and rural elegance meadows rich in hay or covered with numerous herds gentle risings and hanging woods embellished with palaces magnificent seats or beautiful villas a few the hereditary mansions of our ancient gentry but the greater part property transferred by the effects of vice and dissipation to the owners of honest wealth acquired by commerce or industrious professions or the dear purchase of cankering rapine its course furnishes few sublime scenes excepting the high chalky cliffs near henley all its banks are replete with native softness improved by art and the fullest cultivation  i do not recollect that it flows in any part over a rocky channel its bottom is either gravelly or clayey according to the nature of the soil through which it meanders this gives growth to the abundance of weeds with which it is in many parts filled and these prove the safety of multitudes of fishes fish and preserve them from being extirpated by the unbridled ravages of the poachers the thames has between its source and woolwich every species found in the british rivers except the burbot the loche the cobitis taenia or spiny loche of late years discovered in the river trent and the small species of salmon the samlet the salmon and the shad are fishes of passage the first appears in the river about the middle of february is in great estimation and sells at a vast price their capture is prohibited from the   th of august to the   th of november the shad arrives the latter end of may or beginning of june and is a very coarse fish it sometimes grows to the weight of eight pounds but the usual size is from four to five this is the fish which du hamel describes as the true alose of the french du hamel ii     tab i fig    but the fishermen of the thames have another they call allis much lesser than the former with a row of spots from the gills along the sides just beneath the back more or less in number this the french call le feinte du hamel ii     tab i fig    bloche ii tab xxx gives the figure of the feinte but is of opinion that the spots vanish with age for my part i have not had opportunities of frequent examination of these fishes but i incline to think they are different as the feintes appear in spawn at the length of sixteen inches which is their largest size  i suspect that the name allis is misapplied to this species and that it ought to be applied to the great or common shad being an evident corruption from the french name alose is the same with that of the severn but is rarely taken here but neither of them are admitted to good tables  le lamprey its t use the lesser lamprey the petromyzon fluviatilis of linnaeus is a small fish of great and national importance and is taken in amazing quantities between

shillings the thousand this year the dutch have given three pounds and the english from five to eight pounds the former having prudently contracted for three years at a certain price formerly the thames has furnished from a million to twelve hundred thousand annually  an attempt was lately made in parliament to fling the turbot fishery entirely into british hands of the turbot fishery by laying ten shillings a ton duty on every foreign vessel importing turbots into great britain but the plan was found to be derived from selfish motives and even on national injustice the far greater quantity of turbots being discovered to be taken on the coasts of holland and flanders see supplement to the arctic zology   the fish of the thames which come as low as london and beyond it as far as the water is fresh are the barbel which is never seen below the bridge a few roach and dace bleak in great plenty and eels extend far down the river small flounders are found as far as fulham brought up by the tides and continue stationary  i will conclude this account with the fine lines written by sir john denham on this our celebrated river and in a manner worthy of the greatness of the subject my eye descending from the hill surveys where thames among the wanton valleys strays thames the most loved of all the oceans sons by his old fire to his embraces runs hasting to pay his tribute to the
