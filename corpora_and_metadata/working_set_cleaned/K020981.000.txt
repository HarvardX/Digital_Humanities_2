philodamus a tragedy  as the principal design of tragedy is to raise commiseration and terror in the minds of the audience we shall defeat this great end if we always make virtue and innocence happy and successful spectator london printed for j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxvii price half a crown  to   madam far be from the author the presumption of affixing to this trifle any thing so respectable as your name what impudence to have ventured to place it where he has a scruple to suffer one of so little importance as his own to make its appearance but the character of writer which the late extreme abuse of that talent has not at all contributed to illustrate does not invite powerfully enough to the producing ones self professedly in that light to the public  the sole view of the author in the liberty he is now risking is only by way of appeal to you madam whether the character of complete domestic virtue attempted in that of philodamus has been faithfully copied from nature of this madam it is impossible any one can be so good a judge as yourself who have constantly before your eyes the most perfect example of it that perhaps ever actually existed an example whose luster still to increase you are contented madam to suffer your own great and amiable qualities which in any other part of the world would have burst out unrivalled to rank in this but in the second place the loss is compensated in the great share it is allowed madam you have in the very virtues to which you yield the preeminence they are such that had they been exercised only within the walls of a private family they could not have failed of winning their way abroad into the general esteem of mankind what universal adoration must they then command when it is nothing less than the most extended dominion upon the globe which in reality proves to be this vast family under the most vigilant and indulgent of parents and receives to its utmost boundary the effects of that fatherly tenderness and benevolence which seem to have been first put in practice in their more immediate connections in order to learn from experience how they might afterward be best applied and diffused to the most distant  if in return madam our prayers to heaven are but short it proceeds from no deficiency in our gratitude we think we have fulfilled every dictate of duty and love when we have ardently petitioned that you madam may long continue to share adorn and reward all the virtues that can render human nature amiable and respectable  the author of philodamus has the honor to be with the most profound respect and veneration  madam      your  most devoted most obedient and most humble servant  dramatis personae philodamus in a name we are so little accustomed to as that of philodamus the

faithful freedman my souls again at ease  earinus most happy hearing  philodamus thy approved honesty deserves my confidence   earinus you honor me  philodamus  so that i fairly own since i discovered erato my daughter what shall i call it with an indiscretion illsuited to that timorous modesty whose only safe entrenchment is reserve received the private visits of epicrates my mind has labored under some disturbance  earinus your pardon but what shadow of a likelihood one of a fame unblemished as epicrates should entertain a thought that might disturb philodamus whose merit blood and riches claim the first rank in lampsacus  philodamus none but my sensibility was wounded that she whose undisguised soul till now i wont to read in as a book laid open should thus have closed the page  earinus i am surprised a mind so poised as yours should be industrious to raise up trouble from so slight a source  philodamus thou do not know the feelings of a father whose apprehensions shoot to the same height as does his tenderness and whose anxiety finds objects for itself where most unlikely but to the purpose  i at length determined to call for explanation from epicrates even now i leave him  earinus and my lord you found him   philodamus found him earinus as i could wish but see my son which cuts our time too short for more particulars  exit earinus scene ii philippus philodamus philippus early this morning i sought to pay my duty to my father but was informed business had called him forth  philodamus it had philippus but i must observe that business exercise nor yet diversion have any longer power to call you forth  philippus i know not how it is  our inclinations slacken sometimes to flow with renewed force  philodamus whatever the cause the change is rather sudden it is not so long since you foreran the sun clamor and bustle ever wakened with thee when i inquired sometimes it was philippus would try his horses at the hippodrome sometimes the morn was startled at his hounds that claimed with ceaseless quest the promised chase at other every thing was preparation for the gymnasium now they are all forgot  philippus i was not reckoned over negligent   philodamus your other studies too i find lie fallow here am i paying at a vast expense philosophers forsooth to rail at riches to vaunt the praise of simple pulse and roots who by the by despise them at my table while you loiter the livelong day in idleness with erato and my new guest euphemia whom on the death of agatho her father in banishment at corinth for the love i knew your sister bare her i took hither  philippus that love gives reputation to her judgment had but our crabbed rough philosophers availed them of euphemias gentle manners they might have learned what has so puzzled them how virtue looks and acts in her own shape  philodamus fools only know extremes is there no middle between the harsh formality of bookmen and trifling delicacy that makes woman  philippus i see no point in which they yield to us their apprehensions quicker and their reason by forms less fettered their expression clearer they seek no shelter from authorities nor do they strive to veil their ignorance in terms of art as we do then their gentleness smooths off the rugged points of argument melting contention into pleasantry discourse such as euphemias and my sisters conceived by sense and harmonizd by beauty reaches the heart while it informs the mind softens and civilizes all our ways  philodamus not to examine whither but too often these over civilizing freedoms tend how did you venture you their wise admirer who ought to know how delicate their fame how the least breath that blight reproach may point often with irreparable taint deforms the best complexiond innocence that dares but err from common forms to introduce epicrates to eratos apartment which by our manners is severely barred to all but nearest consanguinity  philippus the age since you were young has shaken off many the slavish customs of tradition  philodamus that country where all forms are thrown aside however venerably perhaps derived from the collected wisdom of past times and meant a mound against some national bent some native inclinations of the soil is on the point of losing decency and sinking into rank licentiousness  philippus now good my father if there be to blame do not involve my sister in my fault nor yet condemn her conduct her fair fame stands not within the verge of reprehension nor ever has she given him ear alone euphemia or myself were always present  philodamus twas inconsiderate and rash no matter i have hit upon a way to remedy it which you will soon learn order your sister hither  exit philippus scene iii philodamus such is the heart of man no sooner quit of one anxiety up starts another ready to fill the vacant seat it grieves me to see this boy so very deep involved his thought discourse and soul is all euphemia how desperate the firy wish of youth how blind to the long train of ills behind high on imaginations upper bough pleasure suspends her fruit and shows its cheek flaming with ruddy gold to our impatience does fortune toss it to our longing hand we find in melancholy disappointment the core consumed by worms and rottenness the juice we hoped so racy turned to bitterness  scene iv philodamus erato philodamus erato philodamus good morrow my fair child how do thou erato  erato health to my father what are his commands  philodamus i have been rating here your brother child rather more warmly than my manner is  erato i am sorry for the occasion but i see your looks are still serene your brow unruffled mirth more than anger sparkles in your eye i think you scarce have given us opportunity to learn how you look angry  philodamus why no daughter for i regard my children as my friends as my acquaintance my society connected by the tenderest strings of love it is their affection it is their confidence i want and not a formal cold obedience dread is the seed from which rebellion springs and teaches soon to wish a vacant throne  erato your milder government has rather chosen to copy from those happy states where one is raised for the convenience of the whole rather to represent than exercise the power supreme  philodamus i am glad you think so of me well since i have not sought to reign by terror you will tell me in what light you see epicrates  erato so close an union knits him to philippus i see him almost as another brother  philodamus and pray this other brother as you call him has ought particular ever passed between you  erato no more than general civility the attention ever paid our sex by yours no other than between him and euphemia  philodamus your sentiments  erato are as of an acquaintance that is always entertaining often instructive  philodamus no more  erato no more  philodamus trust me i am glad of it for when i found that you received his visits and with a kind of caution that implied we would not have the old man find us out   erato will you but give me leave  philodamus not till i have done  i did inform me of his character and find him as the general run of the time wild in his ways unmasterd in his temper one who has taken in his teeth the bit and run away from rule one whose glib tongue distills a dangerous and infective softness which on the passive and unguarded mind works like a feather dipped in poisonous ointment pleasing while it destroys   erato do but permit me to tell you youre most grossly misinformed some private enemy has slandered him if worth like his can find an enemy oh that i knew the wretch contempt cleave to him nay common fame which as it rolls along licks up each speck and spot of character impatient to produce them to our eyes speaks him of conduct irreproveable   philodamus what ho my daughter whither are you running and why so warm for any one acquaintance however entertaining or instructive  erato alas you show me to myself at once how could i be so ignrant of my heart i blush at my own folly oh my father teach me my erring steps how to retrace command me and i never see him more  philodamus this picture have i drawn of thy epicrates as in a mirror that inverts the truth to punish you for not confiding in me start you my girl to hear me call him thine why what a fire has lightened in thy cheek and glimmers over thy bosom yes my child epicrates is thine and in an hour from hence expect to interchange your vows  erato i do not only start i tremble too quite giddy at the unexpected change it is but this instant that i find i love the very same you give away my hand i look in wonder round me like a voyager who quitting his own country late at evening sleeps over the easy passage to another and wakes to a new people and new manners where the whole region wears a different aspect from that he left  philodamus as to thy voyage child be sure it lands thee on a sunshine coast where not a cloud yet lours but think of this that happiness grows not on earth spontaneous it is a plant that calls for delicate rearing trifling neglects may chill its tender growth and imperceptibly produce that canker shall dim the orient tints impressed by heaven and give its fading luster for a prey to the harsh worm unkindness think this certain a necessary consequence whenever familiarity outruns complacency  erato fear not my care but this too quick transition this hurrying so abruptly into marriage ere it is whispered in inquirys ear robs it of its due air of decency  philodamus i should distress you were i to assent to what your modesty would ask for form do you get ready while i give my orders how to prepare the feast not with great pomp yet dignity because the legate verres ravenous as the eagle on the roman ensigns is just arrived and t would inform his avarice where to seek out for prey should we unfold all our magnificence to s greedy eye  exit philodamus scene v erato only to love and honor such a father is to be still ungrateful i would give some wild romantic proof of my obedience out of the common trampled road of duty  here comes epicrates why all this tumult this trouble at him whom i used to meet with transport yet be mistress of myself  scene vi epicrates erato epicrates my loveliest erato i can perceive a sweet confusion in your look that tells me you are not unacquainted with my errand will not this gentle hand confirm the promise this best of days has given me from thy father  erato you have it but i fear epicrates giving her hand you knew too well before to need the question for surely you had eyes to read my heart however it imposed upon itself may not a time arrive when you will despise me for the facility with which you win me  epicrates yes could a time arrive when imposition disguise and mockry and the ungenrous pride of giving pain should grow more meritorious than noble plainness and free honesty which lift thee from the level of most women and make thee every thing my heart could wish  erato such may you think me still and i am too happy all that i know is that in pure affection and reverent submission to your pleasure it will be hard indeed for me to err since they are so much my bent and inclination i shall not know they are a debt to duty  epicrates thank thee my gentle love i am not one to outpassion passion and to oerstretch sense to rant in wild hyperbole and rapture such stuff as takes the triflers of thy sex my love obedient to my reason grew which weighed and studied thee and still discovered more and new virtues for its admiration the search has justified excess of love and my best judgment gives thee all my soul  erato grant heaven you do not overrate my worth how poor and how deserted shall i seem when the imaginary virtues vanish and my defects step forward to your view  epicrates there i have not a fear but see philippus what mean his downcast look and haggard eye  scene vii philippus epicrates erato philippus my friend my brother happiness shower on thee  epicrates it does till i can hold no more my friend i cannot love thee better though i gain another tender name by which to call thee  philippus all joy to thee my dearest erato  erato my brother you felicitate but coolly  philippus it may be so for i am scarce myself else the content of such a friend and sister would animate me into exultation euphemia leaves us  erato this was unexpected it gives me grief how shall i bear the parting  epicrates so suddenly  erato has ought offended her  philippus i have offended her i have offended her wretch that i am by telling her i loved for that i love her with a flame as pure as elemental fire unsoild by smoke   epicrates has long been visible enough philippus  philippus the day when she arrived at lampsacus the sea had ruffled her and pald her cheek with such a winning languidness it added an air of sensibility to beauty that only heightned what it meant to steal from she had my hand at landing on the pier and her first touch was answered at my heart which instantly did homage to its sovereign i waited long in humble distant awe smothring my pains till now this very morning their violence forced a passage from my heart  epicrates how did she hear you  philippus as she would a tale related of feigned love and fancied persons a mere milesian novel which we read nor find one track behind it on the mind said it required no answer for tomorrow she sailed for corinth  erato this is something sudden but in these cases trust a womans judgment we read each other with a piercing eye and penetrate with ease each latent meaning i am sure euphemia loves   philippus i have seen it long oh i have no doubt now could i gnaw my heart  epicrates hear me and if i speak with liberty think it is the surgeons hand which cannot aid thee without first giving pain can you conceive high as your father stands in lampsacus with such a city bowing to his greatness he will consent to wed his only son whatever her birth her merit or her beauty may plead in favor of euphemia into a family whom banishment has stripped without remorse of its possessions  i could say more but fear to wound you deeper oh strive to oerrule this unavailing passion and be in time advised  philippus go and advise the lapse of water down the broken cliff not to obey its own propensity which drives it headlong to its place of rest then if it heed thy bidding come again and i will try to bind my passion prisoner in reasons icy fetters ah epicrates it is easier to advise than to assist  epicrates mistake me not for though i would dissuade yet my dissuasion frees no obligation that friendship owes to serve you your own way therefore try you to win upon euphemia but to delay her voyage for a little mean while my erato shall press her father  say will thou not my love  erato whatever you bid were i averse to it but in such a cause my inclinations run before your bidding and be you sure my brother i will plead with all the energy of pure affection joined to the sincere love i bear euphemia could i but hope so to prevail on him as i believe you will on her to stay i should have warmer prospect of success  philippus i see and thank thy goodness erato which strives though thou despondest in thy heart to give the unbodied ghost of hope a substance and tinge it of some color but thy love leaves it at best evanid  epicrates now no more go to euphemia while we try philodamus to erato exeunt end of act i act ii scene i philodamus earinus philodamus you have my orders only this earinus see that propriety and elegance are not encroachd upon by cloying quantity  earinus i shall  philodamus yet do you hear earinus do not so check your hand but that abundance smile gracefully upon my board forget not that my dependents and the poor have mouths alas too seldom filled and can one see the feast which lavish luxury has pild with all that sea and air and earth produce without the thought how many of our species seem to inhabit quite another world and do not know our diet so be gone  exit earinus scene ii philodamus erato philodamus how now what brings thee here my gentle daughter  erato euphemia means to leave us and my heart feels heavy for the parting then philippus   philodamus but erato where is thy nuptial robe i thought to find thee tricked in all the splendor which the unsatisfied and curious hand of ornament could torture out of fancy  erato i hope you have not found me over studious of that vain science you have often told me dress was an indication of the mind which whether rich and noble with simplicity or light and trifling wanton in redundancy hung like a sign to inform one of what goods were to be found within as for my brother   philodamus i have so and why did i so  to check a passion that is inherent to thy sex the peacock beauty though it spread its state quite to the tiptoe stretch of vanity wishes more eyes might stud its gaudy train unsatisfied in all its present pride  erato the greater pity we are ever taught to look on personal perfections as our prime merit but the scanty hand of nature in her dealing out those favors aided by your advice has cured i hope any excess epicrates might blame i came to say i tremble for philippus   philodamus you cannot deny the sobrest of you all seek in the glare of ornament to hide wherever nature wanders from perfection youre skilful architects and know to veil with rich entablature and wreathing soliage any the untoward juttings and abutments that would disgrace your symmetry of building making necessity appear as choice  erato now my best father hear me of my brother   philodamus thou do recur for ever to that burden and wilt not see that i with pains elude it nor am i only talkative from age fond as it is to hear itself discourse but by design why how can thou imagine the care the fondness the parental friendship all faithful sentinels who still on duty never wink their vigilant eyes upon you both who told me ere thou toldst them to thyself the secret inclinations of thy heart could be so drowsy now as not to observe a passion i must disapprove it is this welcomes euphemias departure to me i would be kind but not to foolishness  erato my heart bleeds for him i dread something desperate  philodamus myself i have survived more than one cross which youth and folly thought immediate death of this no more here in the oratory i go to pour my prayers and beg of heaven its blessings on thy marriage and my house why do thou follow me  erato to shut the oratory  philodamus what needs it shut i dare not ask the gods what i would wish kept from the ears of men  exit philodamus scene iii erato i see my brother following euphemia and will avoid him till i meet epicrates or he will jointly try to move my father or soften our sad errand in the telling  scene iv philippus euphemia philippus this is too much this dumb indifference oh rather let me suffer all thy hate and learn it from thyself it would be kind as it must end a life of wretchedness yet stop and answer me cannot these tears obtain one only day it is all i ask nor yet the friendship you profess to erato  euphemia her marriage makes my stay unnecessary my resolutions are immutable  phillipus cruel euphemia but i see the cause which wings your eagerness to take its flight think you a lovers eye could be so dulled his soul so drenched with thick stupidity as to oerlook the thousand treacherous signs which tell spite of yourself the darling secret the sigh half smothered and the melting look the thought abstracted and the ardent wish with all the kindred attributes of passion proclaim to full conviction that your heart is prepossessed and thence my love contemned  euphemia to this i owe no answer free to love or hate of you unquestioned  philippus you say right nor would i now detain you for one moment fly to your lover fly the ship attends you go think a hurricane a tardy wind and all too loitring for such dear impatience then ere the indistinct horizon show the rising hills of corinth like a mist have your arms stretched out ready to embrace him stay not to land but plunge into his bosom oh bliss of gods which cannot know increase unless as i am urged by strong despair i glut your eyes with what they long to see the bleeding mangled triumph of your beauty  euphemia ah do not force me from my resolution my reason and my duty to discover what i would lock for ever in this bosom known only to myself why will you torture me for what when told will draw upon thyself a dreadful train of bitterest repentance  philippus i am past fear of worse oh tell me all though death attend upon the explanation nor think revenge may interrupt your happiness my enmity is pointed at myself  euphemia it is true one has possession of my heart nor malice can reprove my choice his worth allowed by all though doubted by himself of rank exalted but of more distinction for what he owes to none honor and merit his tongue drops honey and whenever he speaks attention blames herself of negligence though she is all ear and eye then for his person  in pride of youth  words are too poor to paint it  philippus refrain thy lavish praise or i shall burst ye tortrers of the soul rage envy jealousy i fail beneath the lashing of your scourges forgive my frenzy i like you adore his wondrous virtues i like you would worship perfections heaven created but for him oh say where stands his altar to this god under what name shall i address my incense i crave his name that happiest of names oh for that name of names   euphemia why you are mad nor do deserve to know nor should you know but that i leave you never to see you more and that your wildness of misapprehension fancyng another master of my soul has humbled me to the too plain avowal of what the delicacy of my sex should doom to sleep in everlasting silence it is philippus know you such a man that rival of himself  philippus can i be sure that i exist support me or i faint astonishment has wrapped me from myself my senses whirl them round in giddy eddies too much for natures suffrance scarce can life cohabit with the tumult of my joy  euphemia avoid these starts of rapture which but add fresh poison to the stings of disappointment imagination views her favorite prospect till lost in soft delusion she approaches even the blue sky to her eager reach skipping the middle space which teems with obstacles  philippus what lion glares athwart the promised way has not my love confessed her generous flame what then can come between me and my wishes  euphemia are you to learn then what may come between what are ingratitude and disobedience and if philippus devious from the tenor of his past life bursting each sacred band that links his duty to so mild a father obedience to him is but awful friendship could take to s arms an unblessed vagabond think not euphemia of so base a spirit to ruin by her love the man she loves or blast by a mean deed of selfishness the only friend destruction left her parents taint like a poisonous worm those kindly branches that yield her food and shelter  philippus i have won epicrates and erato to ask   euphemia ask him to set this ample roof on fire or sink his riches in the boundless sea and he shall laugh less at us  philippus do thou doom me to pine beneath thy ineffectual love away with these refinements let us fly fly to thy mother till resentment here thaw into reconcilement she at least will bless me while i ever seek to pay her in duty the dear debt i owe for thee  euphemia pay it at home you little know that mother nor would she own the name should i revisit her unworthy of her love distress had never the power to eat into her solid virtue nor roughen with its rust the perfect polish one female slave attends her their joint labor earns hard support often borrowing from night its softest hours of rest and i defraud her while i am absent of my share of toil would i had never left her never left her  philippus oh only kind to heighten cruelty  euphemia i have said too much we part take this embrace the first and last i give shun we each other trust not a look and think a sigh rebellion against our duties so farewell  exit shuts the door philippus one word she is gone she is lost for ever oh my brain  ex scene v philodamus the gods have heard my prayer and sent their answer i asked them for a blessing on my house and they have brought this woman to my ear that i might learn her worth how nobly strict how just to me how duteous to her mother there i have been negligent  the voice of misery is often lost to pitys ear by distance hide from the eye distress compassion loses its best almost sole entrance to the heart and leaves disaster by itself to languish it shall be mended erato epicrates hark ye a word  scene vi enter erato epicrates haste thee my gentle daughter upon a message thou wilt be glad to bear i would not hear thee when thou would have moved me to listen to the sorrows of thy brother himself i have heard fly to him child and tell him i love euphemia little less than he does and long to give her to him haste away erato oh happy change how i shall bless philippus  ex scene vii epicrates philodamus epicrates now you have heaped the measure of my joy in thus preventing what i meant to urge in favor of euphemia this completes what you began in hastening my felicity which else had waited the interposition of friends ere i had tied this wished alliance a life so liberal in dispensing happiness claims every prayer for blessings in return  philodamus there is more usury in making happy than the most studied selfishness ever dreamed of my son except that his is more tumultuous owns not more joy  and as for you epicrates had the whole world been open to my choice that i could say here will i give my daughter thou were the man the one my sold would cleave to i love thy probity and gentle nature that form and fashion of the present time which grows a virtue when it is allied to antique truth and sanctity of manners and that timidity of modest merit without the bookish downlookd awkwardness which often disgraces knowledge  who attends there send here earinus to a servant epicrates such commendation i dare not think my own yet i would wish your favor should not be mistaken widely that i may prove not wholly undeserving the hand of erato enter earinus my lord your orders  philodamus thou art too much employed thyself to quit the general inspection of this day therefore earinus have thou in readiness some servant of especial trust to bear a packet to the port it is of consequence  earinus or aeschylus my lord or xanthias   philodamus ay either even which you will let it be given on board the vessel which euphemia meant to sail in thus better freighted with the chearing news for this will cheer lysistrata her mother of our alliance  epicrates thank you for a goodness which never acts as i perceive by halves but at this time youre all too overhurried for such dispatches at your better leisure this may be done as well  philodamus epicrates i tell thee what i should be less punctilious had fortune never turned her back upon her but where adversity has fixed her teeth it leaves a soreness that is sure to smart at light suspicions of unmeant contempt the veriest trifles which in happier days slip our observance and leave no impression assume the shape of injury and insult to rankle in the mind  i write besides to press her with her earliest convenience to hasten hither and to make this house her place of residence  oh here they come  scene vii philodamus euphemia philippus epicrates philodamus well erato how have thou sped thy message or meet you difficulties and objections what says our son does he refuse to obey us or is euphemia not to be prevailed on what is she so determined on her voyage she will not listen  how dissolved in tears i thought you had not owned such weak humanity  euphemia i was prepared and fortified against misery unguarded to this vast surprise of joy whatever resolution we pretend by my own weakness i am too well convinced our passions still are woman  philodamus worth like thine is all too scarce in man thy sex euphemia whether in good or bad will distance ours this hand say may i give it to philippus  euphemia my heart was given before oh ecstasy that you approve and realize the gift  philippus avoid these starts of rapture which but add fresh poison to the stings of disappointment oh best of men oh erato oh friend was ever such a father oh euphemia do not adore him but i know thou do forgive my wildness  do not laugh at me   philodamus contract your transports and retire a little while they prepare this chamber for the ceremony that gives you to each other once and ever  exeunt end of act ii act iii scene i verress palace rubrius apronius sestius rubrius ha our old harbinger

reception but where is the legate that i see him not  rubrius reposing after the fatigue of journey  apronius fatigue why his sedan steps with that smoothness so stuffed with cushions that he rather seems to float upon the air than move on earth  sestius you know his delicacy to what height he has improved that science whose perfection consists in picking cause of discontent fatigue and disappointment where we gross ones thanks to our want of taste meet satisfaction  rubrius why he was sourd but at the last relay because the country round about could furnish only some two poor bushels of fresh roses hardly enough to arm his queasy sense against eight sturdy cappadocian slaves who melted as they bore along his litter  apronius well are your purses crammed you have not served under so great a master in the art of plundring to return with empty hands  sestius ask rubrius there he is an able workman i am but a prentice and can only pilfer  rubrius nothing to boast of yet not much amiss the legate kept to himself king nicomedes as a right royal dish and only served to his own mess where we were not to feed and he has picked him to the bone nay sucked his very marrow irus might be richer than asias monarch now  apronius at least in vermin i like your prudence while you fleeced the court but spared the people you ensurd their love  rubrius ensurd their love say you ensurd their love if plague war famine shipwreck may be loved then we may have our share on it and not else  sestius how stand your lists for pillage and for women for let me tell you he is sharp set on both you need not doubt but he will inquire for them soon as he sees you  rubrius but apronius what is the present state of vice and villainy in lampsacus  apronius in little as at rome the great

more honesty alive than this  apronius alive she died a beggar unrelievd  rubrius so we may fancy then ourselves at home since vice stalks unreprovd here  apronius your philosophers subsist by daily holding forth against it and in mere gratitude at night indulge in it  sestius apronius you say nothing to the women  apronius pooh they are here as in all other places why there is no variation in

for yourself the next is psyche wedded to eubulus reads near upon thirty tall and rather plumpish if she be past the gush and swell of beauty is hard to say so imperceptibly has time blown over it that twould make one think he strove to mend it as the rose smells sweeter for being breathed on than before it opens yet erato who blooms in balmy fragrance subdues like incense all these weak perfumes  verres why tell me of them then proceed to erato  apronius reads rhode the fair and witty wife of lyco another may possess more regular features or glow with richer tints from natures

same measure  verres press we our host no more there is a time when a dull clog hangs on our flagging spirits a listlessness and an indisposition to mirth and all the cheerful ways of men which wayward struggles against its remedy as patients nauseate the draught that cures them i have known music have a great effect in dissipating this cold gloomy humor apronius is your voice in tune  apronius i will try song when theseus left his ariadne fast in her bed the poor girl was a blinking drowned herself for grief she had nigh but second thoughts soon inclined her to drinking sh illumined her face till it shone with that brightness it turned to a star which gives proof of her lightness    verres how so i thought she had been crowned with stars  apronius her loves with bacchus and her stellar wreath are allegorical and mean no more than the song tells us  sestius and all songs tell truth a gallant fellow at a rape that theseus i know his history he would the first of helen

trough for swine to gorge at where they swill to surfeiting in noise and nastiness  rubrius man would immediately relapse to beast if woman did not humanize the brute and make him shave his beard and pare his nails wherever she treads good humor leads the way pleasure lighthearted mirth and elegance compose her train and joy is all her own wine was invented to supply her place and but enhances more the want of her  sestius i dont find that  apronius within these walls is one who had shamed helen given her the pip and to excuse her looks had made her swear she had not slept the whole precedent night though she had had her husband by her side i mean the daughter of our generous host nay her companion is almost her rival and on my conscience i could well believe that leda laid more eggs than we are told of which have been somehow kept and newly hatched to show true beauty to the present age  verres it is inhuman to confine the women who best adorn and ought to share the feast

understand them if not it is not the pressure of the hand will do her harm  verres in truth philodamus your grecian ceremonial is too strict  well argue this within  and shall convince you that the security of female virtue rests safest on its early introduction to the familiarity of men come friends to the next room i know youre thirsty to pledge me to the health of this new helen  exeunt all

passed my dagger through his arm thence come these stains  philippus would it had been his heart or rather that of verres  philodamus who lies here  philippus this was cornelius fain i would have saved him but stupid duty forced him upon death what have we now to do  cornelius carried off philodamus why this philippus to draw up our complaint against this verres and send it to the praetor  well epicrates enter epicrates say are the women safe  epicrates yes they are safe but verres and his crew had well nigh perished fired with just indignation at your wrongs the populace pursued him to his palace where finding it impossible to enter they heaped up faggots every thing combustible to have reduced him and his house to ashes when most unluckily for our revenge arrived the roman praetor

take me too i blush to be at liberty  officer you are not charged their lot deserves no envy  philodamus when hadrian the praetor by extortions had raked the inhabitants of utica beyond the sufferance of human nature despair at last gave vent to their resentment and they consumed him and his spoils and palace to dust by fire unquestioned since of rome  officer i am not here to reason but command so come along  philodamus do you epicrates acquaint my daughters and come after us  exeunt all but epicrates epicrates confusion thou have caught us in thy net   enter euphemia euphemia where is

cloud destruction lowrs on the whole and meditates to burst on all it finds in the devoted verge escape if yet you may fly to my house there shelter from the storm why left you erato  euphemia ay is he dead and i survive him yet   epicrates he lives the praetors guard conducts him chained him and philodamus both to the forum the legates fury drives at such a rate it is manifest at what it will arrive  euphemia he lives blessed be the tongue that tells me so heaven and their innocence will soon acquit them and punishment must light where due on verres soon as the roman praetor is informed he will blush they have been chained as criminals  epicrates can power blush or feels oppression shame then i will believe the crocodile may weep nay more surrender his uninjurd prey ah let us not confide in innocence what is there else that tyranny can hate and what it hates what hinders it to punish  euphemia can any tyranny make selfdefence a punishable crime the roman virtue holds the first station in the worlds esteem and their politeness has such general fame it is thought to overpay the wrongs of conquest  epicrates i have been at rome the insolence of conquerors coins their own fame and we their slaves adopt what character their pride stamps on themselves virtue at rome means to enslave the world politeness is another name for luxury that gorges at a mess the wealth of nations such justice as these principles afford we may expect to find and nothing better  euphemia i catch your fears yet hope you fear too much  epicrates let us prepare us as the worst were certain it is my request euphemia that you choose my house my friendship and the love of erato as your protection in this dread calamity and lest you fear seeing in friendships name how many seek to buy a slave a pennyworth time and familiarity should shrink you from parity into a mean dependence soon as you pass my threshold twenty talents wait your acceptance   euphemia worthy of philippus thou art his match in virtue as in friendship such thanks as my poor gratitude can pay   epicrates the time will not admit of farther reasoning let me prevail and wish you back to erato farewell each minute i will dispatch a messenger who shall inform you both of all that passes  exit euphemia success attend thy steps kneels allruling power we know not how to name and therefore wander through almost infinite denominations to mark thy various attributes and functions who must love justice oh if ever now exert thyself free from thy general laws and speak in prodigies enact and vindicate thy equitable mandates villain man will construe else thy patience a connivance and deal out wrong secure of punishment  exit end of act iv act v scene i dolabella verres dolabella i could almost repent me that i came a little later   verres had been all too late so violent an insult on the name of roman then shall pass unvindicated  dolabella i must be of opinion that the insult keeps just proportion with the provocation for what could violence itself do more than ravish from a fathers arms his daughter to violate her honor in your own  verres there might be that my lord may want excuse but not much blame if i went selfinvited it was because these misers grudge texpose their statues pictures gems  you know i am curious wine and young blood must plead for all that followed  dolabella rather too curious for they tell me verres that your immense collection is extended by rapine and extortion to a size that even beggars all that rome possesses  verres my lord i gather for myself and friends and by the by it is long since i observed a vacant base stand in your vestibule i have a masterpiece of art an heifer so exquisitely cast such through nature the work of myro life is in the brass it would with dignity supply the vacancy  dolabella i know it by report the very same so many grecian wits have celebrated  verres i vow my lord i have started twenty times and thought she lowed  but as to this affair i do assure you what concerns me most is the indignity the state endures  dolabella a state is more dishonored in protecting the infringer of the sacred rights of nature  verres my lord share my collection as you please i hope when you reflect on the injury in your immediate legate done to rome besides my birth twill move you to outbear me through any slight deficiency of form  dolabella believe me i am desirous to assist you but of so ugly nature is your crime i know not where to turn me to effect it  verres cornelius slain and rubrius sorely wounded direct your vengeance to both perpetrators i dont know if you ever thought worth minding the entaglio which i wear upon this finger view it my lord the subjects somewhat wanton see how that leda clasps in her crisp arms her amorous swan who ruffles every feather the figure was designed from my chelidon poor wench dying she left me all her treasure i have been tempted to destroy this ring a thousand times the counterfeit resemblance makes me quite mad when i behold her beauties tasted by jove himself  would you would wear it if only to preserve it from my jealousy  dolabella and am beholden to you  but to murder two innocent men of elevated stations only that they resisted your attempt  i should not like to have such matter argued before the senate by your men of virtue  verres my friends at rome my lord bought and to buy will bear us through who cares there for the provinces shrouded in distance from their thought and notice then  pray my lord what makes a man of virtue to sell ones knavry dearer than another i had almost forgot  it is but a trifle  knowing the vast expenses of your state long since i laid aside a little present  with your permission i will bring it to you tomorrow morning nay it is nothing more than some poor hundred thousand sesterces  dolabella i thank you for your love and i accept them why as you say in such a distant province  the majesty of rome  cornelius slain  and your high birth  require this vindication where are the prisoners  verres they wait without and were i to advise immediate sentence were doubly useful by impressing awe of your authority and stifling

with the stale subterfuges of hired advocates who dodging through a thousand circumstances hope in the course of a longwinded argument obscure traverse involved to warp the judgment which way they please when they have bewildered sense this matter needs no arguing and no witnesses unless you choose the body of cornelius a roman citizen slain by your hands beneath your roof should be produced in court  philodamus we shall not tire your patience i had thought when i appeared before the roman praetor without employing any turn of eloquence to have laid out a plain story to his hearing the undue invasion of a house like mine insolence injury and violence suffered at length repelled i own it needless verres placed by you on the seat of judgment cuts it all short  and we expect our sentence  dolabella to his assessors i am for death and you   verres for death  sestius and i  epicrates forgive most noble if i interfere with your injunction i am no venal advocate but am connected with these prisoners by every band that friendship and esteem love duty obligation can impose my fortunes are extensive and shall answer whatever mulct you please to levy on them nay take them all i never can be poor while i reflect how well they were employed so that their lives be spared and you accept the ruin of us three as equipollent for one the scum of rome by birth and station  verres most noble dolabella not to sit quite useless in this honorable place permit me to observe this forward pleader makes even his intercession aggravate the mistress of the world has ever seen her meanest citizen as of more dignity than any subject conquered by those citizens and she demands that blood compensate blood retire and thank the lenity that spares you  dolabella verres you speak our thoughts most accurately to verres philippus had it been thee and not thy senseless agent whom in a sisters cause i bravely slew i would not have repined to bear these chains nor what is worse to follow as it is we

oppression claims its avenging hand in thy due hour when verres shall be ripe for punishment when the large growth of villainy shall bend his branches to the earth with their own weight i trust thou will in adequate reprisal set up thy hourglass of retaliation i think i see thee not as i am now going to die death is no penalty but abject pale contemned shunned and deserted by those who share thy spoils banished and wandering through provinces thy rapine trod before i feel an ease that tells me i am heard  philippus oh heaven if there be yet in rome one heart one soul that is worthy of thy inspiration one tongue that dares to plead the cause of innocence and something says within me there is one who shall retort the doings of this day do thou inform that heart that soul that tongue with the coercive force of eloquence the energy of language pour from thence the mighty torrent of convictive truth till conscience strike with dumbness thy defenders and guilt and shame anticipate that

deathbed owed me a severer end another word and then we part epicrates one article remains of dearest import if this fierce tempest of calamity when fallen its rage should chance to drive on shore any the wrecks and fragments of my fortunes collect them safely for euphemia  epicrates i have already offered her my house begged her to share my fortunes  philippus embracing him oh epicrates oh friend indeed what would i give for words yet could they more than call thee friend indeed  epicrates oh my philippus oh my better half i live not half without thee   guard come make haste  philippus my last thoughts to euphemia and my sister  exit epicrates philodamus be gone epicrates and now philippus i have no leave to take of thee my boy we are bound on the same voyage only this i have prevailed upon the executioner to spare thy eyes my death and you wait here till i am past so now lead on i am ready  philippus to thy last thought the same my gentle father exit philodamus enter euphemia why art thou here euphemia to unman me now that i have born the parting of a father with all i have of steadiness art thou come to rob me of that last of vanities which cowards sometimes reach the dying resolute i am young am born to dignity and affluence have health untainted and the esteem of friends these i could have resigned yet be myself and mock the phantom death what is a world that one must ask the leave of rome to live in but when i view thy beauties which i quit purchased but unpossessd there lies the agony and it grows terrible indeed to die  euphemia i came to steel thy breast and not to melt it into the whining softness of a woman and why regret to die since we have loved and have enjoyed already never doubt it all that is keen and exquisite in love the rest deserves small notice be like me i feel my soul exalted bove itself secure and pleased in its own resolution it looks with intrepidity on death  philippus what do thou mean euphemia thou alarmst me there is a determination in thine eye and firmness in thy speech that makes me tremble more than the axe that waits me oh dismiss thy desperate thought whatever live euphemia cherish my memory nor let that affect thee beyond a melancholy recollection how much we loved and how unfortunately  euphemia there are philippus in distresss quiver some shafts so very deeply barbd they mock the unavailing art that would extract them and will be left to rankle in the wound but did the world possess the balm to heal them twere meanness to survive distinguished wretchedness what to be pointed at and shown a sight as one no misery could drive from life see here the remedy of every woe see here the cure of verres  shows a dagger philippus twas my fear that dagger no thou must not shall not use it ah do not listen to that witch despair who gilds with a false sunshine the black precipice to allure the suffering mind  euphemia the suffering mind twas then it suffered when my glory bid the chasm of separation yawn between us twas harder to resolve to part our loves adoring and adored than share thy death  philippus in this dread hour it was my consolation epicrates had lent thee noble shelter from all the storms that yet might buffet life oh harbor there and drop the social tear in consort often as you shall think of me till slowpaced time nay habitude of sorrow induce satiety of itself who knows long years of happiness may wait behind that shall do justice to euphemias merit  euphemia yes and be comforted dry up my tears my mourning weeds convert to ornament whimper but now and then and in a moment call any other man my only love  the thought is paltry oh how i disdain it why now methinks i am at the pitch of happiness high in my own esteem it is only now that i feel worthy of a flame like thine i am all on fire to shuffle off this life  it is an impatience that still spurs me forward the gods conceal from those they force to live how happy it is to die lest they desist from their hard drudgry and desert their station  philippus if ever tender thought of me has glowed within that gentle bosom  do not hear horrid the blow that ends the best of fathers noise within the time demands me  let me yet prevail  voice within lead on the prisoner  philippus it is my last request  euphemia but a request you have no right to make nay talk no more farewell this last embrace if memory extend beyond the urn still shall we love each other now away farewell my love my pride my happiness that i am thine oerpays the loss of life  philippus an instant longer   euphemia why an instant longer and should the tyrant grant us till tomorrow think you wed take it guard takes hold of him come nay come along  philippus i go  but would  it is easier to die exit she looking fondly after him till just as he is out of sight she stabs herself he reenters unhand me for a moment rash euphemia  euphemia i thought thee farther  or had spared thee this it is over  haste  oh loiter not behind  where are you  now youre lost  i see thee not  night hangs upon my eyes  and thou art no where  oh now again i know him  it is philippus  at least remember  oh  that i die  thine  philippus kind executioner be quick dispatch  why do i ask what i can do myself with readier expedition  stabs himself with her dagger guard haste prevent him you are too late  philippus i thank thee for thy lesson now verres thy revenge is half deceived now dolabella i elude thy sentence stay let me seize her hand ere light desert me else i shall wander in uncertain search and find it not  why now in spite of numbness i hold thee fast  to separate  no more  enter epicrates epicrates sure she came hither yet i dread to find her ha is it so my fears informed me just philippus art thou here i knew indeed death waited for thee but in other place and other manner better as it is tears by your leave a while there is time enough for your indulgence who commands the guard here  officer it is i  epicrates here is an order from the praetor rendring their bodies up to my disposal it names but two the third was unforeseen but will be undisputed let some bear them to join their fathers corpse then to my house their hands fast linked convey them if you can without disjointing their so tender union virtue thou art not for this present world injustice it is thine own but there is somewhere some happy clime beyond oppressions reach whence tyranny retires its shortened arm and compensation waits for suffering innocence bear them away i follow   exit the bodies carried before him the end
