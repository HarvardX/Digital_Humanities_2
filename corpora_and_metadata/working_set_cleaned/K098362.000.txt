a brief concordance to the holy scriptures of the old and new testament  by which all or most of the principal texts of scripture may be easily found out  by john brown minister of the gospel at

substance of the small in little room   by observing what is one or more principal words of any remembered text and what are the three first letters of them and searching under answerable words in the concordance the sentence will be found   the original words whether nouns or verbs are marked in capital or double letters and these derived from them come after in italics   where words are found in many places the plural is distinguished from the singular and the parts of verbs ending in  ed  est  eth from their original but when the examples are few no such distinction is made but may be easily observed   the concordant words except the first are marked by the first letter a b c etc and the names of the  mark stands for several words above marked in italics divine persons by answerable capitals   even other words especially names of divine persons are often marked by one or more of their first letters that the sense of the line might be more complete   notwithstanding considerable care both in writing and printing sometimes one figure of a number is omitted as in   for    or one like figure is put for another as    for    etc but by remembering this the place of the text may be
