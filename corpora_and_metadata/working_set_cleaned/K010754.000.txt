being the greatest wonder of the kind that ever appeared in this kingdom that all ranks of people receive a pleasing satisfaction that see him and express their surprise at his huge stature which he says exceeds that of any giant since the great goliath of gath whom david slew  this account must needs very much awaken the attention of our youth especially such as have no opportunity to see this big man i think myself therefore under an obligation to my young readers who have promoted the sale of my gigantick volumes to give them the history of this mighty christian goliath as he calls himself in which i hope to satisfy their curiosity to do honor to his giantship and at the same time vindicate the merit of my much respected friends and next neighbors the two giants in guildhall gogmagog and corinaeus  the history of the swedish giant chap i of the giants country birth parentage and education this swedish giant was born at oulo or ula a port town situated on the east side of the botnick bay in finland bordering on russia in the year   0  his fathers name was cajanus a man of a good character but better noted for his gigantick size than for family or fortune though without doubt he came from a race of giants which it is too troublesome at this time to trace to the original his mother likewise was of an uncommon height which exceeded seven feet and his sister now living is still taller who perhaps should she live to see her brother return and know his good luck may take it in her head to travel upon the same errand  of these great parents was our giant born and his size proves he was no bastard  his honest careful old father bestowed on him an education suitable to his own circumstances and his sons capacity for learning which never appeared very quick or lively and endeavored to plant in him whilst young the seeds of true honor and virtue he likewise brought him up to industry to work in the garden with the spade etc and to labor in the field in husbandry affairs and in short to get his bread by the sweat of his brow  as no extraordinary event attended his younger years he eat drank and played like other youth only more at a time and grew faster well pass over this part of his life and follow him to the next stage  chap ii of the giants falling in love with a farmers daughter named dolla rucina how he made known his passion to her father and what reception he met with  near to oulo lived awealthy farmer who had an only daughter of great beauty and possessed of all the virtues which render those charms the more amiable she was likewise trained from her infancy to industry by the care and example of a good mother who taught her to spin flax and wool to milk the kine to make cheese and butter and all that was necessary for the female part in the dairy the house the garden or the field so that she had no idle hours to spend in dress etc nor did she need it for nature had been very indulgent in plentifully bestowing graces to set her off without any art or fallacy  the perfections of this fair maid had taken deep root in our giants heart so that in her centered all his happiness he had demonstrated a good judgment in placing his affections on one so worthy but how to gain her was the point he suffered loves flame to smother a long time in his breast before he dared to undertake this adventure he was at this time a comely young man and though he was tall his stature might have been dispensed with had he ceased growing but his continuing to increase in bulk and  made him almost despair of success for he could not well expect  so  would venture herself with a man of so preposterous a size  notwithstanding these checks and repses which presented themselves concerning the difficulty of this undertaking he at length with the courage of a giant plucked up a good heart and ventured one pleasant evening to visit this fair damsel to whom he was not altogether a stranger she received him with great discretion and caution and he behaved with much politeness and good manners  after some little time he addressed himself to dolla rucinas father and with a graceful air told his errand and with great modesty desired his permission to visit his charming daughter the lovely dolla rucina and though his designs were strictly honorable he would not enter upon a business of so great a concern without his leave  the father answered thou have done well young man in first making known this affair unto me but what thou ask is of so great moment that it requires much consideration i cannot therefore immediately consent to what thou requirest till i have well weighed it in my own mind tell me therefore thy name parentage and place of abode the young giant answered my name is daniel cajanus son of the old cajanus of oulo an honest and reputable family replied the old man thy father was not unknown to me thou shall be welcome to my house and to such good cheer as it will afford  dolla rucinas parents entertained cajanus with bowls of most delicious cream pails of syllabub fresh cheese and butter all sorts of choice fruit that their garden or orchard produced with several kinds of refreshing liquors and what was more dear to him than all other delights a reception which gave him great hopes that one day he should obtain possession of the most lovely object of his affection  our young giant being thus fortunate in his first adventure often resorted to this fair maiden who as constantly received him and with her parents leave entertained him in the same generous manner plentifully and yet prudently regaling him with good cheer and a hearty welcome  chap iii how the giant was disappointed in gaining the fair dolla rucina and what followed  after a considerable time spent in courting the beautiful dolla rucina wherein success seemed to favor all cajanuss wishes and he even rioted in excess of pleasures the parents of this fair maid to whom she was very dear told her with much tenderness lest it should cause too great an uneasiness in her mind for she had during the visits of cajanus conceived a very good liking to his person his great bulk was the only objection and the remarks which the world made of the disproportion in their size that they should inform cajanus at his next visit that they could not approve of a match so unequal that they were sorry they had not broke it off sooner and advised their daughter no longer to entertain thoughts of marrying a man whose size exceeded all reason dolla rucina ever obedient to her parents promised them that she would no longer receive him upon that footing but as they commanded only  the great disproportion in their size had often given much disquietude to these lovers and interrupted their greatest and most innocent enjoyments long before dolla rucina had received this injunction from her father  she at this time reached but a little above cajanuss waste and was of an agreeable size and not likely to be taller he who already surpassed all mankind in height was still growing on apace as if he intended to tower above the skies  it was likewise a great mortification to the happiness of this unequal pair to hear themselves ridiculed upon that account by all the young people in the country round about to whom this courtship was well known and which afforded them much diversion  dolla rucina desired leave of her father that she herself might make this affair known to cajanus to which he freely consented  this fair damsel had that same evening resolution enough to tell cajanus all that her father and mother advised her to which was calculated for the good of them both and this she broke to him in the following manner  after a deep sigh she said dear cajanus thou have need to arm thyself with all the fortitude thou art master of lest what i have to tell thee wound so deep that it overwhelm thy poor spirit alas dolla rucina has this day received a strict charge from her parents no longer to entertain thee on any other terms than that of a friend this charge from my father is of so much consequence and concerns the happiness of us both that i cannot disobey it  cajanus at this news was struck dumb not one word could he utter till after some time he withdrew gave vent to his passion in a torrent of tears which flowed from his eyes in great abundance  dolla rucinas parents endeavored by reason to pacify his great grief but no arguments made any impression time only was to recover him  however in some little time he began to recollect himself to walk talk and use his reason and before his departure they regaled him with curds cream and other country fare as usual which cajanus was a dear lover of and fed pretty cheerfully upon  after this refreshment he bid adieu to his dear dolla rucina paid his respects to her worthy parents and then walked leisurely home with a belly brimful of good cheer a heart loaded with sorrow and a head full of thoughts of what had happened and of contriving what course to take this held him till he got home and to bed where he spent the night in uttering deep sighs and bitter groans grief and melancholy had seized his heart dejection was visible in his countenance  the friends of cajanus endeavored as dolla rucinas had done before to comfort him under this heavy trial but in vain he would yield to no persuasions they left him therefore to his own course which seemed fixed upon a firm resolution of visiting foreign parts  upon every disappointment which cajanus met with a natural sullenness followed which would yield to no arguments of reason but was forced to be left always to his own will to rectify this was the occasion of some extraordinary trouble both to himself and to his friends  chap iv of the giants resolving to leave his country how he was invited into the army and what followed  the disappointment which cajanus met with in his loveadventure was soon spread over the town of oulo and the neighboring villages that he became the jest of all the young people of those parts to whom this amor was well known he shut himself up therefore from society refusing any longer to appear in public and upon this account came to a fixed resolution of leaving his native place and visiting foreign climates  there happened at this time to be recruiting officers in the town of oulo who were raising men for the service of the king of sweden who was then about assembling a large army for the recovery of finland from the russians or some other important enterprise being spirited up by the artful contrivance of a mitred priest who was chief in the cabinet of a great prince  these officers being insormed of the giants design of going abroad endeavored to engage him to enter into the army to which end they tempted him with money they promised to get him promoted but neither of these allurements had any influence on cajanus  it was likewise strongly represented to him how much his king and country stood in need at that time of his service and the honor he might get to himself he was still deaf to all this and chose rather to leave his country and kindred exposed to the havoc and misery of war than to lend them his assistance  chap v how the example of some mighty giants of old was proposed to cajanus how be rejected them with disdain and whether this great swedish giant is not a very great coward  the first is goliath the great giant of gath who made the whole host of the israelites to quake even king saul himself who was taller than any man in his army and a valiant soldier too was afraid of this great philistine he went out day by day and vaunted out his insolent speeches and hold threats of picking their bones and giving their flesh to the fowls of the air and beasts of the  this put saul and his army into so great a panick that had it not been for the fortunate stone from the sling of young david the son of jesse it might have gained the philistine army the victory  the next is the strong and valiant sampson who when he was laid down to repose himself and his enemies were stealing unawares to seize him it was no sooner called out to him sampson the philistines are upon thee but he starts up lays hold of the first weapon in his way even the jaw bone of an ass with which he laid about him so fast that he smote them hip and thigh and after he had surveyed the slain he sat down and composed a song of triumph viz heaps upon heaps with the jaw bone of an ass i have slain a thousand men true courage never wants a weapon  we read in the history of the kings of israel of the mighty tachmonite named adino who slew eight hundred at one time and of eleazar the son of dodo who routed a whole army sacred writ mentions many such stout champions who devoted their service for the defense of their country profane history relates the same of all their great heroes  the noble actions of these brave old giants was no inducement to cajanus he was afraid of being placed in the front of the battle to have the rough music of musket balls whistling in his ears the thoughts of this was death to him how far short does this swedish giants courage fall of giant gogmagogs who even now in his old age will stand the fire of a whole regiment of our valiant city traindbands without winching and his stout brother corineus will do the same  giant cajanus would hearken to no proposals of going into the army and told the recruiting officers that he looked upon what they had promised as only to inveigle and trappan him and not in their power to perform and therefore gave them an absolute denial that he would not accept of a soldiers life and refused to be seen by them any more  as giant cajanus grew up he showed a lesser inclination to a military life than was expected for instead of a brave martial spirit of gaining glory in the field of war he had a natural aversion to the life of a soldier and chose rather to travel like a vagabond to show his great bulk for lucre which shows that the biggest men have not always the stoutest hearts  how pleasant would it have been for future ages to have read in the swedish chronicle of the glorious achievements of the great cajanus when he appeared in the day of battle in the fore front of the army that to him in a great measure might be owing victory against the russians  he might have been made to look very terrible and fierce by gracing his head with a stately strong helmet properly adorned which might have added to his stature two or three foot and given him a handsome and strong shield likewise to have fenced his body with armor of polished steel and a sword answerable to his great size so to have equipped him every way like a man of war and then if he had had no true courage of his own he might have pretended to vaunt it out with big words like the braggadocias of tottenhamcourt of what they can do though they never design to hurt their powerful antagonist such language perhaps might intimidate an enemy and thereby have gained advantage to themselves  giant cajanus had been privately informed that the recruiting officers expected an order to press him into the kings service he therefore agrees with the captain of a ship to carry him to holland  he immediately prepares for his voyage takes leave of all his friends and before his departure he went and took his last farewell of the charming dolla rucina and her good father and mother they gave him a hearty welcome so that having eat of their meat and drank of their nectar they embraced with great tenderness and bid a final adieu to each other  i should have told my readers that dolla rucina was now married to a young farmer whose father was lately dead and had left him in possession of a rich farm they were agreeable in size and circumstances and had the prospect of being a very happy couple in which state we shall leave her and trace the footsteps of young giant cajanus only  chap vi of what befell cajanus in his passage from finland to england  giant cajanus having provided all things necessary for this voyage and the ship being ready to fail went aboard as private as he could where ving stowed himself in the great cabin not caring to show himself till at sea the captain gave or ders to weigh anchor and set fail a fresh gale of wind springing up which soon run them out of sight of oulo and held favorable all down the botnick bay they had likewise good weather through the baltic sea  cajanus was well used by the captain who entertained him with his adventures in many voyages and travels to foreign parts and the dangers he escaped very pleasant to hear but too much to relate in this history cajanus in his turn entertained the captain with his own adventures by land these relations were often seasoned with good bowls of punch canns of flip and other refreshing liquors and thus they spent their time during a safe and quick passage to holland in which no real dangers or misfortunes happened exceptin a stiff gale of wind which they met with one evening off the coast of norway which obliged them to hand all their topfails and to fail under them three coasts there run a very great headsea and the sheets being close hauld she made but dull way through the water it was beside dark hazy weather the failors had often been in greater storms than that and so made light of it but the case of poor cajanus was quite different he expected nothing less than to be swallowed up every minute by the waves the ship sometimes heeld gunnel too which is common in a gale of wind this so much added to cajanuss fright to see the water come upon deck that he laid himself along and held fast by some ropes at the weatherside where he was continually sliding over to leeward and crawling back again and so like sisiphus with his stone his work was never done  the sailors endeavored to hearten him up at this time but nothing would do till cajanus saw the storm abate daylight appear and a brave bowl of punch before him he then looked as stout as the best man aboard the ship  cajanus arrived safe in holland and having made the best advantage he could there being told how fond the english people are of foreign novelties especially of a tame giant he might find his account in it if he would visit that country for he would be looked upon as a very great curiosity perhaps the biggest that ever was seen in that land  the giant being instructed how he should behave when he came over embarked for england where landing safe he set out privately for london and took up his residence at charing cross and having recovered himself from the fatigues of his journey began to publish his arrival  chap vii how giant cajanus sold himself to the renowned giant pinchbone one of the sons of tubalcain the inventer of a rich metal nearly resembling gold and how his master changed his name from cajanus to that of puss  upon the first notice of the arrival of this grant at charing cross his fame was soon spread over the whole town so that there was a great resort of persons of all ranks to see him at one shilling each which was a great profit to cajanus and an encouragement he ought to have been contented with  giant pinchbone who is better known for vivacity of parts and a penetrating genius than for enormous height or bulk of body visiting among other company and observing how well pleased every one was with the sight of him began presently to medltate and contrive how he might make advantage to himself by showing this huge man  in a little time by frequent visits he became so well acquainted with giant caianus that he observed him to be of a very covetous temper and therefore was to be attacked on that quarter accordingly an offer being made he soon listened to the proposal and at last agreed that giant pinchbone for a sum of money some say two hundred pounds should have the use of him for a certain time  six months as it is said to expose to view and to make what advantage he could by showing him articles being drawn up and signed the giant took the money the sight of which made him to smile and put it into a purse and that safe into his pocket this done he delivers himself body and soul whole and entire with the purchase money in his breeches into the hands of his master who was very well pleased with his bargain  giant pinchbone having got the full possession of the swedish giant into his own hands he presently changed his name to puff by publishing him to the world under all the exaggerating titles that his great genius could invent such as the greatest curiosity that ever was seen in this kingdom the surprising giant the wonderful colosius the christian goliath and many other swelled epithets and at length that he was speedily to se out for portugal by these means this son of tubca soon got his purchase money in again  chap viii how giant puff was afraid he had made a compact with the devil by what be had done and how his master delivered him from such terrible apprehensions  soon after puff had sold himself the devils agent came to pinchbone to see if he would part with him again and to know his price and what he was fit for when upon examination finding that he was no blacksmith wheelwright sawyer cooper carpenter joiner tailor nor any other serviceable trade he declined having any thing to do with him though his master was of more honor and knew better his own interest than to have sold him to the devil if his agent had liked him  the great giant puff was not so big a fool but he understood the agents business he grew very uneasy at what he had done and was afraid that he had already entered into articles with the devil he had read of persons selling themselves and making such compacts for a term of years at the end of which they were fetched away the thoughts hereof terribly frighted this mighty christian goliath  this threw the giant into despair he was jealous of his master and expected no other than the devil to send his agent for him his master endeavored to free him from these fears and to divert his mind promised to show him oxon etc by which means he in some measure recovered him from his melancholy  chap ix how puff s master carried him to the chief university of this kingdom and how he was received there  puffs master having satisfied his giants mind that his intentions were honorable provides a proper machine perhaps a chaise which travels without horses and conveys him safe to oxford where having furnished him with commodious longings and given him time to refresh and repose himself he gave notice of the giants arrival in that city which was no sooner made known but the curious from all parts flocked to see him especially the students of the university who were well satisfied with the sight of this living colossus they never before had seen any thing but the bones of dead giants such as long shins and thighs great ribs vast skulls etc they had read indeed of the philistine goliath of gath and his brothers and of the enormous size of og king of bashan and many more mentioned in holy writ and likewise some very monstrous big giants which the learned tell us of but here was a living proof of there being giants a man who measured in height eight foot four inches without shoes and could reach ten and a half and when he was in health his bulk was in proportion to that of his height sure this is demonstration enough to end all disputes about the existence of giants  i make no doubt but that there has appeared at different times all those that have been mentioned by historians though now by length of time they seem like monstrous and fabulous relations  chap x how some unlucky scholars had formed a plot for seizing the giant in one of his night perambulations and how he was delivered out of their hands and got safe to town  during the time that the swedish giant was at oxford some ingenious scholars who perhaps could not afford to pay for the sight of him entered into a design of seizing and carrying him by main force to some private place where they intended to have read a lecture upon this great man and to have examined him joint by joint and limb by limb in order therefore to put this scheme in execution it was agreed to seize him in one of his evening sallies it being customary for the giant to take a small airing when the city was in profound rest this plot was carried into execution by a few of them who were desperate and resolute they knew he had not courage to defend himself the giant being laid hold on was carried to a proper place and a watch set over him with a promise he should come to no harm if he would be quiet and the next day be set at liberty pinchbone his master used all the arguments he could think of to procure his giants liberty but nothing could prevail with them till he pulled out some of his curious metal toys which he distributed amongst them and which they took in reality for gold this so blinded their eyes that after they had a little satisfied their curiosity in viewing him from head to toe he was set at liberty which he had no sooner regained but he begged of his master to leave that city which he readily consented to and gave him a guide directly to london and discharged his lodging and followed him  giant puff whenever he heard any travelers either behind or before always stepped into the hedge and there stood upright which in the night looked like the body or trunk of an old tree by which cunning stratagem he escaped safe to town without any thing remarkable happening  he was conveyed to an apartment facing the mansion house where he remains this   th of august      under the circumstances described in the following chapter  the time being now expired that he sold himself for pinchbone like an honorable master delivered giant puff into his own hands to make the most of himself  chap xi of the present situation of giant puff with a description of him  this wonderful colossus is crammed like a maramotte in a box in a small close back room up one pair of stairs facing the mansion house where perhaps should he live to see it finished he may expect to be put into some post like gogmagog and corineus whether he has done any thing to deserve it or no but that point must be left to the consultation and determination of the heads of the city  here each little boy and girl pays sixpence for the sight of this big giant he is generally seated in a great chair suited to his bulk and dignity and ready to receive company his dress is a rich banjan after the turkish mode double breasted and ornamented with gold and girt round the waste with a splendid sash or girdle like that of giant gogs in guildhall all his other habit is answerable to this and exactly fitted to the gravity of a peaceable giant  having entered goliahs apartment paid obeisance to his giant majesty and surveyed him a little time sitting he begins to rouse for he generally seems drowsy which we may impute to illness he fills a glass of wine and drinks to himself for if any of the company are minded to drink with him they must send for their bottle he then rises up and surprises all spectators with his great height and bigness and having stalked backwards and forwards in his room half a dozen turns and entertained the company with a song in a voice as loud as the great pipe of a large organ and in a tune like tiddedoll over his gingerbread he drinks another glass and perhaps another if he fancies it then he shows how high he can reach answers civil questions and suffers some parts of his body to be measured and these are the chief exploits he performs excepting it be to snuff a candle or to let a fart  his height was eight foot four inches and the bigness of his body and limbs was once in just proportion but now his legs are gouty and ill shapen his knees knock together his body bowed that it seems painful for him to stretch or raise himself up his head likewise hung down and his cheeks are pinched his looks fickly and all his parts greatly wasted his hands and fingers are very long and slender his feet and toes the same  he is now thirty three years of age and has been done growing about eight  i have now my young readers given you the state and way of life of this gigantick young man who for the sake of a little lucre has destroyed his health wanting air and exercise whereas with a proper use of his parts and due care he might have lived to have been an old robust giant and descended to his grave laden with honors and renown as the brave giants of old time  and it was in order to prevent his being utterly ten to the world as also to oblige my young readers that i have been at the pains to publish this gigantick history of his life and i doubt not but i shall be as handsomely rewarded for it as i was for writing that of the two giants my worthy next neighbors old gogmagog and corineus  he is now attended by physicians and surgeons and is in such a dangerous way as seems to forebode a speedy dissolution  but lest this melancholy relation should too much affect the tenderhearted reader let us hasten to the next chapter  chap xii a story of the giants going to see a review his being made an ensign in the army and how be quitted his colors  as i would no ways derogate from our giants reputation for exploits in war i think myself obliged to relate a story i have lately heard though i cannot attest the truth of it it is this  there being a review of the troops assembled in finland the giant was persuaded by some of his acquaintance to go to see it the handsome appearance the officers etc made was much admired by all that saw them this fine sight so well pleased cajanus for so we may now call him as he is his own master again that he accepted of an ensigns place on promise that if he disliked a soldiers life he should be at liberty to quit the service  he being measured clothed and armed entered into present pay but he stalked about very awkardly in his new equipments and seldom in his proper place  cajanuss brother officers soon perceived that though he was of a great bulk he wanted courage on which account he could do but little good in the front of an army excepting to look big and to help scare an enemy that did not know him but the front was a post that great goliath could by no means like except at a review and in time of peace  in short even the common soldiers took upon them to make game of this tall ensign nay challenged and affronted him continually knowing he had not the heart to resent it  after a little time a rumor was spread that the russians were arming designing to drive the swedes out of finland  upon this news some of the young officers who looked so gay at the review fell sick others sold or flung up their commissions cajanus for his part neither asked leave to quit nor tried to ell but threw down his flag and got away in the night as fast as he could  chap xiii how the giant went to visit gogmagog and corineus in guildhall  it happened that during the time this mighty swedish giant was his own master he was presented with the gigantick history of the two famous giants in guildhall london at the sight of which  is impossible to express his surprise and delight but upon hearing it read his countenance fell and he was much alarmed lest he should not appear to great a curiosity as he would fain make the world believe he was informed that they were giants of nice honor but no ways quarrelsome unless they were first affronted upon this he resolved to make them a visit in a private manner to see if he could discern any lineaments of his ancestors or kindred in their faces accordingly he squeezed himself into a coach sitting almost double and drove close to guildhall as he entered the great door he had presently the satisfaction of seeing and paying obeisance to gogmagog and corineus those two brave old city champions he was somewhat abashed at the fierceness of their looks their warlike habits and stately deportment in which he saw nothing that was akin to himself the two old giants stood stiff to their posts taking very little notice of him he appearing to them more like the ghost of a giant than any thing else and though he came just about twelve aclock as if he expected an invitation to dinner when they stepped down he was entirely disappointed if he did perhaps they might have but short commons that day or might judge by his looks that he would with much more intrepidity attack a sheep than he would a lion  the people began to gather about the strange giant from all parts of the hall but he not caring to be stard at too much strides gently up to the bookscilers next the giants looked at his books then turns himself round and without saying one word takes two or three colossus strides across the hall into the coach and away he goes the people gazing after him as if they had seen the apparition of some giant which has been said to happen before their death  now methinks i hear the giant upon hearing this read to him mutter in broken english a lie a lie a lie be that as it will the next time he comes to guildhall without giving notice he will be in danger of being squeezed into littleease  chap xiv how well pleased giant puff will be at the reading of this history how many handfuls of little boys and girls sixpences he will give the author for writing of it and whether he will not set down all the fibs the gigantick author has told and puff them up  and how the two famous giants at guildhall being maintained at the public charge for their past services are still to be seen for nothing and do not intend to travel into foreign countries  and how their histories in two volumes are sold for fourpence each finely bound in the said guildhall just by them  and how likewise the curiosities in the tower two volumes the history of st pauls cathedral two volumes and westminster abbey two volumes finely bound may be all had at the same place and price  there is a great report of another surprising giant of our own nation being lately returned from his travels and how he pretends on a clear day that he can see much farther into a millstone than his neighbors and that he will teach this art to others and how he visits all the country round about to puff eyes in or puff them out and how the mighty deeds which he has done shall be penned down if this should run and how   here is an end of this book
