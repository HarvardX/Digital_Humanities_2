an elegy on the death of an amiable young lady with an epistle from menalcas to lycidas to which are prefixed three critical recommendatory letters  edinburgh printed by a donaldson and j reid for alex donaldson mdcclxi  advertisement the world is obliged to an unknown author for the following excellent poems they were sent to mr donaldson with intention to be published in the second volume of his collection of poems which will appear next winter but upon being examined by some gentlemen of taste they were thought to have so much merit that they are here offered to the public by themselves as none need be ashamed of encouraging genius the gentlemen whose opinions were consulted have permitted them to be printed with the initials of their names it is to be hoped that any inaccuracies in the letters will be excused as they were wrote in a great hurry with little regard to style being indeed nothing more than the warm overflowings of souls susceptible of the ravishing beauties of genuine poetry  to the honorable a e my dear sir i am just now favored with your obliging letter enclosing some copies of verses i return you thanks for the favorable opinion you entertain of my taste but permit me to say that c  n e  has no occasion to call in the aid of any other judgment to enable him to determine the merit of works of taste and genius especially of the poetic kind a good author must necessarily be a sound critic and one who discovers so much fire and at the same time correctness in his own productions is well qualified to judge of the beauties and defects of others but as extreme modesty is often the attendant of consummate merit i suppose you dont care to rely solely on your own judgment in a matter of this consequence you are anxious that mr donaldsons collection should be uniform and that the second volume should contain nothing unworthy of the first for which reason perhaps you with to have your own opinion of these two poems confirmed by mine on which i am afraid you rely more than it deserves probably the laws of parnassus like those of our own country require two witnesses to ascertain any fact of importance  but to proceed i am astonished how during this long preamble i have been able to suppress those exclamations of applause which i utter insensibly every time i read or think of these poems by heavens i never saw any thing that pleased me more nor do i know to which the preference is due in the elegy however i am apt to think the authors genius appears most conspicuously and if i am not mistaken his turn rather leads him to the plaintive strains of terence than to the gay and animated compositions of tibullus the subject too is happily chosen the bard seems to be young and what subject suits the warm imagination and delicate sensibility of a juvenile poet better than the early premature and unexpected death of a lady for whom he probably entertained the most refined affection it is upon occasions of this kind that a poet can give way to those emotions of grief and anguish which never fail to affect every reader of taste with sadness and melancholy when the mind is truly agitated it despises trivial ornaments it overlooks small inaccuracies to this is to be imputed your meeting with nothing very ornamented or figurative in the diction and now and then with a hard word ill spelled and worse chosen does not the native simplicity of the poet in a thousand instances atone for these defects thou numbered lies among the numerous dead   how pretty is that recurrence of numbers in the same line yet happily is it varied and if you will try as mr sheridan directs you to pronounce these words frequently you will observe how trippingly they go off the tongue numerous number numerous number and there is a cadence on the last syllable ber that i defy you not to pronounce you may observe also the propriety of the epithet numerous when applied to the dead  the conclusion also is most tender and affecting and contains that abruptness and those repetitions which constitute the language of grief adieu  adieu  a long  a last farewell   i have only to add that instead of advising mr donaldson to reserve these poems for his collection or even indeed in compliance with the authors request to bury them in a magazine i should think he would do both himself and the author more justice to publish them on a small detached quarto of two or three pages by this means they would be universally known and admired and would certainly add luster and eclat to the collection in which they should afterward appear it is by this obvious and ingenious method that my good friend mr dodsley at london has established his reputation as a man of taste enriched himself and become the only bookseller in that city really known to and esteemed by people of fashion and rank in great haste i submit these observations to you but i wish you would also consult mr b  who really has a very sound judgment in matters of this kind  i have the honor to be dear sir your most obedient servant g d edinb aug        to g d esquire dear sir i have just now received your epistle which contains i think the most candid criticism i ever saw i was only sorry to see it so short every line of poetry i am sure deserves two of observations but what i am remarkably pleased with is the strange coincidence between your sentiments and mine i may really and with truth say that the first time i beheld you i saw in your face a true feeling and just relish of the fine arts particularly poetry poetry sent down by the gods to cheer us in this gloomy forlorn and dreary waste of life i saw numbers both blank verses and rhymes imprinted upon your countenance and if you had presented me with an epic poem superior to homers i should not have been surprised euripides the famous greek poet has a line so agreeable to what i am saying that i cannot forbear sending you a translation of it apollo lightned in his catgrey eyes   in fact the only way of judging the merit of a poet is by his eyes it was in this manner homer was found out although he was blind your modesty has i know as yet only suffered you to publish in the scots magazine but alas one might as well pretend to exhibit a little cow as a show in the highlands of scotland a purse of gold as somewhat remarkable on the coast of guinea or a t  d as an extraordinary spectacle in the streets of edinburgh as endeavor to become conspicuous in that illfated collection would you believe it sir a fable of mine full of the naivette or simplicity absolutely necessary in that species of composition after being inserted there was never with astonishment i speak it and with amazement you shall hear it i say never heard of more lost like a goodly city suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake like a louse annihilated in a large fire or a human excrement dropped in a full capacious chamberpot oh my friend let this deter you and for heavens sake choose some other methods of making your compositions public in this case what expedient so readily offers as making use of the humane and benevolent mr d  a gentleman who like a friendly star helps every dark and benighted poet into the haven of general approbation by his help the rays of my genius have diverged with uncommon and rapid streams of luminary particles into the remotest and most unenlightened corners of these kingdoms by his assistance mr b  is to fix the nave of that wheel whose spokes will reach such a prodigious distance would to god we three could live to latest posterity and be witnesses of our applause from ages yet to come world without end praise is the food of poets notwithstanding mr d  frequently gives them very good dinners this of course brings me back to the subject of this letter which i did not think so soon to have entered upon as i had a few more points to discuss but to proceed the bard of whose poems we have been all this time talking seems to possess the true elegiac humanity of glutheros who flourished before or about the time of homer it is true he is not so merry as lucretius nor so sad as horace neither is he altogether so soft and tender as juvenal in his satires he is not quite so simplex in his munditiis as lucan neither has his work the modern air of the old poet ennius but these are slight faults i cannot pretend to say whether he writes elegies like terence as i never saw that book in which they are contained the only copy of which they say is lodged in the bend of the hanging tower at pisa see father montfaucons antiquities of italy  here i cannot help regretting that i have as yet traveled very little how happy are you sir in that respect i think it was at rome you got your copy of the great glutheros which is an invaluable curiosity for my part i once drank a glass of old hock out of buchanans head at copenhagen which was the only remarkable incident that happened me in a long voyage up the mediterranean i agree with you in thinking that the bard of whom we have all this time been talking discovers here and there a noble negligence of grammar and spelling this is what mr pope calls who by the by was a very bad poet catching a grace beyond the reach of art but these two arts as mr sheridan says i am afraid we know little about i dare say he goes upon sure ground and has good reasons for what he does not that i have any particular reason for saying so the epistle after the elegy seems to be much in the style of pliny there is nothing like it in our language easy and pathetic sublime and natural it presents us with a picture of love and friendship not to be parallelled it is really a capital piece these two poems ought indeed to be printed separately i must here conclude but i first congratulate mr d  on this i may say the second revival of letters i did not indeed think of being guilty of the fault which i accused you of in the beginning of my letter but as i intend to dine with you today i shall resume this subject when i take leave of you  i am sir your most obedient humble servant a e canongate one oclock to the honorable a e  dear sir accept the most sincere thanks of a mind full of gratitude for the favor you have this day loaded me with the exquisite entertainment which i have received from the perusal of the enclosed poems is rather to be conceived than expressed the critical letters upon these pieces by mr d  and yourself i admire beyond measure the greatest compliment i can pay them is to tell without disguise the simple or to use a better word naked truth which is that i could read them with some degree of satisfaction even after an immediate perusal of the poems themselves  i congratulate with my country that we now behold with eyes full of intrepid wonder and premature astonishment such a poet and such critics  it is doing me too much honor to be classed with mr e  and mr d  of both whose abilities the world has already had and is likely to have so many glaring proofs whilst i can only aspire to the appellation of as it were a hackneycoachman of helicon you see i am apt to run into the figurative style which i hope you will impute to an imagination heated by a recent perusal of superlative poesy  dear sir why do you ask me to give my opinion  or indeed what other opinion can i give than what has already been so amply given  but as you insist upon my saying something i shall do so  the elegy is perhaps the completest thing of the kind i have ever seen even you c  n e  who plume yourself so much on your tender sighing breathing and speaking lines must not be offended though i frankly own that you have not gone so great lengths as this gentleman  the pride of prime is an expression which you have not as yet attained to i question much if you ever will  the ingenious author of an essay on the sublime and beautiful gives it as his opinion that a certain inflated and incohesive rotundity of diction is one of the leading sources of what is grand and lofty our author has certainly reached that dizzy summit in this memorable line to such majestic such exalting strains   the epistle affords a striking example of the elevated style  at first indeed i imagined our author had been a plagiary and stolen whole stanzas from drydens alexanders feast  but upon comparing the two poems together with all the attention and accuracy that i possibly could i discovered that i lay under a very palpable mistake and had done the author much injustice for so far has he been from stooping to filch from jack dryden as the present bishop of bangor used to say that upon my word there was not the least atom of similarity either in thought or language  i had almost forgot to take notice of one peculiar circumstance which has eluded the penetration of you as well as that of mr d  although it is perhaps as material a perfection as any in the whole work and that is the mention that is made of wilkie whose poem called the epigoniad we have with infinite regret beheld but too too much neglected  does it not kindle a flame in every patriot breast to think that now the modern epic poem of scotland shall stand upon a firm basis shall swim in a pellucid whirlpool when it is at last hoisted upon the shoulders of a brobdignagian genius according to swift or rather to use the words of sir william temple in his history of the netherlands when it is held forth to the applause and admiration of posterity by a giant of parnassus  i entirely agree with my two good friends and fellowrhymsters that mr donaldson should make a distinct publication of them as they will by this means be better known and consequently more universally applied to use by every reader of any discernment  i cannot conclude without an eulogium upon the justness and propriety of that line when drawing to a close he exclaims with all the rapture and poetic fury of the pythian priestess i cease i cease the empty lay i am persuaded no human mortal can possibly read this without a conscious homefelt satisfaction  i have now trespassed too long on your patience so shall break off with assuring you that i am  your most humble servant j  b   to the editor of the scottish poems sir if the designed volumes of the scotch poems are not fully completed you will please insert amongst them the two following pieces should they deserve a place there i had a few more which i was designing to have got ready for that purpose but was prevented by some other more material concerns if any further volumes are to be hereafter printed you will signify it by a note in the present printing volume   i am sir yours etc j  b  strathaven july         an elegy on the death of an amiable young lady while others sing the heroes glorious fate and tune to warlike strains the sounding lyre their noble lives their fearless deaths relate their gallant deeds which wake the muses fire while british bards to wolfes immortal praise rehearse his victories and fatal doom and as his monument the sculptors raise spread freshest garlands on their warriors tomb let me whose humbler muse has never aspired to such majestic such exalting strains by elegiac song be now inspired and mourn a virgin snatched from these plains sweet wast thou as the opening summers rose too just an emblem of thee lovely maid which in the morning buds at midday blows but withers by the chilly evnings shade calm and serene thou led thy peaceful life religions sacred task thy only boast unknown to stormy passion or to strife thou lived in every good in friendship most amid the joyful gaiety of youth the christians dignity thou still preserved trod all the paths of piety and truth nor in thy actions nor thy precepts swerved snatched from this low inhospitable clime while fortune smiled upon thy cheerful head even in the pride and flower of youthful prime thou numbered lies among the numerous dead thy lovely sisters and thy aged sire in deep distress thy hapless fate deplore praise thy past life and while they praise admire and wail their charming friend alas no more no costly monument adorns thy tomb no panegyric spreads thy humble fame nor verses carved upon the sculptured dome transmit to after times thy virtuous name often as the circling sun returns the day on which thou mounted to the realms of rest unto thy lonely grave i will yearly hie and bid the turf lie easy on thy breast i will sprinkle flowers of every richest dye and deck thy grave with wreaths of liveliest hue then shed a tear and breathe the heaving sigh to sacred friendship sure so much is due farewell my charmer peace attend thy rest thou who in virtue did so much excel for this i hail thee blessed  supremely blessed adieu  adieu  a long  a last farewell lycidas to menalcas while you in natures works explore the wonders of almighty power and curious floras works survey while by your native streams you stray from forthas banks to you i send the warmest wishes of a friend despise not then these humble lays a friend excites your partial praise a friend  how the melodious name with nameless rapture trills my frame what though the feeble muse detains your ardent thought from nobler strains yet friendships soft alluring joys with secret charms inchant your eyes now summer decks the russet plains how sweet how fair the rural scenes say can the weak attempts of art like nature charm the glowing heart can the coquet in dress how fair with yonder lilys breast compare such  such menalcas were our themes while by fair glottas lovely streams we often prolonged the pleasant walk by decent mirth and social talk such were our themes when we surveyed new beauties in each lengthening mead when evening closed the setting day how often did our footsteps stray over the gay banks of silver clyde where natures native charms reside ofttimes in the enameled mead or seated in a leafy shade sweet poetry our senses charmed and our imaginations warmed what time in wilkies flowing strains wilkie the homer of our plains we viewed the fair aetolian maid by love by too fond love betrayed love too did often our speech employ love the pure source of social joy love  but what visions strike mine eyes what forms what heavenly forms arise ammonia here  ah me excuse the sallies of a wanton muse that flies on fancys wing away i cease  i cease the empty lay farewell my friend  ye zephyrs bear my wishes to menalcas ear finis
