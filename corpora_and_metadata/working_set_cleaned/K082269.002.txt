cecilia or memoirs of an heiress  by the author of evelina  in five volumes  vol ii  london printed for t pain and son at the mewsgate and t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxii  cecilia book iii chapter i an application cecilia upon her return home heard with some surprise that mr and mrs harrel were by themselves in the drawing room and while she was upon the stairs mrs harrel ran out calling eagerly is that my brother  before she could make an answer mr harrel in the same impatient tone exclaimed is it mr arnott  no said cecilia did you expect him so late expect him yes answered mr harrel i have expected him the whole evening and cannot conceive what he has done with himself  it is abominably provoking said mrs harrel that he should be out of the way just now when he is wanted however i dare say tomorrow will do as well  i dont know that cried mr harrel reeves is such a wretch that i am sure he will give me all the trouble in his power  here mr arnott entered and mrs harrel called out o brother we have been distressed for you cruelly we have had a man here who has plagued mr harrel to death and we wanted you sadly to speak to him  i should have been very glad said mr arnott to have been of any use and perhaps it is not yet too late who is the man  o cried mr harrel carelessly only a fellow from that rascally tailor who has been so troublesome to me lately he has had the impudence because i did not pay him the moment he was pleased to want his money to put the bill into the hands of one reeves a griping attorney who has been here this evening and thought proper to talk to me pretty freely i can tell the gentleman i shall not easily forget his impertinence however i really wish mean time i could get rid of him  how much is the bill sir said mr arnott  why its rather a round sum but i dont know how it is ones bills mount up before one is aware those fellows charge such confounded sums for tape and buckram i hardly know what i have had of him and yet he has run me up a bill of between three and four hundred pound  here there was a general silence till mrs harrel said brother cannot you be so good as to lend us the money mr harrel says he can pay it again very soon  o yes very soon said mr harrel for i shall receive a great deal of money in a little time i only want to stop this fellows mouth for the present  suppose i go and talk with him said mr arnott  o he is a brute a stock cried mr harrel nothing but the money will satisfy him he will hear no reason one might as well talk to a stone  mr arnott now looked extremely distressed but upon his sisters warmly pressing him not to lose any time he gently said if this person will but wait a week or two i should be extremely glad for really just now i cannot take up so much money without such particular loss and inconvenience that i hardly know how to do it  but yet if he will not be appeased he must certainly have it  appeased cried mr harrel you might as well appease the sea in a storm he is hard as iron  mr arnott then forcing a smile though evidently in much uneasiness said he would not fail to raise the money the next morning and was taking his leave when cecilia shocked that such tenderness and goodnature should be thus grossly imposed upon hastily begged to speak with mrs harrel and taking her into another room said i beseech you my dear friend let not your worthy brother suffer by his generosity permit me in the present exigence to assist mr harrel my having such a sum advanced can be of no consequence but i should grieve indeed that your brother who so nobly understands the use of money should take it up at any particular disadvantage  you are vastly kind said mrs harrel and i will run and speak to them about it but which ever of you lends the money mr harrel has assured me he shall pay it very soon  she then returned with the proposition mr arnott strongly opposed it but mr harrel seemed rather to prefer it yet spoke so confidently of his speedy payment that he appeared to think it a matter of little importance from which he accepted it a generous contest ensued between mr arnott and cecilia but as she was very earnest she at length prevailed and settled to go herself the next morning into the city in order to have the money advanced by mr briggs who had the management of her fortune entirely to himself her other guardians never interfering in the executive part of her affairs  this arranged they all retired  and then with increasing astonishment cecilia reflected upon the ruinous levity of mr harrel and the blind security of his wife she saw in their situation danger the most alarming and in the behavior of mr harrel selfishness the most inexcusable such glaring injustice to his creditors such utter insensibility to his friends took from her all wish of assisting him though the indignant compassion with which she saw the easy generosity of mr arnott so frequently abused had now for his sake merely induced her to relieve him  she resolved however as soon as the present difficulty was surmounted to make another attempt to open the eyes of mrs harrel to the evils which so apparently threatened her and press her to exert all her influence with her husband by means both of example and advice to retrench his expenses before it should be absolutely too late to save him from ruin  she determined also at the same time that she applied for the money requisite for this debt to take up enough for discharging her own bill at the booksellers and putting in execution her plan of assisting the hills  the next morning she arose early and attended by her servant set out for the house of mr briggs purposing as the weather was clear and frosty to walk through oxford road and then put herself into a chair and hoping to return to mr harrels by the usual hour of breakfast  she had not proceeded far before she saw a mob gathering and the windows of almost all the houses filling with spectators she desired her servant to enquire what this meant and was informed that the people were assembling to see some malefactors pass by in their way to tyburn  alarmed at this intelligence from the fear of meeting the unhappy criminals she hastily turned down the next street but found that also filling with people who were running to the scene she was trying to avoid encircled thus every way she applied to a maid servant who was standing at the door of a large house and begged leave to step in till the mob was gone by the maid immediately consented and she waited here while she sent her man for a chair  he soon arrived with one but just as she returned to the street door a gentleman who was hastily entering the house standing back to let her pass suddenly exclaimed miss beverley and looking at him she perceived young delvile  i cannot stop an instant cried she running down the steps lest the crowd should prevent the chair from going on  will you not first said he handing her in tell me what news you have heard  news repeated she no i have heard none  you will only then laugh at me for those officious offers you did so well to reject  i know not what offers you mean  they were indeed superfluous and therefore i wonder not you have forgotten them shall i tell the chairmen whither to go  to mr briggs but i cannot imagine what you mean  to mr briggs repeated he o live for ever french beads and bristol stones fresh offers may perhaps be made there impertinent officious and useless as mine  he then told her servant the direction and making his bow went into the house she had just quitted  cecilia extremely amazed by this short but unintelligible conversation would again have called upon him to explain his meaning but found the crowd increasing so fast that she could not venture to detain the chair which with difficulty made its way to the adjoining streets but her surprise at what had passed so entirely occupied her that when she stopped at the house of mr briggs she had almost forgotten what had brought her thither  the footboy who came to the door told her that his master was at home but not well  she desired he might be acquainted that she wished to speak to him upon business and would wait upon him again at any hour when he thought he should be able to see er  the boy returned with an answer that she might call again the next week  cecilia knowing that so long a delay would destroy all the kindness of her intention determined to write to him for the money and therefore went into the parlour and desired to have pen and ink  the boy after making her wait some time in a room without any fire brought her a pen and a little ink in a broken tea cup saying master begs you will not spirt it about for he is got no more and all our blackings as good as gone  blacking repeated cecilia  yes miss when masters shoes are blacked we commonly gets a little drap of fresh ink  cecilia promised to be careful but desired him to fetch her a sheet of paper  law miss cried the boy with a grin i dare say mastered as soon give you a bit of his nose howsever i will go ax  in a few minutes he again returned and brought in his hand a slate and a black lead pencil miss cried he master says how you may write upon this for he supposes you have no great matters to y  cecilia much astonished at this extreme parsimony was obliged to consent but as the point of the pencil was very blunt desired the boy to get her a knife that she might cut it he obeyed but said pray miss take care it bent known for master dont do such a thing once in a year and if he knowd i would got you the knife he would go nigh to give me a good polt of the head  cecilia then wrote upon the slate her desire to be informed in what manner she should send him her receipt for  00 l which she begged to have instantly advanced  the boy came back grinning and holding up his hands and said miss there is a fine piece of work up stairs masters in a peck of troubles but he says how he will come down if you will stay till he is got his things on  does he keep his bed then i hope i have not made him rise  no miss he dont keep his bed only he must get ready for he wears no great matters of clothes when he is alone you are to know miss lowering his voice that that day as he went abroad with our sweeps clothes on he comed home in sich a pickle you never see i believe somebodyd knocked him in the kennel so does moll but dont you say as i teld you he is been special bad ever since moll and i was as glad as could be because he is so plaguey sharp for to let you know miss he is so near it is partly a wonder how he lives at all and yet he is worth a power of money too  well well said cecilia not very desirous to encourage his forwardness if i want any thing i will call for you  the boy however glad to tell his tale went on  our moll will not stay with him above a week longer miss because she says how she cannot get nothing to eat but just some old stinking salt meat that is stayed in the butchers shop so long it would make a horse sick to look at it but molls pretty nice howsever miss to let you know we dont get a good meal so often as once a quarter why this last week we have not had nothing at all but some dry musty red herrings so you may think miss we are kept pretty sharp  he was now interrupted by hearing mr briggs coming down the stairs upon which abruptly breaking off his complaints he held up his finger to his nose in token of secrecy and ran hastily into the kitchen  the appearance of mr briggs was by no means rendered more attractive by illness and negligence of dress he had on a flannel gown and night cap his black beard of many days growth was long and grim and upon his nose and one of his cheeks was a large patch of brown paper which as he entered the room he held on with both his hands  cecilia made many apologies for having disturbed him and some civil enquiries concerning his health  ay ay cried he pettishly bad enough all along of that trumpery masquerade wish i had not gone fool for my pains  when were you taken ill sir  met with an accident got a fall broke my head like to have lost my wig wish the masquerade at old nick thought it would cost nothing or would not have gone warrant shant get me so soon to another  did you fall in going home sir  ay ay plump in the kennel could hardly get out of it felt myself a going was afraid to tear my clothes knew the rascal would make me pay for them so by holding up the old sack come bolt on my face off pops my wig could not tell what to do all as dark as pitch  did not you call for help  nobody by but scrubs knew they would not help for nothing scrawled out as i could groped about for my wig found it at last all soused in the mud stuck to my head like turners cerate  i hope then you got into an hackney coach  what for to make things worse was not bad enough hay  must pay two shillings beside  but how did you find yourself when you got home sir  how why wet as muck my head all bumps my cheek all cut my nose big as two forced to wear a plaster half ruined in vinegar got a great cold put me in a fever never been well since  but have you had no advice sir should not you send for a physician  what to do hay fill me with jallop can get it myself cannot i had one once was taken very bad thought should have popt off began to flinch sent for the doctor proved nothing but a cheat cost me a guinea gave it at fourth visit and he never came again  warrant will not have no more  then perceiving upon the table some dust from the black lead pencil what is here cried he angrily who is been cutting the pencil wish they were hanged suppose its the boy deserves to be horsewhipped give him a good banging  cecilia immediately cleared him by acknowledging she had herself been the culprit  ay ay cried he thought as much all the time guessed how it was nothing but ruin and waste sending for money nobody knows why wanting  00 l  what to do throw it in the dirt never heard the like shant have it promise you that nodding his head shall not have no such thing  shant have it cried cecilia much surprised why not sir  keep it for your husband get you one soon will not have no juggling dont be in a hurry one in my eye  cecilia then began a very earnest expostulation assuring him she really wanted the money for an occasion which would not admit of delay  her remonstrances however he wholly disregarded telling her that girls knew nothing of the value of money and ought not to be trusted with it that he would not hear of such extravagance and was resolved not to advance her a penny  cecilia was both provoked and confounded by a refusal so unexpected and as she thought herself bound in honor to mr harrel not to make known the motive of her urgency she was for some time totally silenced till recollecting her account with the bookseller she determined to rest her plea upon that persuaded that he could not at least deny her money to pay her own bills  he heard her however with the utmost contempt books he cried what do you want with books do no good all lost time words get no cash  she informed him his admonitions were not too late as she had already received them and must therefore necessarily pay for them  no no cried he send em back that is best keep no such rubbish will not turn to account do better without em  that sir will be impossible for i have had them some time and cannot expect the bookseller to take them again  must must cried he cannot help himself glad to have em too are but a minor cannot be made pay a farthing  cecilia with much indignation heard such fraud recommended and told him she could by no means consent to follow his advice but she soon found to her utter amazement that he steadily refused to give her any other or to bestow the slightest attention upon her expostulations sturdily saying that her uncle had left her a noble estate and he would take care to see it put in proper hands by getting her a good and careful husband  i have no intention no wish sir cried she to break into the income or estate left me by my uncle on the contrary i hold them sacred and think myself bound in conscience never to live beyond them but the  0000 l bequeathed me by my father i regard as more peculiarly my own property and therefore think myself at liberty to dispose of it as i please  what cried he in a rage make it over to a scrubby bookseller give it up for an old pothook no no will not suffer it shant be shant be i say if you want some books go to moorfields pick up enough at an old stall get em at twopence apiece dear enough too  cecilia for some time hoped he was merely indulging his strange and sordid humor by an opposition that was only intended to teize her but she soon found herself extremely mistaken he was immovable in obstinacy as he was incorrigible in avarice he neither troubled himself with enquiries nor reasoning but was contented with refusing her as a child might be refused by peremptorily telling her she did not know what she wanted and therefore should not have what she asked  and with this answer after all that she could urge she was compelled to leave the house as he complained that his brown paper plaster wanted fresh dipping in vinegar and he could stay talking no longer  the disgust with which this behavior filled her was doubled by the shame and concern of returning to the harrels with her promise unperformed she deliberated upon every method that occurred to her of still endeavoring to serve them but could suggest nothing except trying to prevail upon mr delvile to interfere in her favor she liked not indeed the office of solicitation to so haughty a man but having no other expedient her repugnance gave way to her generosity and she ordered the chairmen to carry her to st jamess square  chap ii a perplexity and here at the door of his fathers house and just ascending the steps she perceived young delvile  again cried he handing her out of the chair surely some good genius is at work for me this morning  she told him she should not have called so early now she was acquainted with the late hours of mrs delvile but that she merely meant to speak with his father for two minutes upon business  he attended her up stairs and finding she was in haste went himself with her message to mr delvile and soon returned with an answer that he would wait upon her presently  the strange speeches he had made to her when they first met in the morning now recurring to her memory she determined to have them explained and in order to lead to the subject mentioned the disagreeable situation in which he had found her while she was standing up to avoid the sight of the condemned malefactors  indeed cried he in a tone of voice somewhat incredulous and was that the purpose for which you stood up  certainly sir  what other could i have  none surely said he smiling but the accident was singularly opportune  opportune cried cecilia staring how opportune this is the second time in the same morning that i am not able to understand you  how should you understand what is so little intelligible  i see you have some meaning which i cannot fathom why else should it be so extraordinary that i should endeavor to avoid a mob or how could it be opportune that i should happen to meet with one  he laughed at first without making any answer but perceiving she looked at him with impatience he half gayly half reproachfully said whence is it that young ladies even such whose principles are most strict seem universally in those affairs where their affections are concerned to think hypocrisy necessary and deceit amiable and hold it graceful to disavow today what they may perhaps mean publicly to acknowledge tomorrow  cecilia who heard these questions with unfeigned astonishment looked at him with the utmost eagerness for an explanation  do you so much wonder he continued that i should have hoped in miss beverley to have seen some deviation from such rules and have expected more openness and candor in a young lady who has given so noble a proof of the liberality of her mind and understanding  you amaze me beyond measure cried she what rules what candor what liberality do you mean  must i speak yet more plainly and if i do will you bear to hear me  indeed i should be extremely glad if you would give me leave to understand you  and may i tell you what has charmed me as well as what i have presumed to wonder at  you may tell me any thing if you will but be less mysterious  forgive then the frankness you invite and let me acknowledge to you how greatly i honor the nobleness of your conduct surrounded as you are by the opulent and the splendid unshackled by dependence unrestrained by authority blessed by nature with all that is attractive by situation with all that is desirable  to slight the rich and disregard the powerful for the purer pleasure of raising oppressed merit and giving to desert that wealth in which alone it seemed deficient  how can a spirit so liberal be sufficiently admired or a choice of so much dignity be too highly extolled  i find cried cecilia i must forbear any further enquiry for the more i hear the less i understand  pardon me then cried he if here i return to my first question whence is it that a young lady who can think so nobly and act so disinterestedly should not be uniformly great simple in truth and unaffected in sincerity why should she be thus guarded where frankness would do her so much honor why blush in owning what all others may blush in envying  indeed you perplex me intolerably cried cecilia with some vexation why sir will you not be more explicit  and why madam returned he with a laugh would you tempt me to be more impertinent have i not said strange things already  strange indeed cried she for not one of them can i comprehend  pardon then cried he and forget them all i scarce know myself what urged me to say them but i began inadvertently without intending to go on and i have proceeded involuntarily without knowing how to stop the fault however is ultimately your own for the sight of you creates an insurmountable desire to converse with you and your conversation a propensity equally incorrigible to take some interest in your welfare  he would then have changed the discourse and cecilia ashamed of pressing him further was for some time silent but when one of the servants came to inform her that his master meant to wait upon her directly her unwillingness to leave the matter in suspense induced her somewhat abruptly to say perhaps sir you are thinking of mr belfield  a happy conjecture cried he but so wild a one i cannot but marvel how it should occur to you  well sir said she i must acknowledge i now understand your meaning but with respect to what has given rise to it i am as much a stranger as ever  the entrance of mr delvile here closed the conversation  he began with his usual ostentatious apologies declaring he had so many people to attend so many complaints to hear and so many grievances to redress that it was impossible for him to wait upon her sooner and not without difficulty that he waited upon her now  mean time his son almost immediately retired and cecilia instead of listening to this harangue was only disturbing herself with conjectures upon what had just passed she saw that young delvile concluded she was absolutely engaged to mr belfield and though she was better pleased that any suspicion should fall there than upon sir robert floyer she was yet both provoked and concerned to be suspected at all an attack so earnest from almost any other person could hardly have failed being very offensive to her but in the manners of young delvile good breeding was so happily blended with frankness that his freedom seemed merely to result from the openness of his disposition and even in its very act pleaded its own excuse  her reverie was at length interrupted by mr delviles desiring to know in what he could serve her  she told him she had present occasion for  00 l and hoped he would not object to her taking up that sum  six hundred pounds said he after some deliberation is rather an extraordinary demand for a young lady in your situation your allowance is considerable you have yet no house no equipage no establishment your expenses i should imagine cannot be very great    he stopped and seemed weighing her request  cecilia shocked at appearing extravagant yet too generous to mention mr harrel had again recourse to her booksellers bill which she told him she was anxious to discharge  a booksellers bill cried he and do you want  00 l for a booksellers bill  no sir said she stammering no  not all for that  i have some other  i have a particular occasion    but what bill at all cried he with much surprise can a young lady have with a bookseller the spectator tatler and guardian would make library sufficient for any female in the kingdom nor do i think it like a gentlewoman to have more besides if you ally yourself in such a manner as i shall approve and recommend you will in all probability find already collected more books than there can ever be any possible occasion for you to look into and let me counsel you to remember that a lady whether so called from birth or only from fortune should never degrade herself by being put on a level with writers and such sort of people  cecilia thanked him for his advice but confessed that upon the present occasion it came too late as the books were now actually in her own possession  and have you taken cried he such a measure as this without consulting me i thought i had assured you my opinion was always at your service when you were in any dilemma  yes sir answered cecilia but i knew how much you were occupied and wished to avoid taking up your time  i cannot blame your modesty he replied and therefore as you have contracted the debt you are in honor bound to pay it mr briggs however has the entire management of your fortune my many avocations obliging me to decline so laborious a trust apply therefore to him and as things are situated i will make no opposition to your demand  i have already sir said cecilia spoke to mr briggs but    you went to him first then interrupted mr delvile with a look of much displeasure  i was unwilling sir to trouble you till i found it unavoidable she then acquainted him with mr briggs refusal and entreated he would do her the favor to intercede in her behalf that the money might no longer be denied her  every word she spoke his pride seemed rising to resent and when she had done after regarding her some time with apparent indignation he said  i intercede i become an agent  cecilia amazed to find him thus violently irritated made a very earnest apology for her request but without paying her any attention he walked up and down the room exclaiming an agent and to mr briggs  this is an affront i could never have expected why did i degrade myself by accepting this humiliating office i ought to have known better then turning to cecilia child he added for whom is it you take me and for what  cecilia again though affronted in her turn began some protestations of respect but haughtily interrupting her he said if of me and of my rank in life you judge by mr briggs or by mr harrel i may be subject to proposals such as these every day suffer me therefore for your better information to hint to you that the head of an ancient and honorable house is apt to think himself somewhat superior to people but just rising from dust and obscurity  thunderstruck by this imperious reproof she could attempt no further vindication but when he observed her consternation he was somewhat appeased and hoping he had now impressed her with a proper sense of his dignity he more gently said you did not i believe intend to insult me  good heaven sir no cried cecilia nothing was more distant from my thoughts if my expressions have been faulty it has been wholly from ignorance  well well we will think then no more of it  she then said she would no longer detain him and without daring to again mention her petition she wished him good morning  he suffered her to go yet as she left the room graciously said think no more of my displeasure for it is over i see you were not were of the extraordinary thing you proposed i am sorry i cannot possibly assist you on any other occasion you may depend upon my services but you know mr briggs you have seen him yourself  judge then how a man of any fashion is to accommodate himself with such a pon  cecilia concurred and courtsying took her leave  ah thought she in her way home how happy is it for me that i followed the advice of mr monckton else i had surely made interest to become an inmate of that house and then indeed as he wisely foresaw i should inevitably have been overwhelmed by this pompous insolence no family however amiable could make amends for such a master of it  chap iii an admonition the harrels and mr arnott waited the return of cecilia with the utmost impatience she told them with much concern the failure of her embassy which mr harrel heard with visible resentment and disent while mr arnott entreating him not to think of it again made an offer of his services and declared he would disregard all personal inconvenience for the pleasure of making him and his sister easy  cecilia was much mortified that she had not the power to act the same part and asked mr harrel whether he believed his own influence with mr briggs would be more successful  no no answered he the old curmudgeon would but the rather refuse i know his reason and therefore am sure all pleas will be vain he has dealings in the alley and i dare say games with your money as if it were his own there is indeed one way  but i do not think you would like it  though i protest i hardly know why not  however it is as well let alone  cecilia insisted upon hearing what he meant and after some hesitation he hinted that there were means by which with very little inconvenience she might borrow the money  cecilia with that horror natural to all unpractised minds at the first idea of contracting a voluntary debt started at this suggestion and seemed very ill disposed to listen to it mr harrel perceiving her repugnance turned to mr arnott and said well my good brother i hardly know how to suffer you to sell out at such a loss but yet my present necessity is so urgent    dont mention it cried mr arnott i am very sorry i let you know it be certain however that while i have any thing it is yours and my sisters  the two gentlemen were then retiring together but cecilia shocked for mr arnott though unmoved by mr harrel stopped them to enquire what was the way by which it was meant she could borrow the money  mr harrel seemed averse to answer but she would not be refused and then he mentioned a jew of whose honesty he had made undoubted trial and who as she was so near being of age would accept very trifling interest for whatever she should like to take up  the heart of cecilia recoiled at the very mention of a jew and taking up money upon interest but impelled strongly by her own generosity to emulate that of mr arnott she agreed after some hesitation to have recourse to this method  mr harrel then made some faint denials and mr arnott protested he had a thousand times rather sell out at any discount than consent to her taking such a measure but when her first reluctance was conquered all that he urged served but to show his worthiness in a stronger light and only increased her desire of saving him from such repeated imposition  her total ignorance in what manner to transact this business made her next put it wholly into the hands of mr harrel whom she begged to take up  00 l upon such terms as he thought equitable and to which whatever they might be she would sign her name  he seemed somewhat surprised at the sum but without any question or objection undertook the commission and cecilia would not lessen it because unwilling to do more for the security of the luxurious mr harrel than for the distresses of the laborious hills  nothing could be more speedy than the execution of this affair mr harrel was diligent and expert the whole was settled that morning and giving to the jew her bond for the payment at the interest he required she put into the hands of mr harrel   0 l for which he gave his receipt and she kept the rest for her own purposes  she intended the morning after this transaction to settle her account with the bookseller when she went into the parlour to breakfast she was somewhat surprised to see mr harrel seated there in earnest discourse with his wife fearful of interrupting a tete a tete so uncommon she would have retired but mr harrel calling after her said o pray come in i am only telling priscilla a piece of my usual ill luck you must know i happen to be in immediate want of  00 l though only for three or four days and i sent to order honest old aaron to come hither directly with the money but it so happens that he went out of town the moment he had done with us yesterday and will not be back again this week now i dont believe there is another jew in the kingdom who will let me have money upon the same terms they are such notorious rascals that i hate the very thought of employing them  cecilia who could not but understand what this meant was too much displeased both by his extravagance and his indelicacy to feel at all inclined to change the destination of the money she had just received and therefore coolly agreed that it was unfortunate but added nothing more  o it is provoking indeed cried he for the extrainterest i must pay one of those extortioners is absolutely so much money thrown away  cecilia still without noticing these hints began her breakfast mr harrel then said he would take his tea with them and while he was buttering some dry toast exclaimed as if from sudden recollection o lord now i think of it i believe miss beverley you can lend me this money yourself for a day or two the moment old aaron comes to town i will pay you  cecilia whose generosity however extensive was neither thoughtless nor indiscriminate found something so repulsive in this gross procedure that instead of assenting to his request with her usual alacrity she answered very gravely that the money she had just received was already appropriated to a particular purpose and she knew not how to defer making use of it  mr harrel was extremely chagrined by this reply which was by no means what he expected but tossing down a dish of tea he began humming an air and soon recovered his usual unconcern  in a few minutes ringing his bell he desired a servant to go to mr zackery and inform him that he wanted to speak with him immediately  and now said he with a look in which vexation seemed struggling with carelessness the thing is done i dont like indeed to get into such hands for it is hard ever to get out of them when once one begins  and hitherto i have kept pretty clear but there is no help for it  mr arnott cannot just now assist me  and so the thing must take its course priscilla why do you look so grave  i am thinking how unlucky it is my brother should happen to be unable to lend you this money  o dont think about it i shall get rid of the man very soon i dare say  i hope so at least  i am sure i mean it  cecilia now grew a little disturbed she looked at mrs harrel who seemed also uneasy and then with some hesitation said have you really never sir employed this man before  never in my life never any but old aaron i dread the whole race i have a sort of superstitious notion that if once i get into their clutches i shall never be my own man again and that induced me to beg your assistance however it is no great matter  she then began to waver she feared there might be future mischief as well as present inconvenience in his applying to new usurers and knowing she had now the power to prevent him thought herself half cruel in refusing to exert it she wished to consult mr monckton but found it necessary to take her measures immediately as the jew was already sent for and must in a few moments be either employed or discarded  much perplexed how to act between a desire of doing good and a fear of encouraging evil she weighed each side hastily but while still uncertain which ought to preponderate her kindness for mrs harrel interfered and in the hope of rescuing her husband from further bad practices she said she would postpone her own business for the few days he mentioned rather than see him compelled to open any new account with so dangerous a set of men  he thanked her in his usual negligent manner and accepting the  00 l gave her his receipt for it and a promise she should be paid in a week  mrs harrel however seemed more grateful and with many embraces spoke her sense of this friendly good nature cecilia happy from believing she had revived in her some spark of sensibility determined to avail herself of so favorable a symptom and enter at once upon the disagreeable task she had set herself of representing to her the danger of her present situation  as soon therefore as breakfast was done and mr arnott who came in before it was over was gone with a view to excite her attention by raising her curiosity she begged the favor of a private conference in her own room upon matters of some importance  she began with hoping that the friendship in which they had so long lived would make her pardon the liberty she was going to take and which nothing less than their former intimacy joined to strong apprehensions for her future welfare could authorize but oh priscilla she continued with open eyes to see your danger yet not warn you of it would be a reserve treacherous in a friend and cruel even in a fellow creature  what danger cried mrs harrel much alarmed do you think me ill do i look consumptive  yes consumptive indeed said cecilia but not i hope in your constitution  and then with all the tenderness in her power she came to the point and conjured her without delay to retrench her expenses and change her thoughtless way of life for one more considerate and domestic  mrs harrel with much simplicity asfured her she did nothing but what every body else did and that it was quite impossible for her to appear in the world in any other manner  but how are you to appear hereafter cried cecilia if now you live beyond your income you must consider that in time your income by such depredations will be exhausted  but i declare to you answered mrs harrel i never run in debt for more than half a year for as soon as i receive my own money i generally pay it away every shilling and so borrow what i want till pay day comes round again  and that said cecilia seems a method expressly devised for keeping you eternally comfortless pardon me however for speaking so openly but i fear mr harrel himself must be even still less attentive and accurate in his affairs or he could not so frequently be embarrassed and what is to be the result look but my dear priscilla a little forward and you will tremble at the prospect before you  mrs harrel seemed frightened at this speech and begged to know what she would have them do  cecilia then with equal wisdom and friendliness proposed a general reform in the household the public and private expenses of both she advised that a strict examination might be made into the state of their affairs that all their bills should be called in and faithfully paid and that an entire new plan of life should be adopted according to the situation of their fortune and income when cleared of all encumbrances  lord my dear exclaimed mrs harrel with a look of astonishment why mr harrel would no more do all this than fly if i was only to make such a proposal i dare say he would laugh in my face  and why  why  why because it would seem such an odd thing  it is what nobody thinks of  though i am sure i am very much obliged to you for mentioning it  shall we go down stairs i think i heard somebody come in  no matter who comes in said cecilia reflect for a moment upon my proposal and at least if you disapprove it suggest something more eligible  o it is a very good proposal that i agree said mrs harrel looking very weary but only the thing is it is quite impossible  why so why is it impossible  why because  dear i dont know  but i am sure it is  but what is your reason what makes you sure of it  lord i cannot tell  but i know it is  because  i am very certain it is  argument such as this though extremely fatiguing to the understanding of cecilia had yet no power to blunt her purpose she warmly expostulated against the weakness of her desence strongly represented the imprudence of her conduct and exhorted her by every tie of justice honor and discretion to set about a reformation  why what can i do cried mrs harrel impatiently one must live a little like other people you would not have me be stared at i suppose and i am sure i dont know what i do that every body else does not do too  but were it not better said cecilia with more energy to think less of other people and more of yourself to consult your own fortune and your own situation in life instead of being blindly guided by those of other people if indeed other people would be responsible for your losses for the diminution of your wealth and for the disorder of your affairs then might you rationally make their way of life the example of yours but you cannot flatter yourself such will be the case you know better your losses your diminished fortune your embarrassed circumstances will be all your own pitied perhaps by some but blamed by more and assisted by none  good lord miss beverley cried mrs harrel starting you talk just as if we were ruined  i mean not that replied cecilia but i would fain by pointing out your danger prevail with you to prevent in time so dreadful a catastrophe  mrs harrel more affronted than alarmed heard this answer with much displeasure and after a sullen hesitation peevishly said i must own i dont take it very kind of you to say such frightful things to me i am sure we only live like the rest of the world and i dont see why a man of mr harrels fortune should live any worse as to his having now and then a little debt or two it is nothing but what every body else has you only think it so odd because you ant used to it but you are quite mistaken if you suppose he does not mean to pay for he told me this morning that as soon as ever he receives his rents he intends to discharge every bill he has in the world  i am very glad to hear it answered cecilia and i heartily wish he may have the resolution to adhere to his purpose i feared you would think me impertinent but you do worse in believing me unkind friendship and good will could alone have induced me to hazard what i have said to you i must however have done though i cannot forbear adding that i hope what has already passed will sometimes recur to you  they then separated mrs harrel half angry at remonstrances she thought only censorious and cecilia offended at her pettishness and folly though grieved at her blindness  she was soon however recompensed for this vexation by a visit from mrs delvile who finding her alone sat with her some time and by her spirit understanding and elegance dissipated all her chagrin  from another circumstance also she received much pleasure though a little perplexity mr arnott brought her word that mr belfield almost quite well had actually left his lodgings and was gone into the country  she now half suspected that the account of his illness given her by young delvile was merely the effect of his curiosity to discover her sentiments of him yet when she considered how foreign to his character appeared every species of artifice she exculpated him from the design and concluded that the impatient spirit of belfield had hurried him away when really unfit for traveling she had no means however to hear more of him now he had quitted the town and therefore though uneasy she was compelled to be patient  in the evening she had again a visit from mr monckton who though he was now acquainted how much she was at home had the forbearance to avoid making frequent use of that knowledge that his attendance might escape observation  cecilia as usual spoke to him of all her affairs with the utmost openness and as her mind was now chiefly occupied by her apprehensions for the harrels she communicated to him the extravagance of which they were guilty and hinted at the distress that from time to time it occasioned but the assistance she had afforded them her own delicacy prevented her mentioning  mr monckton scrupled not from this account instantly to pronounce harrel a ruined man and thinking cecilia from her connection with him in much danger of being involved in his future difficulties he most earnestly exhorted her to suffer no inducement to prevail with her to advance him any money confidently affirming she would have little chance of being ever repaid  cecilia listened to this charge with much alarm but readily promised future circumspection she confessed to him the conference she had had in the morning with mrs harrel and after lamenting her determined neglect of her affairs she added i cannot but own that my esteem for her even more than my affection has lessened almost every day since i have been in her house but this morning when i ventured to speak to her with earnestness i found her powers of reasoning so weak and her infatuation to luxury and expense so strong that i have ever since felt ashamed of my own want of discernment in having formerly selected her for my friend  when you gave her that title said mr monckton you had little choice in your power her sweetness and goodnature attracted you childhood is never troubled with foresight and youth is seldom difficult she was lively and pleasing you were generous and affectionate your a quaintance with her was formed while you were yet too young to know your own worth your fondness of her grew from habit and before the inferiority or her parts had weakened your regard by offending your judgment her early marriage separated you from her entirely but now you meet again the scene is altered three years of absence spent in the cultivation of an understanding naturally of the first order by increasing your wisdom has made you more fastidious while the same time spent by her in mere idleness and show has hurt her disposition without adding to her knowledge and robbed her of her natural excellencies without enriching her with acquired ones you see her now with impartiality for you see her almost as a stranger and all those deficiencies which retirement and inexperience had formerly concealed her vanity and her superficial acquaintance with the world have now rendered glaring but folly weakens all bands remember therefore if you would form a solid friendship to consult not only the heart but the head not only the temper but the understanding  well then said cecilia at least it must be confessed i have judiciously chosen you  you have indeed done me the highest honor he answered  they then talked of belfield and mr monckton confirmed the account of mr arnott that he had left london in good health after which he enquired if she had seen any thing more of the delviles  yes said cecilia mrs delvile called upon me this morning she is a delightful woman i am sorry you know her not enough to do her justice  is she civil to you  civil she is all kindness  then depend upon it she has something in view whenever that is not the case she is all insolence and mr delvile  pray what do you think of him  o i think him insufferable and i cannot sufficiently thank you for that timely caution which prevented my change of habitation i would not live under the same roof with him for the world  well and do you not now begin also to see the son properly  properly i dont understand you  why as the very son of such parents haughty and impertinent  no indeed he has not the smallest resemblance of his father and if he resembles his mother it is only what every one must wish who impartially sees her  you know not that family but how indeed should you when they are in a combination to prevent your getting that knowledge they have all their designs upon you and if you are not carefully upon your guard you will be the dupe to them  what can you possibly mean  nothing but what every body else must immediately see they have a great share of pride and a small one of wealth you seem by fortune to be flung in their way and doubtless they mean not to neglect so inviting an opportunity of repairing their estates  indeed you are mistaken i am certain they have no such intention on the contrary they all even teazingly persist in thinking me already engaged elsewhere  she then gave him a history of their several suspicions the impertinence of report she added has so much convinced them that sir robert floyer and mr belfield fought merely as rivals that i can only clear myself of partiality for one of them to have it instantly concluded i feel it for the other and far from seeming hurt that i appear to be disposed of mr delvile openly seconds the pretensions of sir robert and his son officiously persuades me that i am already mr belfields  tricks nothing but tricks to discover your real situation  he then gave her some general cautions to be upon her guard against their artifices and changing the subject talked for the rest of his visit upon matters of general entertainment  chap iv an evasion cecilia now for about a fortnight passed her time without incident the harrels continued their accustomed dissipation sir robert floyer without even seeking a private conference persevered in his attentions and mr arnott though still silent and humble seemed only to live by the pleasure of beholding her she spent two whole days with mrs delvile both of which served to consirm her admiration of that lady and of her son and she joined the parties of the harrels or stayed quietly at home according to her spirits and inclinations while she was visited by mr monckton often enough to satisfy him with her proceedings yet too seldom to betray either to herself or to the world any suspicion of his designs  her  00 l however which was to have been returned at the end of the first week though a fortnight was now elapsed had not even been mentioned she began to grow very impatient but not knowing what course to pursue and wanting courage to remind mr harrel of his promise she still waited the performance of it without speaking  at this time preparations were making in the family for removing to violetbank to spend the easter holidays but cecilia who was too much grieved at such perpetual increase of unnecessary expenses to have any enjoyment in new prospects of entertainment had at present some business of her own which gave her full employment  the poor carpenter whose family she had taken under her protection was just dead and as soon as the last duties had been paid him she sent for his widow and after trying to console her for the loss she had suffered assured her she was immediately ready to fulfill the engagement into which she had entered of assisting her to undertake some better method of procuring a livelihood and therefore desired to know in what manner she could serve her and what she thought herself able to do  the good woman pouring forth thanks and praises innumerable answered that she had a cousin who had offered for a certain premium to take her into partnership in a small haberdashers shop but then madam continued she it is quite morally impossible i should raise such a sum or else to be sure such a shop as that now i am grown so poorly would be quite a heaven upon earth to me for my strength madam is almost all gone away and when i do any hard work it is quite a piteous sight to see me for i am all in a tremble after it just as if i had an ague and yet all the time my hands madam will be burning like a coal  you have indeed been overworked said cecilia and it is high time your feeble frame should have some rest what is the sum your cousin demands  o madam more than i should be able to get together in all my life for earn what i will it goes as fast as it comes because there is many mouths and small pay and two of the little ones that cannot help at all  and there is no billy madam to work for us now  but tell me what is the sum  sixty pound madam  you shall have it cried the generous cecilia if the situation will make you happy i will give it you myself  the poor woman wept her thanks and was long before she could sufficiently compose herself to answer the further questions of cecilia who next enquired what could be done with the children mrs hill however hitherto hopeless of such a provision for herself had for them formed no plan she told her therefore to go to her cousin and consult upon this subject as well as to make preparations for her own removal  the arrangement of this business now became her favorite occupation she went herself to the shop which was a very small one in fetterlane and spoke with mrs roberts the cousin who agreed to take the eldest girl now sixteen years of age by way of helper but said she had room for no other however upon cecilias offering to raise the premium she consented that the two little children should also live in the house where they might be under the care of their mother and sister  there were still two others to be disposed of but as no immediate method of providing for them occurred to cecilia she determined for the present to place them in some cheap school where they might be taught plain work which could not but prove a useful qualification for whatever sort of business they might hereafter attempt  her plan was to bestow upon mrs hill and her children  00 l by way of putting them all into a decent way of living and then from time to time to make them such small presents as their future exigencies or changes of situation might require  now therefore payment from mr harrel became immediately necessary for she had only  0 l of the  00 l she had taken up in her own possession and her customary allowance was already so appropriated that she could make from it no considerable deduction  there is something in the sight of laborious indigence so affecting and so respectable that it renders dissipation peculiarly contemptible and doubles the odium of extravagance every time cecilia saw this poor family her aversion to the conduct and the principles of mr harrel increased while her delicacy of shocking or shaming him diminished and she soon acquired for them what she had failed to acquire for herself the spirit and resolution to claim her debt  one morning therefore as he was quitting the breakfastroom she hastily arose and following begged to have a moments discourse with him they went together to the library and after some apologies and much hesitation she told him she fancied he had forgotten the  00 l which she had lent him  the  00 l cried he o ay true  i protest it had escaped me well but you dont want it immediately  indeed i do if you can conveniently spare it  o yes certainly  without the least doubt  though now i think of it  its extremely unlucky but really just at this time  why did not you put me in mind of it before  i hoped you would have remembered it yourself  i could have paid you two days ago extremely well  however you shall certainly have it very soon that you may depend upon and a day or two can make no great difference to you  he then wished her good morning and left her  cecilia very much provoked regretted that she had ever lent it at all and determined for the future strictly to follow the advice of mr monckton in trusting him no more  two or three days passed on but still no notice was taken either of the payment or of the debt she then resolved to renew her application and be more serious and more urgent with him but she found to her utter surprise this was not in her power and that though she lived under the same roof with him she had no opportunity to enforce her claim mr harrel whenever she desired to speak with him protested he was so much hurried he had not a moment to spare and even when tired of his excuses she pursued him out of the room he only quickened his speed smiling however and bowing and calling out i am vastly sorry but i am so late now i cannot stop an instant however as soon as i come back i shall be wholly at your command  when he came back however sir robert floyer or some other gentleman was sure to be with him and the difficulties of obtaining an audience were sure to be increased and by this method which he constantly practiced of avoiding any private conversation he frustrated all her schemes of remonstrating upon his delay since her resentment however great could never urge her to the indelicacy of dunning him in presence of a third person  she was now much perplexed herself how to put into execution her plan for the hills she knew it would be as vain to apply for money to mr briggs as for payment to mr harrel her word however had been given and her word she held sacred she resolved therefore for the present to bestow upon them the  0 l she still retained and if the rest should be necessary before she became of age to spare it however inconveniently from her private allowance which by the will of her uncle was  00 l a year   0 l of which mr harrel received for her board and accommodations  having settled this matter in her own mind she went to the lodging of mrs hill in order to conclude the affair she found her and all her children except the youngest hard at work and their honest industry so much strengthened her compassion that her wishes for serving them grew every instant more liberal  mrs hill readily undertook to make her cousin accept half the premium for the present which would suffice to fix her with three of her children in the shop cecilia then went with her to fetterlane and there drawing up herself an agreement for their entering into partnership she made each of them sign it and take a copy and kept a third in her own possession after which she gave a promissory note to mrs roberts for the rest of the money  she presented mrs hill also with  0 l to clothe them all decently and enable her to send two of the children to school and assured her that she would herself pay for their board and instruction till she should be established in her business and have power to save money for that purpose  she then put herself into a chair to return home followed by the prayers and blessings of the whole family  chap v an adventure never had the heart of cecilia felt so light so gay so glowing as after the transaction of this affair her life had never appeared to her so important nor her wealth so valuable to see five helpless children provided for by herself rescued from the extremes of penury and wretchedness and put in a way to become useful to society and comfortable to themselves to behold their feeble mother snatched from the hardship of that labor which overpowering her strength had almost destroyed her existence now placed in a situation where a competent maintenance might be earned without fatigue and the remnant of her days pass in easy employment  to view such sights and have power to say  these deeds are mine what to a disposition fraught with tenderness and benevolence could give purer selfapplause or more exquisite satisfaction  such were the pleasures which regaled the reflections of cecilia when in her way home having got out of her chair to walk through the upper part of oxford street she was suddenly met by the old gentleman whose emphatical addresses to her had so much excited her astonishment  he was passing quick on but stopping the moment he perceived her he sternly called out are you proud are you callous are you hard of heart so soon  put me if you please to some trial cried cecilia with the virtuous courage of a selfacquitting conscience  i already have returned he indignantly and already i have found you faulty  i am sorry to hear it said the amazed cecilia but at least i hope you will tell me in what  you refused me admittance he answered yet i was your friend yet i was willing to prolong the term of your genuine tranquillity i pointed out to you a method of preserving peace with your own soul i came to you in behalf of the poor and instructed you how to merit their prayers you heard me you were susceptible you complied i meant to have repeated the lesson to have tuned your whole heart to compassion and to have taught you the sad duties of sympathising humanity for this purpose i called again but again i was not admitted short was the period of my absence yet long enough for the completion of your downfall  good heaven cried cecilia how dreadful is this language when have you called sir i never heard you had been at the house far from refusing you admittance i wished to see you  indeed cried he with some softness and are you in truth not proud not callous not hard of heart follow me then and visit the humble and the poor follow me and give comfort to the fallen and dejected  at this invitation however desirous to do good cecilia started the strangeness of the inviter his flightiness his authoritative manner and the uncertainty whither or to whom he might carry her made her fearful of proceeding yet a benevolent curiosity to see as well as serve the objects of his recommendation joined to the eagerness of youthful integrity to clear her own character from the aspersion of hardheartedness soon conquered her irresolution and making a sign to her servant to keep near her she followed as her conductor led  he went on silently and solemnly till he came to swallowstreet then turning into it he stopped at a small and meanlooking house knocked at the door and without asking any question of the man who opened it beckoned her to come after him and hastened up some narrow winding stairs  cecilia again hesitated but when she recollected that this old man though little known was frequently seen and though with few people acquainted was by many personally recognized she thought it impossible he could mean her any injury she ordered her servant however to come in and bid him keep walking up and down the stairs till she returned to him and then she obeyed the directions of her guide  he proceeded till he came to the second floor then again beckoning her to follow him he opened a door and entered a small and very meanly furnished apartment  and here to her infinite astonishment she perceived employed in washing some china a very lovely young woman genteely dressed and appearing hardly seventeen years of age  the moment they came in with evident marks of confusion she instantly gave over her work hastily putting the basin she was washing upon the table and endeavoring to hide the towel with which she was wiping it behind her chair  the old gentleman advancing to her with quickness said how is he now is he better will he live  heaven forbid he should not answered the young woman with emotion but indeed he is no better  look here said he pointing to cecilia i have brought you one who has power to serve you and to relieve your distress one who is rolling in affluence a stranger to ill a novice in the world  unskilled in the miseries she is yet to endure unconscious of the depravity into which she is to sink receive her benefactions while yet she is untainted satisfied that while she aids you she is blessing herself  the young woman blushing and abashed said you are very good to me sir but there is no occasion  there is no need  i have not any necessity  i am far from being so very much in want    poor simple soul interrupted the old man and art thou ashamed of poverty guard guard thyself from other shames and the wealthiest may envy thee tell here thy story plainly roundly truly abate nothing of thy indigence repress nothing of her liberality the poor not impoverished by their own guilt are equals of the affluent not enriched by their own virtue come then and let me present ye to each other young as ye both are with many years and many sorrows to encounter lighten the burden of each others cares by the heartsoothing exchange of gratitude for beneficence  he then took a hand of each and joining them between his own  you he continued who though rich are not hardened and you who though poor are not debased why should ye not love why should ye not cherish each other the afflictions of life are tedious its joys are evanescent ye are now both young and with little to enjoy will find much to suffer ye are both too i believe innocent  oh could ye always remain so  cherubs were ye then and the sons of men might worship you  he stopped checked by his own rising emotion but soon resuming his usual austerity such however he continued is not the condition of humanity in pity therefore to the evils impending over both be kind to each other i leave you together and to your mutual tenderness i recommend you  then turning particularly to cecilia disdain not he said to console the depressed look upon her without scorn converse with her without contempt like you she is an orphan though not like you an heiress  like her you are fatherless though not like her friendless if she is awaited by the temptations of adversity you also are surrounded by the corruptions of prosperity your fall is most probable here is most excusable  commiserate her therefore now  by and by she may commiserate you  and with these words he left the room  a total silence for some time succeeded his departure cecilia found it difficult to recover from the surprise into which she had been thrown sufficiently for speech in following her extraordinary director her imagination had painted to her a scene such as she had so lately quitted and prepared her to behold some family in distress some helpless creature in sickness or some children in want but of these to see none to meet but one person and that one fair young and delicate  an introduction so singular to an object so unthought of deprived her of all power but that of showing her amazement  mean while the young woman looked scarcely less surprised and insinitely more embarrassed she surveyed her apartment with vexation and her guest with confusion she had listened to the exhortation of the old man with visible uneasiness and now he was gone seemed overwhelmed with shame and chagrin  cecilia who in observing these emotions felt both her curiosity and her compassion increase pressed her hand as she parted with it and when a little recovered said you must think this a strange intrusion but the gentleman who brought me hither is perhaps so well known to you as to make his singularities plead with you their own apology  no indeed madam she answered bashfully he is very little known to me but he is very good and very desirous to do me service  not but what i believe he thinks me much worse off than i really am for i assure you madam whatever he has said i am not ill off at all  hardly  the various doubts to her disadvantage which had at first from her uncommon situation arisen in the mind of cecilia this anxiety to disguise not display her distress considerably removed since it cleared her of all suspicion of seeking by artifice and imposition to play upon her feelings  with a gentleness therefore the most soothing she replied i should by no means have broken in upon you thus unexpectedly if i had not concluded my conductor had some right to bring me however since we are actually met let us remember his injunctions and endeavor not to part till by a mutual exchange of good will each has added a friend to the other  you are condescending indeed madam answered the young woman with an air the most humble looking as you look to talk of a friend when you come to such a place as this up two pair of stairs no furniture no servant every thing in such disorder  indeed i wonder at mr albany he should not  but he thinks every bodys affairs may be made public and does not care what he tells nor who hears him  he knows not the pain he gives nor the mischief he may do  i am very much concerned cried cecilia more and more surprised at all she heard to find i have been thus instrumental to distressing you i was ignorant whither i was coming and followed him believe me neither from curiosity nor inclination but simply because i knew not how to refuse him he is gone however and i will therefore relieve you by going too but permit me to leave behind me a small testimony that the intention of my coming was not mere impertinence  she then took out her purse but the young woman starting back with a look of resentful mortification exclaimed no madam you are quite mistaken pray put up your purse i am no beggar mr albany has misrepresented me if he has told you i am  cecilia mortified in her turn at this unexpected rejection of an offer she had thought herself invited to make stood some moments silent and then said i am far from meaning to offend you and i sincerely beg your pardon if i have misunderstood the charge just now given to me  i have nothing to pardon madam said she more calmly except indeed to mr albany and to him it is of no use to be angry for he minds not what i say he is very good but he is very strange for he thinks the whole world made to live in common and that every one who is poor should ask and every one who is rich should give he does not know that there are many who would rather starve  and are you said cecilia halfsmiling of that number  no indeed madam i have not so much greatness of mind but those to whom i belong have more fortitude and higher spirit i wish i could imitate them  struck with the candor and simplicity of this speech cecilia now felt a warm desire to serve her and taking her hand said forgive me but though i see you wish me gone i know not how to leave you recollect therefore the charge that has been given to us both and if you refuse my assistance one way point out to me in what other i may offer it  you are very kind madam she answered and i dare say you are very good i am sure you look so at least but i want nothing i do very well and i have hopes of doing better mr albany is too impatient he knows indeed that i am not extremely rich but he is much to blame if he supposes me therefore an object of charity and thinks me so mean as to receive money from a stranger  i am truly sorry cried cecilia for the error i have committed but you must suffer me to make my peace with you before we part yet till i am better known to you i am fearful of proposing terms perhaps you will permit me to leave you my direction and do me the favor to call upon me yourself  o no madam i have a sick relation whom i cannot leave and indeed if he were well he would not like to have me make an acquaintance while i am in this place  i hope you are not his only nurse i am sure you do not look able to bear such fatigue has he a physician is he properly attended  no madam he has no physician and no attendance at all  and is it possible that in such a situation you can refuse to be assisted surely you should accept some help for him if not for yourself  but what will that signify when if i do he will not make use of it and when he had a thousand and a thousand times rather die than let any one know he is in want  take it then unknown to him serve him without acquainting him you serve him surely you would not suffer him to perish without aid  heaven forbid but what can i do i am under his command madam not he under mine  is he your father  pardon my question but your youth seems much to want such a protector  no madam i have no father i was happier when i had he is my brother  and what is his illness  a fever  a fever and without a physician are you sure too it is not infectious  o yes too sure  too sure how so  because i know too well the occasion of it  and what is the occasion cried cecilia again taking her hand pray trust me indeed you shall not repent your confidence your reserve hitherto has only raised you in my esteem but do not carry it so far as to mortify me by a total rejection of my good offices  ah madam said the young woman sighing you ought to be good i am sure for you will draw all out of me by such kindness as this the occasion was a neglected wound never properly healed  a wound is he in the army  no  he was shot through the side in a duel  in a duel exclaimed cecilia pray what is his name  o that i must not tell you his name is a great secret now while he is in this poor place for i know he had almost rather never see the light again than have it known  surely surely cried cecilia with much emotion he cannot  i hope he cannot be mr belfield  ah heaven cried the young woman screaming do you then know him  here in mutual astonishment they looked at each other  you are then said cecilia the sister of mr belfield and mr belfield is thus sick his wound is not yet healed  and he is without any help  and who madam are you cried she and how is it you know him  my name is beverley  ah exclaimed she again i fear i have done nothing but mischief i know very well who you are now madam but if my brother discovers that i have betrayed him he will take it very unkind and perhaps never forgive me  be not alarmed cried cecilia rest assured he shall never know it is he not now in the country  no madam he is now in the very next room  but what is become of the surgeon who used to attend him and why does he not still visit him  it is in vain now to hide any thing from you my brother deceived him and said he was going out of town merely to get rid of him  and what could induce him to act so strangely  a reason which you madam i hope will never know poverty  he would not run up a bill he could not pay  good heaven  but what can be done for him he must not be suffered to linger thus we must contrive some method of relieving and assisting him whether he will consent or not  i fear that will not be possible one of his friends has already found him out and has written him the kindest letter but he would not answer it and would not see him and was only fretted and angry  well said cecilia i will not keep you longer lest he should be alarmed by your absence tomorrow morning with your leave i will call upon you again and then i hope you will permit me to make some effort to assist you  if it only depended upon me madam she answered now i have the honor to know who you are i believe i should not make much scruple for i was not brought up to notions so high as my brother ah happy had it been for him for me for all his family if he had not had them neither  cecilia then repeated her expressions of comfort and kindness and took her leave  this little adventure gave her infinite concern all the horror which the duel had originally occasioned her again returned she accused herself with much bitterness for having brought it on and finding that mr belfield was so cruelly a sufferer both in his health and his affairs she thought it incumbent upon her to relieve him to the utmost of her ability  his sister too had extremely interested her her youth and the uncommon artlessness of her conversation added to her melancholy situation and the loveliness of her person excited in her a desire to serve and an inclination to love her and she determined if she found her as deserving as she seemed engaging not only to assist her at present but if her distresses continued to receive her into her own house in suture  again she regretted the undue detention of her  00 l what she now had to spare was extremely inadequate to what she now wished to bestow and she looked forward to the conclusion of her minority with increasing eagerness the generous and elegant plan of life she then intended to pursue daily gained ground in her imagination and credit in her opinion  chap vi a man of genius the next morning as soon as breakfast was over cecilia went in a chair to swallowstreet she enquired for miss belfield and was told to go up stairs but what was her amazement to meet just coming out of the room into which she was entering young delvile  they both started and cecilia from the seeming strangeness of her situation felt a confusion with which she had hitherto been unacquainted but delvile presently recovering from his surprise said to her with an expressive smile how good is miss beverley thus to visit the sick and how much better might i have had the pleasure of seeing mr belfield had i but by prescience known her design and deferred my own enquiries till he had been revived by hers  and then bowing and wishing her good morning he glided past her  cecilia notwithstanding the openness and purity of her intentions was so much disconcerted by this unexpected meeting and pointed speech that she had not the presence of mind to call him back and clear herself and the various interrogatories and railleries which had already passed between them upon the subject of mr belfield made her suppose that what he had formerly suspected he would now think confirmed and conclude that all her assertions of indifference proceeded merely from that readiness at hypocrisy upon particular subjects of which he had openly accused her whole sex  this circumstance and this apprehension took from her for a while all interest in the errand upon which she came but the benevolence of her heart soon brought it back when upon going into the room she saw her new favorite in tears  what is the matter cried she tenderly no new affliction i hope has happened your brother is not worse  no madam he is much the same i was not then crying for him  for what then tell me acquaint me with your sorrows and assure yourself you tell them to a friend  i was crying madam to find so much goodness in the world when i thought there was so little to find i have some chance of being again happy when i thought i was miserable for ever two whole years have i spent in nothing but unhappiness and i thought there was nothing else to be had but yesterday madam brought me you with every promise of nobleness and protection and today a friend of my brothers has behaved so generously that even my brother has listened to him and almost consented to be obliged to him  and have you already known so much sorrow said cecilia that this little dawn of prosperity should wholly overpower your spirits gentle amiable girl may the future recompense you for the past and may mr albanys kind wishes be fulfilled in the reciprocation of our comfort and affection  they then entered into a conversation which the sweetness of cecilia and the gratitude of miss belfield soon rendered interesting friendly and unreserved and in a very short time whatever was essential in the story or situation of the latter was fully communicated she gave however a charge the most earnest that her brother should never be acquainted with the confidence she had made  her father who had been dead only two years was a linendraper in the city he had six daughters of whom herself was the youngest and only one son this son mr belfield was alike the darling of his father mother and sisters he was brought up at eaton no expense was spared in his education nothing was denied that could make him happy with an excellent understanding he had uncommon quickness of parts and his progress in his studies was rapid and honorable his father though he always meant him for his successor in his business heard of his improvement with rapture often saying my boy will be the ornament of the city he will be the best scholar in any shop in london  he was soon however taught another lesson when at the age of sixteen he returned home and was placed in the shop instead of applying his talents as his father had expected to trade he both despised and abhorred the name of it when serious treating it with contempt when gay with derision  he was seized also with a most ardent desire to finish his education like those of his schoolfellows who left eaton at the same time at one of the universities and after many difficulties this petition at the intercession of his mother was granted old mr belfield telling him he hoped a little more learning would give him a little more sense and that when he became a finished student he would not only know the true value of business but understand how to get money and make a bargain better than any man whatsoever within templebar  these expectations equally shortsighted were also equally fallacious with the former the son again returned and returned as his father had hoped a finished student but far from being more tractable or better disposed for application to trade his aversion to it now was more stubborn and his opposition more hardy than ever the young men of fashion with whom he had formed friendships at school or at the university and with whom from the indulgence of his father he was always able to vie in expense and from the indulgence of nature to excel in capacity earnestly sought the continuance of his acquaintance and courted and coveted the pleasure of his conversation but though he was now totally disqualified for any other society he lost all delight in their favor from the fear they should discover his abode and sedulously endeavored to avoid even occasionally meeting them lest any of his family should at the same time approach him for of his family though wealthy worthy and independent he was now so utterly ashamed that the mortification the most cruel he could receive was to be asked his address or told he should be visited  tired at length of evading the enquiries made by some and forcing faint laughs at the detection made by others he privately took a lodging at the west end of the town to which he thence forward directed all his friends and where under various pretenses he contrived to spend the greatest part of his time  in all his expensive deceits and frolics his mother was his neverfailing confident and assistant for when she heard that the companions of her son were men of fashion some born to titles others destined to high stations she concluded he was in the certain road to honor and profit and frequently distressed herself without ever repining in order to enable him to preserve upon equal terms connections which she believed so conducive to his future grandeur  in this wild and unsettled manner he passed some time struggling incessantly against the authority of his father privately abetted by his mother and constantly aided and admired by his sisters till sick of so desultory a way of life he entered himself a volunteer in the army  how soon he grew tired of this change has already been related see p       vol i as well as his reconciliation with his father and his becoming a student at the temple for the father now grew as weary of opposing as the young man of being opposed  here for two or three years he lived in happiness uninterrupted he extended his acquaintance among the great by whom he was no sooner known than caressed and admired and he frequently visited his family which though he blushed to own in public he affectionately loved in private his profession indeed was but little in his thoughts successive engagements occupying almost all his hours delighted with the favor of the world and charmed to find his presence seemed the signal for entertainment he soon sorgot the uncertainty of his fortune and the inferiority of his rank the law grew more and more fatiguing pleasure became more and more alluring and by degrees he had not a day unappropriated to some party or amusement voluntarily consigning the few leisure moments his gay circle afforded him to the indulgence of his fancy in some hasty compositions in verse which were handed about in manuscript and which contributed to keep him in fashion  such was his situation at the death of his father a new scene was then opened to him and for some time he hesitated what course to pursue  old mr belfield though he lived in great affluence left not behind him any considerable fortune after the portions of his daughters to each of whom he bequeathed  000 l had been deducted from it but his stock in trade was great and his business was prosperous and lucrative  his son however did not merely want application and fortitude to become his successor but skill and knowledge his deliberation therefore was hasty and his resolution improvident he determined to continue at the temple himself while the shop which he could by no means afford to reliquish should be kept up by another name and the business of it be transacted by an agent hoping thus to secure and enjoy its emoluments without either the trouble or the humiliation of attendance  but this scheme like most others that have their basis in vanity ended in nothing but mortification and disappointment the shop which under old mr belfield had been flourishing and successful and enriched himself and all his family could now scarce support the expenses of an individual without a master without that diligent attention to its prosperity which the interest of possession alone can give and the authority of a principal alone can enforce it quickly lost its fame for the excellence of its goods and soon after its customers from the report of its declension the produce therefore diminished every month he was surprised he was provoked he was convinced he was cheated and that his affairs were neglected but though he threatened from time to time to enquire into the real state of the business and investigate the cause of its decay he felt himself inadequate to the task and now first lamented that early contempt of trade which by preventing him acquiring some knowledge of it while he had youth and opportunity made him now ignorant what redress to seek though certain of imposition and injury  but yet however disturbed by alarming suggestions in his hours of retirement no alteration was made in the general course of his life he was still the darling of his friends and the leader in all parties and still though his income was lessened his expenses increased  such were his circumstances at the time cecilia first saw him at the house of mr monckton from which two days after her arrival in town he was himself summoned by an information that his agent had suddenly left the kingdom  the fatal consequence of this fraudulent elopement was immediate bankrupcy  his spirits however did not yet fail him as he had never been the nominal master of the shop he escaped all dishonor from its ruin and was satisfied to consign what remained to the mercy of the creditors so that his own name should not appear in the gazette  three of his sisters were already extremely well married to reputable tradesmen the two elder of those who were yet single were settled with two of those who were married and henrietta the youngest resided with her mother who had a comfortable annuity and a small house at padington  bereft thus through vanity and imprudence of all the long labors of his father he was now compelled to think seriously of some actual method of maintenance since his mother though willing to sacrifice to him even the nourishment which sustained her could do for him but little and that little he had too much justice to accept the law even to the most diligent and successful is extremely slow of profit and whatever from his connections and abilities might be hoped hereafter at present required an expense which he was no longer able to support  it remained then to try his influence with his friends among the great and the powerful  his canvass proved extremely honorable every one promised something and all seemed delighted to have an opportunity of serving him  pleased with finding the world so much better than report had made it he now saw the conclusion of his difficulties in the prospect of a place at court  belfield with half the penetration with which he was gifted would have seen in any other man the delusive idleness of expectations no better founded but though discernment teaches us the folly of others experience singly can teach us our own he flattered himself that his friends had been more wisely selected than the friends of those who in similar circumstances had been beguiled and he suspected not the fraud of his vanity till he found his invitations daily slacken and that his time was at his own command  all this hopes now rested upon one friend and patron mr floyer an uncle of sir robert floyer a man of power in the royal household with whom he had lived in great intimacy and who at this period had the disposal of a place which he solicited the only obstacle that seemed in his way was from sir robert himself who warmly exerted his interest in favor of a friend of his own mr floyer however assured belfield of the preference and only begged his patience till he could find some opportunity of appeasing his nephew  and this was the state of his affairs at the time of his quarrel at the operahouse already declared opponents of each other sir robert felt double wrath that for him cecilia should reject his civilities while belfield suspecting he presumed upon his known dependence on his uncle to affront him felt also double indignation at the haughtiness of his behavior and thus slight as seemed to the world the cause of their contest each had private motives of animosity that served to stimulate revenge  the very day after this duel mr floyer wrote him word that he was now obliged in common decency to take the part of his nephew and therefore had already given the place to the friend he had recommended  this was the termination of his hopes and the signal of his ruin to the pain of his wound he became insensible from the superior pain of this unexpected miscarriage yet his pride still enabled him to disguise his distress and to see all the friends whom this accident induced to seek him while from the sprightliness he forced in order to conceal his anguish he appeared to them more lively and more entertaining than ever  but these efforts when left to himself and to nature only sunk him the deeper in sadness he found an immediate change in his way of life was necessary yet could not brook to make it in sight of those with whom he had so long lived in all the brilliancy of equality a high principle of honor which still in the midst of his gay career had remained uncorrupted had scrupulously guarded him from running in debt and therefore though of little possessed that little was strictly his own he now published that he was going out of town for the benefit of purer air discharged his surgeon took a gay leave of his friends and trusting no one with his secret but his servant was privately conveyed to mean and cheap lodgings in swallowstreet  here shut up from every human being he had formerly known he purposed to remain till he grew better and then again to seek his fortune in the army  his present situation however was little calculated to contribute to his recovery the dismission of the surgeon the precipitation of his removal the inconveniences of his lodgings and the unseasonable deprivation of long customary indulgencies were unavoidable delays of his amendment while the mortification of his present disgrace and the bitterness of his late disappointment preyed incessantly upon his mind robbed him of rest heightened his fever and reduced him by degrees to a state so low and dangerous that his servant alarmed for his life secretly acquainted his mother with his illness and retreat  the mother almost distracted by this intelligence instantly with her daughter flew to his lodgings she wished to have taken him immediately to her house at padington but he had suffered so much from his first removal that he would not consent to another she would then have called in a physician but he refused even to see one and she had too long given way to all his desires and opinions to have now the force of mind for exerting the requisite authority of issuing her orders without consulting him  she begged she pleaded indeed and henrietta joined in her entreaties but sickness and vexation had not rendered him tame though they had made him sullen he resisted their prayers and commonly silenced them by assurances that their opposition to the plan he had determined to pursue only inflamed his fever and retarded his recovery  the motive of an obduracy so cruel to his friends was the fear of a detection which he thought not merely prejudicial to his affairs but dishonorable to his character for without betraying any symptom of his distress he had taken a general leave of his acquaintance upon pretense of going out of town and he could ill endure to make a discovery which would at once proclaim his degradation and his deceit  mr albany had accidentally broken in upon him by mistaking his room for that of another sick person in the same house to whom his visit had been intended but as he knew and reverenced that old gentleman he did not much repine at his intrusion  he was not so easy when the same discovery was made by young delvile who chancing to meet his servant in the street enquired concerning his masters health and surprising from him its real state followed him home where soon certain of the change in his affairs by the change of his habitation he wrote him a letter in which after apologizing for his freedom he warmly declared that nothing could make him so happy as being favored with his commands if either through himself or his friends he could be so fortunate as to do him any service  belfield deeply mortified at this detection of his situation returned only a verbal answer of cold thanks and desired he would not speak of his being in town as he was not well enough to be seen  this reply gave almost equal mortification to young delvile who continued however to call at the door with enquiries how he went on though he made no further attempt to see him  belfield softened at length by the kindness of this conduct determined to admit him and he was just come from paying his first visit when he was met by cecilia upon the stairs  his stay with him had been short and he had taken no notice either of his change of abode or his pretense of going into the country he had talked to him only in general terms and upon general subjects till he arose to depart and then he reurged his offers of service with so much openness and warmth that belfield affected by his earnestness promised he would soon see him again and intimated to his delighted mother and sister that he would frankly consult with him upon his affairs  such was the tale which with various minuter circumstances miss belfield communicated to cecilia my mother she added who never quits him knows that you are here madam for she heard me talking with somebody yesterday and she made me tell her all that had passed and that you said you would come again this morning  cecilia returned many acknowledgments for this artless and unreserved communication but could not when it was over forbear enquiring by what early misery she had already though so very young spent two years in nothing but unhappiness  because she answered when my poor father died all our family separated and i left every body to go and live with my mother at padington and i was never a favorite with my mother  no more indeed was any body but my brother for she thinks all the rest of the world only made for his sake so she used to deny both herself and me almost common necessaries in order to save up money to make him presents though if he had known how it was done he would only have been angry instead of taking them however i should have regarded nothing that had but been for his benefit for i loved him a great deal more than my own convenience but sums that would distress us for months to save up would by him be spent in a day and then thought of no more nor was that all  o no i had much greater uneasiness to suffer for i was informed by one of my brothersinlaw how ill every thing went and that certain ruin would come to my poor brother from the treachery of his agent and the thought of this was always preying upon my mind for i did not dare tell it my mother for fear it should put her out of humor for sometimes she is not very patient and it mattered little what any of us said to my brother for he was too gay and too confident to believe his danger  well but said cecilia i hope now all will go better if your brother will consent to see a physician    ah madam that is the thing i fear he never will do because of being seen in these bad lodgings i would kneel whole days to prevail with him but he is unused to control and knows not how to submit to it and he has lived so long among the great that he forgets he was not born as high as themselves oh that he had never quitted his own family if he had not been spoilt by ambition he had the best heart and sweetest disposition in the world but living always with his superiors taught him to disdain his own relations and be ashamed of us all and yet now in the hour of his distress  who else comes to help him  cecilia then enquired if she wanted not assistance for herself and her mother observing that they did not seem to have all the conveniences to which they were entitled  why indeed madam she replied with an ingenuous smile when you first came here i was a little like my brother for i was sadly ashamed to let you see how ill we lived but now you know the worst so i shall fret about it no more  but this cannot be your usual way of life i fear the misfortunes of mr belfield have spread a ruin wider than his own  no indeed he took care from the first not to involve us in his hazards for he is very generous madam and very noble in all his notions and could behave to us all no better about money matters than he has ever done but from the moment we came to this dismal place and saw his distress and that he was sunk so low who used always to be higher than any of us we had a sad scene indeed my poor mother whose whole delight was to think that he lived like a nobleman and who always flattered herself that he would rise to be as great as the company he kept was so distracted with her disappointment that she would not listen to reason but immediately discharged both our servants said she and i should do all the work ourselves hired this poor room for us to live in and sent to order a bill to be put upon her house at padington for she said she would never return to it any more  but are you then cried cecilia without any servant  we have my brothers man madam and so he lights our fires and takes away some of our litters and there is not much else to be done except sweeping the rooms for we eat nothing but cold meat from the cook shops  and how long is this to last  indeed i cannot tell for the real truth is my poor mother has almost lost her senses and ever since our coming here she has been so miserable and so complaining that indeed between her and my brother i have almost lost mine too for when she found all her hopes at an end and that her darling son instead of being rich and powerful and surrounded by friends and admirers all trying who should do the most for him was shut up by himself in this poor little lodging and instead of gaining more had spent all he was worth at first with not a creature to come near him though ill though confined though keeping his bed  oh madam had you seen my poor mother when she first cast her eyes upon him in that condition  indeed you could never have forgotten it  i wonder not at her disappointment cried cecilia with expectations so sanguine and a son of so much merit it might well indeed be bitter  yes and besides the disappointment she is now continually reproaching herself for always complying with his humors and assisting him to appear better than the rest of his family though my father never approved her doing so but she thought herself so sure of his rising that she believed we should all thank her for it in the end and she always used to say that he was born to be a gentleman and what a grievous thing it would be to have him made a tradesman  i hope at least she has not the additional misery of seeing him ungrateful for her fondness however injudicious it may have been  o no he does nothing but comfort and cheer her and indeed it is very good of him for he has owned to me in private that but for her encouragement he could not have run the course he has run for he should have been obliged to enter into business whether he had liked it or not but my poor mother knows this though he will not tell it her and therefore she says that unless he gets well she will punish herself all the rest of her life and never go back to her house and never hire another servant and never eat any thing but bread nor drink any thing but water  poor unhappy woman cried cecilia how dearly does she pay for her imprudent and shortsighted indulgence but surely you are not also to suffer in the same manner  no madam not by her fault for she wants me to go and live with one of my sisters but i would not quit her for the world i should think myself wicked indeed to leave her now besides i dont at all repine at the little hardships i go through at present because my poor brother is in so much distress that all we save may be really turned to account but when we lived so hardly only to procure him luxuries he had no right to i must own i used often to think it unfair and if i had not loved him dearly i should not have borne it so well perhaps as i ought  cecilia now began to think it high time to release her new acquaintance by quitting her though she felt herself so much interested in her affairs that every word she spoke gave her a desire to lengthen the conversation she ardently wished to make her some present but was restrained by the fear of offending or of being again refused she had however devised a private scheme for serving her more effectually than by the donation of a few guineas and therefore after earnestly begging to hear from her if she could possibly be of any use she told her that she should not find her confidence misplaced and promising again to see her soon reluctantly departed  chap vii an expedient the scheme now projected by cecilia was to acquaint the surgeon who had already attended mr belfield with his present situation and address and to desire him to continue his visits for the payment of which she would herself be accountable  the raillery of young delvile however had taught her to fear the constructions of the world and she therefore purposed to keep both the surgeon and mr belfield ignorant to whom they were indebted she was aware indeed that whatever might be her management that highspirited and unfortunate young man would be extremely hurt to find himself thus detected and pursued but she thought his life too well worth preserving to let it be sacrificed to his pride and her internal conviction of being herself the immediate cause of its present danger gave to her an anxious and restless desire to be herself the means of extricating him from it  rupil the name of the surgeon she had already heard mentioned by mr arnott and in getting into her chair she ordered ralph her man to enquire where he lived  i know already where he lives madam answered ralph for i saw his name over a door in cavendishstreet oxfordroad i took particular notice of it because it was at the house where you stood up that day on account of the mob that was waiting to see the malefactors go to tyburn  this answer unravelled to cecilia a mystery which had long perplexed her for the speeches of young delvile when he had surprised her in that situation were now fully explained in seeing her come out of the surgeons house he had naturally concluded she had only entered it to ask news of his patient mr belfield her protestations of merely standing up to avoid the crowd he had only laughed at and his hints at her reserve and dissimulation were meant but to proach her for refusing his offer of procuring her intelligence at the very time when to all appearance she anxiously though clandestinely sought it for herself  this discovery notwithstanding it relieved her from all suspense of his meaning gave her much vexation to be supposed to take an interest so ardent yet so private in the affairs of mr belfield might well authorize all suspicions of her partiality for him and even if any doubt had yet remained the unlucky meeting upon the stairs at his lodgings would not fail to dispel it and confirm the notion of her secret regard she hoped however to have soon some opportunity of clearing up the mistake and resolved in the mean time to be studiously cautious in avoiding all appearances that might strengthen it  no caution however and no apprehension could intimidate her active humanity from putting into immediate execution a plan in which she feared any delay might be fatal and therefore the moment she got home she wrote the following note to the surgeon  to  rupil esquire march         a friend of mr belfield begs mr rupil will immediately call upon that gentleman who is in lodgings about the middle of swallowstreet and insist upon visiting him till he is perfectly recovered mr rupil is entreated not to make known this request nor to receive from mr belfield any return for his attendance but to attribute the discovery of his residence to accident and to rest assured he shall be amply recompensed for his time and trouble by the friend who makes this application and who is willing to give any security that mr rupil shall think proper to mention for the performance of this engagement   her next difficulty was in what manner to have this note conveyed to send her own servant was inevitably betraying herself to employ any other was risking a confidence that might be still more dangerous and she could not trust to the pennypost as her proposal required an answer after much deliberation she at length determined to have recourse to mrs hill to whose services she was entitled and upon whose fidelity she could rely  the morning was already far advanced but the harrels dined late and she would not lose a day where even an hour might be of importance she went therefore immediately to mrs hill whom she found already removed into her new habitation in fetterlane and equally busy and happy in the change of scene and of employment she gave to her the note which she desired her to carry to cavendishstreet directly and either to deliver it into mr rupils own hands or to bring it back if he was out but upon no consideration to make known whence or from whom it came  she then went into the back part of the shop which by mrs roberts was called the parlour and amused herself during the absence of her messenger by playing with the children  mrs hill at her return said she had found mr rupil at home and as she refused to give the letter to the servant she had been taken into a room where he was talking with a gentleman to whom as soon as he had read it he said with a laugh why here is another person with the same proposal as yours however i shall treat you both alike and then he wrote an answer which he sealed up and bid her take care of this answer was as follows  mr rupil will certainly attend mr belfield whose friends may be satisfied he will do all in his power to recover him without receiving any recompense but the pleasure of serving a gentleman who is so much beloved   cecilia charmed at this unhoped for success was making further enquiries into what had passed when mrs hill in a low voice said there is the gentleman madam who was with mr rupil when i gave him the letter i had a notion he was dodging me all the way i came for i saw him just behind me turn which way i would  cecilia then looked  and perceived young delvile who after stopping a moment at the door came into the shop and desired to be shown some gloves which among other things were laid in the window  extremely disconcerted at the sight of him she began now almost to fancy there was some fatality attending her acquantance with him since she was always sure of meeting when she had any reason to wish avoiding him  as soon as he saw he was observed by her he bowed with the utmost respect she oured in returning the salutation and prepared with no little vexation for another attack and further rallery similar to what she had already received from him but as soon as he had made his purchase he bowed to her again and without speaking left the shop  a silence so unexpected at once astonished and disturbed her she again desired to hear  that had passed at mr rupils and from the relation gathered that delvile had himself undertaken to be responsible for his attendance upon mr belfield  a liberality so like her own failed not to impress her with the most lively esteem but this served rather to augment than lessen the pain with which she considered the clandestine appearance she thus repeatedly made to him she had no doubt he had immediately concluded she was author of the application to the surgeon and that he followed her messenger merely to ascertain the fact while his silence when he had made the discovery she could only attribute to his now believing that her regard for mr belfield was too serious for raillery  doubly however she rejoiced at the generosity of mr rupil as it rendered wholly unnecessary her further interference for she now saw with some alarm the danger to which benevolence itself directed toward a youthful object might expose her  chap viii a remonstrance cecilia returned home so late that she was summoned to the dining parlour the moment she entered the house her morning dress and her long absence excited much curiosity in mrs harrel which a quick succession of questions evasively answered soon made general and sir robert floyer turning to her with a look of surprise said if you have such freaks as these miss beverley i must begin to enquire a little more into your proceedings  that sir said cecilia very coldly would ill repay your trouble  when we get her to violet bank cried mr harrel we shall be able to keep a better watch over her  i hope so answered sir robert though faith she has been so demure that i never supposed she did any thing but read sermons however i find there is no going upon trust with women any more than with money  ay sir robert cried mrs harrel you know i always advised you not to be quite so easy and i am sure i really think you deserve a little severity for not being more afraid  afraid of what madam cried the baronet of a young ladys walking out without me do you think i wish to be any restraint upon miss beverleys time in a morning while i have the happiness of waiting upon her every afternoon  cecilia was thunderstruck by this speech which not only expresied an open avowal of his pretensions but a confident security of his success she was shocked that a man of such principles should even for a moment presume upon her favor and irritated at the stubbornness of mr harrel in not acquainting him with her refusal  his intimation of coming to the house for the happiness of waiting upon her made her determine without losing a moment to seek herself an explanation with him while the discovery that he was included in the easter party which various other concomitant causes had already rendered disagreeable to her made her look forward to that purposed expedition with nothing but unwillingness and distaste  but though her earnestness to conclude this affair made her now put herself voluntarily in the way of the baronet she found her plan always counteracted by mr harrel who with an officiousness too obvious to pass for chance constantly stopped the progress of any discourse in which he did not himself bear a part a more passionate admirer might not have been so easily defeated but sir robert too proud for solicitation and too indolent for assiduity was very soon checked because very soon wearied  the whole evening therefore to her infinite mortification passed away without affording her any opportunity of making known to him his mistake  her next effort was to remonstrate with mr harrel himself but this scheme was not more easy of execution than the other since mr harrel suspecting she meant again to dun him for her money avoided all separate conversation with her so skilfully that she could not find a moment to make him hear her  she then resolved to apply to his lady but here her success was not better mrs harrel dreading another lecture upon economy peevishly answered to her request of a conference that she was not very well and could not talk gravely  cecilia justly offended with them all had now no resource but in mr monckton whose counsel for effectually dismissing the baronet she determined to solicit by the first opportunity  the moment therefore that she next saw him she acquainted him with the speeches of sir robert and the behavior of mr harrel  there needed no rhetoric to point out to mr monckton the danger of suffering such expectations or the impropriety of her present situation he was struck with both in a manner the most forcible and spared not for warmth of expression to alarm her delicacy or add to her displeasure but chiefly he was exasperated against mr harrel assuring her there could be no doubt but that he had some particular interest in so strenuously and artfully supporting the pretensions of sir robert cecilia endeavored to refute this opinion which she regarded as proceeding rather from prejudice than justice but when she mentioned that the baronet was invited to spend the easter holidays at violet bank he represented with such energy the consequent constructions of the world as well as the unavoidable encouragement such intimacy would imply that he terrified her into an earnest entreaty to suggest to her some way of deliverance  there is only one answered he you must peremptorily refuse to go to violet bank yourself if after what has passed you are included in the same party with sir robert you give a sanction yourself to the reports already circulated of your engagements with him and the effect of such a sanction will be more serious than you can easily imagine since the knowledge that a connection is believed in the world frequently if not generally leads by imperceptible degrees to its real ratification  cecilia with the utmost alacrity promised implicitly to follow his advice whatever might be the opposition of mr harrel he quitted her therefore with unusual satisfaction happy in his power over her mind and anticipating with secret rapture the felicity he had in reserve from visiting her during the absence of the family  as no private interview was necessary for making known her intention of giving up the easter party which was to take place in two days time she mentioned the next morning her design of spending the holidays in town when mr harrel sauntered into the breakfast room to give some commission to his lady  at first he only laughed at her plan gaily rallying her upon her love of solitude but when he found it was serious he very warmly opposed it and called upon mrs harrel to join in his expostulations that lady complied but in so faint a manner that cecilia soon saw she did not wish to prevail and with a concern that cost her infinite pain now finally perceived that not only all her former affection was subsided into indifference but that since she had endeavored to abridge her amusements she regarded her as a spy and dreaded her as the censor of her conduct  mean while mr arnott who was present though he interfered not in the debate waited the event with anxiety naturally hoping her objections arose from her dislike of sir robert and secretly resolving to be guided himself by her motions  cecilia at length tired of the importunities of mr harrel gravely said that if he desired to hear the reasons which obliged her to refuse his request she was ready to communicate them  mr harrel after a little hesitation accompanied her into another room  she then declared her resolution not to live under the same roof with sir robert and very openly expressed her vexation and displeasure that he so evidently persisted in giving that gentleman encouragement  my dear miss beverley answered he carelessly when young ladies will not know their own minds it is necessary some friend should tell it them you were certainly very favorable to sir robert but a short time ago and so i dare say you will be again when you have seen more of him  you amaze me sir cried cecilia when was i favorable to him has he not always and regularly been my aversion  i fancy answered mr harrel laughing you will not easily persuade him to think so your behavior at the operahouse was ill calculated to give him that notion  my behavior at the operahouse sir i have already explained to you and if sir robert himself has any doubts either from that circumstance or from any other pardon me if i say they can only be attributed to your unwillingness to remove them i entreat you therefore to trifle with him no longer nor to subject me again to the freedom of implications extremely disagreeable to me  o fie fie miss beverley after all that has passed after his long expectations and his constant attendance you cannot for a moment think seriously of discarding him  cecilia equally surprised and provoked by this speech could not for a moment tell how to answer it and mr harrel wilfully misinterpreting her silence took her hand and said come i am sure you have too much honor to make a fool of such a man as sir robert floyer there is not a woman in town who will not envy your choice and i assure you there is not a man in england i would so soon recommend to you  he would then have hurried her back to the next room but drawing away her hand with undisguised resentment no sir she cried this must not pass my positive rejection of sir robert the instant you communicated to me his proposals you can neither have forgotten nor mistaken and you must not wonder if i acknowledge myself extremely disobliged by your unaccountable perseverance in refusing to receive my answer  young ladies who have been brought up in the country returned mr harrel with his usual negligence are always so high flown in their notions it is difficult to deal with them but as i am much better acquainted with the world than you can be you must give me leave to tell you that if after all you refuse sir robert it will be using him very ill  why will you say so sir cried cecilia when it is utterly impossible you can have formed so preposterous an opinion pray hear me however finally and pray tell sir robert    no no interrupted he with affected gaiety you shall manage it all your own way i will have nothing to do with the quarrels of lovers  and then with a pretended laugh he hastily left her  cecilia was so much incensed by this impracticable behavior that instead of returning to the family she went directly to her own room it was easy for her to see that mr harrel was bent upon using every method he could devise to entangle her into some engagement with sir robert and though she could not imagine the meaning of such a scheme the littleness of his behavior excited her contempt and the longcontinued error of the baronet gave her the utmost uneasiness she again determined to seek an explanation with him herself and immovably to refuse joining the party to violet bank  the following day while the ladies and mr arnott were at breakfast mr harrel came into the room to enquire if they should all be ready to set off for his villa by ten oclock the next day mrs harrel and her brother answered in the affirmative but cecilia was silent and he turned to her and repeated his question  do you think me so capricious sir said she that after telling you but yesterday i could not be of your party i shall tell you today that i can  why you do not really mean to remain in town by yourself replied he you cannot suppose that will be an eligible plan for a young lady on the contrary it will be so very improper that i think myself as your guardian obliged to oppose it  amazed at this authoritative speech cecilia looked at him with a mixture of mortification and anger but knowing it would be vain to resist his power if he was resolute to exert it she made not any answer  besides he continued i have a plan for some alterations in the house during my absence and i think your room in particular will be much improved by them but it will be impossible to employ any workmen if we do not all quit the premises  this determined persecution now seriously alarmed her she saw that mr harrel would omit no expedient or stratagem to encourage the addresses of sir robert and force her into his presence and she began next to apprehend that her connivance in his conduct might be presumed upon by that gentleman she resolved therefore as the last and only effort in her power for avoiding him to endeavor to find an accommodation at the house of mrs delvile during the excursion to violet bank and if when she returned to portmansquare the baronet still persevered in his attendance to entreat her friend mr monckton would take upon himself the charge of undeceiving him  chap ix a victory as not a moment was now to be lost cecilia had no sooner suggested this scheme than she hastened to st jamess square to try its practicability  she found mrs delvile alone and still at breakfast  after the first compliments were over while she was considering in what manner to introduce her proposal mrs delvile herself led to the subject by saying i am very sorry to hear we are so soon to lose you but i hope mr harrel does not intend to make any long stay at his villa for if he does i shall be half tempted to come and run away with you from him  and that said cecilia delighted with this opening would be an honor i am more than half tempted to desire  why indeed your leaving london at this time continued mrs delvile is for me particularly unfortunate as if i could now be favored with your visits i should doubly value them for mr delvile is gone to spend the holydays at the duke of derwents whither i was not well enough to accompany him my son has his own engagements and there are so few people i can bear to see that i shall live almost entirely alone  if i cried cecilia in such a situation might hope to be admitted how gladly for that happiness would i exchange my expedition to violetbank  you are very good and very amiable said mrs delvile and your society would indeed give me infinite satisfaction yet i am no enemy to solitude on the contrary company is commonly burdensome to me i find few who have any power to give me entertainment and even of those few the chief part have in their manners situation or characters an unfortunate something that generally renders a near connection with them inconvenient or disagreeable there are indeed so many drawbacks to regard and intimacy from pride from propriety and various other collateral causes that rarely as we meet with people of brilliant parts there is almost ever some objection to our desire of meeting them again yet to live wholly alone is chearless and depressing and with you at least taking cecilias hand i find not one single obstacle to oppose to a thousand inducements which invite me to form a friendship that i can only hope may be as lasting as i am sure it will be pleasant  cecilia expressed her sense of this partiality in the warmest terms and mrs delvile soon discovering by her manner that she took not any del ght in her intended visit to violetbank began next to question her whether it would be possible for her to give it up  she instantly answered in the affirmative  and would you really be so obliging cried mrs delvile with some surprise as to bestow upon me the time you had destined for this gay excursion  most willingly answered cecilia if you are so good as to wish it  but can you also  for you must by no means remain alone in portman square  manage to live entirely in my house till mr harrels return  to this proposal which was what she most desired cecilia gave a glad assent and mrs delvile extremely pleased with her compliance promised to have an apartment prepared for her immediately  she then hastened home to announce her new plan  this she took occasion to do when the family was assembled at dinner the surprise with which she was heard was very general sir robert seemed at a loss what conclusion to draw from her information mr arnott was half elated with pleasure and half depressed with apprehension mrs harrel wondered without any other sensation and mr harrel himself was evidently the most concerned of the party  every effort of persuasion and importunity he now essayed to prevail upon her to give up this scheme and still accompany them to the villa but she coolly answered that her engagement with mrs delvile was decided and she had appointed to wait upon her the next morning  when her resolution was found so steady a general ill humor took place of surprise sir robert now had the air of a man who thought himself affronted mr arnott was wretched from a thousand uncertainties mrs harrel indeed was still the most indifferent but mr harrel could hardly repress his disappointment and anger  cecilia however was all gaiety and pleasure in removing only from the house of one guardian to another she knew she could not be opposed and the flattering readiness with which mrs delvile had anticipated her request without enquiring into her motives had relieved her from a situation which now grew extremely distressing without giving to her the pain of making complaints of mr harrel the absence of mr delvile contributed to her happiness and she much rejoiced in having now the prospect of a speedy opportunity to explain to his son whatever had appeared mysterious in her conduct respecting mr belfield if she had any thing to regret it was merely the impossibility at this time of waiting for the counsel of mr monckton  the next morning while the family was in the midst of preparation for departure she took leave of mrs harrel who faintly lamented the loss of her company and then hastily made her compliments to mr harrel and mr arnott and putting herself into a chair was conveyed to her new habitation  mrs delvile received her with the most distinguished politeness she conducted her to the apartment which had been prepared for her led her to the library which she desired her to make use of as her own and gave her the most obliging charges to remember that she was in a house of which she had the command  young delvile did not make his appearance till dinner time cecilia from recollecting the strange situations in which she had lately been seen by him blushed extremely when she first met his eyes but finding him gay and easy general in his conversation and undesigning in his looks she soon recovered from her embarrassment and passed the rest of the day without restraint or uneasiness  every hour she spent with mrs delvile contributed to raise in her esteem the mind and understanding of that lady she found indeed that it was not for nothing she was accused of pride but she found at the same time so many excellent qualities so much true dignity of mind and so noble a spirit of liberality that however great was the respect she seemed to demand it was always inferior to what she felt inclined to pay  nor was young delvile less rapid in the progress he made in her favor his character upon every opportunity of showing it rose in her opinion and his disposition and manners had a mingled sweetness and vivacity that rendered his society attractive and his conversation spirited  here therefore cecilia experienced that happiness she so long had coveted in vain her life was neither public nor private her amusements were neither dissipated nor retired the company she saw were either people of high rank or strong parts and their visits were neither frequent nor long the situation she quitted gave a zest to that into which she entered for she was now no longer shocked by extravagance or levity no longer tormented with addresses which disgusted her nor mortified by the ingratitude of the friend she had endeavored to serve all was smooth and serene yet lively and interesting  her plan however of clearing to young delvile his mistakes concerning belfield she could not put in execution for he now never led to the subject though he was frequently alone with her nor seemed at all desirous to renew his former raillery or repeat his enquiries she wondered at this change in him but chose rather to wait the revival of his own curiosity than to distress or perplex herself by contriving methods of explanation  situated thus happily she had now one only anxiety which was to know whether and in what manner mr belfield had received his surgeon as well as the actual state of his own and his sisters affairs but the fear of again encountering young delvile in suspicious circumstances deterred her at present from going to their house yet her natural benevolence which partial convenience never lulled to sleep impressing her with an apprehension that her services might be wanted she was induced to write to miss belfield though she forbore to visit her  her letter was short but kind and to the purpose she apologized for her officiousness desired to know if her brother was better and entreated her in terms the most delicate to acquaint her if yet she would accept from her any assistance  she sent this letter by her servant who after waiting a considerable time brought her the following answer  to miss beverley ah madam your goodness quite melts me we want nothing however yet though i fear we shall not say so much longer but though i hope i shall never forget myself so as to be proud and impertinent i will rather struggle with any hardship than beg for i will not disoblige my poor brother by any fault that i can help especially now he is fallen so low but thank heaven his wound has at last been dressed for the surgeon has found him out and he attends him for nothing though my brother is willing to part with every thing he is worth in the world rather than owe that obligation to him yet i often wonder why he hates so to be obliged for when he was rich himself he was always doing something to oblige other people but i fear the surgeon thinks him very bad for he will not speak to us when we follow him down stairs  i am sadly ashamed to send this bad writing but i dare not ask my brother for any help because he would only be angry that i wrote any thing about him at all but indeed i have seen too little good come of pride to think of imitating it and as i have not his genius i am sure there is no need i should have his defects ill therefore as i write you madam who have so much goodness and gentleness would forgive it i believe if it was worse almost and though we are not in need of your kind offers it is a great comfort to me to think there is a lady in the world that if we come to be quite destitute and if the proud heart of my poor unhappy brother should be quite broke down will look upon our distress with pity and generously help us from quite sinking under it i remain  madam with the most humble respect your ever most obliged humble servant henrietta belfield   cecilia much moved by the simplicity of this letter determined that her very first visit from portmansquare should be to its fair and innocent writer and having now an assurance that she was in no immediate distress and that her brother was actually under mr rupils care she dismissed from her mind the only subject of uneasiness that at present had endeavored to disturb it and gave herself wholly up to the delightful serenity of unallayed happiness  few are the days of felicity unmixed which we acknowledge while we experience though many are those we deplore when by sorrow taught their value and by misfortune their loss time with cecilia now glided on with such rapidity that before she thought the morning half over the evening was closed and ere she was sensible the first week was past the second was departed for ever more and more pleased with the inmates of her new habitation she found in the abilities of mrs delvile sources inexhaustible of entertainment and in the disposition and sentiments of her son something so concordant to her own that almost every word he spoke showed the sympathy of their minds and almost every look which caught her eyes was a reciprocation of intelligence her heart deeply wounded of late by unexpected indifference and undeserved mortification was now perhaps more than usually susceptible of those penetrating and exquisite pleasures which friendship and kindness possess the highest powers of bestowing easy gay and airy she only rose to happiness and only retired to rest and not merely heightened was her present enjoyment by her past disappointment but carrying her retrospection to her earliest remembrance she still found her actual situation more peculiarly adapted to her taste and temper than any she had hitherto at any time experienced  the very morning that the destined fortnight was elapsed she received a note from mrs harrel with information of her arrival in town and an entreaty that she would return to portmansquare  cecilia who thus happy had forgot to mark the progress of time was now all amazement to find the term of her absence so soon past she thought of going back with the utmost reluctance and of quitting her new abode with the most lively regret the representations of mr monckton daily lost their force and notwithstanding her dislike of mr delvile she had no wish so earnest as that of being settled in his family for the rest of her minority  to effect this was her next thought yet she knew not how to make the proposal but from the uncommon partiality of mrs delvile she hoped with a very little encouragement she would lead to it herself  here however she was disappointed mrs delvile when she heard of the summons from the harrels expressed her sorrow at losing her in terms of the most flattering regret yet seemed to think the parting indispensable and dropped not the most distant hint of attempting to prevent it  cecilia vexed and disconcerted then made arrangements for her departure which she fixed for the next morning  the rest of this day unlike every other which for the last fortnight had preceded it was passed with little appearance and no reality of satisfaction mrs delvile was evidently concerned her son openly avowed his chagrin and cecilia felt the utmost mortification yet though every one was discontented no effort was made toward obtaining any delay  the next morning during breakfast mrs delvile very elegantly thanked her for granting to her so much of her time and earnestly begged to see her in future whenever she could be spared from her other friends protesting she was now so accustomed to her society that she should require both long and frequent visits to soften the separation this request was very eagerly seconded by young delvile who warmly spoke his satisfaction that his mother had found so charming a friend and unaffectedly joined in her entreaties that the intimacy might be still more closely cemented  cecilia had no great difficulty in according her compliance to those demands of which the kindness and cordiality somewhat lessened her disturbance at the parting  when mrs harrels carriage arrived mrs delvile took a most affectionate leave of her and her son attended her to the coach  in her way down stairs he stopped her for a few moments and in some confusion said i wish much to apologize to miss beverley before her departure for the very gross mistake of which i have been guilty i know not if it is possible she can pardon me and i hardly know myself by what perversity and blindness i persisted so long in my error  o cried cecilia much rejoiced at this voluntary explanation if you are but convinced you were really in an error i have nothing more to wish appearances indeed were so strangely against me that i ought not perhaps to wonder they deceived you  this is being candid indeed answered he again leading her on and in truth though your anxiety was obvious its cause was obscure and where any thing is left to conjecture opinion interferes and the judgment is easily warped my own partiality however for mr belfield will i hope plead my excuse as from that and not from any prejudice against the baronet my mistake arose on the contrary so highly i respect your taste and your discernment that your approbation when known can scarcely fail of securing mine  great as was the astonishment of cecilia at the conclusion of this speech she was at the coach door before she could make any answer but delvile perceiving her surprise added while he handed her in is it possible  but no it is not possible i should be again mistaken i forbore to speak at all till i had information by which i could not be misled  i know not in what unaccountable obscurity cried cecilia i or my affairs may be involved but i perceive that the cloud which i had hoped was dissipated is thicker and more impenetrable than ever  delvile then bowed to her with a look that accused her of insincerity and the carriage drove away  teazed by these eternal mistakes and provoked to find that though the object of her supposed partiality was so frequently changed the notion of her positive engagement with one of the duelists was invariable she resolved with all the speed in her power to commission mr monckton to wait upon sir robert floyer and in her own name give a formal rejection to his proposals and desire him thenceforward to make known by every opportunity their total independance of each other for sick of debating with mr harrel and detesting all intercourse with sir robert she now dropped her design of seeking an explanation herself  she was received by mrs harrel with the same coldness with which she had parted from her that lady appeared now to have some uneasiness upon her mind and cecilia endeavored to draw from her its cause but far from seeking any alleviation in friendship she studiously avoided her seeming pained by her conversation and reproached by her sight cecilia perceived this increasing reserve with much concern but with more indignation conscious that her good offices had merited a better reception and angry to find that her advice had not merely failed of success but even exposed her to aversion  mr harrel on the contrary behaved to her with unusual civility seemed eager to oblige her and desirous to render his house more agreeable to her than ever but in this he did not prosper for cecilia immediately upon her return looking in her apartment for the projected alterations and finding none had been made was so disgusted by such a detection of duplicity that he sunk yet lower than before in her opinion and she repined at the necessity she was under of any longer continuing his guest  the joy of mr arnott at again seeing her was visible and sincere and not a little was it increased by finding that cecilia who sought not more to avoid mr harrel and sir robert than she was herself avoided by mrs harrel talked with pleasure to nobody else in the house and scarcely attempted to conceal that he was the only one of the family who possessed any portion of her esteem  even sir robert appeared now to have formed a design of paying her rather more respect than he had hitherto thought necessary but the violence he did himself was so evident and his imperious nature seemed so repugnant to the task that his insolence breaking forth by starts and checked only by compulsion was but the more conspicuous from his inadequate efforts to disguise it  book iv chapter i a complaint as cecilia now found herself cleared at least of all suspicions of harboring too tender a regard for mr belfield her objections to visiting his sister were removed and the morning after her return to mr harrels she went in a chair to swallowstreet  she sent her servant up stairs to enquire if she might be admitted and was immediately taken into the room where she had twice before been received  in a few minutes miss belfield softly opening and shutting the door of the next apartment made her appearance she looked thin and pale but much gratified by the sight of cecilia ah madam she cried you are good indeed not to forget us and you can little think how it chears and consoles me that such a lady as you can condescend to be kind to me it is quite the only pleasure that i have now in the whole world  i grieve that you have no greater cried cecilia you seem much fatigued and harrassed how is your brother i fear you neglect your own health by too much attention to his  no indeed madam my mother does every thing for him herself and hardly suffers any body else to go near him  what then makes you so melancholy said cecilia taking her hand you do not look well your anxiety i am sure is too much for your strength  how should i look well madam answered she living as i live however i will not talk of myself but of my brother  o he is so ill indeed i am sadly sadly afraid he will never be well again  what does his surgeon say you are too tender and too much frightened to be any judge  it is not that i think myself he will die of his wound for mr rupil says the wound is almost nothing but he is in a constant fever and so thin and so weak that indeed it is almost impossible he should recover  you are too apprehensive said cecilia you know not what effect the country air may have upon him there are many many expedients that with so young a man may yet be successful  o no the country air can do nothing for him for i will not deceive you madam for that would be doubly a fault when i am so ready in blaming other people for wearing false appearances besides you are so good and so gentle that it quite composes me to talk with you so i will honestly speak the truth and the whole truth at once my poor brother is lost  o i fear for ever lost  all by his own unhappy pride he forgets his father was a tradesman he is asnamed of all his family and his whole desire is to live among the grandest people as if he belonged to no other and now that he can no longer do that he takes the disappointment so to heart that he cannot get the better of it and he told me this morning that he wished he was dead for he did not know why he should live only to see his own ruin but when he saw how i cried at his saying so he was very sorry indeed f he has always been the kindest brother in the world when he has been away from the reat folks who have spoilt him but why said he henrietta why would you have me live when instead of raising you and my poor mother into an higher station i am sunk so low that i only help to consume your own poor pittances to support me in my disgrace  i am sorry indeed said cecilia to find he has so deep a sense of the failure of his expectations but how happens it that you are so much wiser young and inexperienced as you are and early as you must have been accustomed from your mother as well as from mr belfield to far other doctrine the clearness of your judgment and the justness of your remarks astonish as much as they charm me  ah madam brought up as i have been brought up there is little wonder i should see the danger of an high education let me be ever so ignorant of every thing else for i and all my sisters have been the sufferers the whole time and while we were kept backward that he might be brought forward while we were denied comforts that he might have luxuries how could we help seeing the evil of so much vanity and wishing we had all been brought up according to our proper station instead of living in continual inconvenience and having one part of a family struggling with distress only to let another part of it appear in a way he had no right to  how rationally said cecilia have you considered this subject and how much do i honor you for the affection you retain for your brother notwithstanding the wrongs you have suffered to promote his elevation  indeed he deserves it take but from him that one fault pride and i believe he has not another and humoured and darling child as from his infancy he has always been who at that can wonder or be angry  and has he still no plan no scheme for his future destination  no madam none at all and that it is makes him so miserable and being so miserable makes him so ill for mr rupil says that with such uneasiness upon his mind he can never in his present low state get well o it is melancholy to see how he is altered and how he has lost all his fine spirits he that used to be the life of us all  and now he hardly ever speaks a word or if he does he says something so sorrowful that it cuts us to the soul but yesterday when my mother and i thought he was asleep he lifted up his head and looked at us both with the tears in his eyes which almost broke our hearts to see and then in a low voice he said what a lingering illness is this ah my dear mother you and poor henrietta ought to wish it quicker over for should i recover my life hereafter will but linger like this illness and afterward he called out what on earth is to become of me i shall never have health for the army nor interest nor means what am i to do subsist in the very prime of my life upon the bounty of a widowed mother or with such an education such connections as mine enter at last into some mean and sordid business  it seems then said cecilia he now less wants a physician than a friend  he has a friend madam a noble friend would he but accept his services but he never sees him without suffering fresh vexation and his fever increases after every visit he pays him  well cried cecilia rising i find we shall not have an easy task to manage him but keep up your spirits and assure yourself he shall not be lost if it be possible to save him  she then though with much fearfulness of offending once more made an offer of her purse miss belfield no longer started at the proposal yet gratefully thanking her said she was not in any immediate distress and did not dare risk the displeasure of her brother unless driven to it by severer necessity cecilia however drew from her a promise that she would apply to her in any sudden difficulty and charged her never to think herself without a banker while her direction was known to her  she then bid her adieu and returned home meditating the whole way upon some plan of employment and advantage for mr belfield which by clearing his prospects might revive his spirits and facilitate his recovery for since his mind was so evidently the seat of his disease she saw that unless she could do more for him she had yet done nothing  her meditation however turned to no account she could suggest nothing for she was ignorant what was eligible to suggest the stations and employments of men she only knew by occasionally hearing that such were their professions and such their situations in life but with the means and gradations by which they arose to them she was wholly unacquainted  mr monckton her constant resource in all cases of difficulty immediately occurred to her as her most able counselor and the determined by the first opportunity to consult with him upon the subject certain of advice the most judicious from his experience and knowledge of the world  but though she rested upon him her serious expectations of assistance another idea entered her mind not less pleasant though less promising of utility this was to mention her views to young delvile he was already she knew well informed of the distress of mr belfield and she hoped by openly asking his opinion to confirm to him her freedom from any engagement with that gentleman and convince him at the same time by her application to himself that she was equally clear of any tie with the baronet  chap ii a sympathy the next day cecilia had appointed to spend in st jamess square and she knew by experience that in its course she should in all probability find some opportunity of speaking with delvile alone  this accordingly happened for in the evening mrs delvile quitted the room for a few moments to answer a letter cecilia then left with her son said after a little hesitation will you not think me very strange if i should take the liberty to consult you upon some business  i already think you very strange answered he so strange that i know not any one who at all resembles you but what is this consultation in which you will permit me to have a voice  you are acquainted i believe with the distress of mr belfield  i am and i think his situation the most melancholy that can be imagined i pity him with my whole soul and nothing would give me greater joy than an opportunity of serving him  he is indeed much to be compassionated returned cecilia and if something is not speedily done for him i fear he will be utterly lost the agitation of his mind baffles all the power of medicine and till that is relieved his health can never be restored his spirit probably always too high for his rank in life now struggles against every attack of sickness and of poverty in preference to yielding to his fate and applying to his friends for their interest and assistance i mean not to vindicate his obduracy yet i wish it were possible it could be surmounted indeed i dread to think what may become of him feeling at present nothing but wretchedness and pain looking forward in future to nothing but ruin and despair  there is no man cried young delvile with emotion who might not rather envy than pity sufferings which give rise to such compassion  pecuniary assistance he will not accept she continued and indeed his mind is superior to receiving consolation from such temporary relief i wish him therefore to be put into some way of life by which his own talents which have long enough amused the world may at length become serviceable to himself do you think sir this is possible  how do i rejoice cried delvile coloring with pleasure while he spoke in this flattering concurrence of our opinions see madam taking from his pocket a letter how i have been this very morning occupied in endeavoring to procure for mr belfield some employment by which his education might be rendered useful and his parts redound to his own credit and advantage  he then broke the seal and put into her hand a letter to a nobleman whose son was soon going abroad strongly recommending belfield to him in capacity of a tutor  a sympathy of sentiment so striking impressed them at the same moment with surprise and esteem delvile earnestly regarded her with eyes of speaking admiration while the occasion of his notice rendered it too pleasant to distress her and filled her with an inward satisfaction which brightened her whole countenance  she had only time in a manner that strongly marked her approbation to return the letter before mrs delvile again made her appearance  during the rest of the evening but little was said cecilia was not talkative and young delvile was so absent that three times his mother reminded him of an engagement to meet his father who that night was expected at the duke of derwents house in town before he heard that she spoke to him and three times more before when he had heard he obeyed  cecilia when she came back to mr harrels found the house full of company she went into the drawing room but did not remain there long she was grave and thoughtful she wished to be alone and by the earliest opportunity stole away to her own apartment  her mind was now occupied by new ideas and her fancy was busied in the delineation of new prospects she had been struck from her first meeting young delvile with an involuntary admiration of his manners and conversation she had found upon every succeeding interview something further to approve and felt for him a rising partiality which made her always see him with pleasure and never part from him without a wish to see him again yet as she was not of that inflammable nature which is always ready to take fire as her passions were under the control of her reason and she suffered not her affections to triumph over her principles she started at her danger the moment she perceived it and instantly determined to give no weak encouragement to a prepossession which neither time nor intimacy had justified she denied herself the deluding satisfaction of dwelling upon the supposition of his worth was unusually assiduous to occupy all her time that her heart might have less leisure for imagination and had she found that his character degenerated from the promise of his appearance the well regulated purity of her mind would soon have enabled her to have driven him wholly from her thoughts  such was her situation when the circumstances of her affairs occasioned her becoming an inmate of his house and here she grew less guarded because less clearsighted to the danger of negligence for the frequency of their conversation allowed her little time to consider their effects if at first she had been pleased with his deportment and elegance upon intimacy she was charmed with his disposition and his behavior she found him manly generous openhearted and amiable fond of literature delighting in knowledge kind in his temper and spirited in his actions  qualities such as these when recommended by high birth a striking figure and polished manners formed but a dangerous companion for a young woman who without the guard of any former prepossession was so fervent an admirer of excellence as cecilia her heart made no resistance for the attack was too gentle and too gradual to alarm her vigilance and therefore though always sensible of the pleasure she received from his society it was not till she returned to portmansquare after having lived under the same roof with him for a fortnight that she was conscious her happiness was no longer in her own power  mr harrels house which had never pleased her now became utterly disgustful she was wearied and uncomfortable yet willing to attribute her uneasiness to any other than the true cause she fancied the house itself was changed and that all its inhabitants and visitors were more than usually disagreeable but this idle error was of short duration the moment of selfconviction was at hand and when delvile presented her the letter he had written for mr belfield it flashed in her eyes  this detection of the altered state of her mind opened to her views and her hopes a scene entirely new for neither the exertion of the most active benevolence nor the steady course of the most virtuous conduct sufficed any longer to wholly engage her thoughts or constitute her felicity she had purposes that came nearer home and cares that threatened to absorb in themselves that heart and those faculties which hitherto had only seemed animated for the service of others  yet this loss of mental freedom gave her not much uneasiness since the choice of her heart though involuntary was approved by her principles and confirmed by her judgment young delviles situation in life was just what she wished more elevated than her own yet not so exalted as to humble her with a sense of inferiority his connections were honorable his mother appeared to her the first of women his character and disposition seemed formed to make her happy and her own fortune was so large that to the state of his she was indifferent  delighted with so flattering a union of inclination with propriety she now began to cherish the partiality she at first had repressed and thinking the future destination of her life already settled looked forward with grateful joy to the prospect of ending her days with the man she thought most worthy to be entrusted with the disposal of her fortune  she had not indeed any certainty that the regard of young delvile was reciprocal but she had every reason to believe he greatly admired her and to suspect that his mistaken notion of her prior engagement first with mr belfield and afterward with sir robert floyer made him at present check those sentiments in her favor which when that error was removed she hoped to see encouraged  her purpose therefore was quietly to wait an explanation which she rather wished retarded than forwarded that her leisure and opportunity might be more for investigating his character and saving herself from repentance  chap iii a conflict the day following this happy intellectual arrangement cecilia was visited by mr monckton that gentleman who had enquired for her immediately after the harrels went to their villa and who had flattered himself with reaping much advantage from their absence by frequent meetings and confidential discourses suffered the severest mortification when he found that her stay in town rendered her not the less inaccessible to him since he had no personal acquaintance with the delviles and could not venture to present himself at their house  he was now received by her with more than usual pleasure the time had seemed long to her since she had conversed with him and she was eager to ask his counsel and assistance in her affairs she related to him the motives which had induced her to go to st james square and the incorrigible obstinacy with which mr harrel still continued to encourage the addresses of sir robert floyer she earnestly entreated him to become her agent in a business to which she was unequal by expostulating in her cause with mr harrel and by calling upon sir robert himself to insist upon his foregoing his unauthorised pretensions  mr monckton listened eagerly to her account and request and when she had finished assured her he would deliberate upon each circumstance of the affair and then maturely weigh every method he could devise to extricate her from an embarrassment which now grew far too serious to be safely neglected  i will not however continued he either act or give my opinion without further enquiry as i am confident there is a mystery in this business which lies deeper than we can at present fathom mr harrel has doubtless purposes of his own to answer by this pretended zeal for sir robert nor is it difficult to conjecture what they may be friendship in a man of his light cast is a mere cover a mere name to conceal a connection which has its basis solely in the licentious convenience of borrowing money going to the same gaming house and mutually communicating and boasting their mutual vices and intrigues while all the time their regard for each other is equally hollow with their regard for truth and integrity  he then cautioned her to be extremely careful with respect to any money transactions with mr harrel whose splendid extravagance he assured her was universally known to exceed his fortune  the countenance of cecilia during this exhortation was testimony sufficient to the penetrating eyes of mr monckton that his advice came not too soon a suspicion of the real state of the case speedily occurred to him and he questioned her minutely upon the subject she endeavored to avoid making him any answer but his discernment was too keen for her inartificial evasion and he very soon gathered all the particulars of her transactions with mr harrel  he was less alarmed at the sum she had lent him which was rather within his expectations than at the method she had been induced to take to procure it he represented to her in the strongest manner the danger of imposition nay of ruin from the extortions and the craft of moneylenders and he charged her upon no consideration to be tempted or persuaded again to have recourse to such perilous expedients  she promised the most attentive observance of his advice and then told him the acquaintance she had made with miss belfield and her sorrow for the situation of her brother though satisfied for the present with the plan of young delvile she now gave up her design of soliciting his counsel  in the midst of this conversation a note was delivered to her from mr delvile senior acquainting her with his return to town and begging the favor of her to call in st jamess square the next morning as he wished to speak to her upon some business of importance  the eager manner in which cecilia accepted this invitation and her repeated and earnest exclamation of wonder at what mr delvile could have to say past not unnoticed by mr monckton he instantly turned the discourse from the belfields the harrels and the baronet to enquire how she had spent her time during her visit in st james square and what was her opinion of the family after her late opportunities of intimacy  cecilia answered that she had yet seen nothing more of mr delvile who had been absent the whole time but with equal readiness and pleasure she replied to all his questions concerning his lady expatiating with warmth and fervor upon her many rare and estimable qualities  but when the same interrogatories were transferred to the son she spoke no longer with the same ease nor with her usual promptitude of sincerity she was embarrassed her answers were short and she endeavored to hasten from the subject  mr monckton remarked this change with the most apprehensive quickness but forcing a smile have you yet he said observed the family compact in which those people are bound to besiege you and draw you into their snares  no indeed cried cecilia much hurt by the question i am sure no such compact has been formed and i am sure too that if you knew them better you would yourself be the first to admire and do them justice  my dear miss beverley cried he i know them already i do not indeed visit them but i am perfectly acquainted with their characters which have been drawn to me by those who are most closely connected with them and who have had opportunities of inspection which i hope will never fall to your share since i am satisfied the trial would pain though the proof would convince you  what then have you heard of them cried cecilia with much earnestness it is at least not possible any ill can be said of mrs delvile  i beg your pardon returned he mrs delvile is not nearer perfection than the rest of her family she has only more art in disguising her foibles because though she is the daughter of pride she is the slave of interest  i see you have been greatly misinformed said cecilia warmly mrs delvile is the noblest of women she may indeed from her very exaltation have enemies but they are the enemies of envy not of resentment enemies raised by superior merit not excited by injury or provocation  you will know her better hereafter said mr monckton calmly i only hope your knowledge will not be purchased by the sacrifice of your happiness  and what knowledge of her sir cried cecilia starting can have power to put my happiness in any danger  i will tell you answered he with all the openness you have a claim to from my regard and then leave to time to show if i am mistaken the delvile family notwithstanding its ostentatious magnificence i can solemnly assure you is poor in every branch alike lineal and collateral  but is it therefore the less estimable  yes because the more rapacious and while they count on each side dukes earls and barons in their genealogy the very wealth with which through your means they project the support of their insolence and which they will grasp with all the greediness of avarice they will think honored by being employed in their service while the instrument all amiable as she is by which they attain it will be constantly held down as the disgrace of their alliance  cecilia stung to the soul by this speech rose from her chair unwilling to answer it yet unable to conceal how much it shocked her mr monckton perceiving her emotion followed her and taking her hand said i would not give this warning to one i thought too weak to profit from it but as i am well informed of the use that is meant to be made of your fortune and the abuse that will follow of yourself i think it right to prepare you for their artifices which merely to point out may render abortive  cecilia too much disturbed to thank him drew back her hand and continued silent mr monckton reading through her displeasure the state of her affections saw with terror the greatness of the danger which threatened him he found however that the present was no time for enforcing objections and perceiving he had already gone too far though he was by no means disposed to recant he thought it most prudent to retreat and let her meditate upon his exhortation while its impression was yet strong in her mind  he would now therefore have taken leave but cecilia endeavoring to recollect herself and fully persuaded that however he had shocked her he had only her interest in view stopped him saying you think me perhaps ungrateful but believe me i am not i must however acknowledge that your censure of mrs delvile hurts me extremely indeed i cannot doubt her worthiness i must still therefore plead for her and i hope the time may come when you will allow i have not pleaded unjustly  justly or unjustly answered mr monckton i am at least sure you can never plead vainly i give up therefore to your opinion my attack of mrs delvile and am willing from your commendations to suppose her the best of the race nay i will even own that perhaps mr delvile himself as well as his lady might pass through life and give but little offense had they only themselves to think of and no son to stimulate their arrogance  is the son then said cecilia faintly so much the most culpable  the son i believe answered he is at least the chief incentive to insolence and ostentation in the parents since it is for his sake they covet with such avidity honors and riches since they plume themselves upon regarding him as the support of their name and family and since their pride in him even surpasses their pride in their lineage and themselves  ah thought cecilia and of such a son who could help being proud  their purpose therefore he continued is to secure through his means your fortune which they will no sooner obtain than to my certain knowledge they mean instantly and most unmercifully to employ it in repairing all their dilapidated estates  and then he quitted the subject and with that guarded warmth which accompanied all his expressions told her he would carefully watch for her honor and welfare and repeating his promise of endeavoring to discover the tie by which mr harrel seemed bound to the baronet he left her  a prey himself to an anxiety yet more severe than that with which he had filled her he now saw all his long cherished hopes in danger of final destruction and suddenly cast upon the brink of a precipice where while he struggled to protect them from falling his eyes were dazzled by beholding them totter  mean while cecilia disturbed from the calm of soft serenity to which she had yielded every avenue of her soul now looked forward with distrust and uneasiness even to the completion of the views which but a few minutes before had comprised all her notions of felicity the alliance which so lately had seemed wholly unexceptionable now appeared teeming with objections and threatening with difficulties the representations of mr monckton had cruelly mortified her well acquainted with his knowledge of the world and wholly unsuspicious of his selfish motives she gave to his assertions involuntary credit and even while she attempted to combat them they made upon her mind an impression scarce ever to be erased  full therefore of doubt and inquietude she passed the night in discomfort and irresolution now determining to give way to her feelings and now to be wholly governed by the counsel of mr monckton  chap iv an expectation in this disposition of mind cecilia the next morning obeyed the summons of mr delvile and for the first time went to st james square in a humor to look for evil instead of good and meanness instead of nobleness  she was shown into an apartment where she found mr delvile alone and was received by him as usual with the most stately solemnity  when she was seated i have given you miss beverley said he the trouble of calling in order to discuss with you the internal state of your affairs a duty which at this juncture i hold to be incumbent upon my character the delicacy due to your sex would certainly have induced me to wait upon you myself for this purpose but for the reasons i have already hinted to you of fearing the people with whom you live might think it necessary to return my visit persons of low origin are commonly in those matters the most forward not however that i would prejudice you against them though for myself it is fit i remember that a general and indiscriminate acquaintance by levelling all ranks does injury to the rites of society  ah thought cecilia how infallible is mr monckton amd how inevitably in a family of which mr delvile is the head should i be cruelly held down as the disgrace of their alliance  i have applied continued he to mrs delvile to know if the communication which i had recommended to you and to which she had promised her attention had yet passed but i am informed you have not spoken to her upon the subject  i had nothing sir to communicate answered cecilia and i had hoped as mrs delvile made no enquiries she was satisfied she had nothing to hear  with respect to enquiries said mr delvile i fear you are not sufficiently aware of the distance between a lady of mrs delviles rank both by birth and alliance and such a young woman as mrs harrel whose ancestors but a short time since were mere suffolk farmers but i beg your pardon  i mean not any reflection upon yours i have always heard they were very worthy people and a farmer is certainly a very respectable person your father i think no more than the dean your uncle did nothing in that way himself  no sir said cecilia drily and much provoked by this contemptuous courtesy  i have always been told he was a very good sort of man i knew none of the family myself but the dean his connections with the bishop of  my relation put him often in my way though his naming me for one of his trustees i must own was rather extraordinary but i mean not to hurt you on the contrary i should be much concerned to give you any uneasiness  again mr monckton arose in the mind of cecilia and again she acknowledged the truth of his strictures and though she much wondered in what an harrangue so pompous was to end her disgust so far conquered her curiosity that without hearing it she wished herself away  to return said he to my purpose the present period of your life is such as to render advice particularly seasonable i am sorry therefore as i before said you have not disclosed your situation to mrs delvile a young lady on the point of making an establishment and with many engagements in her power is extremely liable to be mistaken in her judgment and therefore should solicit instruction from those who are able to acquaint her what connection would be most to her advantage one thing however i am happy to commend the young man who was wounded in the duel  i cannot recollect his name  is i hear totally out of the question  what next thought cecilia though still she gave him no interruption for the haughtiness of his manner was repulsive to reply  my design therefore is to speak to you of sir robert floyer when i had last the pleasure of addressing you upon this subject you may probably remember my voice was in his favor but i then regarded him merely as the rival of an inconsiderable young man to rescue you from whom he appeared an eligible person the affair is now altered that young man is thought of no more and another rival comes forward to whom sir robert is as inconsiderable as the first rival was to sir robert  cecilia started at this information livelier sensations stimulated her curiosity and surmises in which she was most deeply interested quickened her attention  this rival proceeded he i should imagine no young lady would a moment hesitate in electing he is every way the superior of sir robert except in fortune and the deficiencies of that the splendor of your own may amply supply  the deepest crimson now tinged the cheeks of cecilia the prophecy of mr monckton seemed immediately fulfilling and she trembled with a rising conflict between her approbation of the offer and her dread of its consequences  i know not indeed continued he in what estimation you may have been accustomed to hold rank and connection nor whether you are impressed with a proper sense of their superiority and value for early prejudices are not easily rooted out and those who have lived chiefly with monied people regard even birth inself as unimportant when compared with wealth  the color which first glowed in the cheeks of cecilia from expectation now rose yet higher from resentment she thought herself already insulted by a prelude so ostentatious and humiliating to the proposals which were to follow and she angrily determined with whatever pain to her heart to assert her own dignity by refusing them at once too well satisfied by what she now saw of the present that mr monckton had been just in his prediction of the future  your rejection therefore continued he of this honorable offer may perhaps have been merely the consequence of the principles in which you have been educated   rejection interrupted cecilia amazed what rejection sir  have you not refused the proposals of my lord ernolf for his son  lord ernolf never nor have i ever seen either his lordship or his son but in public  that replied mr delvile is little to the purpose where the connection is a proper one a young lady of delicacy has only to accede to it but though this rejection came not immediately from yourself it had doubtless your concurrence  it had not sir even my knowledge  your alliance then with sir robert floyer is probably nearer a conclusion than i had imagined for otherwise mr harrel would not without consulting you have given the earl so determinate an answer  no sir said cecilia impatiently my alliance with him was never more distant nor do i mean it should ever approach more near  she was now little disposed for further conversation her heroic design of refusing young delvile by no means reconciled her to the discovery she now made that he had not meant to address her and though she was provoked and fretted at this new proof that mr harrel scrupled neither assertions nor actions to make her engagement with sir robert credited her disappointment in finding that mr delvile instead of pleading the cause of his son was exerting his interest for another person affected her so much more nearly that notwithstanding he still continued his parading harangue she scarcely knew even the subject of his discourse and seized the first opportunity of a cessation to rise and take her leave  he asked her if she would not call upon mrs delvile but desirous to be alone she declined the invitation he then charged her to proceed no further with sir robert till he had made some enquiries concerning lord ernolf and graciously promising his protection and counsel suffered her to depart  cecilia now perceived she might plan her rejections or study her dignity at her leisure for neither mr delvile nor his son seemed in any haste to put her fortitude to the proof with regard therefore to their plots and intentions mr monckton she found was wrong but with respect to their conduct and sentiments she had every reason to believe him right and though her heart refused to rejoice in escaping a trial of its strength her judgment was so well convinced that his painting was from the life that she determined to conquer her partiality for young delvile since she looked forward to nothing but mortification in a connection with his family  chap v an agitation with this intention and every faculty of her mind absorbed in reflecting upon the reasons which gave rise to it she returned to portmansquare  as her chair was carried into the hall she observed with some alarm a look of consternation among the servants and an appearance of confusion in the whole house she was proceeding to her own room intending to enquire of her maid if any evil had happened when she was crossed upon the stairs by mr harrel who passed her with an air so wild and perturbed that he hardly seemed to know her  frightened and amazed she stopped short irresolute which way to go but hastily returning he beckoned her to follow him  she obeyed and he led her to the library he then shut the door and abruptly seizing her hand called out miss beverley i am ruined  i am undone  i am blasted for ever  i hope not sir said cecilia extremely terrified i hope not where is mrs harrel  o i know not i know not cried he in a frantic manner but i have not seen her  i cannot see her  i hope i shall never see her more   o fie fie said cecilia let me call her i beg you should consult with her in this distress and seek comfort from her affection  from her affection repeated he fiercely from her hatred you mean do you not know that she too is ruined oh past redemption ruined  and yet that i should hesitate that i should a moment hesitate to conclude the whole business at once  how dreadful cried cecilia what horrible thing has happened  i have undone priscilla cried he i have blasted my credit i have destroyed  no not yet quite destroyed myself  o yet nor ever cried cecilia whose agitation now almost equalled his own be not so desperate i conjure you speak to me more intelligibly  what does all this mean how has it come to pass  my debts  my creditors  one way only striking his hand upon his forehead is left for me  do not say so sir said cecilia you shall find many ways pray have courage pray speak calmly and if you will but be more prudent will but in future better regulate your affairs i will myself undertake    she stopped checked in the full career of her overflowing compassion by a sense of the worthlessness of its object and by the remembrance of the injunctions of mr monckton  what will you undertake cried he eagerly i know you are an angel  tell me what will you undertake  i will   said cecilia hesitating i will speak to mr monckton  i will consult    you may as well consult with every cursed creditor in the house interrupted he but do so if you please my disgrace must perforce reach him soon and a short anticipation is not worth begging off  are your creditors then actually in the house  o yes yes and therefore it is high time i should be out of it  did you not see them  do they not line the hall  they threaten me with three executions before night  three executions unless i satisfy their immediate demands    and to what do their demands amount  i know not  i dare not ask  to some thousand pounds perhaps  and i have not at this minute forty guineas in the house  nay then cried cecilia retreating i can indeed do nothing if their demands are so high i ought to do nothing  she would then have quitted him not more shocked at his situation than indignant at the wilful extravagance which had occasioned it  stay cried he and hear me then lowering his voice seek out he continued your unfortunate friend  go to the poor ruined priscilla  prepare her for tidings of horror and do not though you renounce me do not abandon her  then fiercely passing her he was himself leaving the room but cecilia alarmed by the fury of his manner called out what is it you mean what tidings of horror whither are you going  to hell cried he and rushed out of the apartment  cecilia screamed aloud and conjuring him to hear her ran after him he paid her no regard but flying faster than she had power to pursue reached his own dressing room shut himself into it with violence and just as she arrived at the door turned the key and bolted it  her terror was now inexpressible she believed him in the very act of suicide and her refusal of assistance seemed the signal for the deed her whole fortune at that moment was valueless and unimportant to her compared with the preservation of a fellow creature she called out with all the vehemence of agony to beg he would open the door and eagerly promised by all that was sacred to do every thing in her power to save him  at these words he opened it his face was totally without color and he grasped a razor in his hand  you have stopped me said he in a voice scarce audible at the very moment i had gathered courage for the blow but if indeed you will assist me i will shut this up  if not i will steep it in my blood  i will i will cried cecilia i will do every thing you desire  and quickly  immediately  before my disgrace is known and while all may yet be hushed up  yes yes all  any  every thing you wish  swear then  here cecilia drew back her recollection returned as her terror abated and her repugnance to entering into an engagement for she knew not what with a man whose actions she condemned and whose principles she abhorred made all her fright now give way to indignation and after a short pause she angrily answered no sir i will not swear  but yet all that is reasonable all that is friendly    hear me swear then interrupted he furiously which at this moment i do by every thing eternal and by every thing infernal that i will not outlive the seizure of my property and that the moment i am informed there is an execution in my house shall be the last of my existence  what cruelty what compulsion what impiety cried cecilia give me however that horrible instrument and prescribe to me what conditions you please  a noise was now heard below stairs at which cecilia who had not dared call for help lest she should quicken his desperation was secretly beginning to rejoice when starting at the sound he exclaimed i believe you are too late  the ruians have already seized my house then endeavoring to force her out of the room go he cried to my wife  i want to be alone  oh give me first cried she that weapon and i will take what oath you please  no no  go  leave me   cried he almost breathless with emotion i must not now be trifled with  i do not trifle indeed i do not cried cecilia holding by his arm try put me to the proof  swear solemnly swear to empty my house of these creditors this moment  i do swear cried she with energy and heaven prosper me as i am sincere  i see i see you are an angel cried he rapturously and as such i worship and adore you o you have restored me to life and rescued me from perdition  give me then that fatal instrument  that instrument returned he is nothing since so many others are in my power but you have now taken from me all desire of using them go then and stop those wretches from coming to me  send immediately for the jew  he will advance what money you please  my man knows where to find him  consult with mr arnott  speak a word of comfort to priscilla  but do nothing nothing at all till you have cleared my house of those cursed scoundrels  cecilia whose heart sunk within her at the solemn promise she had given the mention of the jew and the arduous task she had undertaken quitted him without reply and was going to her own room to compose her hurried spirits and consider what steps she had to take when hearing the noise in the hall grow louder she stopped to listen and catching some words that greatly alarmed her went half way down stairs when she was met by davison mr harrels man of whom she enquired into the occasion of the disturbance  he answered that he must go immediately to his master for the bailiffs were coming into the house  let him not know it if you value his life cried she with new terror where is mr arnott call him to me  beg him to come this moment  i will wait for him here  the man flew to obey her and cecilia finding she had time neither for deliberation nor regret and dreading lest mr harrel by hearing of the arrival of the bailiffs should relapse into despair determined to call to her aid all the courage prudence and judgment she possessed and since to act she was compelled endeavor with her best ability to save his credit and retrieve his affairs  the moment mr arnott came she ordered davison to hasten to his master and watch his motions  then addressing mr arnott will you sir she said go and tell those people that if they will instantly quit the house every thing shall be settled and mr harrel will satisfy their demands  ah madam cried mr arnott mournfully and how he has no means to pay them and i have none  without ruin to myself  to help him  send them but away said cecilia and i will myself be your security that your promise shall not be disgraced  alas madam cried he what are you doing well as i wish to mr harrel miserable as i am for my unfortunate sister i yet cannot bear that such goodness such beneficence should be injured  cecilia however persisted and with evident reluctance he obeyed her  while she waited his return davison came from mr harrel who had ordered him to run instantly for the jew  good heaven thought cecilia that a man so wretchedly selfish and worldly should dare with all his guilt upon his head to rush unlicenced on eternity masons elfrida    mr arnott was more than half an hour with the people and when at last he returned his countenance immediately proclaimed the ill success of his errand the creditors he said declared they had so frequently been deceived that they would not dismiss the bailiffs or retire themselves without actual payment  tell them then sir said cecilia to send me their accounts and if it be possible i will discharge them directly  mr arnotts eyes were filled with tears at this declaration and he protested be the consequence to himself what it might he would pay away every shilling he was worth rather than witness such injustice  no cried cecilia exerting more spirit that she might shock him less i did not save mr harrel to destroy so much better a man you have suffered but too much oppression already the present evil is mine and from me at least none i hope will ever spread to mr arnott  mr arnott could not bear this he was struck with grief with admiration and with gratitude and finding his tears now refused to be restrained he went to execute her commission in silent dejection  the dejection however was increased though his tears were dispersed when he returned oh madam he cried all your efforts generous as they are will be of no avail the bills even now in the house amount to more than  000 l  cecilia amazed and confounded started and clasped her hands calling out what must i do to what have i bound myself and how can i answer to my conscience  to my successors such a disposal such an abuse of so large a part of my fortune  mr arnott could make no answer and they stood looking at each other in silent irresolution till davison brought intelligence that the jew was already come and waited to speak with her  and what can i say to him cried she more and more agitated i understand nothing of usury how am i to deal with him  mr arnott then confessed that he should himself have instantly been bail for his brother but that his fortune originally not large was now so much impaired by the many debts which from time to time he had paid for him that as he hoped some day to have a family of his own he dared not run a risk by which he might be utterly ruined and the less as his sister had at violet bank been prevailed upon to give up her settlement  this account which explained the late uneasiness of mrs harrel still increased the distress of cecilia and every moment she obtained for reflection augmented her reluctance to parting with so large a sum of money for so worthless an object and added strength to her resentment for the unjustifiable menaces which had extorted from her such a promise yet not an instant would she listen to mr arnotts offer of fulfilling her engagement and charged him as he considered her own selfesteem worth her keeping not to urge to her a proposal so ungenerous and selfish  davison now came again to hasten her and said that the jew was with his master and they both impatiently expected her  cecilia half distracted with her uncertainty how to act changed color at this message and exclaimed oh mr arnott run i beseech you for mr monckton bring him hither directly  if any body can save me it is him but if i go back to mr harrel i know it will be all over  certainly said mr arnott i will run to him this moment  yet no  stop   cried the trembling cecilia he can now do me no good  his counsel will arrive too late to serve me  it cannot call back the oath i have given it cannot compulsatory as it was make me break it and not be miserable for ever  this idea sufficed to determine her and the apprehension of selfreproach should the threat of mr harrel be put in execution was more insupportable to her blameless and upright mind than any loss or diminution which her fortune could sustain  slowly however with tardy and unwilling steps her judgment repugnant and her spirit repining she obeyed the summons of mr harrel who impatient of her delay came forward to meet her  miss beverley he cried there is not a moment to be lost this good man will bring you any sum of money upon a proper consideration that you will command but if he is not immediately commissioned and these cursed fellows are not got out of my house the affair will be blown  and what will follow added he lowering his voice i will not again frighten you by repeating though i shall never recant  cecilia turned from him in horror and with a faltering voice and heavy heart entreated mr arnott to settle for her with the jew  large as was the sum she was so near being of age and her security was so good that the transaction was soon finished   00 l was received of the jew mr harrel gave cecilia his bond for the payment the creditors were satisfied the bailiffs were dismissed and the house was soon restored to its customary appearance of splendid gaiety  mrs harrel who during this scene had shut herself up in her own room to weep and lament now flew to cecilia and in a transport of joy and gratitude thanked her upon her knees for thus preserving her from utter ruin the gentle mr arnott seemed uncertain whether most to grieve or rejoice and mr harrel repeatedly protested she should have the sole guidance of his future conduct  this promise the hope of his amendment and the joy she had expanded somewhat revived the spirits of cecilia who however deeply affected by what had passed hastened from them all to her own room  she had now parted with  0 0 l to mr harrel without any security when or how it was to be paid and that ardour of benevolence which taught her to value her riches merely as they enabled her to do good and generous actions was here of no avail to console or reward her for her gift was compelled and its receiver was all but detested how much better cried she would this have been bestowed upon the amiable miss belfield or upon her nobleminded though proudspirited brother and how much less a sum would have made the virtuous and industrious hills easy and happy for life but here to become the tool of the extravagance i abhor to be made responsible for the luxury i condemn to be liberal in opposition to my principles and lavish in defiance of my judgment  oh that my muchdeceived uncle had better known to what dangerous hands he committed me and that my weak and unhappy friend had met with a worthier protector of her virtue and safety  as soon however as she recovered from the first shock of her reflections she turned her thoughts from herself to the formation of some plan that might at least render her donation of serious and lasting use the signal service she had just done them gave her at present an ascendency over the harrels which she hoped if immediately exerted might prevent the return of so calamitous a scene by engaging them both to an immediate change of conduct but unequal herself to contriving expedients for this purpose that might not easily be controverted she determined to send the next morning a petition to mr monckton to call upon her reveal to him the whole transaction and entreat him to suggest to her what with most probability of success she might offer to their consideration  while this was passing in her mind on the evening of the day in which she had so dearly purchased the right of giving counsel she was summoned to tea  she found mr harrel and his lady engaged in earnest discourse as soon as she appeared the former said my dear miss beverley after the extraordinary kindness you have shown me this morning you will not i am sure deny me one trifling favor which i mean to ask this evening  no said mrs harrel that i am sure she will not when she knows that our future appearance in the world depends upon her granting it  i hope then said cecilia i shall not wish to refuse it  it is nothing in the world said mr harrel but to go with us tonight to the pantheon  cecilia was struck with the utmost indignation at this proposal that the man who in the morning had an execution in his house should languish in the evening for the amusement of a public place  that he who but a few hours before was plunging uncalled into eternity should while the intended instrument of death was yet scarce cold from the grasp of his hand deliberately court a return of his distress by instantly recurring to the methods which had involved him in it irritated and shocked her beyond even a wish of disguising her displeasure and therefore after an expressive silence she gave a cold but absolute denial  i see said mr harrel somewhat confused you do not understand the motives of our request the unfortunate affair of this morning is very likely to spread presently all over the town the only refutation that can be given to it is by our all appearing in public before any body knows whether to believe it or not  do my dearest friend cried his lady oblige me by your compliance indeed our whole reputation depends upon it i made an engagement yesterday to go with mrs mears and if i disappoint her every body will be guessing the reason  at least answered cecilia  my going can answer no purpose to you pray therefore do not ask me i am ill disposed for such sort of amusement and have by no means your opinion of its necessity  but if we do not all go said mr harrel we do almost nothing you are known to live with us and your appearance at this critical time is important to our credit if this misfortune gets wind the consequence is that every dirty tradesman in town to whom i owe a shilling will be forming the same cursed combination those scoundrels formed this morning of coming in a body and waiting for their money or else bringing an execution into my house the only way to silence report is by putting a good face upon the matter at once and showing ourselves to the world as if nothing had happened favor us therefore tonight with your company which is really important to us or ten to one but in another fortnight i shall be just in the same scrape  cecilia however incensed at this intelligence that his debts were still so numerous felt now as much alarmed at the mention of an execution as if she was in actual danger of ruin herself terrified therefore though not convinced she yielded to their persuasions and consented to accompany them  they soon after separated to make some alteration in their dress and then calling in their way for mrs mears they proceeded to the pantheon  chap vi a man of the ton at the door of the pantheon they were joined by mr arnott and sir robert floyer whom cecilia now saw with added aversion they entered the great room during the second act of the concert to which as no one of the party but herself had any desire to listen no sort of attention was paid the ladies entertaining themselves as if no orchestra was in the room and the gentlemen with an equal disregard to it struggling for a place by the fire about which they continued hovering till the music was over  soon after they were seated mr meadows sauntering toward them whispered something to mrs mears who immediately rising introduced him to cecilia after which the place next to her being vacant he cast himself upon it and lolling as much at his ease as his situation would permit began something like a conversation with her  have you been long in town maam  no sir  this is not your first winter  of being in town it is  then you have something new to see o charming how i envy you  are you pleased with the pantheon  very much i have seen no building at all equal to it  you have not been abroad traveling is the ruin of all happiness there is no looking at a building here after seeing italy  does all happiness then depend upon the sight of buildings said cecilia when turning toward her companion she perceived him yawning with such evident inattention to her answer that not choosing to interrupt his reverie she turned her head another way  for some minutes he took no notice of this and then as if suddenly recollecting himself he called out hastily i beg your pardon maam you were saying something  no sir nothing worth repeating  o pray dont punish me so severely as not to let me hear it  cecilia though merely not to seem offended at his negligence was then again beginning an answer when looking at him as she spoke she perceived that he was biting his nails with so absent an air that he appeared not to know he had asked any question she therefore broke off and left him to his cogitation  sometime after he addressed her again saying dont you find this place extremely tiresome maam  yes sir said she half laughing it is indeed not very entertaining  nothing is entertaining answered he for two minutes together things are so little different one from another that there is no making pleasure out of any thing we go the same dull round for ever nothing new no variety all the same thing over again are you fond of public places maam  yes sir soberly as lady grace says  then i envy you extremely for you have some amusement always in your own power how desirable that is  and have not you the same resources  o no i am tired to death tired of every thing i would give the universe for a disposition less difficult to please yet after all what is there to give pleasure when one has seen one thing one has seen every thing o it is heavy work dont you find it so maam  this speech was ended with so violent a fit of yawning that cecilia would not trouble herself to answer it but her silence as before passed wholly unnoticed exciting neither question nor comment  a long pause now succeeded which he broke at last by saying as he writhed himself about upon his seat these forms would be much more agreeable if there were backs to them it is intolerable to be forced to sit like a schoolboy the first study of life is ease there is indeed no other study that pays the trouble of attainment dont you think so maam  but may not even that said cecilia by so much study become labor  i am vastly happy you think so  sir  i beg your pardon maam but i thought you said  i really beg your pardon but i was thinking of something else  you did very right sir said cecilia laughing for what i said by no means merited any attention  will you do me the favor to repeat it cried he taking out his glass to examine some lady at a distance  o no said cecilia that would be trying your patience too severely  these glasses show one nothing but defects said he i am sorry they were ever invented they are the ruin of all beauty no complexion can stand them i believe that solo will never be over i hate a solo it sinks it depresses me intolerably  you will presently sir said cecilia looking at the bill of the concert have a full piece and that i hope will revive you  a full piece oh insupportable it stuns it fatigues it overpowers me beyond endurance no taste in it no delicacy no room for the smallest feeling  perhaps then you are only fond of singing  i should be if i could hear it but we are now so miserably off in voices that i hardly ever attempt to listen to a song without fancying myself deaf from the feebleness of the performers i hate every thing that requires attention nothing gives pleasure that does not force its own way  you only then like loud voices and great powers  o worse and worse  no nothing is so disgusting to me all my amazement is that these people think it worth while to give concerts at all one is sick to death of music  nay cried cecilia if it gives no pleasure at least it takes none away for far from being any impediment to conversation i think every body talks more during the performance than between the acts and what is there better you could substitute in its place  cecilia receiving no answer to this question again looked round to see if she had been heard when she observed her new acquaintance with a very thoughtful air had turned from her to fix his eyes upon the statue of britannia  very soon after he hastily arose and seeming entirely to forget that he had spoke to her very abruptly walked away  mr gosport who was advancing to cecilia and had watched part of this scene stopped him as he was retreating and said why meadows how is this are you caught at last  o worn to death worn to a thread cried he stretching himself and yawning i have been talking with a young lady to entertain her o such heavy work i would not go through it again for millions  what have you talked yourself out of breath  no but the effort the effort  o it has unhinged me for a fortnight  entertaining a young lady  one had better be a galleyslave at once  well but did she not pay your toils she is surely a sweet creature  nothing can pay one for such insufferable exertion though she is well enough too  better than the common run  but shy quite too shy no drawing her out  i thought that was to your taste you commonly hate much volubility how have i heard you bemoan yourself when attacked by miss larolles  larolles o distraction she talks me into a fever in two minutes but so it is for ever nothing but extremes to be met with common girls are too forward this lady is too reserved  always some fault always some drawback nothing ever perfect  nay nay cried mr gosport you do not know her she is perfect enough in all conscience  better not know her then answered he again yawning for she cannot be pleasing nothing perfect is natural  i hate every thing out of nature  he then strolled on and mr gosport approached cecilia  i have been wishing cried he to address you this half hour but as you were engaged with mr meadows i did not dare advance  o i see your malice cried cecilia you were determined to add weight to the value of your company by making me fully sensible where the balance would preponderate  nay if you do not admire mr meadows cried he you must not even whisper it to the winds  is he then so very admirable  o he is now in the very height of fashionable favor his dress is a model his manners are imitated his attention is courted and his notice is envied  are you not laughing  no indeed his privileges are much more extensive than i have mentioned his decision fixes the exact limits between what is vulgar and what is elegant his praise gives reputation and a word from him in public confers fashion  and by what wonderful powers has he acquired such influence  by nothing but a happy art in catching the reigning foibles of the times and carrying them to an extreme yet more absurd than any one had done before him ceremony he found was already exploded for ease he therefore exploded ease for indolence devotion to the fair sex had given way to a more equal and rational intercourse which to push still farther he presently exchanged for rudeness joviality too was already banished for philosophical indifference and that therefore he discarded for weariness and disgust  and is it possible that qualities such as these should recommend him to favor and admiration  very possible for qualities such as these constitute the present taste of the times a man of the ton who would now be conspicuous in the gay world must invariably be insipid negligent and selfish  admirable requisites cried cecilia and mr meadows i acknowledge seems to have attained them all  he must never continued mr gosport confess the least pleasure from any thing a total apathy being the chief ingredient of his character he must upon no account sustain a conversation with any spirit lest he should appear to his utter disgrace interested in what is said and when he is quite tired of his existence from a total vacuity of ideas he must affect a look of absence and pretend on the sudden to be wholly lost in thought  i would not wish said cecilia laughing a more amiable companion  if he is asked his opinion of any lady he continued he must commonly answer by a grimace and if he is seated next to one he must take the utmost pains to show by his listlessness yawning and inattention that he is sick of his situation for what he holds of all things to be most gothic is gallantry to the women to avoid this is indeed the principal solicitude of his life if he sees a lady in distress for her carriage he is to enquire of her what is the matter and then with a shrug wish her well through her fatigues wink at some byestander and walk away if he is in a room where there is a crowd of company and a scarcity of seats he must early ensure one of the best in the place be blind to all looks of fatigue and deaf to all hints of assistance and seeming totally to forget himself lounge at his ease and appear an unconscious spectator of what is going forward if he is at a ball where there are more women than men he must decline dancing at all though it should happen to be his favorite amusement and smiling as he passes the disengaged young ladies wonder to see them sit still and perhaps ask them the reason  a most alluring character indeed cried cecilia and pray how long have these been the accomplishments of a fine gentleman  i am but an indifferent chronologer of the modes he answered but i know it has been long enough to raise just expectations that some new folly will be started soon by which the present race of insensiblists may be driven out mr meadows is now at the head of this sect as miss larolles is of the voluble and miss leeson of the supercilious but this way comes another who though in a different manner labors with the same view and aspires at the same reward which stimulate the ambition of this happy triplet that of exciting wonder by peculiarity and envy by wonder  this description announced capt aresby who advancing from the fireplace told cecilia how much he rejoiced in seeing her said he had been reduced to despair by so long missing that honor and that he had feared she made it a principle to avoid coming in public having sought her in vain partout  he then smiled and strolled on to another party  and pray of what sect said cecilia is this gentleman  of the sect of jargonists answered mr gosport he has not an ambition beyond paying a passing compliment nor a word to make use of that he has not picked up at public places yet this dearth of language however you may despise it is not merely owing to a narrow capacity foppery and conceit have their share in the limitation for though his phrases are almost always ridiculous or misapplied they are selected with much study and introduced with infinite pains  poor man cried cecilia is it possible it can cost him any trouble to render himself so completely absurd  yes but not more than it costs his neighbors to keep him in countenance miss leeson since she has presided over the sect of the supercilious spends at least half her life in wishing the annihilation of the other half for as she must only speak in her own coterie she is compelled to be frequently silent and therefore having nothing to think of she is commonly gnawn with selfdenial and soured with want of amusement miss larolles indeed is better off for in talking faster than she thinks she has but followed the natural bent of her disposition as to this poor jargonist he has i must own rather a hard task from the continual restraint of speaking only out of his own liliputian vocabulary and denying himself the relief of ever uttering one word by the call of occasion but what hardship is that compared with what is borne by mr meadows who since he commenced insensiblist has never once dared to be pleased nor ventured for a moment to look in good humor  surely then said cecilia in a short time the punishment of this affectation will bring its cure  no for the trick grows into habit and habit is a second nature a secret idea of fame makes his forbearance of happiness supportable to him for he has now the selfsatisfaction of considering himself raised to that highest pinnacle of fashionable refinement which is built upon apathy and scorn and from which proclaiming himself superior to all possibility of enjoyment he views the whole world with contempt holding neither beauty virtue wealth nor power of importance sufficient to kindle the smallest emotion  o that they could all round listen to you cried cecilia they would soon i think sicken of their folly if they heard it thus admirably exposed  no they would but triumph that it had obtained them so much notice  but pray do you see that gentleman or dont you choose to know him who has been bowing to you this half hour  where cried cecilia and looking round perceived mr morris who upon her returning his salutation instantly approached her though he had never ventured to show himself at mr harrels since his unfortunate accident on the evening of the masquerade  entirely casting aside the easy familiarity at which he had latterly arrived he enquired after her health with the most fearful diffidence and then bowing profoundly was modestly retiring when mrs harrel perceiving him smiled with so much good humor that he gathered courage to return and address her and found her to his infinite delight as obliging and civil as ever  the concert was now over the ladies arose and the gentlemen joined them morris at sight of mr harrel was again shrinking but mr harrel immediately shaking hands with him enquired what had kept him so long from portmansquare morris then finding to his great surprise that no one had thought more of the mischief but himself who had committed it joyously discarded his timidity and became as sprightly as before his mortification  a motion was now made for going to the tearoom and as they walked on cecilia in looking up to examine the building saw in one of the galleries young delvile and almost at the same time caught his eye  scarcely now did a moment elapse before he joined her the sight of him strongly reviving in her mind the painful contrariety of opinion with which she had lately thought of him the sentiments so much in his favor which but a few days before she had encouraged and which it was only that morning she had endeavored to crush made her meet him with a kind of melancholy that almost induced her to lament he was amiable and repine that she knew none like him  his appearance mean time was far different he seemed enchanted at the sight of her he flew eagerly to meet her and his eyes sparkled with pleasure as he approached her a pleasure neither moderate nor disguised but lively unrestrained and expressive  cecilia whose plans since she had last seen him had twice varied who first had looked forward to being united with him for ever and afterward had determined to avoid with him even a common acquaintance could not while these thoughts were all recurring to her memory receive much delight from observing his gaiety or feel at all gratified by his unembarrassed manners the openness of his attentions and the frankness of his admiration which hitherto had charmed her as marks of the sincerity of his character now shocked her as proofs of the indifference of his heart which feeling for her a mere common regard that affected neither his spirits nor his peace he manifested without scruple since it was not accompanied with even a wish beyond the present hour  she now too recollected that such had always been his conduct one single and singular moment excepted when as he gave to her his letter for mr belfield he seemed struck as she was herself by the extraordinary coincidence of their ideas and proceedings that emotion however she now regarded as casual and transitory and seeing him so much happier than herself she felt ashamed of her delusion and angry at her easy captivation  reflections such as these though they added fresh motives to her resolution of giving up all thoughts of his alliance were yet so humiliating that they robbed her of all power of receiving pleasure from what was passing and made her forget that the place she was in was even intended for a place of entertainment  young delvile after painting in lively colors the loss his house had sustained by her quitting it and dwelling with equal force upon the regret of his mother and his own asked in a low voice if she would do him so much honor as to introduce him to mr harrel as the son added he of a brother guardian i think i have a kind of claim to his acquaintance  cecilia could not refuse though as the request was likely to occasion more frequent meetings she persuaded herself she was unwilling to comply the ceremony therefore past and was again repeated with mrs harrel who though she had several times seen him had never been formally made known to him  the harrels were both of them much pleased at this mark of civility in a young man whose family had prepared them rather to expect his scorn and expressed their wishes that he would drink his tea in their party he accepted their invitation with alacrity and turning to cecilia said have i not skilfully timed my introduction but though you have done me this honor with mr and mrs harrel i must not yet i presume entreat you to extend it to a certain happy gentleman of this company glancing his eyes toward sir robert floyer  no sir answered she with quickness yet nor ever  they were now at the door leading down stairs to the tearoom cecilia saw that sir robert who had hitherto been engaged with some gentlemen seemed to be seeking her and the remembrance of the quarrel which had followed her refusal of his assistance at the operahouse obliged her to determine should he offer it again to accept it but the same brutality which forced this intention contributed to render it repugnant to her and she resolved if possible to avoid him by hurrying down stairs before he reached her she made therefore a sudden attempt to slip through the crowd and as she was light and active she easily succeeded but though her hasty motion separated her from the rest of her party delvile who was earnestly looking at her to discover her meaning in the disclaiming speech she made about sir robert saw into her design but suffered her not to go alone he contrived in a moment to follow and join her while she was stopping at the foot of the stairs for mrs harrel  why what a little thief you are cried he to run away from us thus what do you think sir robert will say i saw him looking for you at the very instant of your flight  then you saw at the same time said cecilia the reason of it  will you give me leave cried he laughing to repeat this to my lord ernolf  you may repeat it sir if you please said cecilia piqued that he had not rather thought of himself than of lord ernolf to the whole pantheon  and if i should cried he half of it at least would thank me and to obtain the applause of so noble an assembly what would it signify that sir robert should cut my throat  i believe said cecilia deeply mortified by a raillery that showed so little interest in her avowal of indifference you are determined to make me as sick of that mans name as i am of his conversation  and is it possible exclaimed delvile in a tone of surprise that such can be your opinion and yet situated as you are the whole world at your command and all mankind at your devotion  but i am answering you seriously when you are only speaking by rule  what rule sir  that which young ladies upon certain occasions always prescribe themselves  here they were interrupted by the arrival of the rest of the company though not before cecilia had received some little consolation for her displeasure by finding that young delvile still supposed she was engaged and flattering herself his language would be different were he informed of the contrary  morris now undertook to procure them a table for tea which as the room was very full was not easily done and while they were waiting his success miss larolles who from the stairs had perceived cecilia came running up to her and taking her hand called out lord my dear creature whod have thought of seeing you here i was never so surprised in my life i really thought you was gone into a convent it is so extreme long since i have seen you but of all things in the world why was you not at lady nylands last assembly i thought of asking mrs harrel fifty times why you did not come but it always went out of my head you have no notion how excessively i was disappointed  you are very obliging said cecilia laughing but i hope since you so often forgot it the disappointment did much lessen your entertainment  o lord no i was never so happy in my life there was such a crowd you could not move a finger every body in the world was there you have no idea how delightful it was i thought verily i should have fainted with the heat  that was delightful indeed and how long did you stay  why we danced till three in the morning we began with cotillons and finished with country dances it was the most elegant thing you ever saw in your life every thing quite in a style i was so monstrously fatigued i could hardly get through the last dance i really thought i should have dropped down dead only conceive dancing five hours in such a monstrous crowd i assure you when i got home my feet were all blisters you have no idea how they smarted  and whence comes it cried young delvile that you partake so little of these delights  because i fear answered cecilia i came too late into the school of fashion to be a ductile pupil  do you know continued miss larolles mr meadows has not spoke one word to me all the evening though i am sure he saw me for i sat at the outside on purpose to speak to a person or two that i knew would be strolling about for if one sits on the inside there is no speaking to a creature you know so i never do it at the opera nor in the boxes at ranelagh nor any where it is the shockingest thing you can conceive to be made sit in the middle of those forms one might as well be at home for nobody can speak to one  but you dont seem to have had much better success said cecilia in keeping at the outside  o yes i have for i got a little chat with two or three people as they were passing for you know when one sits there they cannot help saying something though i assure you all the men are so excessively odd they dont care whether they speak to one or no as to mr meadows he is really enough to provoke one to death i suppose he is in one of his absent fits however i assure you i think it is extreme impertinent of him and so i shall tell mr sawyer for i know he will make a point of telling him of it again  i rather think said cecilia the best would be to return the compliment in kind and when he next recollects you appear to have forgotten him  o lord that is a very good notion so i will i edclare but you cannot conceive how glad i am the concerts over for i assure you though i sat as near the fire as possible i was so extreme cold you have no idea for mr meadows never would let me have the least peep at it i declare i believe he does it on purpose to plague one for he grows worse and worse every day you cannot think how i hate him  not easily i believe indeed said cecilia archly  o do but look resumed the fair voluble if there is not mrs mears in her old red gown again i begin to think she will never have another i wish she was to have an execution in her house if it was only to get rid of it i am so fatigued with the sight of it you cannot conceive  mr morris now brought intelligence that he had secured one side of a table which would very well accommodate the ladies and that the other side was only occupied by one gentleman who as he was not drinking tea himself would doubtless give up his place when the party appeared  miss larolles then ran back to her own set and the rest followed mr morris mrs harrel mrs mears and cecilia took their places the gentleman opposite to them proved to be mr meadows morris therefore was much deceived in his expectations for far from giving up his place he had flung himself all along upon the form in such a lounging posture while he rested one arm upon the table that not contented with merely keeping his own seat he filled up a space meant for three  mr harrel had already walked off to another party delvile stood aloof for some minutes expecting sir robert floyer would station himself behind cecilia but sir robert who would scarce have thought such a condescension due to a princess disdained any appearance of assiduity even while he made it his care to publish his pretensions and therefore finding no accommodation to please him he stalked toward some gentlemen in another part of the room delvile then took the post he had neglected and mr arnott who had not had courage to make any effort in his own favor modestly stood near him cecilia contrived to make room for mr gosport next to herself and morris was sufficiently happy in being allowed to call the waiters superintend the provisions and serve the whole party  the task of making tea fell upon cecilia who being somewhat incommoded by the vicinity of her neighbors mrs mears called out to mr meadows do pray sir be so good as to make room for one of us at your side  mr meadows who was indolently picking his teeth and examining them with a tooth pick case glass did not at first seem to hear her and when she repeated her request he only looked at her and said umph  now really mr meadows said she when you see any ladies in such distress i wonder how you can forbear helping them  in distress are you cried he with a vacant smile pray what is the matter  dont you see we are so crowded we can hardly sit  cannot you cried he upon my honor it is very shameful that these people dont contrive some seats more convenient  yes said mrs mears but if you would be so kind as to let somebody else sit by you we should not want any contrivance  here mr meadows was seized with a furious fit of yawning which as much diverted cecilia and mr gosport as it offended mrs mears who with great displeasure added indeed mr meadows it is very strange that you never hear what is said to you  i beg your pardon said he were you speaking to me and again began picking his teeth  morris eager to contrast his civility with the inattention of mr meadows now flew round to the other side of the table and calling out let me help you miss beverley i can make tea better than any body he lent over that part of the form which mr meadows had occupied with one of his feet in order to pour it out himself but mr meadows by an unfortunate removal of his foot bringing him forwarder than he was prepared to go the tea pot and its contents were overturned immediately opposite to cecilia  young delvile who saw the impending evil from an impetuous impulse to prevent her suffering by it hastily drew her back and bending down before her secured her preservation by receiving himself the mischief with which she was threatened  mrs mears and mrs harrel vacated their seats in a moment and mr gosport and mr arnott assisted in clearing the table and removing cecilia who was very slightly hurt and at once surprised ashamed and pleased at the manner in which she had been saved  young delvile though a sufferer from his gallantry the hot water having penetrated through his coat to his arm and shoulder was at first insensible to his situation from an apprehension that cecilia had not wholly escaped and his enquiries were so eager and so anxious made with a look of such solicitude and a voice of such alarm that equally astonished and gratified she secretly blessed the accident which had given birth to his uneasiness however she grieved for its consequence to himself  but no sooner was he satisfied of her safety than he felt himself obliged to retire yet attributing to inconvenience what was really the effect of pain he hurried away with an appearance of sport saying there is something i must own rather unknightly in quitting the field for a wet jacket but the company i hope will only give me credit for flying away to ranelagh so  like a brave general after being beat i will exult and rejoice in a prudent retreat smart    he then hastened to his carriage and poor morris frightened and confounded at the disaster he had occasioned sneaked after him with much less ceremony while mr meadows wholly unconcerned by the distress and confusion around him sat quietly picking his teeth and looking on during the whole transaction with an unmeaning stare that made it doubtful whether he had even perceived it  order being now soon restored the ladies finished their tea and went up stairs cecilia to whom the late accident had afforded much new and interesting matter for reflection wished immediately to have returned home but she was not the leader of the party and therefore could not make the proposal  they then strolled through all the apartments and having walked about till the fashionable time of retiring they were joined by sir robert floyer and proceeded to the little room near the entrance to the great one in order to wait for their carriages  here cecilia again met miss larolles who came to make various remarks and infinite ridicule upon sundry unfashionable or uncostly articles in the dresses of the surrounding company as well as to complain with no little resentment that mr meadows was again standing before the fire  captain aresby also advanced to tell her he was quite abattu by having so long lost sight of her to hope she would make a renounce of mortifying the world by discarding it and to protest he had waited for his carriage till he was actually upon the point of being acable  in the midst of this jargon to which the fullness of cecilias mind hardly permitted her to listen there suddenly appeared at the door of the apartment mr albany who with his usual austerity of countenance stopped to look round upon the company  do you see cried mr gosport to cecilia who approaches your poor sycophants will again be taken to task and i for one tremble at the coming storm  o lord cried miss larolles i wish i was safe in my chair that man always frightens me out of my senses you have no notion what disagreeable things he says to one i assure you i have no doubt but he is crazy and i am always in the shockingest fright in the world for fear he should be taken with a fit while i am near him  it is really a petrifying thing said the captain that one can go to no spectacle without the horreur of being obsede by that person if he comes this way i shall certainly make a renounce and retire  why so said sir robert what the d  l do you mind him for  o he is the greatest bore in nature cried the captain and i always do mon possible to avoid him for he breaks out into such barbarous phrases that i find myself degoute with him in a moment  o i assure you said miss larolles he attacks one sometimes in a manner you have no idea one day he came up to me all of a sudden and asked me what good i thought i did by dressing so much only conceive how shocking  o i have had the horreur of questions of that sort from him sans fin said the captain once he took the liberty to ask me what service i was of to the world and another time he desired me to inform him whether i had ever made any poor person pray for me and in short he has so frequently inconvenienced me by his impertinences that he really bores me to a degree  that is just the thing that makes him hunt you down said sir robert if he were to ask me questions for a month together i should never trouble myself to move a muscle  the matter of his discourse said mr gosport is not more singular than the manner for without any seeming effort or consciousness he runs into blank verse perpetually i have made much enquiry about him but all i am able to learn is that he was certainly confined at one part of his life in a private madhourse and though now from not being mischievous he is set at liberty his looks language and whole behavior announce the former injury of his intellects  o lord cried miss larolles halfscreaming what shocking notions you put in ones head i declare i dare say i shant get safe home for him for i assure you i believe he is taken a spite to me and all because one day before i knew of his odd ways i happened to fall a laughing at his going about in that old coat do you know it put him quite in a passion only conceive how illnatured  o he has distressed me exclaimed the captain with a shrug  partout and found so much fault with every thing i have done that i should really be glad to have the honor to cut for the moment he comes up to me i know what i have to expect  but i must tell you cried miss larolles how monstrously he put me in a fright one evening when i was talking with miss moffat do you know he came up to us and asked what we were saying and because we could not think in a minute of something to answer him he said he supposed we were only talking some scandal and so we had better go home and employ ourselves in working for the poor only think how horrid and after that he was so excessive impertinent in his remarks there was quite no bearing him i assure you he cut me up so you have no notion  here mr albany advanced and every body but sir robert moved out of the way  fixing his eyes upon cecilia with an expression more in sorrow than in anger after contemplating her some time in silence he exclaimed ah lovely but perishable flower how long will that ingenuous countenance wearing because wanting no disguise look responsive of the whiteness of the region within how long will that air of innocence irradiate your whole appearance unspoilt by prosperity unperverted by power pure in the midst of surrounding depravity unsullied in the tainted air of infectious perdition  the confusion of cecilia at this public address which drew upon her the eyes and attention of all the company was inexpressible she arose from her seat covered with blushes and saying i fancy the carriage must be ready pressed forward to quit the room followed by sir robert who answered no no they will call it when it comes up arnott will you go and see where it is  cecilia stopped but whispered mrs harrel to stand near her  and whither cried albany indignantly whither would thou go art thou already disdainful of my precepts and can thou not one short moment spare from the tumultuous folly which encircles thee many and many are the hours thou may spend with such as these the world alas is full of them weary not then so soon of an old man that would admonish thee  he cannot call upon thee long for soon he will be called upon himself  this solemn exhortation extremely distressed her and fearing to still further offend him by making another effort to escape she answered in a low voice i will not only hear but thank you for your precepts if you will forbear to give them before so many witnesses  whence cried he sternly these vain and superficial distinctions do you not dance in public what renders you more conspicuous do you not dress to be admired and walk to be observed why then this fantastical scruple unjustified by reason unsupported by analogy is folly only to be published is vanity alone to be exhibited oh slaves of senseless contradiction oh feeble followers of yet feebler prejudice daring to be wicked yet fearing to be wise dauntless in levity yet shrinking from the name of virtue  the latter part of this speech during which he turned with energy to the whole company raised such a general alarm that all the ladies hastily quitted the room and all the gentlemen endeavored to enter it equally curious to see the man who made the oration and the lady to whom it was addressed cecilia therefore found her situation unsupportable i must go she cried whether there is a carriage or not pray mrs harrel let us go  sir robert then offered to take her hand which she was extremely ready to give him but while the crowd made their passage difficult albany following and stopping her said what is it you fear a miserable old man worn out by the sorrows of that experience from which he offers you counsel what too is it you trust a libertine wretch coveting nothing but your wealth for the gift of which he will repay you by the perversion of your principles  what the d  l do you mean by that cried the baronet  to show answered he austerely the inconsistency of false delicacy to show how those who are too timid for truth can fearless meet licentiousness  for heavens sake sir cried cecilia say no more to me now call upon me in portmansquare when you please  reprove me in whatever you think me blameable i shall be grateful for your instructions and bettered perhaps by your care  but lessons and notice thus public can do me nothing but injury  how happy cried he were no other injury near thee spotless were then the hour of thy danger bright fair and refulgent thy passage to security the good would receive thee with praise the guilty would supplicate thy prayers the poor would follow thee with blessings and children would be taught by thy example  he then quitted her every body making way as he moved and proceeded into the great room mrs harrels carriage being also announced at the same time cecilia lost not an instant in hastening away  sir robert as he conducted her disdainfully laughed at the adventure which the general license allowed to mr albany prevented his resenting and which therefore he scorned to appear moved at  mrs harrel could talk of nothing else neither was cecilia disposed to change the subject for the remains of insanity which seemed to hang upon him were affecting without being alarming and her desire to know more of him grew every instant stronger  this desire however outlived not the conversation to which it gave rise when she returned to her own room no vestige of it remained upon her mind which a nearer concern and deeper interest wholly occupied  the behavior of young delvile had pained pleased and disturbed her his activity to save her from mischief might proceed merely from gallantry or good nature upon that therefore she dwelt little but his eagerness his anxiety his insensibility to himself were more than good breeding could claim and seemed to spring from a motive less artificial  she now therefore believed that her partiality was returned and this belief had power to shake all her resolves and enfeeble all her objections the arrogance of mr delvile lessened in her reflections the admonitions of mr monckton abated in their influence with the first she considered that though connected she need not live and for the second though she acknowledged the excellence of his judgment she concluded him wholly ignorant of her sentiments of delvile which she imagined when once revealed would make every obstacle to the alliance seem trifling when put in competition with mutual esteem and affection  chap vii a reproof the attention of cecilia to her own affairs did not make her forgetful of those of the harrels and the morning after the busy day which was last recorded as soon as she quitted the breakfastroom she began a note to mr monckton but was interrupted with information that he was already in the house  she went to him immediately and had the satisfaction of finding him alone but desirous as she was to relate to him the transactions of the preceding day there was in his countenance a gravity so unusual that her impatience was involuntarily checked and she waited first to hear if he had himself any thing to communicate  he kept her not long in suspense miss beverley he said i bring you intelligence which though i know you will be very sorry to hear it is absolutely necessary should be told you immediately you may otherwise from however laudable motives be drawn into some action which you may repent for life  what now cried cecilia much alarmed  all that i suspected said he and more than i hinted to you is true mr harrel is a ruined man he is not worth a groat and he is in debt beyond what he ever possessed  cecilia made no answer she knew but too fatally the desperate state of his affairs yet that his debts were more than he had ever possessed she had not thought possible  my enquiries continued he have been among principals and such as would not dare deceive me i hastened therefore to you that this timely notice might enforce the injunctions i gave you when i had the pleasure of seeing you last and prevent a misjudging generosity from leading you into any injury of your own fortune for a man who is past all relief from it and who cannot be saved even though you were to be destroyed for his sake  you are very good said cecilia but your counsel is now too late she then briefly acquainted him with what passed and with how large a sum she had parted  he heard her with rage amazement and horror and after inveighing against mr harrel in the bitterest terms he said but why before you signed your name to so base an imposition could you not send for me  i wished i meant to have done it cried she but i thought the time past when you could help me how indeed could you have saved me my word was given given with an oath the most solemn and the first i have ever taken in my life  an oath so forced answered he the most delicate conscience would have absolved you from performing you have indeed been grossly imposed upon and pardon me if i add unaccountably to blame was it not obvious that relief so circumstanced must be temporary if his ruin had been any thing less than certain what tradesmen would have been insolent you have therefore deprived yourself of the power of doing good to a worthier object merely to grant a longer date to extravagance and villainy  yet how cried cecilia deeply touched by this reproof how could i do otherwise could i see a man in the agonies of despair hear him first darkly hint his own destruction and afterward behold him almost in the very act of suicide the instrument of selfmurder in his desperate hand  and yet though he put his life in my power though he told me i could preserve him and told me he had no other reliance or resource could i leave him to his dreadful despondence refuse my assisting hand to raise him from perdition and to save what after all i am well able to spare suffer a fellow creature who flung himself upon my mercy to offer up his last accounts with an action blacker than any which had preceded it  no i cannot repent what i have done though i lament indeed that the object was not more deserving  your representation said mr monckton like every thing else that i ever heard you utter breathes nothing but benevolence and goodness but your pity has been abused and your understanding imposed upon mr harrel had no intention to destroy himself the whole was an infamous trick which had not your generosity been too well known would never have been played  i cannot think quite so ill of him said cecilia nor for the world would i have risked my own future reproaches by trusting to such a suspicion which had it proved wrong and had mr harrel upon my refusal committed the fatal deed would have made his murder upon my own conscience rest for ever surely the experiment would have been too hazardous when the consequence had all my future peace in its power  it is impossible not to revere your scruples said mr monckton even while i consider them as causeless for causeless they undoubtedly were the man who could act so atrocious a part who could so scandalously pillage a young lady who was his guest and his ward take advantage of her temper for the plunder of her fortune and extort her compliance by the basest and most dishonorable arts meant only to terrify her into compliance for he can be nothing less than a downright and thorough scoundrel capable of every species of mean villainy  he then protested he would at least acquaint her other guardians with what had passed whose business it would be to enquire if there was any chance of redress  cecilia however had not much trouble in combating this proposal for though her objections which were merely those of punctilious honor and delicacy weighed nothing with a man who regarded them as absurdities yet his own apprehensions of appearing too officious in her affairs forced him after a little deliberation to give up the design  besides said cecilia as i have his bond for what i have parted with i have at least no right to complain unless after he receives his rents he refuses to pay me  his bonds his rents exclaimed mr monckton what is a mans bond who is not worth a guinea and what are his rents when all he ever owned must be sold before they are due and when he will not himself receive a penny from the sale as he has neither land house nor possession of any sort that is not mortgaged  nay then said cecilia if so it is indeed all over i am sorry i am grieved  but it is past and nothing therefore remains but that i try to forget i ever was richer  this is very youthful philosophy said mr monckton but it will not lessen your regret hereafter when the value of money is better known to you  if i shall dearly buy my experience said cecilia let me be the more attentive to making good use of it and since my loss seems irremediable to myself let me at least endeavor to secure its utility to mr harrel  she then told him her wish to propose to that gentleman some scheme of reformation while yesterdays events were yet recent in his mind but mr monckton who had hardly patience to hear her exclaimed he is a wretch and deserves the full force of the disgrace he is courting what is now most necessary is to guard you from his further machinations for you may else be involved in ruin as deep as his own he now knows the way to frighten you and he will not fail to put it in practice  no sir answered cecilia he would vainly apply to me in future i cannot repent that i ventured not yesterday to brave his menaces but too little is the comfort i feel from what i have bestowed to suffer any consideration to make me part with more  your resolution answered he will be as feeble as your generosity will be potent depend nothing upon yourself but instantly quit his house you will else be made responsible for every debt that he contracts and whatever may be his difficulties hereafter he will know that to extricate himself from them he has but to talk of dying and to show you a sword or a pistol  if so then said cecilia looking down while she spoke i suppose i must again go to mr delviles  this was by no means the purpose of mr monckton who saw not more danger to her fortune with one of her guardians than to her person with the other he ventured therefore to recommend to her a residence with mr briggs well knowing that his house would be a security against her seeing any man equal to himself and hoping that under his roof he might again be as unrivalled in her opinion and esteem as he formerly was in the country  but here the opposition of cecilia was too earnest for any hope that it might be surmounted for added to her dislike of mr briggs her repugnance to such an habitation was strongly though silently increased by her secret inclination to return to st jamesssquare  i mention not mr briggs as an eligible host said mr monckton after listening to her objections but merely as one more proper for you than mr delvile with whom your fixing at present would be but ill thought of in the world  ill thought of sir why so  because he has a son for whose sake alone it would be universally concluded you changed your abode and to give any pretense for such a report would by no means accord with the usual delicacy of your conduct  cecilia was confounded by this speech the truth of the charge she felt and the probability of the censure she did not dare dispute  he then gave her a thousand exhortations to beware of the schemes and artifices of mr harrel which he foresaw would be innumerable he told her too that with respect to sir robert floyer he thought she had better suffer the report to subside of itself which in time it must necessarily do than give to it so much consequence as to send a message to the baronet from which he might pretend to infer that hitherto she had been wavering or she would have sent to him sooner  but the real motive of this advice was that as he found sir robert by no means to be dreaded he hoped the report if generally circulated and credited might keep off other pretenders and intimidate or deceive young delvile  the purport for which cecilia had wished this conference was however wholly unanswered mr monckton enraged by the conduct of mr harrel refused to talk of his affairs and could only mention him with detestation but cecilia less severe in her judgment and more tender in her heart would not yet give up the hope of an amendment she so anxiously wished and having now no other person to whom she could apply determined to consult with mr arnott whose affection for his sister would give him a zeal in the affair that might somewhat supply the place of superior abilities  there was indeed no time to be lost in making the projected attempt for no sooner was the immediate danger of suffering removed than the alarm wore away and the penitence was forgotten every thing went on as usual no new regulations were made no expenses abated no pleasures forborne not a thought of hereafter admitted and ruinous and terrible as had been the preceding storm no trace of it was visible in the serenity of the present calm  an occasion of discussion with mr arnott very speedily offered mr harrel said he had observed in the looks of his friends at the pantheon much surprise at the sight of him and declared he should take yet another measure for removing all suspicion this was to give a splendid entertainment at his own house to all his acquaintance to which he meant to invite every body of any consequence he had ever seen and almost every body he had ever heard of in his life  levity so unfeeling and a spirit of extravagance so irreclaimable were hopeless prognostics yet cecilia would not desist from her design she therefore took the earliest opportunity of speaking with mr arnott upon the subject when she openly expressed her uneasiness at the state of his brothers affairs and warmly acknowledged her displeasure at his dissipated way of life  mr arnott soon showed that example was all he wanted to declare the same sentiments he owned he had long disapproved the conduct of mr harrel and trembled at the situation of his sister they then considered what it was possible to propose that might retrieve their affairs and concluded that entirely to quit london for some years was the only chance that remained of saving them from absolute destruction  mr arnott therefore though fearfully and averse to the task told his sister their mutual advice she thanked him said she was much obliged to him and would certainly consider his proposal and mention it to mr harrel  parties of pleasure however intervened and the promise was neglected  cecilia then again spoke herself mrs harrel much softened by her late acts of kindness was no longer offended by her interference but contented herself with confessing that she quite hated the country and could only bear to live in it in summer time and when cecilia very earnestly expostulated on the weakness of such an objection to a step absolutely necessary for her future safety and happiness she said she could do no worse than that if already ruined and therefore that she thought it would be very hard to expect from her such a sacrifice beforehand  it was in vain cecilia remonstrated mrs harrels love of pleasure was stronger than her understanding and therefore though she listened to her with patience she concluded with the same answer she had begun  cecilia then though almost heartless resolved upon talking with mr harrel himself and therefore taking an opportunity which he had not time to elude she ingenuously told him her opinion of his danger and of the manner in which it might be avoided  he paid unusual attention to her advice but said she was much mistaken with respect to his affairs which he believed he should now very speedily retrieve as he had had the preceding night an uncommon run of luck and flattered himself with being able very shortly to pay all his debts and begin the world again upon a new score  this open confession of gaming was but a new shock to cecilia who scrupled not to represent to him the uncertainty of so hazardous a reliance and the inevitable evils of so destructive a practice  she made not however the least impression upon his mind he assured her he doubted not giving her shortly a good account of himself and that living in the country was a resource of desperation which need not be anticipated  cecilia though grieved and provoked by their mutual folly and blindness could proceed no further advice and admonition she spared not but authority she had none to use she regretted her ineffectual attempt to mr arnott who was yet more cruelly afflicted at it but though they conversed upon the subject by every opportunity they were equally unable to relate any success from their efforts or to devise any plan more likely to ensure it  chap viii a mistake mean time young delvile failed not to honor cecilias introduction of him to mr harrel by waiting upon that gentleman as soon as the ill effects of his accident at the pantheon permitted him to leave his own house mr harrel though just going out when he called was defirous of being upon good terms with his family and therefore took him up stairs to present him to his lady and invited him to tea and cards the next evening  cecilia who was with mrs harrel did not see him without emotion which was not much lessened by the task of thanking him for his assistance at the pantheon and enquiring how he had himself fared no sign however of emotion appeared in return either when he first addressed or afterward answered her the look of solicitude with which she had been so much struck when they last parted was no longer discernable and the voice of sensibility which had removed all her doubts was no longer to be heard his general ease and natural gaiety were again unruffled and though he had never seemed really indifferent to her there was not the least appearance of any added partiality  cecilia felt an involuntary mortification as she observed this change yet upon reflection she still attributed his whole behavior to his mistake with respect to her situation and therefore was but the more gratified by the preference he occasionally betrayed  the invitation for the next evening was accepted and cecilia for once felt no repugnance to joining the company young delvile again was in excellent spirits but though his chief pleasure was evidently derived from conversing with her she had the vexation to observe that he seemed to think her the undoubted property of the baronet always retreating when he approached and as careful when next her to yield his place if he advanced as when he was distant to guard it from all others  but when sir robert was employed at cards all scruples ceasing he neglected not to engross her almost wholly he was eager to speak to her of the affairs of mr belfield which he told her wore now a better aspect theletter indeed of recommendation which he had shown to her had failed as the nobleman to whom it was written had already entered into an engagement for his son but he had made application elsewhere which he believed would be successful and he had communicated his proceedings to mr belfield whose spirits he hoped would recover by this prospect of employment and advantage it is however but too true he added that i have rather obtained his consent to the steps i am taking than his approbation of them nor do i believe had i previously consulted him i should have had even that disappointed in his higher views his spirit is broken and he is heartless and hopeless scarce condescending to accept relief from the bitter remembrance that he expected preferment time however will blunt this acute sensibility and reflection will make him blush at this unreasonable delicacy but we must patiently sooth him till he is more himself or while we mean to serve we shall only torment him sickness sorrow and poverty have all fallen heavily upon him and they have all fallen at once we must not therefore wonder to find him intractable when his mind is as much depressed as his body is enervated  cecilia to whom his candor and generosity always gave fresh delight strengthened his opinions by her concurrence and confirmed his designs by the interest which she took in them  from this time he found almost daily some occasion for calling in portmansquare the application of cecilia in favor of mr belfield gave him a right to communicate to her all his proceedings concerning him and he had some letter to show some new scheme to propose some refusal to lament or some hope to rejoice over almost perpetually or even when these failed cecilia had a cold which he came to enquire after or mrs harrel gave him an invitation which rendered any excuse unnecessary but though his intimacy with cecilia was increased though his admiration of her was conspicuous and his fondness for her society seemed to grow with the enjoyment of it he yet never manifested any doubt of her engagement with the baronet nor betrayed either intention or desire to supplant him cecilia however repined not much at the mistake since she thought it might be instrumental to procuring her a more impartial acquaintance with his character than she could rationally expect if as she hoped the explanation of his error should make him seek her good opinion with more study and design  to satisfy herself not only concerning the brother but the sister she again visited miss belfield and had the pleasure of finding her in better spirits and hearing that the noble friend of her brother whom she had already mentioned and whom cecilia had before suspected to be young delvile had now pointed out to him a method of conduct by which his affairs might be decently retrieved and himself creditably employed miss belfield spoke of the plan with the highest satisfaction yet she acknowledged that her mother was extremely discontented with it and that her brother himself was rather led by shame than inclination to its adoption yet he was evidently easier in his mind though far from happy and already so much better that mr rupil said he would very soon be able to leave his room  such was the quiet and contented situation of cecilia when one evening which was destined for company at home while she was alone in the drawing room which mrs harrel had just left to answer a note sir robert floyer accidentally came up stairs before the other gentlemen  ha cried he the moment he saw her at last have i the good fortune to meet with you alone this indeed is a favor i thought i was always to be denied  he was then approaching her but cecilia who shrunk involuntary at the sight of him was retreating hastily to quit the room when suddenly recollecting that no better opportunity might ever offer for a final explanation with him she irresolutely stopped and sir robert immediately following took her hand and pressing it to his lips as she endeavored to withdraw it exclaimed you are a most charming creature when the door was opened and young delvile at the same moment was announced and appeared  cecilia coloring violently and extremely chagrined hastily disengaged herself from his hold delvile seemed uncertain whether he ought not to retire which sir robert perceiving bowed to him with an air of mingled triumph and vexation and said sir your most obedient  the doubt however in which every one appeared of what was next to be done was immediately removed by the return of mrs harrel and the arrival at almost the same moment of more company  the rest of the evening was spent on the part of cecilia most painfully the explanation she had planned had ended in worse than nothing for by suffering the baronet to detain her she had rather shown a disposition to oblige than any intention to discard him and the situation in which she had been surprised by young delvile was the last to clear the suspicions she so little wished him to harbor while on his part the accident seemed to occasion no other alteration than that of rendering him more than usually assiduous to give way to sir robert whenever he approached her  nor was sir robert slack in taking advantage of this attention he was highly in spirits talked to her with more than common freedom and wore the whole evening an air of exulting satisfaction  cecilia provoked by this presumption hurt by the behavior of young delvile and mortified by the whole affair determined to leave this mistake no longer in the power of accident but to apply immediately to mr delvile senior and desire him as her guardian to wait upon sir robert himself and acquaint him that his perseverance in pursuing her was both useless and offensive and by this method she hoped at once to disentangle herself for ever from the baronet and to discover more fully the sentiments of young delvile for the provocation she had just endured robbed her of all patience for waiting the advice of mr monckton  chap ix an explanation the following morning therefore cecilia went early to st jamess square and after the usual ceremonies of messages and long waiting she was shown into an apartment where she found mr delvile and his son  she rejoiced to see them together and determined to make known to them both the purport of her visit and therefore after some apologies and a little hesitation she told mr delvile that encouraged by his offers of serving her she had taken the liberty to call upon him with a view to entreat his assistance  young delvile immediately arising would have quitted the room but cecilia assuring him she rather desired what she had to say should be known than kept secret begged that he would not disturb himself  delvile pleased with this permission to hear her and curious to know what would follow very readily returned to his seat  i should by no means she continued have thought of proclaiming even to the most intimate of my friends the partiality which sir robert floyer has been pleased to show me had he left to me the choice of publishing or concealing it but on the contrary his own behavior seems intended not merely to display it but to insinuate that it meets with my approbation mr harrel also urged by too much warmth of friendship has encouraged this belief nor indeed do i know at present where the mistake stops nor what it is report has not scrupled to affirm but i think i ought no longer to neglect it and therefore i have presumed to solicit your advice in what manner i may most effectually contradict it  the extreme surprise of young delvile at this speech was not more evident than pleasant to cecilia to whom it accounted for all that had perplexed her in his conduct while it animated every expectation she wished to encourage  the behavior of mr harrel answered mr delvile has by no means been such as to lead me to forget that his father was the son of a steward of mr grant who lived in the neighborhood of my friend and relation the duke of derwent nor can i sufficiently congratulate myself that i have always declined acting with him the late dean indeed never committed so strange an impropriety as that of nominating mr harrel and mr briggs coadjutors with mr delvile the impropriety however though extremely offensive to me has never obliterated from my mind the esteem i bore the dean nor can i possibly give a greater proof of it than the readiness i have always shown to offer my counsel and instruction to his neice mr harrel therefore ought certainly to have desired sir robert floyer to acquaint me with his proposals before he gave to him any answer  undoubtedly sir said cecilia willing to shorten this parading harangue but as he neglected that intention will you think me too impertinent should i entreat the favor of you to speak with sir robert yourself and explain to him the total inefficacy of his pursuit since my determination against him is unalterable  here the conference was interrupted by the entrance of a servant who said something to mr delvile which occasioned his apologizing to cecilia for leaving her for a few moments and ostentatiously assuring her that no business however important should prevent his thinking of her affairs or detain him from returning to her as soon as possible  the astonishment of young delvile at the strength of her last expression kept him silent some time after his father left the room and then with a countenance that still marked his amazement he said is it possible miss beverley that i should twice have been thus egregiously deceived or rather that the whole town and even the most intimate of your friends should so unaccountably have persisted in a mistake  for the town answered cecilia i know not how it can have had any concern in so small a matter but for my intimate friends i have too few to make it probable they should ever have been so strangely misinformed  pardon me cried he it was from one who ought to know that i had myself the intelligence  i entreat you then said cecilia to acquaint me who it was  mr harrel himself who communicated it to a lady in my hearing and at a public place  cecilia cast up her eyes in wonder and indignation at a proof so incontrovertible of his falsehood but made not any answer  even yet continued he i can scarcely feel undeceived your engagement seemed so positive your connection so irretrievable  so  so fixed i mean   he hesitated a little embarrassed but then suddenly exclaimed yet whence if to neither favorable if indifferent alike to sir robert and to belfield whence that animated apprehension for their safety at the operahouse whence that never to be forgotten oh stop him good god will nobody stop him  words of anxiety so tender and sounds that still vibrate in my ear  cecilia struck with amazement in her turn at the strength of his own expressions blushed and for a few minutes hesitated how to answer him but then to leave nothing that related to so disagreeable a report in any doubt she resolved to tell him ingenuously the circumstances that had occasioned her alarm and therefore though with some pain to her modesty she confessed her fears that she had herself provoked the affront though her only view had been to discountenance sir robert without meaning to show any distinction to mr belfield  delvile who seemed charmed with the candor of this explanation said when she had finished it you are then at liberty  ah madam  how many may rue so dangerous a discovery  could you think said cecilia endeavoring to speak with her usual ease that sir robert floyer would be found so irresistible  oh no cried he far otherwise a thousand times i have wondered at his happiness a thousand times when i have looked at you and listened to you i have thought it impossible  yet my authority seemed indisputable and how was i to discredit what was not uttered as a conjecture but asserted as a fact asserted too by the guardian with whom you lived and not hinted as a secret but affirmed as a point settled  yet surely said cecilia you have heard me make use of expressions that could not but lead you to suppose there was some mistake whatever might be the authority which had won your belief  no answered he i never supposed any mistake though sometimes i thought you repented your engagement i concluded indeed you had been unwarily drawn in and i have even at times been tempted to acknowledge my suspicions to you state your independence and exhort you  as a friend exhort you  to use it with spirit and if you were shackled unwillingly incautiously or unworthily to break the chains by which you were confined and restore to yourself that freedom of choice upon the use of which all your happiness must ultimately depend but i doubted if this were honorable to the baronet  and what indeed was my right to such a liberty none that every man might not be proud of a wish to do honor to myself under the officious pretense of serving the most amiable of women  mr harrel said cecilia has been so strangely biggotted to his friend that in his eagerness to manifest his regard for him he seems to have forgotten every other consideration he would not else have spread so widely a report that could so ill stand enquiry  if sir robert returned he is himself deceived while he deceives others who can forbear to pity him for my own part instead of repining that hitherto i have been mistaken ought i not rather to bless an error that may have been my preservative from danger  cecilia distressed in what manner to support her part in the conversation began now to wish the return of mr delvile and not knowing what else to say she expressed her surprise at his long absence  it is not indeed well timed said young delvile just now  at the moment when   he stopped and presently exclaiming oh dangerous interval he arose from his seat in manifest disorder  cecilia arose too and hastily ringing the bell said mr delvile i am sure is detained and therefore i will order my chair and call another time  do i frighten you away said he assuming an appearance more placid  no answered she but i would not hasten mr delvile  a servant then came and said the chair was ready  she would immediately have followed him but young delvile again speaking she stopped a moment to hear him i fear said he with much hesitation i have strangely exposed myself  and that you cannot  but the extreme astonishment   he stopped again in the utmost confusion and then adding you will permit me to attend you to the chair he handed her down stairs and in quitting her bowed without saying a word more  cecilia who was almost wholly indifferent to every part of the explanation but that which had actually passed was now in a state of felicity more delightful than any she had ever experienced she had not a doubt remaining of her influence over the mind of young delvile and the surprise which had made him rather betray than express his regard was infinitely more flattering and satisfactory to her than any formal or direct declaration she had now convinced him she was disengaged and in return though without seeming to intend it he had convinced her of the deep interest which he took in the discovery his perturbation the words which escaped him and his evident struggle to say no more were proofs just such as she wished to receive of his partial admiration since while they satisfied her heart they also soothed her pride by showing a diffidence of success which assured her that her own secret was still sacred and that no weakness or inadvertency on her part had robbed her of the power of mingling dignity with the frankness with which she meant to receive his addresses all therefore that now employed her care was to keep off any indissoluble engagement till each should be better known to the other  for this reserve however she had less immediate occasion than she expected she saw no more of young delvile that day neither did he appear the next the third she fully expected him  but still he came not and while she wondered at an absence so uncommon she received a note from lord ernolf to beg permission to wait upon her for two minutes at any time she would appoint  she readily sent word that she should be at home for the rest of the day as she wished much for an opportunity of immediately finishing every affair but one and setting her mind at liberty to think only of that which she desired should prosper  lord ernolf was with her in half an hour she found him sensible and well bred extremely desirous to promote her alliance with his son and apparently as much pleased with herself as with her fortune he acquainted her that he had addressed himself to mr harrel long since but had been informed that she was actually engaged to sir robert floyer he should therefore have forborne taking up any part of her time had he not the preceding day while on a visit at mr delviles been assured that mr harrel was mistaken and that she had not yet declared for any body he hoped therefore that she would allow his son the honor of waiting upon her and permit him to talk with mr briggs who he understood was her acting guardian upon such matters as ought to be speedily adjusted  cecilia thanked him for the honor he intended her and confirmed the truth of the account he had heard in st jamesssquare but at the same time told him she must decline receiving any visits from his lordships son and entreated him to take no measure toward the promotion of an affair which never could succeed  he seemed much concerned at her answer and endeavored for some time to soffen her but found her so steady though civil in her refusal that he was obliged however unwillingly to give up his attempt  cecilia when he was gone reflected with much vexation on the readiness of the delviles to encourage his visit she considered however that the intelligence he had heard might possibly be gathered in general conversation but she blamed herself that she had not led to some enquiry what part of the family he had seen and who was present when the information was given him  mean while she found that neither coldness distance nor aversion were sufficient to repress sir robert floyer who continued to persecute her with as much confidence of success as could have arisen from the utmost encouragement she again though with much difficulty contrived to speak with mr harrel upon the subject and openly accused him of spreading a report abroad as well as countenancing an expectation at home that had neither truth nor justice to support them  mr harrel with his usual levity and carelessness laughed at the charge but denied any belief in her displeasure and affected to think she was merely playing the coquet while sir robert was not the less her decided choice  provoked and wearied cecilia resolved no longer to depend upon any body but herself for the management of her own affairs and therefore to conclude the business without any possibility of further cavilling she wrote the following note to sir robert herself  to sir robert floyer bart miss beverley presents her compliments to sir robert floyer and as she has some reason to fear mr harrel did not explicitly acquaint him with her answer to the commission with which he was entrusted she thinks it necessary in order to obviate any possible misunderstanding to take this method of returning him thanks for the honor of his good opinion but of begging at the same time that he would not lose a moment upon her account as her thanks are all she can now or ever offer in return  portmansquare may   th       to this note cecilia received no answer but she had the pleasure to observe that sir robert forbore his usual visit on the day she sent it and though he appeared again the day following he never spoke to her and seemed sullen and out of humor  yet still young delvile came not and still as her surprise increased her tranquillity was diminished she could form no excuse for his delay nor conjecture any reason for his absence every motive seemed to favor his seeking and not one his shunning her the explanation which had so lately passed had informed him he had no rival to fear and the manner in which he had heard it assured her the information was not indifferent to him why then so assiduous in his visits when he thought her engaged and so slack in all attendance when he knew she was at liberty  chap x a murmuring unable to relieve herself from this perplexity cecilia to divert her chagrin again visited miss belfield she had then the pleasure to hear that her brother was much recovered and had been able the preceding day to take an airing which he had borne so well that mr rupil had charged him to use the same exercise every morning  and will he said cecilia  no madam i am sadly afraid not she answered for coach hire is very expensive and we are willing now to save all we can in order to help fitting him out for going abroad  cecilia then earnestly entreated her to accept some assistance but she assured her she did not dare without the consent of her mother which however she undertook to obtain  the next day when cecilia called to hear her success mrs belfield who hitherto had kept out of sight made her appearance she found her alike in person manners and conversation a course and ordinary woman not more unlike her son in talents and acquired accomplishments than dissimilar to her daughter in softness and natural delicacy  the moment cecilia was seated she began without waiting for any ceremony or requiring any solicitation abruptly to talk of her affairs and repiningly to relate her misfortunes  i find madam she said you have been so kind as to visit my daughter henny a great many times but as i have no time for company i have always kept out of the way having other things to do than sit still to talk i have had a sad time of it here maam with my poor sons illness having no conveniences about me and much ado to make him mind me for he is all for having his own way poor dear soul and i am sure i dont know who could contradict m for it is what i never had the heart to do but then maam what is to come of it you see how bad things go for though i have got a very good income it will not do for every thing and if it was as much again i should want to save it all now for here my poor son you see is reduced all in a minute as one may say from being one of the first gentlemen in the town to a mere poor object without a farthing in the world  he is however i hope now much better in his health said cecilia  yes madam thank heaven for if he was worse those might tell of it that would for i am sure i should never live to hear of it he has been the best son in the world madam and used nothing but the best company for i spared neither pains nor cost to bring him up genteely and i believe there is not a nobleman in the land that looks more the gentleman however there is come no good of it for though his acquaintances was all among the first quality he never received the value of a penny from the best of them so i have no great need to be proud but i meant for the best though i have often enough wished i had not meddled in the matter but left him to be brought up in the shop as his father was before him  his present plan however said cecilia will i hope make you ample amends both for your sufferings and your tenderness  what madam when he is going to leave me and settle in foreign parts if you was a mother yourself madam you would not think that such good amends  settle said cecilia no he only goes for a year or two  that is more than i can say madam or any body else and nobody knows what may happen in that time and how i shall keep myself up when he is beyond seas i am sure i dont know for he has always been the pride of my life and every penny i saved for him i thought to have been paid in pounds  you will still have your daughter and she seems so amiable that i am sure you can want no consolation she will not endeavor to give you  but what is a daughter madam to such a son as mine a son that i thought to have seen living like a prince and sending his own coach for me to dine with him and now he is going to be taken away from me and nobody knows if i shall live till he comes back but i may thank myself for if i had but been content to see him brought up in the shop  yet all the world would have cried shame upon it for when he was quite a child in arms the people used all to say he was born to be a gentleman and would live to make many a fine ladys heart ache  if he can but make your heart easy said cecilia smiling we will not grieve that the fine ladies shod escape the prophecy  o maam i dont mean by that to say he has been over gay among the ladies for it is a thing i never heard of him and i dare say if any lady was to take a fancy to him she would find there was not a modester young man in the world but you must needs think what a hardship it is to me to have him turn out so unlucky after all i have done for him when i thought to have seen him at the top of the tree as one may say  he will yet i hope said cecilia make you rejoice in all your kindness to him his health is already returning and his affairs wear again a more prosperous aspect  but do you suppose maam that having him sent two or three hundred miles away from me with some young master to take care of is the way to make up to me what i have gone through for him why i used to deny myself every thing in the world in order to save money to buy him smart clothes and let him go to the opera and ranelagh and such sort of places that he might keep himself in fortunes way and now you see the end of it here he is in a little shabby room up two pair of stairs with not one of the great folks coming near him to see if he is so much as dead or alive  i do not wonder said cecilia that you resent their showing so little gratitude for the pleasure and entertainment they have formerly received from him but comfort yourself that it will at least secure you from any similar disappointment as mr belfield will in future be guarded from forming such precarious expectations  but what good will that do me maam for all the money he has been throwing after them all this while do you think i would have scraped it up for him and gone without every thing in the world to see it all end in this manner why he might as well have been brought up the commonest journeyman for  comfort i shall have of him at this rate and suppose he should be drowned in going beyond seas what am i to do then  you must not said cecilia indulge such fears i doubt not but your son will return well and return all that you wish  nobody knows that maam and the only way to be certain is for him not to go at all and i am surprised maam you can wish him to make such a journey to nobody knows where with nothing but a young master that he must as good as teach his a b c all the way they go  certainly said cecilia amazed at this accusation i should not wish him to go abroad if any thing more eligible could be done by his remaining in england but as no prospect of that sort seems before him you must endeavor to reconcile yourself to parting with him  yes but how am i to do that when i dont know if ever i shall see him again who could have thought of his living so among the great folks and then coming to want i am sure i thought they would have provided for him like a son of their own for he used to go about to all the public places just as they did themselves day after day i used to be counting for when he would come to tell me he would got a place at court or something of that sort for i never could tell what it would be and then the next news i heard was that he was shut up in this poor bit of place with nobody troubling their heads about him however i will never be persuaded but he might have done better if he would but have spoke a good word for himself or else have let me done it for him instead of which he never would so much as let me see any of his grand friends though i would not have made the least scruple in the world to have asked them for any thing he had a mind to  cecilia again endeavored to give her comfort but finding her only satisfaction was to express her discontent she arose to take leave but turning first to miss belfield contrived to make a private enquiry whether she might repeat her offer of assistance a downcast and dejected look answering in the affirmative she put into her hand a ten pound bank note and wishing them good morning hurried out of the room  miss belfield was running after her but stopped by her mother who called out what is it  how much is it  let me look at it  and then following cecilia herself she thanked her aloud all the way down stairs for her genteelness assuring her she would not fail making it known to her son  cecilia at this declaration turned back and exhorted her by no means to mention it after which she got into her chair and returned home pitying miss belfield for the unjust partiality shown to her brother and excusing the proud shame he had manifested of his relations from the vulgarity and selfishness of her who was at the head of them  almost a fortnight had now elapsed since her explanation with young delvile yet not once had he been in portmansquare though in the fortnight which had preceded scarce a day had passed which had not afforded him some pretense for calling there  at length a note arrived from mrs delvile it contained the most flattering reproaches for her long absence and a pressing invitation that she would dine and spend the next day with her  cecilia who had merely denied herself the pleasure of this visit from an apprehension of seeming too desirous of keeping up the connection now from the same sense of propriety determined upon making it wishing equally to avoid all appearance of consciousness either by seeking or avoiding the intimacy of the family  not a little was her anxiety to know in what manner young delvile would receive her whether he would be grave or gay agitated as during their last conversation or easy as in the meetings which had preceded it  she found mrs delvile however alone and extremely kind to her yet much surprised and half displeased that she had so long been absent cecilia though somewhat distressed what excuses to offer was happy to find herself so highly in favor and not very reluctant to promise more frequent visits in future  they were then summoned to dinner but still no young delvile was visible they were joined only by his father and she found that no one else was expected  her astonishment now was greater than ever and she could account by no possible conjecture for a conduct so extraordinary hitherto whenever she had visited in st jamesssquare by appointment the air with which he had received her constantly announced that he had impatiently waited her arrival he had given up other engagements to stay with her he had openly expressed his hopes that she would never be long absent and seemed to take a pleasure in her society to which every other was inferior and now how striking the difference he forbore all visits at the house where she resided he even flew from his own when he knew she was approaching it  nor was this the only vexation of which this day was productive mr delvile when the servants were withdrawn after dinner expressed some concern that he had been called from her during their last conversation and added that he would take the present opportunity to talk with her upon some matters of importance  he then began the usual parading prelude which upon all occasions he thought necessary in order to enhance the value of his interposition remind her of her inferiority and impress her with a deeper sense of the honor which his guardianship conferred upon her after which he proceeded to make a formal enquiry whether she had positively dismissed sir robert floyer  she assured him she had  i understood my lord ernolf said he that you had totally discouraged the addresses of his son  yes sir answered cecilia for i never mean to receive them  have you then any other engagement  no sir cried she coloring between shame and displeasure none at all  this is a very extraordinary circumstance replied he the son of an earl to be rejected by a young woman of no family and yet no reason assigned for it  this contemptuous speech so cruelly shocked cecilia that though he continued to harangue her for a great part of the afternoon she only answered him when compelled by some question and was so evidently discomposed that mrs delvile who perceived her uneasiness with much concern redoubled her civilities and caresses and used every method in her power to oblige and enliven her  cecilia was not ungrateful for her care and showed her sense of it by added respect and attention but her mind was disturbed and she quitted the house as soon as she was able  mr delviles speech from her previous knowledge of the extreme haughtiness of his character would not have occasioned her the smallest emotion had it merely related to him or to herself but as it concerned lord ernolf she regarded it as also concerning his son and she found that far from trying to promote the union mr monckton had told her he had planned he did not seem even to think of it but on the contrary proposed and seconded with all his interest another alliance  this added to the behavior of young delvile made her suspect that some engagement was in agitation on his own part and that while she thought him so sedulous only to avoid her he was simply occupied in seeking another this painful suggestion which every thing seemed to confirm again overset all her schemes and destroyed all her visionary happiness yet how to reconcile it with what had passed at their last meeting she knew not she had then every reason to believe that his heart was in her power and that courage or an opportunity more seasonable was all he wanted to make known his devotion to her why then shun if he loved her why if he loved her not seem so perturbed at the explanation of her independance  a very little time however she hoped would unravel this mystery in two days the entertainment which mr harrel had planned to deceive the world by an appearance of affluence to which he had lost all title was to take place young delvile in common with every other person who had ever been seen at the house had early received an invitation which he had readily promised to accept some time before the conversation that seemed the period of their acquaintance had passed should he after being so long engaged fail to keep his appointment she could no longer have any doubt of the justice of her conjecture should he on the contrary again appear from his behavior and his looks she might perhaps be able to gather why he had so long been absent  end of the second volume
