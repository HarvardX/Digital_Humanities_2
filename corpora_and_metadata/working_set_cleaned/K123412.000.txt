observations i could perceive none at this present era from whom i might derive more honor or find one more eminently distinguished than yourself  had you lived in the mythological days of old the transcendent labors of your ingenious hands would have raised your name to a state of immortality and the sapient god placed on his bright parnassian throne wondering at what you had done would have added another sister to the celestial nine and called her unica for being so great a mistress of the opus phrygium art  if at an hour of relaxation you shall be pleased to think any of the following pages worthy your perusal it will be the highest gratification to  madam your most humble and obedient servant geo s carey  the apology as the rage for visiting the different watering places in this kingdom has every season become more and more general i shall make no other apology for my introducing this balnearean system than that it might have been better done by many others than myself had the same idea come before them there are partial accounts given of every place that i have spoken of but they have been written by some inhabitant on the spot or some hireling who for his interests sake has been obliged to say something handsome should the situation be ever so ugly and given the qualities of each place like a fair piece of white paper without a spot and with one insipid sameness of perfection every one of the places in question have their beauties and defects therefore like a landscape the best way is to give each its natural coloring so that where the defects are introduced in a dark or dingy ground the beauties are always seen with a better effect by being thrown judiciously in by the painter as a contrast in some advantageous situation where the excellencies are heightened by comparison  what i have ventured to give the public is little more than a kind of chart in which the reader looking over it by his fireside in the winter may bethink himself what place would be the most convenient for him to visit in the summer  it may seem odd perhaps and look like vanity in me having obtruded two or three favorite bantlings of my humble muse into the following pages but as many of them have been seen like poor wandering foundlings thrown upon the world without their real parents name being known and none to tell to whom they belong i thought it high time to declare myself the father especially when i have been so often told that the relationship has been given to another and i must be thought unnatural indeed were i to deny my own children for the poorest mother and the humblest father though their offspring should be ever so ragged or ever so plain are generally tenacious of their being called by the name of any other family and i have many of the same feature  as i have never had interest like the authors of fall de ral tit the little farthing rushlight and many other writers of such elegant and classical productions to have my songs ushered from the stage my poor disconsolate brats have seldom been seen or heard in public but when they have been yelled through the loud discordant lungs of an itinerant balladsinger where they have been more attended to from the incident than the music by the plebeian listeners in the streets of london or sung as tom of bedlam did his frantic scraps at fairs or wakes or market towns and my relatives hereafter when i may be no more though i may have done so little may be glad trifling as they are that i have done so much and be pleased with them because they were mine  subscribers names

balnea margate the reader often feels as great a satisfaction in going over the excursions of another in print as if he had trod the ground himself at any rate it is less irksome and less expensive than the trouble of traveling two or three thousand miles  when a man has paid his deposit to a bookkeeper at an inn in london for being conveyed to edinbugh or any suchlike distance in a stagecoach he is little aware if he should be a stranger to traveling of what mortifications what impositions and what impediments he will meet with on the road shakespeare says fortune never comes with both hands full  nor does pleasure a traveller from his first setting out upon such a journey will find himself a victim to the hostler the coachman the waiter the chambermaid and the innkeeper for notwithstanding the plausible advertisements held out by the coachmaster to the public of expedition safe and easy traveling with good treatment and similar allurements it is a hundred to one by the time they have changed the first set of horses the passenger will find himself in as awkward a situation and as little respected as if he was a convict under the influence of a jailkeeper on his voyage to botanybay male or female old or young or let their description be whatever it may  in our police there is as needful a lookout necessary in respect to this species of abuse as any other trespass on mankind being too often practiced on the embarrassed traveller to a degree of terror and sometimes cruelty some provisional mode therefore of speedy redress and restitution while he is on the road ought to be made by the magistracy to protect the injured and helpless from becoming subject to such unwarrantable measures  to digress from the general subject i will make my way to margate and pursue particular ones  should you visit this pleasurable watering place and its vicinities in the summer season you can hardly travel through a country that has more attractive scenes or more variety of prospect than the county of kent you no sooner reach shooters hill than the eye is arrested with natural and numerous landscapes of hill and dale wood and water until you arrive at sarre in the isle of thanet the purpose of your journey is known by every innkeeper hostler coachman postboy and waiter on the road and like a sheep that has been under the necessity of making his way through a wild of thickets in order to get at and assemble with the social flock you are sure to lose a great deal of wool before you get to your journeys end and when you arrive at the place in question you are considered as a summerfly certain of meeting with gaping swallows enough that are always ready to receive you  yet i do not know a wateringplace that is more calculated to gratify a party on a summers excursion than margate and its environs nor is there one where the ladies have been so considered or so accommodated the bathingrooms are not only well situated as to their easy access to the machines but as a pleasant retreat at a small subscription where you are furnished with the news of the day and have a pleasant lookout in the morning over the green ocean  now a calm now a breeze and sometimes presenting itself with all its grandeur in a terrific storm in the evening parties assemble in the different rooms and what is seldom found in other places of the kind accord in amity and find an innocent and laudable entertainment for themselves  each room is generally provided with a pianoforte and is seldom at a loss for a willing and ingenious hand to display its dexterity and give it harmony nor are the vocal powers restrained in those that are possessed of that enviable ability  the harbor is sheltered and defended by the pier has a fine sand and a level bottom so that the bather unless the wind and the tide be uncommonly high is seldom annoyed by the turbulency of the waves  the assemblyroom is spacious and a good object standing in the center of the town the theater is a royal one well concerted in respect to size and proportioned to the place it is remarkably neat and seems to be well conducted the performers are better in point of competition in the gross than at most wateringplaces but are not always so well attended as they sometimes deserve to be this may proceed from the multiplicity of diceboxes which are generally rattling at theatrical hours for at the raffleboard every one is an actor and as the spirit of gambling infuses itself into the hearts and minds of men with a much stronger and more interested propensity than the lines of shakespeare or the notes of handel it is not to be wondered at when yon see the theater so often empty or a deserving actor with all his ability and best exertions neglected  there is a tolerable market but it is not so well supplied as might be wished and if you are desirous to furnish your table with the necessary comforts of the day you must get up by six oclock in the morning and scramble for them otherwise you may chance to go without your dinner  the pier is a lounging place for many people every evening but of a sunday it is a general promenade where you will see a greater diversity of object a more heterogeneous group than at any place in england which often enables the ingenious artist when he is disposed to make use of his pencil to treat the world with a whimsical characature or two the libraries are uncommonly elegant particularly the upper one which was built by mr hall  dandelion about a mile and a half from margate is as pleasant and rural a retreat as can be found any where possessing a grove an extensive and welllevelled bowlinggreen encircled with a voluptuous and variegated shrubbery of the rarest plants and flowers intersected with seats of accommodation like to those at bagniggewells or whiteconduit house the dwelling from whence the place takes its name is ancient formerly belonged to a family of that name who resided there and by the stately gateway which is now standing they must have been people of great respect being adorned with battlements as if it had been a place of some defense the house is now licensed as a tavern so that the visitor has an opportunity of refreshing himself if he pleases while dancing on the green which is a general practice during the season at a public breakfast every wednesday about twelve oclock  there is no proper inlet to the town of margate from any direction whatever and what they call the high street is a close contracted thoroughfare many parts of it filthy with scarcely a decent habitation and only serves in the present instance to show us what their nowflourishing town was in its original state the street is too narrow for one carriage to pass another in the day but in the night it is dangerous indeed being of considerable length commencing from the london road down to the old parade which is nearly the extent of the town what the old parade might have been is no easy matter to tell but in its present state and in this improving age it has little to boast of in respect to elegance or even cleanliness and in rainy weather it is a mere swamp the greatest part of it lies between a noisy stableyard well furnished with manure and the common sewer of the contiguous marketplace as well as all the lower part of the old town which frequently yield up the most ungrateful exhalations and unsavory smells to those who choose to regale themselves in this delicious neighborhood  cecilsquare is well built so are the houses in church field but they both turn their backs to the sea the sight of which one would suppose to be one of the principal attractions which bring summervisitors to this place  the narrow passage leading from high street to cecilsquare and the assemblyrooms is dangerous both to footpassengers and to those in carriages and serious accidents have often happened there  it is not to be wondered at that those who have the management of these things the principal part of the natives who are always resident do not contrive that the newimproved parts of the town should have better access to them or that the visitors who support the improvement should not be better accommodated it should seem as if they acted upon the following idea  serve but my turn today and turn out tomorrow  the lower order of the natives are cunning avaricious disrespectful and sometimes malevolent and though their bread of life is for ever sweetened by the industrious honeybees from london who yearly distribute the essence of their winter labor among them yet from the depravity of their natures as if they possessed an inward hatred in their minds toward their best benefactors they seldom discover the least spark of gratitude or even common civility  churchfield and cecilsquare form the principal part of the new town and there would have been a tolerable opening from thence toward the london and ramsgate roads but the intervening ground in different patches having been unfortunately purchased by several of the low shopkeepers of margate who have conjunctively built upon it a few paltry huts forming an insignificant row which they call cranbournalley by which means a very elegant and respectable neighborhood is deprived of the only eligible egress that was left of making their way into the high road with safety or convenience  the most desirable spot in margate and where a handsome row of houses might have been judiciously ranged with all the capability of forming a pleasant airy and useful walk in the front is on the west side of the town at the back of the high street it is not only eminently situated but has one of the best aspects of the harbor where there is an everlasting entertainment for the eye from the number of vessels perpetually coming in or going out with an extensive view of sea and land but this idea is done away from the ground being purloined by the proprietors of a ropewalk who carry on their business upon the very spot in question and which would be an intolerable nuisance were such an improvement to take place  the isle of thanet possesses a number of industrious as well as ingenious farmers who from an indefatigable attention to the land have made the soil uncommonly prolific so much so it is said as to yield as much grain in one season as to furnish the inhabitants with bread for three  the villages are neat and prettily scattered about the island and shaded with orchards fenced with elmtrees those of st peter and st lawrence are beautifully situated and contain many respectable families there is a labyrinth of roads which leads from place to place so that in your excursions you never tire with a tedious sameness  margate is seventytwo miles from london by land the posttowns through which you pass are dartford rochester sittingbourne and canterbury but rochester and canterbury and their vicinities are well worth the attention of the traveller if he should have so much time to spare  kent is not only eminent for the beauty of its prospects and fertility of its soil but it produces much eventful history which is to be met with even on the road to margate  at dartford the marriagesolemnity between isabella sister of henry iii and frederic emperor of germany was celebrated king edward iii founded a nunnery in this town which became famous for the dignity of its devotees at the time of the reformation king henry viii converted it into a palace for himself and successors queen elizabeth in her way from rochester to greenwich resided in this palace two days it was alienated from the crown in the reign of james i the knights templars also had a mansion in this town the first papermill was erected here by sir john spelman in the reign of charles the first  near the road from dartford is a large common called dartfordbrink where edward iii held a solemn tournament in the year       the strife between the families of york and lancaster began here a d      when richard plantagenet duke of york brought together on this spot an army of ten thousand men  the country about greenhithe and swanscomb is famous for being the rendezvous of the danish freebooters the latter place derives its name from a captain of those barbarians called swein who there pitched his camp which was named sweins camp  near the twentyseventh milestone is gads hill supposed to have been the scene of the robbery mentioned by shakespeare in his play of henry iv  kilburne who seems to have been a much better topographer than orthographer if we judge by the multitudinous errata which he has prefixed to his work furnished the world with a survey of kent in the reign of charles i speaking of rochester castle he says julius caesar about   00 years since in the time of cassibelanus governor of britain commanded the same to be built according to the roman order to awe the britains and the same was called the castle of medway but time and tempests utterly decayed the same oese or uske king of kent about    0 years since caused hroff one of his chief counselors and lord of this place to build a new castle upon the old foundation and hereupon it took the name of hroffes cester about   0 years afterward hasting the dane besieged and much impaired the same and it afterward lay desolate till the time of king william the conqueror who caused it to be new built and put  00 soldiers for a guard therein to which odo earl of kent and brother to that king was a great benefactor  afterward in the year  0   in the time of king william rufus that odo and other barons held this castle against him the same being then accounted the strongest and most important castle in england and his subjects being backward to assist him he proclaimed him to be accounted a niding supposed to have meant a dastardly foolish fellow or perhaps our idiot or ninny are derived from it which was then a word of high reproach that came not to his assistance whereupon multitudes came and the resistants were forced to yield the same to the king and gundulphus a norman then bishop of rochester repaired and fortified the same and built the great tower therein  afterward in the   th year of king john the barons held this castle against him but he took the same and in the year following jews son of philip king of france likewise took the same and king henry iii afterward gave it to guy of rochford a poictovin who was afterward banished and therefore lost the same  afterward in the year      simon earl of leicester besieged the same and won the bridge and the first gate and left the siege  afterward in the fifth year of the reign of richard the second the commons of this country strongly besieged this castle and by force took a prisoner out of the same and thus the castle ran to decay and the old walls afterward falling king edw iv repaired both the same and the castle  i find also three minthouses to have been granted by king ethelstan about the year   0 to be in this city viz two for the king and one for the bishop and   december      king hen iii held a just here  as concerning the cathedral and priory  the same was built by king ethelbert in the year  00 and dedicated to the honor of god and st andrew endowed with lands called priestfields and channons were put into the same but the several devastations aforesaid of the city by the mercians danes and the west saxons also caused the decay both of this church and the priory both which were new builded by the aforesaid gundulphus being bishop there about the year  0 0    a judicious editor who published in the year      the history and antiquities of rochester says about april      rochester became the theater of one of those horrid scenes that disgraced the reign and religion of queen mary i john harpole of st nicholas parish in this city and john beach of tunbridge were burnt alive as heretics according to the sentence of maurice griffin bishop of rochester for denying the authority of the church and the transubstanaittion of the sacramental elements the illustrious sister of queen mary was more propitious to this city it has been observed by many historians of her reign that traveling from one part of the kingdom to another was a favorite passion of elizabeth and in order to gratify this laudable inclination she in the year      visited various places in the counties of sussex and kent being on her return toward the metropolis from this tour her majesty came on september the   th to rochester and for four or five days of her continuance here she took up her abode at the crown inn but on the last day mr watts had the honor and happiness of accommodating her at his house on bullyhill the same which lately belonged to mr brook there is a traditional story of this royal guest having given the title of satis to this mansion either as declaring it to be her opinion that the apartments were sufficiently large and commodious even for a lady of her exalted rank and that therefore all further apologies supposing he had made many on the subject were needless or as expressing her satisfaction at the treatment she had received in it    the name of watts stands very conspicuously forward in the annals of rochester owing to the many benefactions he left to the city and its neighborhood one from its singularity as well as its utility particularly attracts the attention of both the traveller and the historian and that is the house appointed for the reception of poor travelers situated on the north side of the high street in which agreeable to the benevolent design of the donor poor travelers have lodging and fourpence each and that this charity may be the more generally known the following inscription is fixed over the door  richard watts esquire the mayor and citizens of this city caused a monument to be erected to his memory on the south side of the door entering into the choir of the cathedral on the top of this monument is a bust of mr watts given by joseph brook esquire as appears by the following inscription under the bust  archetypum hunc dedit on the marble monument beneath it  sacred to the memory of richard watts esquire a principal benefactor to this city who departed this life sept  0      at his mansion house on bullyhill called satis so named by q elizabeth of glorious memory and lies interred near this place as by his will does plainly appear by which will dated aug    and proved sept         he founded an almshouse for the relief of poor people and for the reception of six poor travelers every night and for employing the poor of this city  in respect to the dockyard at chatham camden speaking of it says it is the bestappointed arsenal the sun ever saw  between the   th and   th milestones is the ancient village of harbledown this was the place that formerly held that precious relic called st thomas a beckets slipper neatly set in copper and crystal mentioned by erasmus numerous pilgrims to the shrine of st thomas used to stop here and kiss his slipper as a preparation for their more solemn approach to his tomb in that blind age when priestcraft had its fullest sway followed by bigotry and superstition so far as to bring men down upon their knees even to a heap of putrid dust whose ambitious spirit had made its flight to an awful region where he will be convinced of his own insignificance and be made to answer for all the sacerdotal perfidy and hypocrisy he practiced not only on his deluded followers but shameful cruelty on his king who had raised this ignominious and ungrateful monster from the lowest order of life to the most exalted state of affluence and splendour the mitre of this imperious prelate is deposited among the many sacred vestiges at st bertrams church at st omers in french flanders which is much revered by every devotee of the roman church  kilburne says canterbury is one of the most ancient cities now in the nation and anciently called caergent or the court of kentish men it is reported by some to have been founded with winchester in hampshire and shaftesbury in dorsetshire by rudhudibras otherwise cicuber king of britain almost   00 years since the truth whereof may be questionable for that it is believed for certain that shaftesbury was founded by king alfred many hundred years afterward but as certain it is that this city of canterbury was famous in the time of the roman government here and in the time of ethelbert king of kent above  0 0 years since this was his chief city and place of residence which afterward was by ethelstan enriched with seven mints viz four for himself two for the archbishop and one for the abbot  and for diverse centuries afterward this city was the chief place of kent governed by a prefect portreve bailiffe or provost until the year      when it came to be governed by a mayor and so has ever since continued and in the year      it was made a county of itself  the cathedral is a fine piece of gothic architecture situated in a spacious square toward the east side of the city this magnificent pile is erected where a christian church stood before the saxons governed in kent that church with its adjacent palace ethelbert gave to augustine the monk soon after he arrived to preach the gospel in britain augustine dedicated it to christ and made it a cathedralmonastery about the year  00    there are many ancient monuments in this church some in very good condition among which are those of henry iv and his queen a d      and edward the black prince the cloisters and chapter house are of the same age as the church in this chapterroom a d      king henry ii either through piety or policy suffered the audacious monks to vent their insolence on his royal back with a scourge the ruins of st augustines monastry stand upon many acres of ground and the two spacious gateways lead the mind of the spectator to picture to itself what a splendid structure it must have been but were i to dwell on the history of this city it would break in so much upon my intended plan that i should be under the necessity of swelling my duodecimo to a folio volume  the nearest way from margate to ramsgate is four miles but if you should go through kingsgate and broadstairs it is more than five  should you be disposed to go by water to margate you will often be under the necessity of arming yourself with a great deal of patience and a good store of victuals you must shut your eyes from seeing indecent scenes your ears from indecent conversation and your nose from indelicate smells the hoys are a kind of small muchcrowded and moving jails the captain as he is called and his men generally assimilate much in their manners and in their language to the keepers of newgate and other places of confinement about london and the passengers often from the time they set sail from billingsgate till they arrive at margate feel themselves under the same state of injunction as those unfortunate creatures who are kept under lock and key in the aforementioned places of confinement and generally meet with as little degree of respect  broadstairs broadstairs is another watering place of little extent and not much note lately shot up between margate and ramsgate there is a good view of the sea it is true but it possesses no other attraction it lies low in a husky situation with no diversity of object and being newly built pictures to the traveller the idea of a brickkiln surrounded by unpleasant and stubble fields in going to broadstairs you pass kingsgate the seat of the late lord holland the simplicity and elegance of which causes every traveller to pause with admiration it is situated in the dimple of a hill commanding a view of the sea in a manner which presents itself to you with a crescentine effect its appendages such as stabling and other outhouses are whimsically and judiciously fancied they encircle the house at a considerable distance the whole comprising many acres of ground on leaving this beautiful scene for broadstairs which is in its neighborhood the latter perhaps suffers the more by comparison  ramsgate ramsgate is much frequented in the summer season by some of the first families the principal street is very narrow but well paved and the old houses many of which are built with flint corniced and decorated with stone are handsome and kept remarkably clean and neat by the inhabitants there have been considerable additions made to ramsgate in respect to building within these few years church and albion places are well built both commanding an extensive view of the ocean so far as the coast of france which on a fair day may be perceived by the naked eye the spirit of this place has been considerably kept up and many of the tradesfolks of moderate circumstances encouraged and patronised by that female macaenas the ingenious mrs t  y and the greatest proportion of the new buildings were erected at her own expense which is not only a compliment to her natural public spirit but her judicious speculation and taste  the pier is one of the most magnificent structures of its kind in this kingdom forming almost a circus of a mile in compass which is a stately and convenient shelter for shipping on that part of the coast at the commencement of the pier is the assemblyroom built by the late mr herritage which though small is well proportioned not splendid but elegantly neat  albionplace is built upon one of the cliffs overlooking the sea commanding a variety of views particularly dover castle and the downs the back prospect presents to the eye the greatest part of the isle of thanet  the library here is much confined in point of situation being placed in the center of the town very near to the market at one of the corners of four streets where there is little prospect and much smell and the subscribers have this consolation when reading should they take their eyes from their books and turn them to the market that they are well placed having food for the body and mind at the same time so near at hand the librarian is a very civil wellbehaved respectable tradesman and the reason that his library has risen to that degree of eminence is from the uniform attention he seems to pay every body that is pleased to countenance him in his profession  we are told that a certain popular lady in that neighborhood in order to accommodate the frequenters of ramsgate and encourage an industrious and deserving character has it in mind to build another house for him near the pier where the subscribers will be placed in a better point of view and enjoy the salubrity of the seaair at the same time  tunbridgewells this place is built in a sandy bottom closely encircled with hills contracting the atmosphere which seems to lie heavy upon the heads and the hearts of the inhabitants for there is a visible languor in all their manners and a weight upon all their countenances the promenade is a long brick pavement over which is thrown a wooden colonnade or shed and to keep you more from the light of the heavens and the influx of the air this colonnade is sheltered by a row of tall elms so that what air you imbibe for the sake of respiration arises from the earth or bricks great part of which are grown over with a thin coat of a mossy green the common consequence of stagnated air or water  there are two assemblyrooms but neither of them commodious elegant nor neat one set of the public rooms are upon the side of the pantiles or bricked walk the windows are not more than breasthigh from the ground without either curtain or shutter and on a public night the gentry while dancing and many of them whimsical sickly figures being exposed to the vulgar eye are often joined in the laugh against them by their own servants while they are peeping through the windows at their masters and mistresses  the visitors of this place are for the most part peevish old maids or bloated old dowagers who will now and then bring a frisky young tit or two along with them in order to keep them out of harms way as they call it many of whom have often been scented thither by the hibernian foxes that have been by habeas corpus unkennelled a while from the kings bench or fleet prisons and who have often taken advantage of the old hens going to roost in order that they may have an opportunity of running away with the fattest of her chickens  of what quality the mineral springs of this place may be is best known to the diplomatist who for his own sake may have analyzed them or the credulous invalid who may have been complaisant enough to drink them but we are told as every quack says of his nostrum they are good for all diseases  as we approach the grave we begin to respect the church like those who on a journey are in fear of a storm from the threatening clouds that surround them make way to the first inn for shelter which in all probability they might have passed had they not been in apprehension of some danger from this principle i presume the chapel was built so near the well that when they had filled their stomachs with the springs from the rock they might improve it by the spirit of divinity and by mixing it make it into a kind of religious grog  hence it is that the chapel is visited every day about eleven oclock but whether from the love of the gospel the fear of their souls or respect to custom will be hard to determine yet true it is that few pay a regular attention to this seat of devotion but those who are on the verge of a grand climacteric  the good minister as a reward for his labors is under the necessity of submitting to the painful alternative of leaving a beggingcard for subscriptions at the rooms and libraries when a physician administers to a patient with only a bodily complaint he demands his guinea in cog but when a minister of the gospel has been holding out his comforts to the soul is it not grievous that all the world are to be told that he is in want of a shilling and that he will thank you for whatever trifle you may bestow on him tell it not at home tell it not abroad lest the daughters of the jacobins rejoice  if those devotees who from fear seem to pay so much respect to their souls had a respect to the holy cloth they would surely raise an established stipend to prevent a gentleman of that description from blushing  there is a playhouse here it is very small but often well attended it may appear the more so because a few people will make a full house for when you are in it you feel as if the actors and actresses were tumbling into your lap and they are generally of that description which are seen best at a distance the mistress of this company is named baker who has been in the theatrical oven so long that she is become crusty whenever you ask her a civil question  the late countess of huntingdon built a methodist chapel near mount misery a place so named overlooking the town and many a miserable creature of that deplorable place is seen upon his knees in it imbibing the enthusiasm and frantic doctrines of the chosen few who roar and stare the ignorant into a belief of whatever they may please to say  a methodist sermon versified my sisters and brothers who hither come crying whose practice is nothing but swearing and lying is it heaven you seek  your journey pursue you will never get there  i will

with a flea in his ear there are two other mounts in the same direction one called mount ephraim the other mount sion but were you to ask why they are called so it would be a difficult matter to learn the houses upon these mounts are handsomely built and pleasantly situated some of them the summerresidence of eminent families others boarding or lodginghouses for the same description of people  east of the town on the side of a rising hill are very elegant villas embowered with stately groves forming a sufficient residence for people of the first fashion something similar to the houses and groves in the upper part of hampstead near london there are few accommodations for the middling kind of his majestys subjects here except those in the lower town which are intolerably bad and extravagantly dear they are chiefly on the left hand as you enter the pantiles from the london road parallel to the shops or rather sheds for there are few of them that are much larger than a goodsized stagecoach most of these shops are miserably furnished and poorly attended in respect to customers and though they lie in the low part of the old town yet the lodginghouses for people of a scanty fortune are still situated in a declivity from them generally full of ragged noisy children their back views are into a dirty brook which divides the counties of kent and sussex  here if you should wish to look out in order to regale yourself with the breathings of the morning air your ears are perpetually annoyed with the grunting of pigs and your nose with the essence of their sties  every article of life is uncommonly dear and there is a difficulty of getting your food dressed unless you should take up your quarters in an inn and there your head is made to ache and your pocket lightened in the space of fourandtwenty hours and it is a doubt if by that time you do not begin to contemplate a retreat for the sake of your peace and a respect to your purse  there are two libraries one at each end of the promenade that near the pump is very small but neat the other is a long slip of about four feet deep exposed to the open air without a window  something like to the front of a fishmongers shop in london  the rides about the wells are more pleasant than numerous that to beyhamabbey is well diversified with rural objects it is about seven miles from the wells standing in an extensive and beautiful meadow skirted round with woods many of which have walks cut through them and enchanting labyrinths with here and there a seat in the shade which has been erected for an hospitable purpose to accommodate the weary traveller whose curiosity might have led him that distance in order to gratify his eyes with so voluptuous a scene  the ruins are the most picturesque and kept in the best state and perfection of any romantic pile of that description in england they are lofty and from what is left of them which is very considerable there is a display of much gothic elegance the stately ailes where once the holy priests their slow processions led and veiled virgins in seraphic strains have sung their pious orgies to their makers praise are now unroofed the marble pavement is gone and in its stead a level mossy walk while up the walls the creeping ivy climbs and various flowers adorn the important base the only occupants are now the blinking owl and fluttering bat  along the meadows and before the familyhouse which is inhabited by part of the camden family meandring runs a wide and clear refreshing stream adding greatly to the tranquil scene the whole of these delectable domains belong to the above family in the winter when all the rest of the feathered tribe are silent grown the robin redbreast on some jutty of this ancient pile will often perch and sing his christmas carrol to the jolly rustic huddled round his fire and drinking down his horn of wholesome ale  one summers evening when i had been for many hours gratifying myself with exploring these sweet romantic scenes i sat me down on the root of an old tree and wrote the following lines  ye that groan beneath the weight of dissipation pride and state condemned to walk through lifes parade at rout or drum or masquerade ye that fain would pleasure find led by fortune ever blind come and sit along with me come and taste tranquillity or if chased by sallow care would you shun the hag despair would you cheerful health restore when advice can do no more seek the fresh reviving breeze or the fanning of the trees come and sit along with me come and taste tranquillity ye that feel the pangs of love come and murmur with the dove shun the false ungrateful maid seek the sweet sequestered shade let her never behold thy grief time ere long will bring relief come and sit along with me come and taste tranquillity ye that languish to regain a breaking heart or racking brain driven by fortune or by fate to a wild or frantic state or moping wander like a loon dreading often the wayward moon come and sit along with me come and taste tranquillity tunbridgewells are thirtyfive miles from london lying partly in kent and partly in sussex the posttowns are bromley sevenoaks and tunbridgetown  brighton or brighthelmstone brighton has less diversity than margate and less tranquillity than tunbridgewells but i believe it is visited by more nobility than either of the foregoing places this may proceed from the heir apparent making it his summer residence for the eagles and the hawks for ever gather round the highest rocks  brighton is like a beggars coat which as he grows fat by being too well fed by his neighbors becomes too little for him so that in order to make it fit the better he sometimes finds occasion to let it out and patches it with different cloths which being mostly new disgraces the old it was formerly an insignificant fishing town the natives were merely amphibious and to this day they retain much of their original quality  there is nothing here to arrest the travellers attention but the princes pavillion which is more a temporary convenience for the summer than a splendid object of admiration  the houses in general are alternately high and low new and old handsome and ugly through the town there is a baldness in the whole and nothing to relieve the eye take it in whatsoever point of view you may  the sea presents one continued sameness divested of the almostperpetual moving scene which shows itself to the spectator at margate from the multiplicity of shipping of all descriptions sailing so near the shore to and from the downs and to different parts of the coast at brighton you have only a few fishing boats or now and then a vessel of consequence will present itself to you in the offing at four or five leagues distance which is descried only by the aid of a telescope and then you scarcely are able to ascertain her rate or burden or to what kingdom she belongs  the water is strongly impregnated with the particles of salt very pure and clear but it is often comfortless and sometimes dangerous to the bather nor can he at all times indulge himself with a dip the shore running so shallow and the waves so high that should a northwest wind blow briskly in which is often the case he is obliged to relinquish all idea of bathing or should he even be standing upon the beach or cliff he will find it necessary sometimes to retreat  the stayne was once a pleasant lounge enough before it was encircled with houses and had a view of the hills and cornfieldsd contiguous to it but now it is confined the air impeded and the rural effect it once possessed is lost  there is a nuisance which ought long ago to have been removed from a proper respect due to the elegant society that visit here especially as that society has ever been considered the support of the whole neighborhood this nuisance is the fishingnets which are daily spread from one end of the stayne to the other so that the company while walking are frequently tripped up by entangling their feet and if any of the barbarians to whom the nets belong should be standing by you are sure to be reprobated and insulted for what you cannot avoid  but this they pretend to say is a privilege which they possess if it be so it is a shame that they do not relinquish it in order to make the only promenade they have more agreeable to their best friends who if they were to desert the place from being too frequently annoyed might leave to the inhabitants the advantage of enjoying their privileges and going without bread at the same time  the fellows who persist in this privilege as they call it seem to possess it more from the principle of audacity than justice or necessity for were they to take their nets to a piece of ground which lies about two hundred yards from the stayne the evil would be removed but there seems to be a brutal obstinacy in their tempers and an idleness in their habits which prevent them from showing one particle of gratitude even to those to whom they owe their whole existence  should you ride out you have little shade the only places in this neighborhood that are adorned with a tree more than ten feet high are preston and whiting two villages which lie in a dale the first is one and the other two miles lying behind the town on the road to shoreham the rest of the rides are chiefly over the downs to the devils dyke to jews to ratten or rottendean  the latter of these places is on the seaside four miles east of brighton they have two or three machines there and lodginghouses and many make it their bathing place but it is a poor ragged unpleasant village divested of almost every convenience void of society and only fit for the valetudinarian  brighton has two libraries neither of them splendid but well situated where there is ever more talking than reading unless it be the newspaper and that is frequently seized with as much avidity as if you were playing at the game of snapdragon  the market here is not very well supplied and there is generally a great paucity of provisions which in point of price run extravagantly high fruit is very scarce and very dear like the lodgings and if any body should have an advantage in respect to marketing it is the native inhabitants who make a tolerable market of the london gulls which go down to visit their coast  they have a theater here in a good situation and not badly built the performers like all others forming these kind of companies are possessed of very moderate talents now and then a star of superior luster and magnitude to the common twinklers in the theatrical hemisphere will stroll from the capital and draw a few people together for a night or two but it is rarely that they do more  but brighton is not a place for encouraging amusements of this kind the tragic or the comic muse or their midwives the players who bring their bantlings to light have little attraction here the chequered dies of mercury and the midnight revels of the deluding venus engage the kind of company that frequent this place many do it from propensity others from fashion and imitation and they are seldom at a loss for an example  the assemblyroom is capacious elegant and well situated the lustres are uncommonly brilliant and the ornamental fancies judiciously conceived on viewing the external part of this room the mind becomes prejudiced until you explore its interior beauties for from an outside view it presents to the eye an unfavourable aspect like that of a welllooking barn ornamented with a set of handsome windows  the equinoctial winds when they blow high from a northwest point produce a tremendous and formidable sea so that many of the houses on the cliff have been often considered in danger from the waves which will sometimes overtop them and distribute the spray of the ocean all over the stayne  brighton is in the county of sussex there are two roads to it and the posttowns from london are epsom darking horsham steyning and so on to brighton this road is sixty miles  the other road is through sutton riegate crawley and cuckfield  this to brighton is only fiftytwo miles and a half  while a visitor at brighton i was entreated by a friend at bath who had heard much of its beauties to give him a true idea of it in rhyme accordingly i sent him the following verses  you say you fain would wish to hear what great inducements we have here that coaxes all our courtiers down and half depopulates the town like bath you think our streets are fine our squares and crescents all divine you think our hills and vales produce the pomegranate or nectar juice in rhyme you wish me to relate the wonders of its present state tho youre a critic yet i will try to give it you in poetry this town or village of renown like london bridge half broken down few years ago was worse than wapping scarce fit for human soul to stop in but now like to a wornout shoe by patching well the place will do you would wonder much i am sure to see how it is berammd with quality here lords and ladies often carouse together in a tiny house like joan and darby in their cot with stool and table spit and pot and what in town they would despise his lordship praises to the skies but such the ton is such the case you will see the first of rank and place step from his carriage all profuse duck at his doorway like a goose the humble beam was fixed so low perhaps to teach some clown to bow the air is pure as pure can be and such an aspect of the sea as you perhaps never saw before from off the cliff of any shore on one hand ceres spreads the plain and on the other over the main a bark majestic sometimes laves far distant on the buoyant waves the hills all mantld over with green a friendly shelter to the stayne whenever the rugged boreas blows arrayed in hyperborean snows such is the place and situation such is the reigning seat of fashion little hampton little hampton is a small bathing place twenty five miles on the sussex coast west of brighthelmstone four miles from arundel and fifty nine from london there are a few small lodging houses erected here and a machine or two the houses are at a considerable distance from the sea as if the builders were aware of their being washed away some time or other by the turbulent tides and it seems to be no improper caution  there is but one house of public refreshment and that is built upon a kind of sandbank approaching so near the waters side that many have been apprehensive lest the tides should make an unmannerly attack and the bearded neptune break into their room while they were enjoying themselves over their meal  it seems to be an unpleasant kind of place fit only to inspire melancholy in a contemplative mind but to a dull indifferent being blessed with apathy or one that can gratify himself over his glass of grog his pipe of tobacco or his mug of ale it may do well enough as he may stupify himself with the one and go to sleep over the other without interruption  bognar bognar is another and the last new established watering place on the sussex coast seventy two miles west of little hampton by the way of arundel and chichester it lies seven miles south of the last mentioned city and seventy from london through guildford godalmin and midhurst  this is an extensive village of brickbuilt palaces newly erected but little inhabited a favorite speculation of sir richard hothams it is a desirable spot and like a well compiled newspaper in lack of customers is only wanting to be read so bognar is only wanting to be seen there is a good hotel and small assemblyroom near the ocean which presents itself to you with the same kind of aspect as when you are at brighton  it appears at present merely calculated for the superior sort of society and as there is often a peculiar shyness in them from pride in respect to rank and etiquette they seldom associate or are they seen together the want of which makes it appear for ever desolate and throws a shade of melancholy over the whole neighborhood  were there a few humbler habitations built for a middling race of his majestys subjects it might be a consideration worth attending to it would add life to the scene by furnishing it with moving objects whereas those which are there at present whether it be from pride or as if they were ashamed to be looked at sit brooding in their chambers at home all day or if they venture abroad they huddle and curtain themselves up invisibly in their carriages  southampton southampton is an incorporated town and may be said to be situated in the garden of hampshire its approach from winchester is unparalled by any other town or city in england it is handsomely built the streets well paved and flagged of no inconsiderable extent of great antiquity and generally appears very lively from its internal trade and navigation the environs are beautiful and the rides about it numerous  the assemblyroom is handsome but inferior to those of brighthelmstone and margate yet it is pleasantly situated in respect to its view to the water the new forest and the isle of wight but its approach is entangled with little zigzag streets and to those in carriages in the night it is sometimes dangerous the rooms are in the hands of a very respectable man and it is a pity there could not be contrived a more agreeable access  there is a theater also a small one which is generally better attended than those at any other summer wateringplace it has been in the hands of its present proprietors many years who have carried it on with that level uniformity which has got them the confidence of the company who yearly visit southampton bakers library is in the center of high street well furnished with books and well attended by customers himself as well as family who preside in the library are more intelligent attentive and obliging than most that you will meet with in that profession  there is an excellent market well supplied but in the watering season every article of life is extremely dear although well furnished with fish yet they keep up the price so shamefully high that none but those who are possessed of good fortunes can gratify themselves with a dish of it without its going against their stomach by thinking of the price while they are making a meal  the bathing here is safe and the mode decent in the manner of a cold bath built close to the waters edge which is filled and emptied every tide but there are no machines  the polygon is composed of eight very noble and elegant built houses at an equal but convenient distance from each other forming a rotundity it is about a quarter of a miles distance from the town stands high and so contrived that every house has a variety of prospect  the favorite ride is to netleyabbey and its neighbourhoood being about two miles and a half from southampton standing near the beach of the same arm of sea which runs up to southampton the ruins are ancient venerable and extensive and form so picturesque a scene that many gentlemen of the pencil have exercised their talents by taking a copy and published it to the world  some years ago being excited to ramble from southampton to this mouldering pile alone where contemplation full many an hour battens on the solemnity of the scene ruminating on its present and its former state i left it and wandered toward the sea where i perceived a single sailor with seemingly an agitated mind his arms were folded while he walked impatiently to and from a large basin of water which had been left by the tide sometimes he would look into it significantly and sigh then turn away from it again beating his forehead with an uncommon emotion by his manner conceiving him in distress my apprehensions were such as led me to an idea there could be no impropriety in my addressing myself to him lest his mind should be driven to that state of despair which might excite him to commit some act of violence upon himself  on my accosting him he soon made me acquainted with his disorder by giving me to understand that he came from southampton and had been in the neighborhood of netleyabbey in quest of a man who had borrowed some money of him some time ago and pointing to the house said he could not find him at home that he was under the necessity of being at cowes in the isle of wight or that he should be disgraced by not going on board the vessel he belonged to according to his appointed time that he had spent all the little money he brought in his pocket from cowes at a public house in southampton where he had been some days that they retained his duds as he called them which he afterward gave me to understand were his clothes and had turned him out of his quarters after he had spent his last penny in the house in a most ungrateful manner and with much shameful abuse said that he only owed them sixteen pence halfpenny and that was the reason why they had stopped his duds that the man he came in quest of had borrowed two shillings of him but that he was gone to the lord knows where  he told his story with such earnestness with such simplicity and apparent truth that i presented him with half a crown he then looked in my face with a degree of astonishment and with an enquiring countenance said do you know me i assured him that i did not not know me replied he again and give me half a crown why i never met with such a thing in all my life what could you see in my face to do me such a favor as this i told him he was a poor sailor seemingly in distress that had buffeted the billows in tempestuous nights when such people as me were sleeping safe in their beds on shore and that it was by such men as him that our coast was safely guarded from the common enemy  then with tears rising into his eyes he cried god bless ye give a poor man your hand and believe me when i tell you that were you at sea with me in an engagement and that i could see a ball making toward you to do you a mischief d  n my heart if this hand which you have relieved should not stop it or lose its place he then gave me such a hearty gripe by the hand as to almost make my fingers crack and took his leave bestowing many blessings on me and saying i will now go to master burleyface my landlord pack up my poor duds and give the old heathen a rowland for his oliver  this incident pressed so strongly on my mind that when i returned to my friends who were at the star inn southampton i told them of the scene in question and while they were playing a game at draughts sat myself down and wrote the following song  should it possess any degree of merit that merit is due to me who wrote it and i should not have been led to this comment had not public report frequently bestowed that merit upon another man who does not deserve it whose trade is only writing songs in bad english and singing them with a worse voice is it to be supposed that there is only one man in the world that can write a song it might as well be thought that there was no other river that produced fish but the thames  the disconsolate sailor when my money was gone that i gained in the wars and the world gan to frown at my fate what mattered my zeal or my honored scars when indifference stood at each gate the face that would smile when my purse was well lined showed a different aspect to me and when i could naught but ingratitude find i hied once again to the sea i thought it unwise to repine at my lot or to bear with cold looks on the shore so packed up the trifling remnants i would got and a trifle alas was my store a handkerchief held all the treasure i had which over my shoulder i threw away then i trudged with a heart rather sad to join with some jolly ships crew the sea was less troubled by far than my mind for when the wide main i surveyed i could not help thinking the world was unkind and fortune a slippery jade and i vowed if once more i could take her in tow i would let the ungrateful ones see that the turbulent winds and the billows could show more kindness than they did to me southampton is in hampshire seventyfive miles southwest of the capital the post towns are brentford stains bagshot farnham alton alresford winchester and southampton winchester is well worth the attention of the antiquarian it is twelve miles from southampton many make it a mornings ride in order to explore that venerable city and generally find themselves amply compensated for their trouble  lymington lymington is about twenty miles west of southampton by redbridge and lindhurst lying in the new forest it is a little incorporated town with a little body and a little town hall which is made use of to little purpose but should the company who go there to bathe wish to make use of it for a ball or a concert this little corporation like the dog in the manger generally makes a great deal of fuss about it the ride from southampton to lymington is over as good a piece of road and through as pleasant a part of the country as any in england which is a stronger incentive to the visitors of lymington than any thing else and from the little time they stay there it appears to be the only one for they seem to go back as soon as they can in order that they may have the opportunity of going the same piece of ground over again  the baths are nearly a mile out of the town through a ragged neighborhood and a wretched road and when you get there the manner of bathing is the most uncomfortable and the water less salutary than it should be from being mixed with the freshes and the springs that incorporate themselves with the seawater  weymouth this royal watering place has nothing to recommend it but its convenience in respect to bathing no ride no object but that sterile rock the isle of portland no walk but the esplanade which has no variety in point of view but is one straight line of rubbish thrown up from the level as a kind of barrier to prevent the town from being overwhelmed by a more than ordinary tide  gloucesterlodge where the royal family reside is before you enter the town nearly in the front of the bay the hotel is on a line with the lodge and has a small assemblyroom which is conveniently situated for a place of that kind but a man must be very well situated in respect to circumstances who wishes to make it his home the person who keeps it was for many years the master of the bedford arms in covent garden in london a house that has been of great notoriety time out of mind venerum excitatus  the inhabitants devise different ways to amuse and accommodate his majesty one furnishes a splendid library not only with a superabundance of books but with all the trinkets of bond or cockspur streets over which he builds a spacious room purposely for a sovereignlounge or for secret councils but this overardent zealot being too civil by half has unfortunately been obliged to lounge off to another part of the kingdom without being thanked for his pains and with this reflection at his heels  who is to blame  another has built a magnificent bath at the expense of five hundred pounds on the plan of royal accommodation likewise but this has also proved a wrong speculation for the sovereign complimented the builder with taking a single dip gave him five guineas told him the water was not sufficiently impregnated with the sal mare which is generally believed to be the case therefore the projector like an injudicious tailor who officiously wishes to furnish a gentleman with a new coat of a peculiar and fashionable cut without paying a proper attention to the quality of the cloth has met with the mortification of having it returned upon his hands this circumstance no doubt has set a whispering censure on foot in respect to his majesty not making a general use of the bath as the projector had signified that it was built for a royal purpose but the truth is he was never consulted in the business and if he had would certainly have made himself master of the defects and told the man to have spared himself the trouble and to have kept his money in his pocket  when the royal family make their first entrance into weymouth every summer season the inhabitants out of compliment cover the pavement with small pebbles from the sea shore which has generally the effect of endangering your eyes or breaking the parlourwindows of all the houses in the street for as the party is mostly numerous and the horses driven along at a furious pace their hoofs tipping the pebbles before them make them fly as thick as hail and as sharp almost as a small bullet shot from a pistol  yet notwithstanding all the apparent zeal of the natives of weymouth one would think they in reality did not care a straw for the royal visitors otherwise these gothamites if they truly wished to make their sovereigns entrance easy would have bestowed a bundle or two of the above commodity for the sake of his family their friends eyes their neighbors windows and the general safety of his majestys subjects being thrown into this situation once myself with my head uncovered like an obedient subject i was under the necessity of turning my back upon my betters for the sake of saving my face it was at a time when i had an idea of addressing his majesty in respect to my father being the author of god save great george our king i had no evil in my mind like macbeth yet   the very stones  seemed to prate at my where about for they rose from the pavement in such vollies and pelted me hip and thigh at such a rate that i could not help bringing to mind that passage in the scriptures where it is said  i asked for bread and he gave me a stone  as it has been whispered abroad nay even given in print that an annuity of two hundred pounds per annum had been bestowed on me in consequence of my father being the author of god save great george our king i think it a duty incumbent on me to acquaint the world that no such consideration has ever yet transpired yet i must beg that my readers will give me leave to introduce a few lines on this subject  in spite of all literary cavil and conjectural assertions there has not yet appeared one identity to invalidate the truth of my fathers being the author of the above important song some have given the music to handel others to purcell some have signified that it was produced in the time of charles i others in james i and some in their slumbers have dreamed that it made its appearance in the reign of henry viii it might as well have been carried still further back to the wicked reign of saul or the wiser one of songsinging solomon the son of david  i have heard the late mr pearce galliard an able counselor in the law and a colleague of my fathers who died some years ago at southampton assert time after time that my father was the author of god save the king that it was produced in the year fortyfive and six another friend presented it to me in its original state bound up with a collection of songs for two and three voices set to music by mr handel dr blow mr leveridge dr green mr eccles mr lamp daniel purcell mr corfe and henry carey printed in the year    0 for john johnson opposite bow church in cheapside it precedes another song of my fathers beginning with  he comes he comes the hero comes  sound sound your trumpets beat your drums etc but for the satisfaction of my readers i will insert the song of god save great george our king as it is printed in the original text where it is called a song for two voices and runs thus  god save great george our king long live our noble king god save the king send him victorious happy and glorious long to reign over us god save the king ii o lord our god arise scatter our enemies and make them fall confound their politics frustrate their knavish tricks on him our hopes we fix god save us all iii thy choicest gifts in store on him be pleased to pour long may he reign may he defend our laws and ever give us cause to sing with heart and voice god save the king iv lord grant that marshal wade may by thy mighty aid victory bring may he sedition hush and like a torrent rush rebellious scots to crush god save the king every one who has read the history of the scotch rebellion in      will remember that marshal wade was a commander of great and eminent ability employed by our government to repel the factious spirit of the caledonians who were hostile to this country at that time and invaded many of the northern parts of this island  the following letter of the ingenious dr harington of bath strongly corroborates the authenticity of my fathers being the author of the song in question hearing that he was in possession of this piece of information i entreated him to make it known to me which he politely and readily acquiesced in saying sir the anecdote you mention respecting your father being the author and composer of the words and melody of god save great george our king is certainly true that most respectable gentleman mr smith my worthy friend and patient has often told me what follows viz that your father came to him with the words and music desiring him to correct the bass which mr smith told him was not proper and at your fathers request he wrote down another in correct harmony  mr smith to whom i read your letter this day the   th of june repeated the same again his advanced age and present infirmity render him incapable of writing or desiring to be written to but on his authority i pledge myself for the truth should this information prove in the least advantageous to yourself it will afford the most sincere satisfaction and pleasure to  sir your most obedient servant w harington bath june   th      ps my curiosity was often raised to enquire after the author before mr smith related the above and i was often misinformed mr smith says he understood your father intended this air as part of a birthday ode or somewhat of that kind however this might be no laureat nor composer has furnished the world with any production more complimentary or more popular which must ever be the consequence of concise elegance and natural simplicity  this mr john smith was friend and assistant to mr handel many years       surely the foregoing letter wears the complexion of truth and yet either from envy or rigid skepticism it has been held out by many as a master of doubt without one feasible authority or circumstantial argument that could render it so  however many of my friends being convinced of the infallibility of dr haringtons letter and referring to the material and provident aid the song had often yielded to the king and state in every critical situation when lurking sedition had caused loud and dangerous murmurs to be daily heard in every house and every street threatening defiance to the sword of justice and her wise established laws spurning at majesty on his road to meet his mobinsulted senate or annoying him in his public pleasures yet has the wavering subject been often called back to his original duty to his king and the harsh and clamorous voice of anarchy lulled into a calm by this divine this popular and national hymn  reflecting on its utility without assuming a claim i thought there could be no harm in endeavoring through some medium or other to make myself known at windsor as son of the author of god save great george our king and as great families create great wants it is natural to wish for some little relief accordingly i was advised to beg the interference of dr  residing not far from the castle and who is for ever seen bowing and scraping in the kings walks that he would be kind enough to explain this matter rightly to the sovereign thinking it was not improbable but that some consideration might have taken place and some little compliment bestowed on the offspring of one who had done the state some service but alas no sooner did i move the business with the greatest humility to this demi canon but he opened his mouth as wide as a fourandtwenty pounder bursting as loudly upon me as the largest piece of ordnance with his chin cocked up like the little center figure with his cauliflower wig in bunburys country club exclaiming sir i do not see because your father wrote the song of god save the king that the king is under any obligation to his son i could have said knowing him to be a man of the church had he not been in his own house that private as well as public obligations were hereditary and ought never to be forgotten and where there is a propinquity of blood it should not be suffered to rest lingering in the veins for want of that physical assistance gratitude  surely no one will say that there is any thing unchristianlike in this mode of arguing i am convinced there is justice in it and there is much justice in religion they are engrafted and grow from the same stock in respect to myself i may have by and by to say like cardinal wolsey that  i am weary and old left to the mercy  of a rude stream that must for ever hide me yet at the day of retribution the gates of mercy may be as freely thrown aside to me as those that are canopied stalled and pampered up in a golden litter battening on the fattest fodder or harnessed in all the costly trappings of a priest who now and then may stay his impatient hour and saddle the state with an incumbency of fourteen or fifteen hundred pounds per annum for sitting dummy in a cathedral  i am convinced had my plea been fairly stated at the queens lodge i should have had a princely answer but the royal door perhaps like jaffiers was dammd up not with starving creditors but clamorous petitioners backed with such irresistible influence that there was nothing to be done for me such as great mens butlers valets footmen and coachmen and an infinity of waiting and chamber maids with whom their noble masters and mistresses had run in debt from year to year to a considerable amount therefore were under the necessity of throwing them on the public by thrusting them into the treasury the waroffice the customs etc many of whom doubtless had been for some time at their evening schools from lack of education or so long at cross purposes and the habit of making a mark that it was found necessary in order that they might be endowed with the ability of signing their names and when they had the honor of being ushered into a place of four or five hundred a year they might do it legibly nay even pimps and panders might have been on the list who had followed their libidinous lords through every scene of debauchery and extravagance from the days of puberty to those of listless imbecility  but kings like clowns have played at blindmans buff ere now and like fortune indiscriminately held out their hands to every lout that chance has pushed into their way  notwithstanding all impediments should justice for ever wink and fortune turn her back die when i may i will die with my old familyprinciples which are to adore my god honor my king revere my country and admire the constitution  weymouth and melcomb regis are so contiguous to each other as to be only divided by a narrow river and are often considered as one place but neither of the towns are of much consequence in respect to buildings situation or wealth there is no public place of refreshment but the great hotel that is worth notice or where you get attention  should you visit the isle of portland which lies about two miles from weymouth you may meet with some gratification but not without much fatigue and when you have ascended about a mile into this island you will be surprised to meet with a neat and not inelegant hotel well supplied with every comfortable article for the table the inhabitants of this rock look wholesome and generally clean the men robust the women fair and stout their children often beautiful they have peculiar customs of their own live peaceably with each other and not being subject to all the laws that the rest of the kingdom is perhaps this may be the principal reason of their living in such an envied state of tranquillity  it is reported of them by the people of weymouth that the men and women marry only among themselves that they are bedded first but if in a certain time no fruitful signs should happen to appear in the woman they part and both look out for another mate  there is a well built new church situated on the highest part and in the center of the island and a vast number of neat grave stones with a great variety of whimsical and affectionate epitaphs  it is worthy observation that the stones which are blown up by the miners on the very summit of the rock much higher from its extensive base than the cross of st pauls in the city of london is from the foundation of the church yet those very stones are impregnated with thousands of shells of various shapes and sizes  there is a theater in weymouth which is frequently honored with the attendance of the royal family the performers are generally of a moderate description only fit to make the audience laugh by putting nature out of joint but when the manager is disposed to touch the royal heart to the quick he sends for a certain old favorite from covent garden who by cocking up his leg like a pantaloon toy or by grunting like a pig the whole house is thrown into convulsions almost so great as to bring on an apoplexy in the greater part of the audience  the theater is on a contracted scale built in the shape of a wigbox and not much wider this thing for it is difficult to give it a name is managed by one of the principal proprietors of sadlers wells  weymouth is in dorsetshire one hundred and thirty miles from london the posttowns are brentford stains bagshot basingstoke whitchurch andover salisbury blandford dorchester and so on to weymouth when the traveller arrives at salisbury it is worth his while to make a halt in order to take a survey of the most splendid gothic cathedral in england the close in which it stands is the most extensive kept in better order and is more attractive in respect to its shaded and well gravelled walks than is to be seen encircling any other structure of the kind in his majestys dominions many similar buildings in london as well as in the country are too often hid or huddled up and obtruded upon by insignificant and contemptible houses that prevent the spectator from taking a proper survey of the whole and take greatly away from the wished for effect  although not the best built yet there is not a town or provincial city in england that has such capabilities about it as salisbury the streets are laid out in regular angles wide and strait the ground level and they open every way like those in the parish of marybone in london all terminating with a view into the adjacent country which renders it airy and of course healthy the whole is nearly square and the marketplace is extensive neat and handsome and so judiciously concentrated that it stands contiguous to every habitation there is no where to be seen a marketplace situated to such an advantage where five or six wide streets open to it as inlets to the country people from every quarter and where no narrow lanes are seen with crooked sharp and dangerous turnings which often endanger the lives of his majestys subjects such as are to be found in norwich coventry leicester shrewsbury cambridge and many other towns throughout the kingdom all very deficient in respect to convenience  the new town hall erected by lord radnor is a stately edifice built with stone and is a great ornament to the city the canals perpetually running through almost every street pure clear and rapid streams are of peculiar advantage to the inhabitants who have always at hand that useful necessary of life to keep their houses clean or to carry away the dirt that consequently must be made in washing them  bath we now come to one of the most splendid cities for the size of it that we have to boast of it is difficult to begin or to point out the numerous beauties and elegancies of this place  the whole city is built with a cream colored stone the architect and the mason have equally here exercised their talents and indulged their fancies for thirty years past and have spread it over so much ground that could its former inhabitants rise from their silent dormitories they would lift up their eyes and hold up their hands with wonder  the squares the circus the great crescent and the minor ones which are numerous are of that magnitude and beauty as at once to delight and astonish the beholder  the new streets are commodiously wide and of vast extent great pulteneystreet lately built on the east side of avonbridge is perhaps except portlandplace in london not to be equalled in christendom this spacious street commences and concludes with a crescent which adds to its splendour it has the advantage of portlandplace in as much as it is built with beautiful stone and the different orders of architecture which have been uniformly observed through the whole street give it that magnificent effect which almost rivals every thing we have to boast of in respect to buildings  the new pumproom and the new street which faces it form a beautiful picture displaying on each side an elegant colonnade of considerable length leading down to the different baths the pumproom in question is not only an elegant but a stately structure and for the purpose to which it is appropriated not to be equalled any where  the lower assemblyrooms are handsome commodious and capacious but the upper ones surpass every thing of that kind in any town or city in the three kingdoms  the theater is handsome and its size properly adapted to the place but is fixed in a bad situation inconvenient to the greater part of the inhabitants and incommodious in regard to its approach it is said to be the best conducted theater in england and has furnished the capital with some of its most eminent performers  there is greater decorum and order observed in bath than in any other place the markets are the best supplied and conducted of any we can refer to being regulated by the mayor and corporation as well as the different apartments which are let at a stipulated price half a guinea each room no more nor less even in the very best lodginghouses having a colliary about eight miles from the city they are well supplied with coals from the advantage of the somersetshire avon a navigable river running through the bottom of the city and passing the mines they are not only the more easily conveyed but consequently rendered more moderate in respect to price  the cathedral is in the center of the city a grand gothic structure and presents a fine effect in point of object to the whole  the town hall is also a magnificent pile built with peculiar taste something similar to the vatican at rome standing in an advantageous situation and not far from the cathedral  the waters here have undoubtedly been of the most salutary effect in gouty as well as bilious cases we have perpetual instances of their rendering great relief to both  bath is as well paved flagged and lighted as london and has most of the pleasurable advantages of that great and extensive city within a much less compass it lies in a dale surrounded by high hills decorated with hanging woods prior park and its embellishments form a pleasing scene for the rambling eye while you are walking over the parades or passing along great pulteneystreet  there are very few walks of consequence in the vicinity of bath nor are there any rides but landsdowne and then you have to surmount a summit along the common road of nearly two miles high the downs being very bleak and cold in the winter from their eminent situation and hot in the summer from the chalky soil and want of shade render them no very desirable retreat for relaxation or exercise at any season of the year the only walk is that newly made continuing from the lower end of great pulteneystreet which adds greatly to its effect but being one straight line upon an ascent brings to mind the saying of  the king of france and twenty thousand men  went up a hill and then came down again   this is no reproach on the spirit or taste of the people who have made bath one of the most splendid cities for its size in europe but from its situation not having sufficient level meadowland to admit of an opportunity of displaying their taste by embellishing their city with every ornament in respect to sight and accommodations to the gratification of their visitors however they have taken care when we speak of it as a winter residence to make it a most enviable retreat  the city of bath is in somersetshire one hundred and eight miles from london the market or post towns through which you pass are brentford colnbrook maidenhead reading newbury hungerford marlborough devizes melksham and so on to bath  the inns which lie between london and bath in point of grandeur or elegance surpass every thing of the kind perhaps in the known world the castle at marlborough and its appurtenances comprise a palace fit to accommodate the first monarch in europe  the hot wells are two miles from the city of bristol and fourteen from bath they are in a vale through which the avon continues its course and forms a conjunction with the severn which divides the english and the welsh coasts and makes its way into the bristol channel  in getting to this place from bath you are under the necessity of running through a kind of gauntlet by going from one end to the other of one of the largest noisiest and most bustling cities except london in england but when you arrive at the wells the scene becomes calm and not unpleasant there are two sets of assemblyrooms which are made use of alternately lodgings are remarkably dear and so are all kind of provisions the more to be wondered at when we consider it is near so capital a city as bristol which lies in a very plentiful country and the markets supplied abundantly with all the comforts of the earth  the waters are rather warm and have a soft milky taste said to be of great effect in respect to disordered stomachs and consumptive habits many a melancholy object of the last description are too frequently seen here buoyed up with hopes of relief but display evident symptoms to the pitying beholder that they are sent there to take their last sublunary lounge  the bristol rocks commence from the wells and are arranged on each side for nearly two miles down the river which runs between them in a serpentine form st vincents rock is of a tremendous height impregnated with what is called the bristol stone and when the sun shines in a particular direction upon it while you are on the opposite shore this rock in many places appears as if it were decorated with so many little stars the whole presents a grand romantic scene  the reverberation of sounds from shore to shore are uncommonly distinct and i have heard a capital singer once upon a time in the celebrated song of sweet echo from this situation produce a greater and more delightful effect than ever was heard upon the stage the response was soft but correct in point of imitation  the rides here are numerous that over durdendowns to blazecastle in point of prospect is hardly equalled after you have made your way to the summit of the hills that overlook the wells you arrive at the village of clifton which in point of situation and building strikes the traveller with delight the stone of which these beautiful villas are built we are told was brought from bath the houses are arranged at that judicious distance from each other so as to admit of a considerable piece of pleasuregarden laid out with the greatest taste the foliage gives an admirable effect to what would otherwise be thought perhaps naked and deficient in respect to its completion  when you arrive at the downs you are parallel with the summit of the highest rocks and look down the awful depth into the winding avon many parts of the downs are defended with a stone wall in order that it may be less irksome to the timorous female when she is taking her ride of recreation there is a beacon built here as a seamark on the highest ground from whence you have a very extensive view across the severn to chepstow and the welsh mountains and while you enjoy the prospect you imbibe as pure an air as ever wafted over sod  from this situation on turning round you have a view of the extensive city of bristol which at that distance presents itself to you as a good object and when you come to examine its interior beauties on a closer point of view you will find that there are many things worth attention the churches are for the most part handsome well furnished and kept in the greatest preservation the cathedral has unfortunately suffered so much from intestine broils and savage war that there is but little of it left and that is only the inferior part but st ratcliffs church possesses all the elegance of gothic beauty in a perfect state  i could always wish to avoid every appearance of egotism in these sketches of different places for let it be observed that i am not writing a musical tour where ego sum is for ever staring you in the face in every line nor do i mean to calumniate any body of people whom i have stood before in public because they have not treated me with idolatry or that the whole corporation of a town has not met me with a trumpet and drum and every distinguished symbol of respect  should it be asked what i advert to in respect to this digression from the general idea of my plan i must beg leave to refer my readers to the sentiments of a certain singsong writer who while he was delivering his unparalleled productions through england and could not be admitted at cambridge because i was there abused the vice chancellor for not pushing me out of the town where i had been handsomely received and caressed for many preceding years  yet this fulsome egotist in his incongruous publication has been pleased to lug me into his muddy matter and set himself off by saying that the vice chancellor had not only refused him an opportunity of exercising his transcendent talents but had given that opportunity to another who stood in his way whose only merit was taking him off  if the few preceding lines should happen to be thought an obtrusion upon my readers i have to plead in my own behalf a propensity that almost all mankind possess that of retaliation yet where i to give a perfect imitation of him i do not think i could find a dye in all my compositions of coloring dark enough to paint him in his true complexion  but i will take my leave of this subject and make my way to st ratcliffs church where i was standing one day admiring its external beauties in company with a gentleman when we were accosted by an odd looking fellow from whose appearance we were at a loss to determine whether he was a jew or a christian he addressed us with good morning gentlemen you seem to be admiring that church it is a fine church i assure you opens every morning at eleven oclock and is worth your inspection you seem to be strangers here did you come upon business or pleasure gentlemen on acquainting him that we came upon business he obtruded farther on our patience by asking us if we were in the mustardway  this we were told by our friends afterward to whom we related the story was called touting a customer and though a whimsical mode was adopted by many of the lower order of mechanics by way of driving the nail as they call it and keeping up the spirit of trade  bristol is a large and opulent city filled with wealthy merchants and industrious tradesmen but it is thought its mercantile business has not flourished of late as it did some years ago having been rivalled by liverpool from what cause is not easily ascertained some have assigned it to the spirit of the people of liverpool others to the great superiority of that port in respect to the accommodation of vessels in their extensive docks and harbors  bristol hotwells are one hundred and twentytwo miles from london the posttowns through which you travel are the same as to bath  cheltenham cheltenham lies in the beautiful vale of gloucester in a rural situation and is a long narrow town nearly a mile in extent well paved lighted and flagged has a clean and bright appearance as you pass through it many of the houses being well built there are two assemblyrooms the upper one is remarkably neat and elegant the chandeliers and lustres peculiarly brilliant the rest of the apartments are very commodious and in unity with the whole pile these set of rooms were built by the worthy mr miller who may be said to be almost the father and establisher of cheltenham for it seems to have been the business of his life to lend a helping hand to every project that might facilitate its improvements and has certainly been a principal instrument in raising it to its present state of popularity  the lower rooms are handsome but inferior to the upper ones they are both rented by mr rook who conducts the whole with great propriety and keeps them in so neat and perfect a state that it gives a pleasing gratification to all who visit them  there is a theater here which is called a royal one for the manager had the honor of the kings visiting it when at cheltenham as he does that at weymouth  i wish it could be said of the theater as i have spoken of the public rooms in respect to their neatness and elegance but the cheltenham theater is deficient in both the house is small and uncomfortable lighted with about half a dozen of the commonest tallowcandles the stagelights as they are called present themselves to you as something in the shape of a long drippingpan and so scantily illuminated that one would suppose a few black and casual cinders had fallen into it and produced a blaze for it has that appearance to the eye and in respect to smell the nose will bear the eye a faithful evidence  the performers have the least salaries and consequently the least merit of any set i ever saw this may proceed from a depression of spirits for if an englishman has but little to eat he has little inclination to do any kind of business as it should be a man or woman who has only eight or nine shillings per week with the appendage often of a large family must summon up a considerable degree of philosophy indeed who can exercise their talents with any portion of reputation to themselves or satisfaction to an audience when so narrowed in their circumstances  the walks about this place have been taken a great deal of pains with in respect to their beauty and convenience they are well shaded and well gravelled which was judicious from the first idea because as it is only in the summerseason that cheltenham is visited the waterdrinkers have always a retreat from the glare and heat of the sun by retiring to the shade  the pumproom is about a quarter of a mile distant from the town the greatest part of which you are sheltered with tall embowering trees and on your turning round when you get to the well the church which has a handsome spire presents itself like a tall and stately obelisk terminating the north end of the grove  the earl of fauconberg has a charming residence here standing on a rising ground a little distance from the well from which he possesses a prospect of the malvernhills in worcestershire and greatest part of the extensive vale of gloucester his lordship with that complacency which does him credit as a man and honor as a nobleman throws open all his gates even to the threshold of his house for the accommodation of the indiscriminate company who may wish to lounge about his grounds  the taste of the waters of cheltenham resembles that which has been strongly impregnated with glaubers salts and has much the same effect upon those that drink them they are said to relieve an aching head clear an overcharged stomach and produce a good appetite  disorders naturally brought on by the mode of living the lack of rest and want of air in london and such do well to visit this lethe to the mind and comfort to the body who may be so circumstanced as to have it in their power to make it a temporary retreat in the summer  the markets are well supplied and the provisions in common are tolerably cheap considering it a place of pleasure  the regulation of the markets are attributed to mr moreau who for many years presided as master of the ceremonies at cheltenham and filled that situation with a great degree of reputation to himself and satisfaction to the company who frequented this place he is a gentleman of a liberal turn of mind of a good family and endowed with an education that constitutes him a man of letters but he is in a very bad state of health at present and visited with heavy bodily complaints which seem to weigh him to the ground  mr king is an irish gentleman who presides in the office of master of the ceremonies to the upper rooms at bath and officiates in that capacity now at cheltenham and should he conduct himself with the same degree of complacency as his predecessor he will deserve the same encouragement time will show  there are two libraries and that which is kept by harwood who is an old inhabitant is composed of a great collection of books and i believe many of them valuable ones i mean that library in the new buildings for he has one also in the high street the new room is very commodious handsomely built and well filled there is another kind of library but it is furnished with so heterogeneous an assortment of millenery perfumery powder and paste toys and trinkets that from its external appearance one is at a loss what to call it except it be the gossiping shop for there is a smirking wench or two that seem to attract the old and weakhammed debauchees who visit there for the sake of a little small talk and become customers for the sake of being flattered in their dotage the books which this library contains are chiefly of such as teem from the minervarian press but the only matter that seemed to be read while i was there was mostly the lie of the day where it was said one day that buonaparte was taken by the english and contradicted the next which is a political idea in the printer of a newspaper because it makes two paragraphs one day to give a false report as a truth and the next to give that report the lie but old time after all has set us to rights for we find the little bustling hero at last surrounded in jeopardy  the lodgings of this place are enormously dear and like those at tunbridgewells ill adapted to the middling sort of society not only extravagant in the extreme but shamefully deficient in point of accommodation the lower kind of inhabitants are as illiterate as laplanders and having the complexion of jews are generally as avaricious and hard in their dealings  the rides are various and well diversified with shade and rural villages but little water the roads are generally very bad the ride to dowdswell which lies four miles from cheltenham on the london road is the best and that elegant village is sheltered from east and northeast winds by hanging woods it is built upon a hill comprising only five or six handsome houses from which you have a most beautiful and extensive view of almost all the vale of gloucester over cheltenham the spires of the different villages peering over the tufted groves terminated with the stately and celebrated gothic tower of gloucestercathedral at the distance of about thirteen miles  once on a summers evening i had the pleasure and delight of seeing the setting sun take his leave and couch behind the malvern hills which are at an immense distance yet are seen from dowdswell the rays of light from the sun upon the clouds threw such a glow and solemnity upon the earth tinting it with so beautiful a variety that had there been but water to have finished the scene a judicious painter might have formed a picture equal to the best of claude lauraine  the village of presbury lies two miles on the north side of cheltenham to which you may better walk than ride and so secluded in orchards and other trees that one neighbor can hardly see anothers house from the redundancy of the foliage that surrounds it  here the wanderer will be surprised to find a neat hotel with almost every accommodation and a garden laid out with peculiar taste and fancy and which has had more pains taken with it than is generally to be met with in so circumscribed a spot a beautiful thatched grottohermitage decorated with shells and fossils of various kinds and displayed in the most ingenious manner small gothic windows with old painted glass the floor tessalated and different parts decorated with round unequal mirrors the whole is rendered the more impressive on the mind from the various and negligent shrubs that shelter it giving the interior part a solemn effect in this situation i could not help calling to mind a couple of lines in shakespeares as you like it  under the shade of melancholy boughs  loose and neglect the creeping hours of time   opposite to the back door of the house and on a terrace raised at the upper end of the garden is a chinese temple used as a tearom for company and round it an appropriate balcony sheltered by an awning from the top  there is also a tower or beacon at a little distance from the temple in which there is an octagon room remarkably neat where the lounger may refresh himself with tea or wine or whatever may suit his fancy  the proprietor having a botanical taste has taken care to display it by decorating the ground with great variety of flowers which diffuse their essence round you while you are regaling in the shade  cheltenham is ninetyone miles from london and the posttowns through which you pass are brentford colnbrooke maidenhead henley upon thames benson oxford witney burford northlech and so on by way of frogmill to cheltenham  should the traveller have time he would do well to spend a day or two in oxford where he would have an opportunity of exploring the beauties of one of the neatest cleanest and most magnificent gothic cities in europe  malvern wells the malvernwells are situated on the brow of that extensive range of lofty mountains commonly called the malvernhills in the county and about eight miles from the city of worcester  the waters here are said to be a chalybeate and are a kind of cordial for low spirits that the air is pure is natural enough as the wells lie so eminently high the prospects are beautiful and of vast extent reverting the view which you have from cheltenham to malvern by looking back again over the vale of gloucester from a northwest point  there is but one hotel at which the company generally dine together at one table but they are seldom numerous  those who have agility and strength enough to scramble up the mountains which from the base to the summit is supposed to be two miles will have a view of worcestershire gloucestershire herefordshire shropshire and the black mountains near brecknock in wales the three cathedrals of worcester gloucester and hereford are all seen from the same spot with the naked eye which lie in a kind of triangle nearly thirty miles distant from each other and at the season when the trees are in blossom in these cidercountries intersected with numerous hopgrounds they present a picture almost too voluptuous to describe when you look down upon them from this mountain  worcester is a handsome city great part of which is paved and flagged it stands on the banks of the severn over which is built a very handsome bridge  the cathedral is a stately gothic building which with the cloisters have lately been repaired at a vast expense the inside of both have the appearance of being newly built the whole of the cathedral has had a new pavement laid down the old monuments put in a good condition and that of bishop hough sculptured by rubiliac would be an ornament and is fit to be ranked among the best of that artists performances in westminster abbey  worcester is a hundred and eleven miles northwest of london through oxford woodstock chipping norton pershore etc malvernwells is eight miles from worcester on the road to hereford  riding near ledbury in worcestershire one rainy day upon a restive horse i had the misfortune to splash a poor young soldier all over who was on his furlough i was grieved at the circumstance and apologized to him the roads were deeply cut and dirty he had a heavy knapsack at his back and seemed much tired entering into conversation with him he told me he had played the fool to his own cost had rashly enlisted for a soldier in consequence of a little quarrel with his wife saying she was one of the best of women and that he had great reason to repent of his folly every day i pitied his situation bid him a good day sat down at the first inn upon the road and wrote the following song which i have heard mr dignum sing with great effect  the furloughed soldier i as i have plodded my way to some far country town full many a wearisome day my purse has contained but a scanty halfcrown and that has soon melted away ii often tired and sad on some wintry road with rain i have been wet to the skin of my knapsack grown tired i have sought for abode at some friendly good alehouse or inn iii i have hoped that good fortune in turning her wheel would cast me per chance on the place where the wound of my bosom would instantly heal at the sight of my sallys dear face iv she grieves for she knows how i am destined to roam on the strength of my furlough to rest and then she often wishes her allen at home to bury his cares in her breast about two years after on the same road in the winter time at a cottage near worcester being a spectator to an affecting but pleasing scene where a soldier had just returned from the continent of austrian flanders i was led to a combination of ideas thinking it might possibly have been the same young man which i saw near ledbury therefore was induced to invoke the muse to furnish me with matter for the same subject  the affectionate soldier i twas in the evening of a wintry day when safe returning from a long campaign allen oertoild and weary with the way came home to see his sally once again ii his battered arms he carelessly threw down and viewed his sally with enraptured eyes but she received him with a modest frown she knew not allen in his rough disguise iii his hair was knotted and his beard unshorn his tattered coutrements about him hung a tear of pleasure did his cheek adorn and blessings fell in torrents from his tongue iv am i so altered with this cruel trade that you your faithful allen have forgot or has your heart unto some other strayed ah why escaped i from the murdering shot v when this he spoke her wonted color fled she ran and sank upon her allens breast all pale awhile she looked like one that is dead he kissed she breathed and all her love confessed vi yes my delight though altered as thou art reduced by honest courage to this state thou art the golden treasure of my heart my long lost husband and my wished for mate having had for many years a wish to see the ancient and memorable town of ludlow in shropshire i took the opportunity when at worcester to make it in my circuit to buxton and was well requited for my trouble  whatever way you approach ludlow you find an ascent up to the market place which is in the center of the town the streets are wide and well built and opening to the four points of the compass east west north and south command different ways a variety of prospects  the castle stands upon a lofty hill seemingly much higher than that of windsor when you look down upon the college of eaton from the terrace it commands a most enchanting country but is in a state of ruin and the mouldering hand of time has given it a fantastic and magnificent effect  imagine yourself in the most favorite walk of kensingtongardens and that walk zigzagged down the side of a stupendous mountain shaded with embowering trees and as you peep through the different vistas the fertile valleys below and the distant hills present the most unrivalled landscapes such is the promenade at ludlow  the river gliding through the meadows near the base of the castle walls is clear and wide decorated with various kinds of shrubs a venerable bridge strides across the stream over which there hangs a high and shaggy promontory sheltering a watermill standing near to a line of dwarfy rocks that run from shore to shore impeding the hasty current the effect of which is hardly to be conceived the enraged river rushing furiously against its cross impediment rises above the common surface and in foaming surges overwhelms the obstructing ridge hurrying down the counterside with a tremendous roar forming a beautiful cascade like to another niagara or a mississippi the whole presenting as beautiful a natural picture to the eye as can be formed by the most creative imagination  the castle is said to be nearly half a mile in circumference i explored and could have wept at its interior delapidations this relic of grandeur was once the ancient habitation of king stephen and in various reigns the station where many a british worthy has placed himself in his courtly seat enjoying the splendor of his golden hours some might have felt as i did especially when they beheld the lofty topping towers mantled with pensive ivy threatening every wondering passenger whose veneration for the scene may have led him too near its precarious foundation or its opening sides  it was here king edward kept his crowded court at the time of the bloody struggles between the contending houses of lancaster and york it was from hence his sons the poor young edward prince of wales and richard duke of york were sent for by the tyrant richard and murdered in the tower of london here the great earl of pembroke lived and the illustrious and elegant sir philip sidney while within these walls in his hours of lucubration presented to the world that beautiful ornament to literature called the countess of pembrokes arcadia  here miltons comus was partly written and first performed in all its splendor by courtly actors attended by princely auditors the wood is still standing in the neighborhood of the castle where he laid the scenes for his important necromancer to exercise his fancy and riot in his revels  it was here that the witty but unfortunate butler even in the tower over the great gateway at the entrance of the castle wrote the greatest part of his hudibras the stately walls are now tumbling down and the spacious hall that once was decorated with a gilded roof and choicest hangings crowded with female beauty and with warriors bold is open now to the inclemency of the skies its garnished sides are all defaced but there is a mutability in all sublunary matters which only serves to tell us that time has no respect to persons or to things  buxton this place is generally very fashionably attended in the summer season it lies in the peak of derby the waters are said to render great relief to those patients who are afflicted with rheumatisms or spasms they are grateful to the taste and rather warm i had never an occasion to make use of the waters but the air produces a vigorous appetite  buxton is built chiefly of stone and was no more than a small village of great inns hotels and little public houses a few years ago but it has been considerably augmented many little dwellings being lately built have made it a town of more consequence the new crescent has given it a style and dignity which though it lies in a dell has raised it to that degree of respect as to excite the attention of all travelers it is built with stone and said to be as fine a piece of masonry as any thing we have to boast of being both elegant and extensive has a handsome piazza in the front the rest of the building is of the composite order in rainy weather and there is commonly more at buxton than at any other town in england except manchester the piazza is found a convenient shelter the people having it in their power to go from house to house without suffering from the liquid climate  the stabling is on a rising ground at the distance of about one hundred yards from the back part of the crescent between which there runs a rivulet that carries off every thing that might prove offensive from the stables which form a circus of great extent and are also built of stone the interior part is colonnaded round with a spacious ride in the center within the colonnade they have secured a shelter like to that in the crescent to prevent the grooms and other servants suffering from the rain while they are dressing the horses each of these pillars is cut out of one solid stone of about ten feet high and handsomely formed the coachhouses are on one side of the stables which are built in the same order and beauty and possess the same convenience the whole displaying the most uniform and extensive mews in the kingdom  the royal hotel is very commodious forming part of the crescent built on an extensive scale the rooms are handsome many of them elegant but the assemblyroom which is within the hotel is as finished in respect to symmetry and ornament both as to the mason and the upholdsterer as any that i ever remember to have seen  the hall was formerly the only house of accommodation and is yet fashionably attended being near the wells or pumproom at the end of the crescent the libraries here are small nor are there any shops that can boast of a respectable appearance there being no rooms of consequence or magnitude enough to display a variety of articles  there are two very large inns in the upper or high part of the town the white heart and the eagle which like those of the hall royal hotel etc in the lower town are made use of as boarding houses where the visitors in different parties mess together in the greatest harmony order and decorum and are seldom at a loss for the want of mental as well as bodily entertainment the charges are moderate considering the great variety of viands which are generally served up to the company  lodgings in private houses are of a very moderate kind and scarce there is no common market here so that butchers meat poultry and fish are very dear and fruit is sold at an enormous price being brought from a considerable distance for there is little vegetation about buxton the country round it is bald bleak and dreary has little foliage and bears a great resemblance to many parts of scotland the rides are not very pleasant there being no objects but naked hills and fruitless dales picturing one desolate scene often impressing the mind with melancholy  to gentlemen who go there on the plan of grouseshooting and more game it is well enough but the invalid who wishes to recreate himself with a mornings ride now and then had better confine himself to the purlieus of the crescent or the walks in the garden belonging to the hall  there is a little compact theater here made out of an old barn which has had much pains bestowed upon it and the interior so decorated that when you are in it you loose all idea of its original state it is usually kept very clean and well lighted the outside has also been so well furbished up as almost to make you forget its wonted rusticity i have seen good acting in this little theater when cook who used to perform in the manchester company has been there on a summers engagement  pooles hole is a subterraneous cavern about a mile from the crescent which from its entrance to its furthermost bounds is said to be six hundred feet and in which are many an excavated and lofty roof you are conducted through this place by a set of old women something resembling the witches in macbeth with small candles stuck between their greasy fingers  in some parts it is decorated with various colored spar which from the light of the candles often gives it a beautiful effect yet this is a visit of some danger for when you have been riding or walking on a summers day until you are warm the fatal chills have sometimes been attended with disagreeable consequences to the constitution by giving it a sudden check in many places there is the appearance of large rocks of ice which are continually kept wet and rendered slippery from the drizzling and petrifying springs which ooze from the roof  many of the rocks on your approach and which are only seen by the dim and imperfect light of a few halfpennycandles present themselves to you in various shapes one like a couching lioness another resembling an ancient regal throne which they have named queen elizabeths chair the whole is an epitome of that wonderful celebrated cavern called the devils peak near castleton and not far from the duke of devonshires magnificent seat in the same county  pooles hole is visited by most of the people who make a summers excursion to buxton and is well worth the observation of the curious being one of those very striking and sublime scenes in nature which seldom fail to gratify the eye as well as the mind  at the back of pooles hole on the brow of an extensive hill is a curious kind of village the dwellings are of a whimsical construction called the ashilocks or ashhillocks where there have been a number of limekilns which from the frequent rains have become a kind of mortar encrusted and hardened by the sun they are all hollow and the poor inhabitants have taken possession of them propped up the arched roofs with the strongset wooden piles and formed them into one two and sometimes three tenements under one roof with a small window to each some of them clean and not uncomfortable and wherein many of the inhabitants have brought up a numerous offspring  they have most of them prudently embanked up a sufficient portion of ground which they have levelled out before their doors where they often sit on a summers evening regaling with their brother rustics over a mug of ale some of these people have decorated the entrance of their cells with little arbours by planting such shrubs about their doors as will grow in that chalky heated soil  it is supposed that these huts contain two hundred souls at a distance the whole appears like a warren where the inhabitants run to and from each burrow like rabbits so that it may be called a burrow town without a corporation in point of situation being on a hill it has the advantage of buxton which is no bad object from it and the humble inhabitants have to boast of fates having placed them so much above their betters  buxton is one hundred and fiftynine miles and a half from london through barnet st albans dunstable newportpagnell northampton harborough leicester mountsorrel loughborough derby ashbourn and so on to buxton  matlock matlock i believe is visited more from the romantic pictures of nature which it displays than from the efficacy of its springs for here is a splendid scene indeed comprised within the space of two short miles which is soon explored and seldom retains a party for any length of time the visitors drop in here as butterflies would upon a beautifully colored flower which attracts them more from its gaiety than from its honied sweets  most minds revolt at the arrogance of an ignorant and overgrown innkeeper and here many have been disgusted from the same cause matlock has several hotels as they are pleased to call them and the guests are generally glad to get out of their inns as soon as they can who find it a common maxim with the hosts to make their friends who come to feast their eyes on these luxuriant scenes pay for their peeping  there is a boldness and a beauty at matlock not easy to be described it should be seen the objects are so refulgent that neither the pen nor the pencil can produce a true effect this village is enclosed between two lofty hills partly covered with hanging woods through which are often seen a ponderous rugged rock tufted with dwarfish shrubs sprung from the crannies wherein some alien seedling casually might have dropped and taken root the clear impetuous river hurrying down the steep with a formidable roar the oak the willow the ash and other trees stretching out their long expanded leafy arms midway over the stream forming a grateful cooling shade  sir richard arkwrights elegant mansion is contiguous to matlock and his grounds being handsomely laid out are a great attraction to every stranger  but there is a great draw back to all those pleasurable scenes both in respect to the eye and the ear from the manufactories which are built so near the bath  the eye is offended too frequently here from having the uniformity destroyed by two or three large red brick buildings standing on the margin of the clear and winding stream intruding upon the harmony of the prospect and disgracing the native coloring of the gray the grave and towering rock which has stood there from the creation of the world by having a neighbor obtrude itself so near its ancient precincts in the modern form of an extensive brickkiln  the ear is offended hourly by the rude or indecent speeches of the almost lawless manufacturers should they meet you in your walks or on your rides accosting you too often with shameful sentences of blasphemy or obscenity for the wonted simplicity of the rustic with his obedient nod has long been done away in this distracted country why is this wherefore shall we call it licentiousness or has the humble crawling worm conceiving itself too much oppressed embibed the poison of the envenomed adder and raising his ignoble crest resolved to show resentment to every imperious traveller who may chance to tread too heavily on the secret path under which he sleeps and wreathing from his crooked narrow cavern of repose gives his betters to understand that he is possessed of feeling or has he having been visited by the spirit of equality for ever taken leave of order and degree so truly necessary in society  if it be so the times are bad indeed shakespeare in his troilus and cressida has defined this matter more philosophically and to the purpose than any other writer saying   the heavens themselves the planets and this center observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthroned and spherd amidst the rest whose medcinable eye corrects the ill aspects of planets evil and posts like the commandment of a king sans check to good and bad but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander what plagues and what portents what mutiny what raging of the sea shaking of earth commotion in the winds frights changes horrors divert and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixure oh when degree is shakd which is the ladder of all high designs the enterprise is sick how could communities degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities peaceful commerce from dividable shores the primogeniture and due of birth prerogative of age crowns scepters laurels but by degree stand in authentic place take but degree away untune that string and hark what discord follows each thing meets in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters would lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe strength would be lord of imbecility and the rude son would strike his father dead force would be right or rather right and wrong between whose endless jar justice resides would lose their names and so would justice too then every thing includes itself in power power into will will into appetite and appetite an universal wolf so doubly seconded with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up itself matlock is one hundred and thirtysix miles from london through derby  harrowgate there is an upper and a lower harrowgate which lie at about a mile distant from each other and in point of accommodation manner and custom are similar to buxton only with this difference they are less elegant but still more moderate in respect to boarding and other expenses  there is great decorum and good order at the boarding inns and mostly good harmony this may proceed from a president being placed at the head of the table the last new visitant always takes his seat at the bottom rising by degrees to the head and that maintains good order for without a head all bodies are imperfect  the two villages of harrowgate are a few scattered houses on a dreary common and were it not for the pleasant faces and the good company you often meet with there is nothing to excite the attention in respect to situation the rides are tolerable yet you seem to have nothing worth your pursuit but the dripping well and curious petrifactions at knaresborough which is five miles and stukelypark near rippon seventeen miles from harrowgate you are amply repaid for the length of your ride from the splendour of the scenes at stukely  while at this place having been invited by an old acquaintance to kendal in westmoreland i accepted his offer for two purposes  that of seeing a worthy intelligent character and of having an opportunity of taking a survey of wyndermerelake which i had long wished to see and which lies about fourteen miles to the southwest of the town of kendal  after riding over the craggy hilly road from the above town to the lake i was never more struck it presents itself to you first at the distance of about half a mile just as you have surmounted the summit of the last hill on that road its smooth glassy face appears like a clear extensive mirror seven or eight miles in length and two in breadth the lofty mountains which nearly encircle the whole present themselves to the traveller with a sublime and beautiful effect but when you view them from reflection in the water they appear most formidable their tremendous shaggy heads seem tumbling into a vast expanse sometimes a cloud will suspend itself midway down a mountains side secluding part leaving the base and summit only visible to the eye throwing at the same time a pleasing partial shadow over some part of the crystal lake beneath  the bishop of landaffs seat stands a beautiful object at the head sir michael flemmings on one side and mr christians on a small island tastefully laid out in the center of the lake these gentlemen have wisely purchased all the contiguous land in order to improve the scene by planting down each mountainside shrubs and various firs which have greatly taken off that bleak and sterile appearance they formerly wore they have also made the roads more comfortable to the fashionable visitors who every season make summerexcursions hither in order to explore these luxuriances of nature  a little way north of this lake is ambleside and having heard much of the waterfal at the back of the town i was induced to extend my journey and was fully gratified with viewing so grand an exhibition  but it would be presumption in me to dwell on a subject which has been so ably and minutely given from the pens of mr pennant and mr gross in whose publications the eye has also been aided by correct engravings taken on the spot  weary with rambling from place to place i was much pleased to find near the waterfal a neat and comfortable house of refreshment furnished with good viands as well as wine here i rested and indulged myself but after some time was roused from my chair on hearing a female voice in notes of deep distress and looking from the window saw a beautiful young damsel surrounded by a group of villagers to whom she was bewailing the loss of her betrothed allen for so she called him i found by the tenor of her story that they had been playing at lovers quarrels that her swain had taken his leave in a pet and neglected to visit her at his wonted hour the poor girl showed great agitation of mind tinctured with symptoms of jealousy for by what i could learn from her conversation she had made earnest enquiries of every one she met if they had seen her allen in their walks showing visible apprehensions of her lovers perfidy and of his having forsaken her for some other damsel in the neighborhood this set my muse afloat i thought it no unpleasant subject and therefore wrote the following song while sitting over my wine after dinner it was set to music by mr hook who has done credit to himself and honor to me by giving it a melody of notes and simplicity of style expressing the subject so well as to cause it to make its way to the heart like that of my disconsolate sailor composed by the same master with equal ability the following song was sung by the late mrs kennedy at vauxhall some years ago under the title of  allen brook of wyndermere i say have you in the village seen a lovely youth of pensive mien if such a one has passed by with melancholy in his eye where is he gone  ah tell me where it is allen brook of wyndermere ii last night he sighing took his leave which caused me all the night to grieve and many maids i know there be who try to wean his love from me but heaven knows my hearts sincere to allen brook of wyndermere iii my throbbing heart is full of woe to think that he should leave me so but if my love should angered be and try to hide himself from me then death shall bear me on a bier to allen brook of wyndermere the reputation of this song for it has been much sung and much sold has also been given to the singingbird of leicesterplace as if there were no other shrubs seen nor birds heard to sing than those that are in kensingtongardens because they are so often visited i should not say so much of myself were i not urged to it by too often seeing a jackdaw wearing peacocks feathers  the late celebrated patriot wilkes speaking of hogarth in number    of his north briton says we all tremble when he takes up the pencil but we titter when he takes up the pen so of this sable bird in question we admire him while he confines himself to his crotchets and quavers but when he aims at metaphors similies or figures in rhetoric we cannot help smiling and sometimes pitying him for making the attempt  if it should be thought that i have dwelt too much on this character let it be remembered that i did not cast the first stone and i feel too strongly the force of the motto in the arms of the caledonian kings  nemo me impune lacessit to bear it with silence  there is little etiquette at harrowgate nor are the company pestered with the officious and interesed cringings of an obsequious master of the ceremonies they appropriate one from among themselves such as may have goodnature enough and ability to undertake the office during his visit at dinner the gentlemen treat the ladies with wine who in the afternoon return the compliment by treating the gentlemen with tea and all this seems to be done in perfect amity  there is a billiardtable at each village where there is much play but little gambling they were erected for amusement and that every one may have their share the ladies are not excluded  the library is not of the greatest magnitude but is pleasantly situated on a rising ground between upper and lower harrowgate it is an agreeable lounge where you are accommodated with newspapers hear the novelties of the day and sometimes form a good society  harrowgate is two hundred and twelve miles from london and fifteen miles north of leeds in yorkshire  scarborough in your way from harrowgate to scarborough you go through the ancient and venerable city of york the metropolis of the northern part of england it is well worth the travellers while to rest a day in this city especially if he should possess a taste for antiquity  the cathedral is perhaps one of the largest gothic structures in europe shamefully huddled up and obtruded upon by the pitiful houses that enclose it almost to the very steps of every entrance so that you are mortified by having only a piecemeal view of this national ornament from any point whatever  scarborough is a well built market town its castle of no inconsiderable extent standing upon a stupendous promontory commanding a view of the great german ocean has a sublime effect as you approach it from the sea the market is well supplied provisions tolerably cheap and the visitor has a greater advantage here than at most other watering places from the extent of the town in respect to providing himself with lodgings being often more convenient and moderate in their prices  the bathing is not so pleasant as at margate and many other places owing to the sudden tides and the short breakings of the sea which often come with great impetuosity and sometimes danger to those who venture too far from the shore many accidents have happened in this respect  i had the mortification some years ago to be one among many hundreds of spectators who saw the late unfortunate mr bowers tutor to the earl of glasgow while he was bathing drowned a very amiable young gentleman and a sound scholar he was an excellent swimmer but was too confidence in his own abilities for while he was laving and amusing himself at a considerable distance from the beach the seabreaks overcame his strength beat him almost to pieces against the shingles and carried his body away into the wide ocean where he sank he was thrown up next day by the tide at a little distance from the town  he was buried a few days after this accident and followed to the grave by a great concourse of voluntary mourners showing an unfeigned grief wetting their handkerchiefs with their tears which issued from the heart as a tribute to his virtues and actuated by the reflection of so melancholy a catastrophe  there is a tolerable theater here and the performers are much upon a par with all other companies who perform at watering places  the assemblyroom has nothing to boast of in respect to elegance there is some dancing but the four aces trip it right hand and left with more agility and dexterity and are more attended to than the most celelebrated gentleman of the pump  scarborough is two hundred and thirty miles from london and fortyfour from the city of york  while at the above place i fortunately picked up at a booksellers shop wards antiquities of the county of york who seems to be a very modest writer but does not excel much in diction nor is he very minute in respect to particulars however from what he says of beverlyminster a building little spoken of in the southern parts of england i was excited to ramble about five and twenty miles out of my way to gratify myself with a sight of it for it lies near hull in a nook of yorkshire  mr ward says the danes it seems had not totally ruined the monastry of st john of beverly for we are told that in the year  0   it was entirely destroyed by an accidental conflagration but such was the piety of mankind by degrees in various times and of different work they raised it to an admirable form and in an order the most magnificent and majestic its length from east to west was one hundred and eleven yards from north to south above fiftyfive the breadth of those aisles being twentyone the height from the pavement to the highest cieling about twentytwo the sideaisles eleven and up to the two strong western towers sixtysix thus it remained in glory till its dissolution which we are told was in the first year of king edward vi by the power of an act made in the   th year of his fathers reign after which being abandoned and stripped of its land all the gutters contraforts and battlements fell into a lamentable decay its oncecuriously painted windows were broken and imperfect in several places in short so much was the building out of repair that in the year    0 it had like to have fallen and become as a chaos of confusion especially the northeast part of the great cross with others adjoining that depended upon one another which had such a deplorable accident happened might have very much endamaged the choir but through the happy interposition of john moyser esquire who procured a successful brief assisted by the advice of nicholas hawksmore esquire famous for his knowledge in architecture encouraged by king george the first who granted toward its repair some of the stones of st marys abbey york and sir michael warton who not only gave in his lifetime  00l but bequeathed  000l more which happily increased by the rise of the south sea stock and escaped that dreadful storm that afterward happened on that unfathomable ocean  all these powerful assistances enabled the gentlemen entrusted to restore as it were this famous church to its ancient splendour  the admiration of all that behold it at this day  when the present beautiful pavement of the church was beginning to be laid the aforesaid relics were again taken up till an arched repository of bricks was made in which they were replaced with this new addition to the ancient inscription  to describe all its present beauties the aforesaid pavement in the body of the church margined with black marble that in the choir still more exquisitely fine in form of a hexagon or cube the altar built after the corinthian order up to which is an ascent of live or six steps and curiously arched above with the emblem of st john behind the table being of fine white marble presented to the church by john moyser esquire the lesser cross on each side that part on the south now a place to transact parishaffairs and some of the north made the vestry the place called sanctum sanctorum handsomely paved with stones of two colors the beautiful marble monument under the great east window in honor of sir michael warton erected at the expense of his grateful executor sir michael newton knt the screen at the back of and ancient decayed spirework like canopies over the stalls artfully mended and supplied the carved screen of fine white rocheabbey stone dividing the choir from the western part of the church done after the old gothic order the new pulpit desk and cover of the font of agatestone which was removed from the west end to the south wall the nicelycontrived seats with neat galleries for the parishioners in the sideaisles of the doric order resembling those of st albans at rome supported by pillars of wood without any damage to those of stone which uphold the church the large effigies of the four evangelists st matthew mark luke and john with their emblems beneath which adorn the inner side of the great west door up to which on the outer are new and handsome round steps of fair and white stone to tell how wonderfully the late ingenious mr thornton of york contrived an engine to screw up perpendicular the wall aforesaid that before hung over three feet and a half how a great part of the large cross from whence the painted window of st martin had been taken was nobly rebuilt and the outside and towers especially from the west end of the south side to the door repaired truly to give all these their just encomiums would swell my volume to a greater degree than designed    mr ward has forgot to mention the great endowments bestowed upon this minster by the pennymans family or to describe the beautiful chapel in the east part of the church appropriated to their use and in which are several handsome monuments built in honor of their ancestors  in the north window in the cross aisle is a perfect painting on the glass of king athelstone in his regal and of john of beverly in his pastoral robes holding a handsome crosier in his hand the back ground represents a prospect of part of the adjacent country to which the king is pointing and from his mouth a scroll enclosing a poetical decree in four lines of old german text  all is free make i thee as heart can wish or eye can see the whole minster is kept in so excellent a state of preservation that one might suppose the mason had just taken his tools away or that the doors had been opened to day to gratify the eye of the spectator with what seems to have been only finished yesterday  this minster very unlike that at york stands at the extremity of the south part of the town in an extensive close with gravelled walks arched over with stately trees divested of the disgraceful encumbrances of paltry houses and ragged tenements which invest the latter stately fabric and its beautiful chapter house  mr ward has also forgot to mention that the model of mr thorntons engine that drew up the stupendous wall of the north aisle of beverly minster which had swerved so far out of the perpendicular is deposited in the mansion house of york well executed in wood and worthy the attention of every mechanist  tynmouth this watering place lies eight miles to the north east of newcastle in northumberland it is only a small village composed of little more than one tolerable street of lowly houses being in a plentiful country a visitor may indulge himself and enjoy the advantage of bathing here more reasonably than at any other place of the kind the inhabitants who possess the lodging houses and let them to the visitors are humble and seldom extortionate it is said that there are sharks upon this coast but there are none so ravenous as the great shark on the parade at margate in kent who extends his wide and avaricious jaws with rapacious eagerness whenever he hears of a hoy coming into harbor freighted with london gudgeons who have fattened their sides while they have been gliding about and busying themselves for eight or nine months on the muddy banks of the river thames between westminster and london bridges this landshark employs himself for three or four months in the summer with gutting the gudgeons in question and after depriving them of all the substance of their wellclad ribs spurns them with contempt and sends them home again in a pitiable state like so many shotten herrings  the bathing at tynmouth is comfortable and convenient being sheltered by an amphitheatre of lofty rocks divided at the distance of about two hundred yards from each other and about three hundred yards to the extremity of the rocks which run parallel and open to the great german ocean you are never annoyed by the wind but when it sets in from the east being defended from all the other points by the rocks the sands are delectable to the feet being more divested of pebbles or rubbish than any other bathing place  on the point of one of the rocks are the beautiful and extensive ruins of tynmouthabbey built in the reign of king athelstone near to which stands the castle both commanding an extensive lookout to the sea and a side view of the busy port of shields which is divided from the castle and the abbey by the river tyne a few miles from this place is seaton dellaval the seat and splendid domains of the dellavals of northumberland  one moonlight evening walking with a friend about a mile northward upon the sands and near the rocks we were surprised to see a female all alone near the mouth of a cave who had recently lost her lover near that spot by being overset in a small vessel while they were sailing for a little recreation too near the shore where he was unfortunately drowned she was a handsome young woman and appeared to be inconsolable leaning upon her arm upon a large stone at the entrance of the cave her situation was pitiable her sorrow excessive nor could we prevail upon her with the most earnest entreaties to leave that melancholy spot she acquainted us with the place of her residence to which we made the best of our way and told her friends of her unfortunate situation but had the mortification of being informed by the neighbors that she died on the morrow of a broken heart  though struck with the malady which attended this poor illfated fair one yet it presented itself as no improper thesis out of which i produced the following song entitled the  maid of the rock i sat out one eve with intention to roam to the rock where the surges wantonly play when the owl had stole out from her secret home and bright vested hesperus closed in the day the moon was at full and with dignity rose and tissud with silver the green mantld seas the god of the ocean was gone to repose and aeolus fanned with a whispering breeze ii on reaching the cave where old legends report and many a sorrowful tale has been sung where bloodhunting robbers had often held their court on each side was some vestige of chivalry hung my eyes were alarmed on beholding a maid who near to the cavern sat silent in grief her head on her hand all in sorrow was laid a hard rocky pillow was all her relief iii she started with fear and she fain would have fled i begged her to stay and her sorrow relate then told her from me she had nothing to dread that i was brought there by the order of fate you came by the order of one she replied who has done all she can to distract my poor mind overwhelmed in the deep my dear william my pride then sank and she gave her last breath to the wind yarmouth yarmouth is in the county of norfolk and lies near to the seacoast about twentyeight miles east of that city the town stands in a peninsula and its bay has often been said to have been something similar to that of naples the streets are wide and upon the whole very well built  the bathing here in respect to purity is equal to the most frequented watering place in england but so much cannot be said in regard to its convenience or accommodation the whole town and the country round for many miles being one continued bed of sand therefore as the machines are at some distance from the town if you ride the horse is up to the belly and if you walk you are up to the knees in this troublesome soil  the lowbacked car is a vehicle commonly used here and i believe on account of the roads but it is a disagreeable species of conveyance you cannot help forming to yourself from the slowness its humble appearance and your near acquaintance with your motherearth while you are riding in one of these cars over the sandy roads that you are in a sledge drawn like a traitor to some place of execution but when upon the rough pavement in the town you are electrified with the bonebreaking motion almost impossible to sustain it even when in health but an invalid is in danger of annihilation  yarmouth is not so fashionably attended as southampton brighthelmstone or even margate or ramsgate but those who go with a good appetite get themselves gratified at a much less expense than at either of the other places and many of the summer visitors of this town are neighbors composed mostly of that description who go more for an hour of relaxation to look about them and to gratify their stomachs with the viands of the table than swill themselves with the briny water of the ocean  this town from its traffic and maritime intercourse like southampton and scarborough is more independent of the company that go there than brighton margate or ramsgate not a newfangled place built by greedy and insatiable swallows for a season who live on the giddy summerflies from london and its vicinity  the lodgings are more easily acquired and rents more moderate than the other mercenary places in question and provisions of every kind are to be had at a much cheaper rate at any time of the day without being obliged to scramble for them  there is a theater here generally well attended belonging to mr brunton manager of the norwich company which next to those of london bath and york stands in a more respectable light than most other theaters in england  the assemblyroom is not of the first order either in respect to its elegance or the company that attend it and there is no other structure of consequence unless it be the customhouse  the church has a whimsical twisted spire slated or leaded from the bottom to the top resembling an inverted cornucopia and as it has a good fat living attached to it conveys no bad idea being more the symbol of plenty than of piety  yarmouth through colchester ipswich woodbridge etc is one hundred and twentythree miles from london which is the nearest road should you go through chelmsford bury st edmunds and norwich it is one hundred and twenty eight miles  at bury st edmunds which is called the montpellier of england in point of air and situation the traveller should he have a veneration for antiquity ancient architecture or monastic history he will be gratified were he to stop at this place  the two churches which were built and at this time stand upon one extensive and consecrated piece of ground are both handsome and venerable edifices but that of st marys is uncommonly so the taper gothic lofty columns which support the roof are scarcely to be equalled in symmetry and beauty in any other church in this island the roof was made in france and put together after it was brought into this country  it has altogether a very light and elegant effect and is ever kept in good repair the ancient monuments are numerous and many of them spacious the armorials for the most part are richly blazoned  the pulpit and the desk are an expensive piece of workmanship built of the best mahogany and of an uncommon size  the churchyard comprises many acres and the gravestones are multifarious to a great degree  many striking vestiges of antiquity surround this buryingplace particularly the stupendous ruins of the ancient abbey of which mr kendall has given us a very accurate engraving in its present state which being engrafted as it were by many well built houses erected within the strong cemented arches give it an uncommon effect and adds greatly to the curiosity of the picture he has likewise by way of explanation furnished us with an interesting part of its history saying this structure was in the time of its perfection accounted the largest church in england being two hundred and forty feet broad and five hundred and thirteen feet in length it had five aisles and was exceedingly lofty its inside was enriched with the most beautiful work in carving and gilding exclusive of many stately monuments which were erected over the remains of royal and noble personages whose interments in the church were numerous among these were st edmund king and martyr  constantia countess of richmond daughter of william the conqueror by lady matilda daughter of the earl of flanders  richmond the conquerors nephew who landed with william and shared the command in the famous battle of hastings  his brother and successor allen niger earl of brittany and richmond  thomas plantagenet son of king edward the first by lady margaret daughter of philip king of france earl marshal of england and earl of norfolk  thomas of beaufort son of john of gaunt by the lady caroline swinford  mary tudor queen of louis the twelfth king of france and sister of king henry the eighth  john of lydgate the famous poet monk of this abbey  robert the martyr who was crucified by the jews  sir william elmham  sir william tressel  sir william spencer etc etc and most of the lord abbots    dugdale speaks but little of this place nor does any other monastical writer but perhaps this may proceed from want of proper records many of which were destroyed at the dissolution of the great abbey which would have given them a just and fair authority for a true and more particular information in respect to the annals of this memorable town and its gothic relics  it is a pity and a great loss to the curious who take pleasure in making researches of this nature that more of its history has not been preserved as there are many other visible and striking marks of antiquity which testify that bury st edmunds has once been a place of very considerable consequence as well as grandeur  norwich next to london and bristol is one of the largest cities in england has the narrowest streets and the largest marketplace that is to be seen any where except covent garden and smithfield in london and they have to boast of its being as plentifully supplied with all the good things of the earth as any market in the three kingdoms  the cathedral is a large building much more extensive than either of the churches at bury st edmunds but by no means so elegant as st marys at the latter place nor is there that respectable history about it  in norwich there are thirtythree churches which show that religion was more attended to and revered by our ancestors than it is at the present day unless in the fanatical sectaries of moorfields and tottenham courtroad where the furious preachers seem to be hand and glove with the great creator of all things making him a partial spirit that has set his face against all but the chosen few their own goodly selves  like moses they have their secret conferences with the deity though not perhaps in a burning bush but in secret chambers which is a burning shame that no one else should be admitted into his presence but a frantic cobbler or a howling tailor who shall have taken upon themselves to teach the gospel one to his own end and the other to his own measure promising those that are more ignorant than themselves a passport to heaven when many of the poor deluded wretches miss their way and end their melancholy days in bedlam  at norwich there is annually kept a kind of regatta and many of the best inhabitants keep a handsome cutter which on that day they furnish with the gayest rigging they sail or row down the river to the village of thorp about two miles from the city then assemble in a grove upon the shore to the amount of some hundreds and spend the afternoon in high festivity being once of the party i was much entreated a few days previous to this festival to write them a song upon the occasion saying that they were tired of their hackneyed old ditties and accordingly i penned the following words making the measure accord with an old french tune which served as a new one in this country and i named it the sailors allegory it was sung by one of the party who possessed a strong manly voice the chorus was general and has since that time become a very popular song throughout the kingdom the merit of which like that of my disconsolate sailor has been given to the same character as that song was therefore i have taken the liberty to introduce it here as the finale to this work with the history of its birth that the world may no longer be deceived  lifes like a ship in constant motion sometimes high and sometimes low where every one must brave the ocean whatsoever wind may blow if unassaild by squall or shower wafted by the gentle gales let us not lose the favoring hour while success attends our sails or if the wayward wind should bluster let us not give way to fear but let us all our patience muster and learn from reason how to steer let judgment keep you ever steady it is a ballast never fails should dangers rise be ever ready to manage well the swelling sails trust not too much your own opinion while your vessels under way let good example bear dominion  that is a compass will not stray when thundering tempests make you shudder or boreas on the surface rails let good discretion guide the rudder and providence attend the sails then when youre safe from dangers riding in some welcome port or bay hope be the anchor you confide in and care awhile enslumberd lay or when each cans with liquor flowing and good fellowship prevails let each true heart with rapture glowing drink success unto our sails finis
