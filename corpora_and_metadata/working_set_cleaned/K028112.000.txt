the desideratum or electricity made plain and useful  by a lover of mankind and of common sense  london prined and sold by w flexey under grays inn gate holbourn e cabe avemary lane george clak in litte carter lne george keih gracechurch street t smith under the change and a the foundey in moorfields  mdcclx  the preface   in the following tract i have endeavored to comprize the sum of what has been hitherto published on this curious and important subject by mr franklin dr hoadly mr wilson watson lovett freke martin watkins and in the monthly magazines but i am chiefly indebted to mr franklin for the speculative part and to mr lovett for the practical though i cannot in every thing subscribe to the sentiments either of one or the other    indeed i am not greatly concerned for the philosophical part whether it stand or fall of the facts we are absolutely assured although they are of so surprising a nature than a man could not have asserted them a few years ago without quite giving up his reputation but who can be assured of this or that hypothesis by which he endeavors to account for those facts perhaps the utmost we have reason to expect here is an high degree of probability    i am much more concerned for the physical part knowing of how great importance this is how much sickness and pain may be prevented or removed and how many lives saved by this unparalled remedy and yet with what vehemence has it been opposed sometimes by treating it with contempt as if it were of little or no use sometimes by arguments such as they were and sometimes by such cautions against it is ill effects as made thousands afraid to meddle with it    but so it has fared with almost all the simple remedies which have been offered to the world for many years when sir john floyer published his excellent book on cold bathing many for a time used and profited by it so did abundance of people by cold water when it was publicly recommended by dr hancock the ingenious and benevolent bishop of cloyne brought tarwater likewise into credit for a season and innumerable were the cures wrought thereby even in the most desperate and deplorable cases nor was it a little good which was done by the use of seawater after dr russel had published his tract concerning it indeed each of these did wonders in it is turn but alas their reign was short the vast party which were on the other side soon raised the cry and ran them down in a few years they were out of fashion cut of use and almost out of memory and the foul hard named exotics took place again to the utter confusion of common sense    must not electricity then whatever wonders it may now perform expect soon to share the same fate and yet it is absolutely certain that in many very many cases it seldom or never fails i can truly say says mr lovett i scarce ever knew any who made the trial and did not succeed not that all disorders will yield thereto neither in this any more than the common way will the same treatment of the same disorder in different persons have always the same success indeed there cannot be in nature any such thing as an absolute panacea a medicine that will cure every disease incident to the human body if there could electricity would bid fairer for it than any thing in the world as it takes place in such a vast number of disorders some of them so widely different from the others    and yet there is something peculiarly unaccountable with regard to its operation in some cases where there was no hope of help it will succeed beyond all expectation in others where we had the greatest hope it will have no effect at all again in some experiments it helps at the very first and promises a speedy cure but presently the good effect ceases and the patient is as he was before on the contrary in others it has no effect at first it does no good perhaps seems to do hurt yet all this time it is striking at the root of the disease which in a while it totally removes frequent instances of the former we have in paraslytic of the latter in rheumatic cases    but still one may upon the whole pronounce it the desideratum the general and rarely failing remedy in nervous cases of every kind palsies excepted as well as in many others perhaps if the nerves are really perforated as is now generally supposed the electric either is the only fluid in the universe which is fine enough to move through them and what if the nervous juice itself be a fluid of this kind if so it is no wonder that it has always eluded the search of the most accurate naturalists    be this as it may mr lovett is of opinion the electrical method of treating disorders cannot be expected to arrive at any considerable degree of perfection till administered and applied by the gentlemen of the faculty nay then quanta de spe decidi all my hopes are at an end for when will it be administered and applied by them truly ad graecas calendas not till the gentlemen of the faculty have more regard to the interest of their neighbors than their own at least not till there are no apothecaries in the land or till physicians are independent of them    therefore without waiting for what probably never will be and what indeed we have no reason to expect let men of sense do the best they can for themselves as well as for their poor sick helpless neighbors how many may they rlieve from racking pain or pining sickness by this unexpensive and speedy remedy restoring them to ease health strength generally in a few minutes frequently in a moment and if a few of these lovers of mankind who have some little knowledge of the animal economy would only be diligent in making experiments and setting down the more remarkable of them in order to communicate them to one another that each might profit by the others labor i doubt not but more nervous disorders would be cured in one year by this single remedy than the whole english materia medica will cure by the end of the century   0 it is not impossible but the gentlemen reviewers may bestow a compliment on me as well as on mr lovett if they are so kind i would only beg them not to plume themselves upon a discovery which i have helped them to myself namely that the following is little more than an extract from others i intended it so to be i designed only to collect together the substance of the most celebrated writings on the subject and to place them in one connected view for the use of those who have little time or money to spare i only wish some who has more leisure and ability than me would consider it more deeply and write a full practical treatise on electricity which might be a blessing to many generations  nov        the desideratum or electricity made plain i   from a thousand experiments it appears that there is a fluid far more subtle than air which is every where diffused through all space which surrounds the earth and pervades every part of it and such is the extreme fineness velocity and expansiveness of this active principle that all other matter seems to be only the body and this the soul of the universe this we might term elementary fire but that it is hard for us to separate the ideas of fire and burning although the latter is in reality but a preternatural and violent effect of the former    it is highly probable this is the general instrument of all the moion in the universe from this pure fire which is properly so called the vulgar culinary fire is kindled for in truth there is but one kind of fire in nature which exists in all places and in all bodies and this is subtle and active enough not only to be under the great cause the secondary cause of motion but to produce and sustain life throughout all nature as well in animals as in vegetables    to this effect the learned bishop of cloyne observes the vital flame is supposed to be the cause of all the motions in the body of man whether natural or voluntary and has not fire the same force to animate throughout and actuate the whole system of the world cherishing heating fermenting dissolving shining and operating in various manners as various subjects offer to employ or to determine it is force it is present in all parts of the earth and firmament though latent and unobserved till some accident produces it into act and renders it visible in it is effects    this great machine of the world requires some such constant active and powerful principle constituted by it is creator to keep the heavenly bodies in their several courses and at the same time give support life and increase to the various inhabitants of the earth now as the heart of every animal is the engine which circulates the blood through the whole body so the sun as the heart of the world circulates this fire through the whole universe and this element is not capable of any essential alteration increase or diminution it is a species by itself and is of a nature totally distinct from that of all other bodies    that this is absolutely necessary both to feed common fire and to sustain the life of animals it seems may be learned from an easy experiment place a cat together with a lighted candle in a cold oven then lute the door close having fixed a glass in the middle of it and if you look through this you may observe at one and the same instant the candle goes out and the animal dies a plain proof that the same fire is needful to sustain both culinary fire and animal life and a large quantity of it some doubtless pervades the oven door but not enough to sustain either flame or life indeed every animal is a kind of fireengine as soon as the lungs inspire the air the fire mingled with it is instantly dispersed through the pulmonary vessels into the blood thence it is diffused through every part of the body even the most minute arteries veins and nerves in the mean time the lungs inspire more air and fire and so provide a constant supply    the air seems to be universally impregnated with this fire but so diluted as not to hurt the animal in respiration so a small quantity of a liquor dropped in water may be friendly to an human body though a few drops of the same liquor given by themselvs would have occasioned certain death and yet you cannot conceive one particle of the water without a particle of the medicine it is not impossible this may be one great use of air by adhering so closely to the elementary fire to temper and render salutary to the body what would otherwise be fatal to it    to put it beyond dispute that this fire is largely mixed with the air you may make the following experiment take a round lump of iron and heat it to a degree called a welding heat take it out of the fire and with a pair of bellows blow cold air upon it the iron will then as effectually melt as if it were in the hottest fire now when taken out of the forge it had not fire enough in it to conquer the cohesion of it is parts but when this fire is joined with that which was mixed with the air it is sufficient to do it on the same principle we account for the increase of a coal or wood fire by blowing it    and let none wonder that fire should be so connected with air as hardly to be separated as subtle as fire is we may even by art attach it to other bodies yea and keep it prisoner for many years and that either in a solid or a fluid form an instance of the first we have in steel which is made such only by impacting a large quantity of fire into bars of iron in like manner we impact a great quantity of fire into stone to make lime an instance of the second kind we have in spirits wherein fire is imprisoned in a fluid form hence common spirits will burn all away and if you throw into the air spirits rectified to the highest degree not one drop will come down again but the universal fire will take hold of and absorb it all    that this fire subsists both in air earth and water that it is diffused through all and every part of the universe was suspected by many of the ancient naturalists and believed by the great sir isaac newton but of late years it has been fully demonstrated particularly by mr stephen gray a pensioner at the charterhouse who some years since presented to the royal society an account of many experiments he had made whereby this subtle fluid became clearly perceptible both to the sight and feeling because the glass tube by means of which those experiments were made was observed when rubbed to attract straws and other light bodies a known property of amber called in latin electrum these experiments were termed electrical a word which was soon affixt to that subtle fluid itself and every thing pertaining to it but improperly enough seeing the attracting or seeming to attract straws and feathers is one of the most inconsiderable of all the effects wrought by this powerful and universal cause   0 it was afterward found that a glass globe was on some accounts preferable to a glass tube particularly as it was less labor to turn the one for some hours together by means of a small wheel in the mean time rubbing it with a dry hand or a little cushion than to rub the tube for so long a time it was likewise observed that a greater quantity of ethereal fire might be collected by this means than by the other i say collected for that fire is no more created by rubbing than water is by pumping the grand reservoir thereof is the earth from which it is diffused through all the other parts of common matter accordingly in these experiments the globe rubbing against the cushion collects fire from it the cushion receives it from the frame of the machine the frame of the machine from the floor but if you cut off the communication with the floor no fire can be produced because none can be collected     in the year      mr de muschenbroek profssor of natural philosophy at leyden was led by a casual experiment into many new discoveries these were chiefly made by means of a large but thin glass phial the best way to prepare which is to coat it with thin lead to line it on the inside with leafgold to within two inches of the top and to fasten some tinsel fringe to the bottom or to the end of the wire within the phial so as to touch the gold lining by this wire going through the cork the phial is hung on any metallic body which communicates by a wire with the globe or tube this metallic body has been termed the prime conductor as it conducts or conveys the fire collected by the tube or globe either into the phial or into any other body communicating therewith     but all bodies are not capable of receiving it there is in this respect an amazing difference between them the excrements of nature as wax silk hair will not receive the ethereal fire neither convey it to other bodies so that whenever in circulating it comes to any of these it is at a full stop air itself is a body of this kind with great difficulty either receiving or conveying this fire to other bodies so are pitch and rosin excrements as it were of trees to these we may add glass amber brimstone dry earth and a few other bodies these have been frequently styled electrics per se as if they alone contained the electric fire an eminently improper title founded on a palpable mistake from the same mistake all other bodies which easily receive and readily convey it were termed non electrict on a supposition that they contained no electric fire the contrary of which is now allowed by all     that this fire is inconceivably subtle appears from it is permeating even the densest metals and that with such ease as to receive no perceptible resistance if any one doubt whether it pass through the substance or only along the surface of bodies a strong shock taken through his own body will prevent his doubting any longer it differs from all other matter in this that the particles of it repel not attract each other and hence is the manifest divergency in a stream of electrical effluvia but though the particles of it repel each other yet are they attracted by all other matter and from these thr e the extreme subtlety of this fire the mutual repulsion of its parts and the strong attraction of them by other matter arises this effect that if a quantity of electric fire be applied to a mass of common matter of any bigness or length which has not already got its quantity it is immediately diffused through the whole     it seems this globe of earth and water with its plants animals buildings have diffused through their whole substance just as much of this fire as they will contain and this we may term their natural quantity this is not the same in all kinds of matter neither in the same kind of matter in all circumstances a solid foot of one kind of matter as glass contains more of it than a solid foot of another kind and a pound weight of the same kind of matter when rarefied contains more than it did before     we know that this fire is in common matter because we can pump it out by the globe or tube we know that common matter has near as much of it as it can contain because if we add a little more to any portion of it the additional quantity does not enter but forms a kind of atmosphere round it on the other hand we know that common matter has not more of it than it can contain otherwise all loose portions of it would repel each other as they constantly do when they have such atmospheres had the earth for instance as much electric fire in proportion as we can give to a globe of iron or wood the particles of dust and other light matter would not only repel each other but be continually repelled from the erth hence the air being constantly loaded therewith would be unfit for respiration here we see another occasion to adore that wisdom which has made all things by weight and measure     the form of every electric atmosphere is that of the body which it surrounds because it is attracted by every part of the surface though it cannot enter the substance already replete without this attraction it would not remain round the body but dissipate into the air     the atmosphere of an electrified sphere is not more easily drawn off from any one part of it than from the other because it is equally attracted by every part but it is not so with bodies of other figures from a cube it is more easily drawn off at the corners than at the sides and so from the corners of bodies of any other form and most easily from the sharpest corners for the force with which an electrified body retains it is atmosphere is proportioned to the surface on which that atmosphere rests so a surface four inches square retains it is atmosphere with sixteen times the force that one of an inch square does and as in pulling the hairs from an horses tail a force insufficient to pull off an handful at once could easily pull it off hair by hair so though a blunt body cannot draw off all the atmosphere at once a pointed one can easily draw it off particle by particle     if you would have a sensible proof how wonderfully pointed bodies draw off the electric fire place an iron shot of four inches diameter on the mouth of a dry bottle suspend over it a small corkball by a silken thread just so as to rest against the side of the shot electrify the shot and the ball will be repelled four or five inches from it then present to the shot six or eight inches off the point of a sharp bodkin the fire is instantly drawn off so the repulsion ceases and the ball flies to the shot but a blunt body will not produce this effect till it is brought within an inch of the shot if you present the point of the bodkin in the dark you may see sometimes at a foot distance a light gather upon it like a glowworm which is manifestly the fire it extracts from the shot the less sharp the point is the nearer it must be brought before you can see the light and at whatever distance you see the light you may draw off the electric fire     to be convinced that pointed bodies throw off as well as draw off the fire you may lay a long sharp needle on the shot it cannot then be electrified so as to repel the ball because the fire thrown upon it continually runs off at the point of the needle from which in the dark you may see such a stream of light as in the preceding instance   0 while the electric fire which is in all bodies is left to itself undisturbed by any external violence it is more or less dense according to the nature of the body which it is in in dense bodies it is more rare in rare bodies it is more dense accordingly every body contains such a quantity of it rare or dense as is suitable to it is nature and there is some resistance to every endeavor of altering it is density in the whole of any body or in any part of it for all bodies resist either the increase or diminution of their natural quantity and on the other hand when it has been either increased or diminished there is a resistance to it is return to it is natural state     with regard to the different resistance made by different bodies in either of these cases it is an invariable rule that glass wax rosin brimstone silk hair and such like bodies resist the most and next to these the air provided it be dry and in a sufficient quantity that this resistance is least in metals minerals water quicksilver animals and vegetables which we may rank together because the difference in their resistance is very inconsiderable and that in these bodies the resistance is greater when their surface are polished and extended in length than when their surfaces are rough and short or end in sharp points     when a body has more electric fire forced into it than it has naturally it is said to be electified positively when part of the natural quantity is taken away it is said to be electrified negatively now when an iron bar is negativey electrified the fire drawn out does not go in again as soon as the experiment is over but forms an atmosphere round it because of the resistance it finds in it is endeavor to dilate itself either into the air or into the bar and when it is electified positively the same kind of atmosphere is formed by the fire accumulated upon it whether therefore bodies are electrified negatively or positively and remain so when the experiment is over there are similar atmospheres surrounding them which will produce similar effects     but we can electrify no body beyond a certain degree because when any is electrified to that point it has an atmosphere round it sufficiently strong to balance any power that endeavors to electrify it farther nor is the electric fire either from the tube or the globe able to force its way through this     and in the ordinary course of nature this subtle active fluid which not only surrounds every gross body but every component particle of each where it is not in absolute contact with it is neighboring particle can never be idle but is ever in action though that action be imperceptible to our senses it is ever varying it is condition though imperceptibly in all parts of all bodies whatever and electrifying them more or less though not so forcibly as to give sensible signs of it all bodies then and all their component particles when in their natural situation have round their surfaces where they are not in absolute contact with other surfaces an imperceptible atmosphere sufficient to balance the smaller force with which they are attacked every way similar to the perceptible atmosphere of bodies forcibly electrified in these imperceptible atmospheres is placed the power which resists their being electrified to an higher degree than they are naturally and this power lies in the elasticity of the subtle fluid every where dispersed both round all bodies and in them     glass is very difficultly electified which seems  prove it has a very dense electric atmosphere metals are easily electrified consequently they have rare and therefore weaklyresisting atmospheres but as heat rarefies all bodies so if glass be heated to a certain degree even below melting it will give as free a passage to the electric fire as brass or iron does the atmosphere round it being then rendered as rare as that of metals nay when melted it makes no more resistance than water but it is resistance increases as it cools and when it is quite cold it resists as forcibly as ever smoothlypolishd wax resists as much as glass but even the small heat raised by rubbing will render it is atmosphere as rare as that of metals and so entirely destroy it is resistance the same is true of rosin and brimstone even the heat arising from friction destroys the resistance which they naturally make to being electrified a strong proof that the resistance of all bodies thereto is exerted at their surfaces and caused by an electric atmosphere of different densities according to different circumstances     most experiments will succeed as well with a globe of brimstone as with one of glass yet there is a considerable difference in their nature what glass repells brimstone as also rosin attracts rubbed glass emits the electric fire rubbed brimstone rosin and wax receive it hence if a glass globe be turned at one end of a prime conductor and a brimstone one at the other not a spark of fire can be obtained one receiving it in as fast as it is given out by the other hence also if a phial be suspended on the prime conductor with a chain from it is coating to the table and only one globe turned it will be electrified or charged as they term it by twenty turns of the wheel after which it may be discharged that is unelectrified by twenty turns of the other wheel     the difference between non electrics vulgarly speaking and electrics per se is chiefly this   a non electric easily suffers a change in the quantity of fire it contains it is whole quantity may be lessened by drawing out a part which it will afterward resume but you can only lessen the quantity contained in one of the surfaces of an electric and not that but by adding at the same time an equal quantity to the other surface so that the whole glass will always have the same quantity in it is two surfaces and even this can only be done in glass that is thin beyond a certain thickness we know no power that can make this change   the ethereal fire freely moves from place to place in and through the substance of a non electric but through the substance of an electric it will by no means pass it freely enters an ironrod and moves from one end to another where the overplus is discharged but it will not enter or move through a glassrod neither will the thinnest glass which can be made suffer any particle of it entering one of it is surfaces to pass through to the other     indeed it is only metals and liquids that perfectly conduct or transmit this fire other bodies seem to conduct it only so far as they contain a mixture of these accordingly moist air will conduct it in proportion to it is moistness but dry air will not conduct it at all on the contrary it is the main instrument in confining any electric atmosphere to the body which it surrounds dry air prevents it is dissipating which it does presently when in vacuo or passing from body to body a clear botle full of air instead of water cannot be electrified but exhausted of air it is electrified as effectually as if it was full of water yet an electrical atmosphere and air do not exclued one another for we breath in it freely and dry air will blow through it without altering it at all     when a glass phial is electrified whatever quantity of fire is accumulated on the inner surface an equal quantity is taken from the outer suppose before the operation begins the quantity of fire contained in each surface is equal to twenty grains suppose at every turn of the globe one grain is thrown in then after the first stroke there are twenty one within nineteen only without after the second the inner surface will have twentytwo the outer but eighteen and so on till after twenty strokes the inner will have forty the outer none and the operation ends for no power or art of man can throw any more on the inner surface when no more can be taken from the outer if you attempt to throw more in it is thrown back through the wire or flies cut in cracks through the sides of the phial the equilibrium cannot be restored in this phial but by a communication formed between the inner and outer surface by something external touching both the outer and the wire which communicates with the inner surface if you touch these by turns it is restored by degrees if both at once it is restored instantly but then there is a shock occasioned by the sudden passing of the fire through the body in it is way from the inner to the outer surface for it moves from the wire to the finger not from the finger to the wire as is commonly supposed thence it passes through the body to the other hand and so to the outer surface   0 the force with which this shock may be given is far greater than one would conceive it will kill rats hens or even turkeys in a moment others that are not quite killed it strikes blind it will give polarity to a fine needle making it point north and south as if touched by a loadstone it will invert the polarity of a compass and make the north point turn to the south at the same time the ends of the needles are finely blued like the spring of a watch it will melt off the heads and points of pins and needles and sometimes the whole surface of the needle is run and appears as it were blisterd when examined by a magnifying glass it will melt thin gold or silver when held tight between two panes of glass together with the surface of the glass itself and incorporate them in a fine enamel yea a strong spark from an electrified phial makes a fair hole through a quire of paper doubled which is thought good armor against the push of a sword or even a pistol bullet and it is amazing to observe in how small a portion of glass a great electrical force may be a thin glassbubble about an inch diameter being half filled with water partly gilt on the outside when electrified gives as strong a shock as a man can well bear allowing then that it contains no more fire after charging than before how much fire must there be in this small glass it seems to be a part of it is very substance perhaps if that fire could be separated from it it would be no longer glass it might in losing this lose its most essential properties it is transparency brittleness and elasticity     some have not improbably supposed that all electric bodies so called are by their original constitution throly saturated with electric fire that it remains fixed in them unless while the texture of those bodies is quite altered by liquefaction that fire fixed in a body constitutes an electric and all bodies where it is not fixed are non electries agreeably to which they suppose that in all non electrics the original fire loosely inhering is easily driven on by the new collected fire which then possesses its place but that in electrics the original fire being impacted into their substance and therefore more firmly inhering will not give way to or be driven on by the new collected fire such is air in particular with the particles of which the original fire is closely incorporated dry air seems to be so fully saturated with it that it is scarce capable of receiving any more whereas all nwcollected fire is continually endeavoring to return into the earth let wires be electrified ever so strongly yet the moment any part of them is touched by a person standing on the floor they are electrified no longer all the fire escaping through him into the earth     upon the principles of electricity we may give a more rational account of many appearances in nature than has yet been done of thunder and lightning in particular in order to which we may observe all electrified bodies retain the fire thrown into them till some nonelectric approaches to which it is then communicated with a snap and becomes equally divided electric fire is strongly attracted by water and readily mixes with it and water being electrified the vapors arising from it are equally electrified as these float in the air they retain the additional fire till they meet with clouds not so much electrified then they communicate it with a shock     the ocean is compounded of water and salt one an electric the other not when there is a friction among the parts near its surface the fire is collected from the parts below it is then plainly visible in the night at the stern of every failing vessel it appears from every dash of an oar in storms the whole sea seems on fire the particles of water then repelled from the electrified surface continually carry off the fire as it is collected they rise and form clouds which are highly electrified and retain the fire till they have an opportunity of discharging it     particles of water rising in vapors attach themselves to particles of air one particle of air may be surrounded by twelve particles of water as large as itself all touching it and by more added to them particles of air thus loaded would be drawn nearer together by the mutual attraction of the particles of water did not the fire common or electric included therein assist their mutual repulsion hence they continue suspended but if air thus loaded be compressed by adverse winds or by being driven against mountains or if it be condensed by the loss of it is fire it will continue suspended no longer but will descend in dew and if the water surroun ing one particle of air comes into contact with that surrounding another they naturally coalesce into a drop and so descend in rain     the sun supplies common fire to all vapors rising either from sea or land vapors having both this and electric fire are better supported than those which have this only for when vapors rise into the coldest region the common fire may fail but the cold will not diminish the electric this is always the same hence clouds raised from fresh waters from moist earth or growing vegetables more easily descend and deposite their waters as having but little electric fire to keep the particles separate from each other so that the greatest part of the water raised from the land falls on the land again but clouds raised from the sea having both fires and much of the electric support their water far more strongly and being assisted by winds may bring it from the middle of the widest ocean to the middle of the broadest continent and yet a way is provided whereby these also are readily brought to deposite their water for whenever they are driven against mountains by the winds those mountains take away their electric fire and being cold the common also hence the particles immediately close if the air was not much loaded the water falls in dew on the top and the sides of the mountain if it was the electric fire being taken at once from the whole cloud it flashes brightly and cracks loudly and the particles instantly coalescing for want of that fire fall in an heavy shower     when a ridge of mountains stops the clouds and draws the electric fire from the cloud first approaching it the next when it comes near the first now deprived of it is fire flashes into it and deposites it is own water the third cloud approaching and all that succeed act in the same manner as far back as they extend which may be for several hundred miles hence the continual storms of thunder lightning and rain on the east side of those vat mountains the andes which running north and south intercept all the clouds brought against them from the atlantic ocean in a plain country there are other means to make them drop their water for if an electrified cloud coming from the sea meets in the air a cloud coming from the land and therefore not electrified the first will give it is flash into the latter and thereby both will be made to deposite their water the concussion of the air contributes also to shake down the water not only from those two clouds but from others near them when the sea and land clouds would pass at too great a distance from each other they are mutually attracted till within the distance for the sphere of electrical attraction is far beyond the flashing distance and yet where a cloud contains much fire it may strike at a considerable distance when a conductor has but little fire in it you must approach very near before you can draw a spark throw into it a greater quantity of fire and it will give a spark at a greater distance but if a gun barrel when electrified will strike and make a noise at the distance of an inch at what a distance and with how great a nose may ten thousand acres of electrified cloud strike no wonder that this should melt metals which our artificial flash does in some degree though perhaps not so properly by it is heat as by insinuating into the pores and creating a violent repulsion between the particles of the metal it passes through this overcomes the attraction whereby they cohere and so melts the metallic body and this accounts for its melting a sword in the scabbard or gold in the pocket without burning either     but thunder clouds do not always contain more than their natural quantity of electric fire very frequently they contain less and when this is the case when they are negatively electrified although the effects and appearances are nearly the same yet the manner of operation is different for in this case it is really the fire from the mountains or other part of the earth which strikes into the cloud and not as we imagine fire from the cloud which strikes into the earth and we may easily conceive how a cloud may be negatively electrified when a portion of water is rarefied into a thin vapor the fire it contains is rarefied too consequently it has then less than it is natural quantity of fire such a cloud therefore coming within a due distance of the earth will receive from it a flash of electric fire which flash to supply a great extent of cloud must often contain a great quantity of fire such a cloud also passing over woods of tall trees may silently receive some supply either from the points of the boughs or from the sharp ends and edges of the leaves the cloud thus supplied flashes into other clouds that have not been so supplied and those into others till an equilibrium is produced among all that are within a striking distance of each other and hence are repeated strokes and flashes till they descend in showers to the earth their original rain especially when in large drops generally brings down the electric fire falling snow often summer hail always though silently consequently any of these may prevent thunder and lightning or at least abate it is violence rain is helpful in another respect likewise by wetting men or beasts it saves many lives for if your cl athes are throly wet and a flash of lightning strikes the top of your head it will run in the water over the surface of your body into the ground whereas if your cl aths were not wet it would go through your body hence a wet chicken cannot be killed by a stroke from the phial whereas a dry one is killed in an instant see here also the wisdom and goodness of him who sends forth lighning with the ran it should likewise be observed that wherever electrified clouds pass spires towers chimneys and high trees as so many points draw the electric fire and the whole cloud frequently discharges there therefore it is highly dangerous in such a storm to take shelter under a tree     common fire if it be any thing more than a different modification of the same element is more or less in all bodies as well as electrical if there be a sufficient quantity of either in any body it is inflamed but when the quantity of common fire therein is small there needs more electric fire to inflme it where the quantity of common fire is greater less of the electric will suffice so if spirits are heated a small spark inflames them if they are not the spark must be greater sulphurous vapors whether rising from the earth or from stacks of moist hay or corn or any other heated and reeking vegetable contain ab ndance of common fire a small addition of electric then will inflame them therefore they are easily kindled by lightning     any who would be clearly convinced of the nature of lightning may make the following experiment make a small cross of two thin strips of wood the arms being just so long as to reach the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief when extended tie the corners of this to the extremities of the cross and so you have the body of a kite add to this a proper tail loop and string and it will rise in the air like one made with paper but this is fiter to bear the wind and wet in a storm without tearing to the top of the cross fix a sharp pointed wire rising a foot above it tie a silk ribbon to the end of the twine next the hand and where the silk and twine join fasten a key raise this kite when a thunderstorm is coming on but he that holds the string must stand in a porch or under some other covering that the ribbon may not be wet he must likewise take particular care that the twine do not touch the top or side of the porch as soon as the thundercloud comes over the kite the pointed wire draws the electric fire from it the kite and all the twine are then electrified as plainly appers by this that the loose filaments of the twine stand out every way and are attracted by an approaching finger and when the kite and twine being wet conduct the fire freely it will stream from the key on the approach of the knuckle by this key the phial may be charged and all other experiments made as by the globe and this is a demonstration that the electric fire thereby obtained is the very same with that of lightning   0 may not the knowledge of this power in pointed bodies of drawing off the fire contained in these clouds suggest to us a very probable method of preserving ouses churche ships from the stroke of lightning might we not fix on the highest part of them upright rods of iron made sharp as needles and gilt to prevent rusting which otherwise would hi der their free conveyance of the electric fire from the foot of those rods which need not be above half an inch diameter a were may pas down the outside of the building into the ground or down ound one of the shrouds of a ship and down her side till it reaches the water would not these rods silently draw off he electric fire before the cloud was nigh enough to strike and thereby in a good measure secure us from that most sudden and terrible mischief let it not be objected that the using this probable means of preventing a threatening danger would imply any denial of or distrust in divine providence not at all we know the creator of the universe is likewise the governor of all things therein but we know likewise that he gove ns by second causes and that accordingly it is his will we should use all the probable means he has given us to attain every lawful end it is therefore no more an impeachment of his providence when we foresee a storm of lightning and rain to shelter our house as far as we are able from the one than to shelter ourselves in that house from the other is it not just as innocent if it be possible to keep our rooms tight from lightning as from wind and water     it may not be improper to add one or two observations before we proceed to what is of more importance scarce any phenomenon in nature has been esteemed more difficult to be accounted for than those luminous appearances in the sky termed aurora borealis or northern lights but these also may be rationally explained upon the principles of electricity we often see clouds at different heights passing different ways north and south at the same time this manifestly proves different currents of air one of them under the other now as the air between the tropics is rarefied by the sun it rises the denser air pressing into it is place the air so raised moves north and south and if it has no opportunity before must descend in the polar regions when this air with it is vapors descends into contact with the vapors arising there the electric fire which it brought begins to be communicated and is seen in clear nights being first visible where it is first in motion namely in the most northern parts but from thence the streams of light seem to shoot southerly even to the zenith of northern countries     another phenomenon of a totally different kind may be accounted for on the same principles although mr prior supposes solomon himself to ask as a question which he could not answer whence does it happen that the plant which well we name the sensitive should move and feel whence know her leaves to answer her command and with quick horror fly the neighboring hand   allowing for poetical amplification the plain fact is this the sensitive plant as it were shrinks away as soon as your hand approaches it and from a turgid and vivid appearance instantly droops and hangs it is leaves now suppose this plant to contain more electric fire than any other plant or animal it must or course communicate that fire to any other that touches it and if so it is leaves and branches must be in a languid state till they have recovered their natural quantity to illustrate this set any small tree in a pot on a cake of brimstone electrify it and it grows extremely turgid so as to erect it is leaves but the moment you touch one of them the whole tree droops and hangs all it is leaves and branches  to throw all the light i can on the subject i subjoin a few extracts from several other writers  an extract from mr watsons experiments and observations   when two plates the one electrified the other not were brought near each other the flashes of bright flame were so large that in a dark room i could distinctly see the faces of    persons p      a piece of large blunt wire was hung to the conductor to the end of this when electrified a black surface not electrified being brought near though not near enough to cause a snap a brush of blue flame quite different from the former issued of more than an inch long and an inch thick p      if a person strongly electrified lays his hand on the clothes of one that is not especially if they are thin woollen or silk they both feel as it were many pins pricking them as long as the globe is in motion    if oil of turpentine be set on fire in a vessel held by one electrified the smoke arising therefrom received against a plate held at a foot distance from the flame by one standing on rosin will enable him to fire warm spirits of wine the electric strokes have been likewise felt upon touching the second man when the plate he held in the smoke has been between seven and eight feet above the flame p      take burning spirits of wine instead of oil of turpentine and if the second man hold the end of an iron rod at the top of the flame he may k ndle other warm spirits held near his finger hence we find that either smoke or flame conducts the electric fire and does not perceptibly diminish it is force p      if the wire of the phial be not touched the electrified water or steel dust will retain it is force many hours may be conveyed several miles and will afterward exert it is force upon touching the wire p       if an egg is hung on the conductor and a person grasping the electrified hial with one hand brings the palm of his other near the bottom of the egg he receives a smart troke on the hand as with a ferula and his hand seems full of a more red fire than is usually observed p       any number of persons communicating with each other the first of whom grasps the phial and the last touches the conductor receive the same shock as if it was ne only p       the electric force always describes a circuit and moves in the straitest line it can between the conductor and hial p      0 to prove ths while the machine stood on wax i stood upon the floor and putting one hand on the machine touched the gun barrel with the other upon this fire issued and the snapping continued as long as i held my hand on the machine but no longer this showed at once that the electric fire past from the floor through my body t the machine p        if the electric fire is ot stopped no sign of it is presence is observable in the bodies suspended to the globe though it throws ever so much of this fire upon them it passes from them to the floor whence it came but if it is stopped it is then accumulated in or upon these bodies although this can be done only to a certain degree after which it continually disperses if when it is accumulated a man standing on the floor touces those bodies the snap is felt and the fire is seen but this snapping is not when the fire passes off continually as from a piere of blunt wire hung to the barrel and a han brought near it then it appears lie a blue cone of flame with it is point toward the wire when the hand is held at a proper distance there is a blast therefrom as of cold air if you o not determine the electric fire to a point it is dispersed from all art of the electrified body but if you do by thus holding your hand near the fire you see ow it passes to the floor and so into the earth the globe therefore only circulates this fire which is collected by it is friction against the hand or cushion and which is constantly supplied to these from the earth and accordingly the ngrss of it as well as the egress is visible for if while any unelerified body touches the brrel you bring your finger near the woodwork of the machine you will see the brush of blue flame set in from it to the woodwork and this flame passes diverging into the machine and continues as long as the barrel is touched p        that the electric atmosphere which surrounds all electrified bodies extends to a considerable distance appears from their attracting a fine thread at the distance of some feet if no unelectrified body is near this atmosphere seems to be equally spread over that which is electrified but if one unelectrified is brought near the greatest part of it is determined that way whence the attraction of the other parts of the electrified body is considerably diminished this is the cause of electric repulsion which does not operate till the electric either is sufficiently accumulated this repulsion is strongest in those parts of the electrified body where unelectrified bodies are brought near it for by these the electric blast which otherwise is general is particularly determined p        when the machine is placed upon rosin if a man standing likewise on rosin touches the barrel while the globe is turning he will receive a snap or two and no more but if he touch the woodwork of the machine with one hand and the barrel with the other he receives snaps again which continue as long as he touches the machine and no longer here the man by touching the machine with one hand becomes a part thereof and by turning the globe part of the electric fire inherent in his body is transmitted to the barrel but it is restored to him on his touching the barrel with his other hand if instead of touching the machine or barrel he holds his finger near either or both you see the fire go out and return p        may we not gather from the preceding experiments   that the attracion and repulsion of electrified bodies is owing to the flux of electric either   that this either is no other than pure fire   that this fire appears in different forms according to it is different modifications when brought toward a point is it not a lambent flame when nearer still may we not both hear and feel it and does not it is lighting up spirits demonstrate that it is real fire   that this fire is intimately connected with all bodies though least of all with pure dry air we have extracted it from water flame smoke red hot iron and from a mixture  0 degrees colder than the freezing point   that it is extremely subtle and highly elastic   that the electric machine may as properly be termed a firepump as mr foyls machine an air pump and lastly that fire is not mechanically producible from other bodies but is an original distinct principle  an extract from mr wilson s dissertation on electricity prop   when two bodies equally replete with electric matter approach each other no flame or snap will ensue p    prop   two bodies equally electrified repel each other p    prop   an electric body interposed between a person and the earth prevents his exciting electricity in another body by friction p     prop   if there is originally a certain quantity of electric matter in a body of a given magnitude and density and that matter be equally distributed therein by it is elastic force according to the density of the parts upon increasing the quantity of matter by adding other bodies of the same kind the quantity of electric matter will be increased in the same proportion p     prop   as electric bodies act on light bodies that are not electrified so unelectrified bodies act on the electric matter contained in electrified bodies p     let a wire be electrified in the dark and if you hold any unelectrified body   or   inches from the end of it a stream of fire will issue from it which will diverge to that body but the divergency will lessen as it approaches it till the rays become parallel if the body be held not directly before the end of the wire but wide of it at about two inches distance the fire will describe curvilinear rays toward that body p     hence it appears that unelectrified bodies act in like manner with electrified only the acting force of the one being increased by friction is greater than that of the other  prop   when two equally electric atmospheres are brought so near as to touch they repel each other with a force equal to their densities p     prop   if while a fluid surrounds a globe which is electrified and turned round an axis passing through it is center an unelectrified body be held near the equator of it the fluid will rise successively toward that body as it turns round in like manner as the sea is affected by the moon p     the shock given by the phial is in proportion to the size of it the thinness of the glass and the number of points in contact with it is surface p     an extract from mr martins essay on electricity   the electric matter is emitted from some sort of bodies when rubbed which are called electrics p      by other sorts of bodies therefore termed nonelectrics it is not emitted    it will run off to all nonelectrics but it restrained by all electrics    it shines like a flame and is emitted with a snap if toward a non electric the fire is condensed less or more and so appears of a bluish purple yellow or white color  when the electric fire is not so much condensed as to explode as in thunder and lightning it goes off in a dilated stream of purple flame greatly resembling that part of the aurora borealis which appears in streams of light  when it is little condensed it appears bluish as all other faint lights do when a little denser it appears purple when denser still it looks yellow like candle light when highly condensed it is clear and white like the light of the sun so the white lightning is of all others most fierce so phosphorus rubbed a little spends itself in an harmless blue flame but upon a greater attrition kindles into a white flame and burns with an outrageous and unquenchable fire p     and as lightning pervades soft substances unhurt but dissolves hard and compact bodies so electric fire pervades the soft muscular parts of the body but violently strikes the bones and tendons again as those denser parts of lightning which we call thunderbolts striking against hard bodies glance by reflection to different parts so this fire striking against the elbow is reflected from thence across the breast to the other elbow p     indeed different persons are affected thereby in a very different manner some are extremely capable of it some not and some are not susceptible of it at all a person for instance who has the smallpox cannot be electrified by any means whatever p  0  experiment   on the axis in the center of my globe is fixed a circular string of threads when the globe is at rest they all hang down when it is in motion they all extend themselves from the center strait toward the inner surface of the globe like the spokes of a coachwheel which they nearly touch thus they continue till the electric virtue ceases and then gradually fall down as at first p     exp   while they are extended if you move your hand toward the surface of the globe they move every way toward the hand hence we see the amazing subtlety of this fire which pervades glass as readily as if nothing were in the way  exp   place a hoop of fine threads round the globe in motion and all of them will stand perpendicular to the surface hence we learn that the electric power acts equally both within and without the globe and in directions perpendicular to it is surface  exp   if the room be then darkened the ends of the threads on the outside will be all tipped with fire but those within are not which shows that this power acts only ab intra outwardly p     exp   an iron rod being hung on silken strings with one end about of an inch from the globe will at the other end which terminates in a conical point emit a purple flame diverging every way hold your finger within of an inch and the fire will issue more largely p     exp   hold your finger still nearer and the rays will be so condensed as to run to it in a stream of yellow flame which is also sensible to the feeling as a gentle wind and smells like the fire of phosphorus  exp   if you put your finger on the rod the flame instantly disappears the fire all running off upon the finger but take it off and the flame appears again  exp   apply your finger near a tin tube so suspended and you may see the fire and both hear and feel the snap p     exp    under an electrified plate put some leafgold or other light substances on another plate unelectrified and it will be attracted and repelled alternately between the two plates for each time it touches the lower plate it discharges he electric fire and so becomes again attractble p     exp    if to a gun barrel you adapt a small tin cup and pour in water a person holding his finger perpendicular over the water within of an inch of it is surface will find the water rise in form of a cone to meet his finger and from the top of it a stream of fire will issue to the finger and snap as usual p  0  exp    a dry sponge is an electric but if it be dipped in water and then hung on the barrel put your finger near it and the fire issues out and the drops which before fell very slowly will now fall very fast if the room be darkened they will appear as drops of fire p    exp  0 a siphon hung on the cup drops very gently till it is electrified but then the water runs in a stream which in the dark is like a stream of fire  exp    open a vein in a person standing on the rosin and the blood will fly out to a certain distance but let him be electrified and it will spin out with a much greater force and to a far greater distance  exp    if mercury be put for water the electric force is something greater but in no proportion to it is density  exp    when the mercury is saturated the electric streams will issue through the wire more copiously than from the phial of water and will snap of themselves which the streams issuing from the water never do  exp    the electrified phial will not retain the fire very long but if you hold it up in a dark room it will be seen to go off from the point of the wire in a small white flame p     exp  0 a cup of water held by an electrified person will emit fire more forcibly than his body p     exp    a person standing on the ground cannot easily kiss an electrified person standing on the rosin p     exp    if a square piece of leaf gold be placed between two plates about two inches asunder one of them electrified the other not at first it will be attracted and repelled alternately till in a while it will lose its motion and remain suspended between them p     exp    if the globe be exhausted of air and then turned the electric fire will act wholly within the globe where it will appear in a dark room as a reddish or purple flame filling the whole globe but this as the air is readmitted into it will gradually disappear in this case the electric fire is confined within by the elastic air on the outside p    an extact from mr watkinss account of electrical experiments when the machine is to be used the globe should be wiped clean with a clean dry warm flannel it is pivots oild and the cushion and phial warmed in damp weather there should be a fire in the room p    exp   let an unelectrifyd plate with scouring sand upon it be held   or   inches under an electrifyd plate and the sand will be so attracted and repelled as to resemble a stormy shower p     exp   if a glass ball of   or   inches diameter be hung by a wire to the gunbarrel and a ball of of an inch diameter exceeding thin placed on a smooth plate be brought near it this will not only be attracted by the large ball but will perform continual revolutions round it exactly as the planets do round the sun p     exp   hang a loadstone on the barrel and a key on the armature of it and if you bring your finger near the key it will snap and emit fire a plain proof that the electric and magnetic power no way hinder each other p     exp    a sparrow killed by the electric shock was found livid without as if killed with a flash of lightning and most of the blood vessels within were burst animals shocked on the head if not killed are commonly struck blind p     exp    ice held by an electrifyd person will fire warm spirits of wine p     exp    mr watson put an ounce of oil of vitriol an ounce of iron filings and four ounces of water into a flask an ebullition ensued an electrifyd person applied his finger to the mouth of the flask the vapor took fire and burnt out of the neck a long time p     from an experiment made by mr watson and others it appeared that the electric fire circulated without interruption from the surry side of the thames over westminster bridge to the westminster side and thence through the river to the surry side again which is upwards of  00 yards spirits of wine also were fired at the same distance  from this and several other experiments it appeared that distance simply considered did little if at all impair the force of the electric shock  they afterward conveyed this shock through a circuit of four miles and sound the motion of the electric fire to be nearly if not quite instantaneous  ii i have been hitherto endeavoring to make electricity plain i shall endeavor in the second place to make it useful    this ethereal fire in its unmixt state seems too violent an agent for the human body to bear therefore the wise author of nature has provided the air to temper and adapt it to our use so tempered it is the grand instrument of life it gives and preserves says bishop brkeley a proper tone to the vessels it promotes all secretions keeping every part in motion it pervades the whole animal system producing great variety of effects various vibrations in the solids and ferments in the fluids indeed from many experiments we know it communicates activity and motion to fluids in general and particularly accelerates the motion of the blood in an human body this is quickened three or four pulses in half a minute by a person only standing on glass and being electrified and it is certain many bodily disorders may be removed even by this safe and easy operation    but because plain matters of fact weigh more than nice speculative reasoning with all who do not obstinately steel themselves against conviction i shall first briefly specify several disorders wherein electrification has been found eminently useful and then subjoin a few particular instances    the disorders in which it has been of unquestionable use are agues st anthonys fire blindness even from a gutta serena blood extravasated bronchocele chlorosis coldness in the feet consumption contractions of the limbs cramp deafness dropsy epilepsy feet violently disordered felons fistula lacrymalis fits ganglions gout gravel headache hysterics inflammations kings evil knots in the flesh lameness leprosy mortification pain in the back in the stomach palpitation of the heart palsy pleurisy rheumatism ringworms sciatica shingles sprain surfeit swellings of all kinds throat sore toe hurt toothache wen   it will be easily observed that a great part of these are of the nervous kind and perhaps there is no nervous distemper whatever which would not yield to a steady use of this remedy it seems therefore to be the grand desideratum in physic from which we may expect relief when all other relief fails even in many of the most painful and stubborn disorders to which the human frame is liable  i have scarce known an instance wherein a few shocks all over the body have failed to cure either a quotidian or tertian ague  anne heathco daughter of mr heathcote brasier in long alley near moofields was seized in may last with what is commonly called an ague in the head having a violent pain in her head face and teeth after trying abundance of remedies to no purpose she was in august electrified through the head immediately the pain fixed in her teeth she was electrified four times more and has felt nothing of it since    having observed says mr lovet the great efficacy of electrical either in soon relieving most kind of inflammations i was inclined to think the same efficacy would appear when it was applied to st anthonys fire but when a case offered the inflammation was so great that at first i almost despaired of success about noon i made the first trial by drawing off sparks while the person was electrified on the rosin before night the angry swelling was much appeased and in a few days quite cured    a boy about seven years old says mr floyer a surgeon in dorchester was taken blind suddenly in both his eyes without any previous pain or fever three or four days after he was brought to me he was as blind as if his eyes had been cut out taking the case to be a perfect gutta serena in both eyes i told his parents it was my opinion he would never see again however i determined to try the electric shock and the next morning fastening a wire coming from the phial to his leg and another round his head i brought the latter near the conductor and gave him four shocks successively that day he was put to bed and continued there sweating profusely till the next morning when he agreeably alarmed his father by crying out he could see the window when he was brought to me the second time he could see when i put my hand between his eyes and the light of the sun this gave me encouragement to repeat what we had done the day before the next day he could a little contract and dilate his eyes the third day he could distinguish objects the fourth colors the fifth day after repeating the experiment his sight was perfectly restored and the eyes in every respect as well as if no disorder had happened to them    from a gentleman in newcastle upon tyne i have the following account last week a poor man in sandgate that had been blind twentyfour years was led to the machine i set him upon the electrical board and drew sparks for about twenty minutes from the pupil of his eye after he had rested himself a little and was able to look up he told us he could see sidgate which he had not seen for many years before he could also distinguish objects in the room and was able to walk home without a guide he came a second time and was so much better that i imagine he did not think it necessary to come any more    he adds about the time i wrote last a young woman was cured of a fourteen years blindness she was able before she went home to distinguish one letter from another    from the same person a few days afterward i received the following lines  the cure of the blind man of newcastle has spread through all the country in consequence of which i am much against my will become an oculist  i have had several in hand and among the rest a girl about seventeen has been with me about three weeks her case is owing to a film or skin grown over her eyes it came by the smallpox about twelve years ago her friends have had all the advice and used all the means in their power but to no purpose except that she has lost her left eye irrecoverably by one of the persons they applied to  when she came to me the iris of the right eye also was very near covered with a very thick skin so that she could do very little more than distinguish day from night it was grown much worse this winter and was so bloodshot and angry that i told her mother i could do nothing for her however she made such a lamentable complaint that i consented to try  the method i have taken is drawing sparks from her eye and sometimes giving shocks from her head or neck down her arm to carry off the frequent complaints of pain and dizziness in her head which never fails of succeeding in about ten minutes we have electrifyd her about half an hour twice every day the skin wastes gradually and grows thinner and less every day so that now the color of the eye appears through it except in the middle and toward the nose where the film at first seemed twice as thick as the rest the other day as i had her under hand she saw the buttons of my shirtsleeve and of my coat and yesterday saw the teeth of one of her companions that was laughing at her but her eye is so weak that i advise her to make very little use of it yet    a person having a dark livid spot under his eye from a blow three days before it was in less than a quarter of an hour quite taken away by drawing the sparks from the parts mr l  here extravasated blood was manifestly dissolved and resorbed into the vessels i have lately known an instance of this kind one whose eyes were almost beat out as they term it by the same operation lost all the swelling and the blackness too in twelve minutes   0  a woman troubled with a bronchocele the most obstinate of all swellings whose neck was eighteen inches and one half about is already so far relieved that the largest part of her neck is but fifteen inches and an half about the smallest not thirteen and the swelling now waes so fast that there is hopes of a perfect cure mr l  she applies the wire from the phial to one side of the swelling and laying one ed of another wire to the other side of it then guides the other end of that wire to the electrical apparatus     william jones a plaisterer living at mr frazers in king street seven dials sell from a scaffold on thursday feb    last he was grievously bruised both outwardly and inwardly and lay in violent pain utterly helpless till saturday in the afternoon when he was brought carried by two men to be electrified after a few minutes he walked home alone and on monday went to work  mary osgathrp had her foot bruised by a stone falling on it which occasioned a running sore it continued though frequently healed for a time upwards of eight years but was entirely healed a month ago by electrifying and has never broke out since     a number of moderate shocks daily repeated for some time effectually cure coldness in the feet it does not fail     angus minnon of fullers rents in holborn was afflicted with a violent cough till his strength wasted away and he had all the symptoms of a true consumption he was electrified three times about eighteen months ago and restored to perfect health  elizabeth collis a child of twelve years old living with mrs wragg in windmill street was so far gone in a genuine consumption that she was judged to be quite past recovery this summer she was electrified four times and has been quite well ever since     a man at upsal in sweden whose kneejoint had been contracted above five years originally from an illcurd rheumatism was quite restored by drawing off sparks for a few weeks      mrs m  d  of worcester was long afflicted with a most violent cramp in her legs this disorder seized her before she was twenty years of age and continued till she was upwards of seventy this was most violent when she was in bed at which time she was forced to tumble out on the floor sometimes twice or thrice in the same night it was attended with exquisite pain bursting the small blood vessels which afterward appeared of a livid hue for a considerable time  she was entirely cured in a few days by being electrified once a day thus having taken off her shoes she put one foot on the end of the chain which came from the charged phial putting the lower end of a wire to the other foot so that this being touched both legs might receive the shock at once mr l  i never once knew it fail in this disorder     deafess rising from hardened wax or following a fever is cured by only drawing off sparks this was frequently tried at upsal at stockhlm a gentleman of distinction who had been almost deaf a considerable time with a singing in his ears was perfectly cured in three or four minutes  a young man who had almost lost his hearing for six months by violent vomitings which forced blood out of his ears was perfectly cured in a few minutes  samuel jones gardener at lambeth marsh in the year of the great frost leaped into the thames to save a man from drowning hereby he became so deaf of both ears that he could not hear any sound at all were it ever so near or ever so loud in february last after being once electrified he could hear the noise of a coach at some distance after the third time he could hear the sound of the machine he came no more so it is supposed he is well  a man fiftyseven years old who had been deaf for thirtytwo years was so far relieved in a few days as to hear tolerably well  a girl of seven born deaf who consequently could notspeak began presently to hear words which were spoken very loud in her ear and could repeat some of them in a few days  i have known hearing hereby given to a man born deaf      in may      came to me one mary smargins born in the island of nevis in the west indies    years old she had been so deaf from a cold at first for seventeen years as not to hear any one unless they were very near and spoke loud her deafness had no intervals she always heard the least with the left ear on saturday may    the phial being electrified by two turns of the wheel only i applied one wire to the left temple just above the ear the other to the opposite temple she felt a small warmth in her head chiefly from ear to ear i repeated it four times a little stronger each time the warmth increased at each shock and though i struck her at each ear alternately she always felt most warmth at the deafest ear at last she complained of small twitchings in her ears chiefly in that ear and cross her head no other part of her body felt the shocks the warmth increased all day with twitchings at intervals the next morning i repeated the experiments which then affected her arms and body also the twitchings were more violent the warmth greater round the ears chiefly the deafer ear these effects continued all the day and she heard considerably better but toward evening by sitting man open window she catched cold on which the warmth left her and she felt very chill all over her body on monday she was extremely ill with pains all over her on tuesday she was much better and felt the same kind of warmth round each ear again on wednesday the noise and beating in her head which she had had from the first of her deafness much abated in the evening a violent shooting went across her head from the left to the right ear on thursday i repeated the experiment some minutes after blowing her nose there issued corrupted matter with a small quantity of clotted blood from this time she had little noise or beating in her head and heard perfectly well  she had a great cold and her eyes were much inflamed when i began the experiment but after the first days experiment the inflammation decreased and after the second was wholly removed  i was able at first to bear the strongest shocks but after repeating them some weeks i could hardly bear a small shock and a strong one occasioned a violent convulsion of the muscles of my arm and body  upon rubbing with my hand a globe while turning i have several times felt a violent headache but it always went off upon discontinuing the rubbing i have known many persons who found an unusual pain for some days after receiving the shock  thus far mr wilson  i am surprised at this for i never yet knew any person man woman or child sick or well who found any such inconvenience only i have known rheumatic pains increase on the first or second trial which were afterward perfetly cured  mary baker chairwoman aged    living at mrs hunts in neals yard near the seven dials having been long ill of a dropsy was admitted last year into st georges hospital but on nov    she was discharged out of it as incurable as she was also from the westminster infirmary in spring last she was electrified and soon after parted with several gallons of water after being twice more electrified she was well and able again to earn her living     it is of great use in the epilepsy or falling sickness unless it be hereditary and then it does at least no harm  the following case seems to have been of the epileptic kind e  t  of worcester was troubled with a very uncommon disorder for ten or eleven years the contraction usually began under her left breast and darted thence to her right and back again to her left breast and shoulder it then struck down to her elbow wrist and fingers which were instantly so contracted that if she had not time to catch up something in her hand the nail of the forefinger would so wound the thumb as to make the blood run down the contraction likewise twisted and drew her hand behnd her turning it up again to the shoulder the intervals of this terrible disorder were uncertain sometimes she had ease for a month sometimes she was taken twice in a day it would yield to no medicine but was by this method entirely cured in a few weeks she stood on the wire coming from the phial and then touched the apparatus with a finger of the hand affected by this means the fire circulated the narest way through the body to the arm and fingers this was several times repeated to each finger mr l     sarah bettesworth aged    then living in cowlane was some years since seized with so violent fits that five or six men were scarce able to hold her in autumn      while she was in one of them the apothecary being asked by her master if he should electrify her made light of it however he did so applying the bottle to one shoulder as she lay on the ground and the wire to the other on the first shock her struggling ceased and she lay still at the second her senses returned after two or three more she rose in good health some months after she relapsed and was electrified again and again entirely cured last easter she fell into a fit again through a fright but by a few shocks was cured and restored to health  william matthews schoolmaster aged thirty two living at the foundery near moorfields had epileptic fits supposed to be hereditary from his birth till he was six years old thence he was free till thirteen they then returned on occasion of a fright and continued so to do twice or thrice in a year till he was seventeen from that time they came almost every month till the year      since then they usually returned about once

all can all england afford such a cure as this wrought by a course of medicines   0   john webb of worcester seventy years of age was much disordered in his fet for ten or twelve years the pain resembled that of the gout and such a coldness attended it as was scarce supportable if he warmed them by the fire they raged still more as also when they began to be warm in bed the nails of his toes very frequently dropped off the toes in general appeared livid and frequently large black or bluish spots were formed at the end of them or on the top and sides of his feet these when they first came were exceedingly painful but after a time grew dry and hard his heels likewise were generlly puffed up like blown bladders  all these complaints gradually decreased till they totally went away by his being electrified once a day for some time and afterward twice a week at first only sparks were drawn afterward the chain was brought from the phial to the part affected of one foot then one end of a wire was laid to the part affected of the other foot and the other end of it brought to the conductor mr l     felons are speedily cured by drawing sparks if any disorder be superficial this operation suffices but if it lie deeper then the giving of shocks is found to be more effectual       ann t  had a fistula near the inner corner of her eye which healed and broke again seven times the last time it healed it continued well for some time after which it began with a small swelling till it was as big as a filbird from the time she was electrified by drawing off sparks it gradually decreased till it was entirely dissipated mr l  eliz johnson daughter of mr johnson gunmaker in the towr was taken on newyearsday last with sharp pains in her bowels which soon threw her into convulsionfits these returned five or six times a day for ten or eleven days she was electrified all over and had no fit for eight months she was then frighted into a fit she was again electrified and continues well      a young lady had been affected with fits near seven years which seized her without any warning and threw her flat on her face quite insensible these frequently returned twice in a day this was attended with almost a continual coldness in her feet her stomach also was much affected she stood upon a wire coming from the coat of the phial and to complete the circuit another wire was laid upon her head by which means the fire was conveyed to that part by this means both the fits and coldness were gradually removed and a complete cure effected mr l       elizabeth b  near the old hills a few miles from worcster had for fifty years been afflicted with severe fits they threw her down to the ground quite insensible sometimes twice or thrice a day she had tried many remedies but to no purpose from the latter end of the year      she received several shocks an inveterate headache which attended her quickly decreased and in some months her fits too totally ceased mr l     electricity was tried at upsal in three cases of a ganglion which it perfectly dispersed     slight attacks of the gout are suddenly and effectually removed by drawing sparks from the part affected  a person who within the space of two or three years had had several attacks of the gout since the first of which he had always a stiffness and pain in the joint of one of his great toes and for a considerable time in both was quite cured by setting him on rosin while one on the floor drew sparks from the diseased parts mr l  william sinnock cabinetmaker in lombardcourt seven dials was in feb      seized with sharp pains in his feet which continued three months and for six weeks disabled him from doing any work they returned in february last he was electrified twice and has felt no pain since  thomas willis chairmaker aged    was for many years afflicted with the gravel in the kidneys in july last he was electrified twice after the second time he parted with a large quantity of gravel he was electrified twice more and has not found the least complaint since     in very bad fits of the headache i have often says mr l used this remedy with surprising success  a man of bromsgrove afflicted for near a fortnight with a violent and constant headache was twice electrified by a few light shocks with half an hours interval and entirely cured mr l  a  t  of whitechappel had a violent head ach which continued for seven or eight weeks after she was electrified the pain increased for three hours it then gradually decreased till she was quite well this proves that it may remove even a disorder which at first it seems to increase     samuel rennee aged seven the son of richard rennee weaver living in yorkstreet by taking cold was seized with a violent headache which continued with short intermissions for above a year tuesday march        he was moderately electrified all over the pain lest him from that hour      a man who had a fixed pain just above his eyebrow for several days was by little shocks at the part cured in a few minutes so was mr higgins of worcester of a periodical headache which commonly began at five or six in the evening and affected him from the top of his right temple to his ear till he went to bed this was cured only by drawing sparks mr l   m  t d  s was afflicted with an almost constant as well as violent pain in the hinder part of her head for near three quarters of a year especially when she lay down in bed being then so intolerable she could not forbear shrieking having used many other means with no effect she was electrified once a day this presently relieved sometimes by sparks sometimes light shocks and in some weeks perfectly cured her mr l   e  t  was troubled for eleven years with a severe headache which baffled all the efforts of medicine by moderate shocks applied to her head she was cured in a few weeks mr l   0 abigail brown aged    then living in redcrossstreet was from a child frequently afflicted with a violent headache in octobr      she was electrified five days successively having one wire applied to the fore part another to the hinder part of the head and receiving seven or eight shocks each time hereby she was entirely cured nor has found any pain in her head since unless occasionally for want of sleep  sarab webb wife of mr webb tallowchandler in grubstreet aged    was from  0 years old subject to a violent pain on the top of her head this frequently obliged her to keep her bed nor could any remedy for it be found in december last she received gentle shocks from temple to temple and from the forehead to the back of the head this was done threedays successively and she was entirely cured     richard outen ropemaker aged    living in bunhillrow was troubled with a violent headache over the eyes before he was ten years old arising from a blow on the head he was scarce free from it a month together for above    years it used to throb and shoot through the head so that often he was almost distracted in december      he was electrified once receiving three shocks by one wire applied to the forehead and another to the back of the head he was worse than ever for some hours till he went to bed but awaked in the morning perfectly well and has continued so ever since     in deep hysterical cases the person ought to sit on the rosin at least half an hour every morning and evening at first sparks may be drawn off and afterward shocks given more or less as the disorder requires this would seldom fail of the desired effect as may well be supposed from the following instances  a young gentlewoman about  0 miles from worcester sometime after she recovered from a fever was seized with violent hysterics which soon deprived her both of memory and understanding the fire was conducted through her head by sparks and shocks several times a day during the week she stayed at worcester in which time not only her memory but her understanding was perfectly restored  mrs higgins of worcester was troubled for above ten years with an hysterical disorder and a coldness in her feet from these that coldness moved gradually up to her head in half a minutes time which then seemed a palsy in the head soon after her teeth would chatter as in a violent ague thence the shaking proceeded to her arms and whole body and was so violent as hysterics mimc most distempers as to resemble st vituss dane  sometimes sparks were drawn sometimes shocks were given and she stood near half an hour daily on the rosin in less than a fortnight the fits went entirely off and in a while after the coldness of her feet mr l     a person had rigid knots in the thigh like what appear in violent cramps but not so hard or painful these were entirely dissipated in a minute or two only by drawing sparks     one at upsal who had lost the use of his limbs from cold for several years was in some weeks quite restored  one at stockholm who had used crutchets for seven years could walk without them in thirteen days  eliz buttle nurse aged    living in featherstone street in may last such a pain round her anklebone that she could scarce set her foot to the ground this grew worse and worse for about a month in june she was electrified seven times round the ankle and thrice upon the knee immediately her lameness ceased with the pain that occasioned it     mary lallo aged    then living in st thmas the apostles when she was a child was taken with a pain in the bone of the left leg from the knee to the bottom of the foot which then felt as if a great weight had been fastened to it this continued by intervals for many years frequently she could not walk without holding some one and then in great agony in febuary      she received several small shocks on the knee within four or five minutes the pain instantly ceased she walked home quite well and has continued so ever since  a girl also of    who after the small pox had been lame from four years old having been electrified about twenty times walked without a staff  a young lady from a strain in the kneejoint or rather the crural ligament was quite disabled from walking about three quarters of a year after when she came to me the muscular part of the leg was much fallen away and a continual coldness attended the foot  i ordered her to sit on the rosin at least half an hour daily and to receive several shocks through the disordered part of the knee the first month there was little effect in the next there was a visible alteration for the better the third she could walk a few steps without any crutch or staff in the following month she seemed quite well and left off electrifing but after a time relapsed after the relapse the progress of the cure was more tedious and it was four or five months before she could leave her remedy quite off  she was then totally cured mr l      a young woman drinking at a cold spring when very hot was seized with a kind of fever for a quarter of a year many red spots then appeared on her arms and soon after a thin dry crusty substance which appeared rather as scales than scabs from her elbows down to her fingers this leprous disorder which many call a surfeit continued near three years indeed it lessened the first and second winter but the third was the same as in summer  by drawing sparks once a day from the parts affected in three weeks or a month all the scales disappeared mr l      a gentleman in worcester had a mortification which began in his toe and in spite of all the means used gradually increased he was shocked and the mortification stopped but on his neglecting this it began again and increased so far that the case seemed desperate yet on his being shcked again through the mortified part such a change appeared as astonished the surgeon who owned it had done more good in two days than had been done in six weeks before mr l     a clergyman near london had from a child almost a constant pain in the lower part of his left side he was once electrified by standing with his left foot on the chain and has never felt the pain since  james kitely of lambeth had a sharp pain in his left side about three years after being electrified three or four times the pain left him and came no more  mary burges living at the tu in knavesace had a pain in her side for seven years in may last she was entirely cured the first time of electrifying

as if it had been broke by following the prescriptions of dr l the pain after a fortnight settled in her shoulder there it continued so violent that often she had scarce any use of her arm she afterward used abundance of remedies for above two years but all to no effect on tuesday march         she received two strong shocks on each shoulder which made the skin red and sore that night she was in more pain than usual trembled all over and could get little sleep the next morning she received several shocks all over and so on thursday morning and evening after the second time her pain was gone and she had the full use of both her arms  john reed cabinetmaker in wardrstreet was for six years afflicted with violent pains in the back of his neck in spring      he was electrified about thrice a week for a month and quite cured   0 joseph jones was taken about march         with a violent pain in the stomach he received the same day a few gentle shocks the pain went off and returned no more  mary peltecree warper living in primrosestreet was troubled six months with a pain in her stomach and back accompanied with extreme weakness and faintness which made her incapable of her work by the advice of a physician she took many medicines but with no effect five weeks ago she was electrified receiving the shock through the stomach this was done for five days successively she has been perfectly well ever since  h  w  throwster aged    living in fleetstreet bednal green not being regular was taken a year ago with a violent pain in her stomach she had the advice of a physician and

september      with a violent disorder in her stomach which felt as if it was ready to burst and often made her sweat to her fingers ends this continued for upwards of four months and gave her little rest day or night in february following she was seized with the rheumatism throughout the left side for this having quite lost the use of her left arm she came to be electrified she felt the shock

pleuritic pain for which he lost an unusually large quantity of blood immediately he was seized with a strong palpitation of the heart which continued more or less without the intermission of one day for more than sixteen years in february      while i was electrifying for a pain in my stomach which was wholly removed by one shock he came in and said my heart is very bad and i think i will try it too he did so receiving a shock through the breast and has been ever since perfectly well     a citizen of upsal who was thoroughly paralytic was perfectly cured only by drawing sparks  april   th      a remarkable case happened at edinburgh robert moubray in the beginning of january was struck with a palsy of the tongue and soon after entirely lost the use of his speech last week he began being

leatherpipemaker aged    living in barnabystreet was seized with a palsy in the tongue on july   th last it grew worse and worse till saturday    and then quite deprived him of his speech he was electrified for five days by drawing sparks from the tongue and shocking him all over and hereby not only his palsy was cured but convulsions also which he had had for four years  mr p had a year or two ago a slight touch of a palsy on a sudden his arm dropped down quite without strength and though after chafing it well he recovered the use of the upper and middle joint yet the lower part was still so weak that he could by no means write his name but by a few shocks in the arm he was effectually relieved  the same person had lately a much worse stroke all his right side was so affected that he could not walk without two to support him after he had been electrified three times he could walk with the support of one only and in a short time he was perfectly well he used to stand on the chain with the right foot and touch the apparatus with his right hand mr l  i have not yet known any instance of this kind many paralytics have been helped but i think scarce any palsy of a year standing has been throly cured     a gentlewoman in london who for several years was never long together without sharp pains in her knee which seemed chiefly rheumatical was freed from them in a moment by one single shock  john ramsay cabinetmaker living in the strand by being very wet catched a violent cold in the latter end of june      this occasioned a rheumatic pain which fixed in his

and was frequently constrained to shriek out like a woman in labor i came before nine after the second shock he felt some change after the third he was able to raise himself a little after two more he rose and walked about the room and before noon he was quite easy and well  sarah guilford aged    living on saffronhill was for upwards of seven years so afflicted with the rheuma ism in her right

been most affected  ann cardiff servant at the golden head islington aged  0 about sixteen years ago was taken with a violent rheumatism by catching cold in lying in it returned every year and the last winter took away the use of her limbs she followed the advice of several physicians till they pronounced her incurable october    last she was electrified first by general shocks then through the parts most affected the first and the second time it made her extremely weak and faint the third time she was better and after nine times all her weakness and pains were gone  margaret virgin silkwinder aged    living in whitehorseyard seethinlane was troubled with the rheumatism before she was ten years old and more and more till when she was about twelve she was confined to her bed for near    weeks from that time she was seldom free from it so that many times she was quite incapable of business last winter she was so ill as to be forced to quit her work not being able to lift an arm to her head in january she was electrified twice the first time all over the second time through the left arm the use of her arm was immediately restored her pains entirely left her and ever since she has been more capable of any kind of work than she had been for twenty years  mary trumbel of whitecrossstreet aged    began to be afflicted with the rheumatism before she was  0 years of age it returned in her shoulders or head every winter and for the three winters last past so increased that she could by no means turn either arm behind her and was extremely painful last winter it was worse than ever a little before christmas she received five or six small shocks immediately she was easy recovered the full use of both arms and has retained it ever since  william g of the little minories

of worcester troubled with a suitica for some years was cured at once by shocks conveyed to the parts affected mr l  mary butler aged    living in eaglestreet redliensquare having been afflicted with the sciatica for more than twenty years was last month electrified ten or twelve times and has been easy ever since  it seems the electric fire in cases of this and of many other kinds dilates the minute vessels and capillary passages as well as separates the clogging particles of the stagnating fluids by accelerating likewise the motion of the blood it removes many obstructions     thomas nevil weaver aged    living at the bottom of vinecourt spittlefields when about    years of age sprained his loins so violently that from that time he found a continual weakness frequent pains and an inability to do any hard work on thursday march  0th      he was electrified receiving five or six shocks through the parts affected when he went home he felt no pain but much soreness on the part on which a red spot appeared like a small pins head but the next morning he was perfectly well and has been ever since stronger than before the first hurt  francis halfpenny tailor aged  0 living in redcrossstreet southwark when about    years old had a fall from a tree by this he received such a sprain that he could not walk twenty yards unless exceeding slow without a gnawing aching pain down his thigh about the middle of september last he was electrified through the upper part of the thigh this was repeated at five or six different times the first shock removed the pain down to the knee at the third electrifying it went quite away and since that time he has been full as well as he was before his fall      e  h  of tedny had a very painful sweling in the ball of her great toe for some years having made use of many other means in vain she was at length electrified after the first operation by drawing sparks the pain was much abated and in a short time the swelling disappeared and the pain left her  mr joshua w  of pershore was troubled for seven or eight years with a pain in his second toe though nothing was to be seen it was as tender as a boil and the pain was so great particularly in walking that he at length determined to have it cut off by drawing sparks he was cured in an hour  a gentleman of worcester ran a bodkin into the side of his hand near the fore and middle fingers the wound was no more than the prick of a large pin yet in three or four days a swelling came both in the palm and on the back of the hand  the fifth day a surgeon was called who for three months dressed both the inside and the outside of the hand to no purpose a caustic was then applied but with no more success than all the other means  finding no alteration nor likelihood of any he was electrified twice by drawing off sparks on the inside of his hand at the bottom of the middle finger in four days it broke and in about three weeks healed mr l  jane davison quilter aged    living in quaker street had about six years ago a violent toothache which occasioned a swelling in her right cheek this continued gradually increasing on the inside of the cheek till it grew into an hard fleshy lump despairing of any help she let it alone till last month she was persuaded to be electrified she received several strong shocks through the part after this was done the first time the swelling not only increased exceedingly but was violently painful the next day the other cheek likewise swelled and that swelling spread through the upper lip across the mouth nevertheless she was electrified again two or three days after it broke and for two days together discharged abundance of purulent matter mixed with blood but in a few days the wound was entirely healed and all the swelling gone      e  t  taking cold was seized with a sore throat which grew worse and worse for six days she then could not swallow even a bit of bread soaked in tea the same morning she was electrified so as to direct the shock in a right line through the part affected by the time she got home she could eat any thing two shocks more made a perfect cure      the toothache if proceeding from a scorbutic habit from hollow teeth or from a defluxion of rheum is presently assuaged or totally removed by this remedy  this may frequently be done by drawing sparks from the tooth or check in moe stubborn cases by moderate shocks the sooner you touch the phial the weaker the shock so that you may lessen or increase it at pleasure  in giving the shock the most effectual way is to bring one wire under the chin and tooth if it be on the under side and lay the end of the other wire on the top of the tooth if it be on the upper side bring one wire to the top of the head over the tooth and apply the other to the bottom of it mr l  sarah ellison the wise of john ellson abovementioned catched cold in lying in which fixed a sharp pain in her teeth and the side of her face she used all manner of means to remove this for upwards of six years among many others she had at several times three teeth draw and was fourteen times blistered but without effect in july     she received six shocks through her head the pain ceased immediately and returned no more   0  a person had a swelling supposed to be a wen between the neck and the shoulder blade as big as an egg and nearly as hard which had been growing to that size for several years she had not been electrified many times by drawing sparks for five or six minutes every day before it began to soften soon after it discharged a thin humor through a small orifice and continued discharging and softening more and more till it was entirely dissipated mr l     whoever desires to see a more circumstantial account of many of the preceding cases with the names of most of the patients and their places of abode may consult mr lovtts treatise it is wrote not only with admirable judgment but with an excellent spirit a principle of benevolence to human kind may be easily observed to breathe through the whole nor can any lightly condemn it but those whose interest naturally leads them to decry whatever would lessen their own gain     after relating these cures mr l himself adds i cannot deny but i was much astonished at seeing such mighty things performed by electricity but after having attentively considered the nature of electric either its great subtilty and power its active and enlivening qualities and its mighty tendency to accelerate the motion of the fluids in general and of the blood in particular i would add and to pervade the finest arteries and nerves to dilate their obstructed or contracted orifices as well as to restore the tone of any muscle or fiber which is either impaired or destroyed i concluded that all those surprising effects were no more than the necessary consequences of so powerful an agent when thus determined and directed and the helping us in our bodily infirmities was one great end it was ordained to serve probably the great end after it had been thus fully and plainly discovered to us     it were greatly to be wished that the gentlemen of the faulty would strictly examine the nature properties and effects of this sovereign remedy for such it unquestionably is particularly in nervous cases even in those cases which the common materia medica will in no wise reach but it is not to be expected they must not disoblige their good friends the apothecaries neither can it consist with their own interest to make although not every man yet so many men their own physicians which would be the unavoidable consequence if a regular system of practical rules were formed from a process of experiments whereby a sensible man might judge in what cases it would cure and in what not and in what manner it might be most effectually applied in any case wherein it was proper  in order to prevent any ill effect these two cautions should always be remembered first let not the shock be too violent rather let several small shocks be given secondly do not give a shock to the whole body when only a particular part is affected if it be given to the part affected only little harm can follow even from a violent shock  for instance in a palsy of the tongue the shock may be given to the tongue only by applying one wire to the hinder part of the neck and another to the tongue and if in any case there be danger of too great a shock it may easily be prevented  it is highly probable a timely use of this means might prevent before they were throly formed and frequently even then remove some of the most painful and dangerous distempers cancers and scrophulous tumors in particular though they will yield to no other medicine yet discovered it is certain nothing is so likely by accelerating the contained fluids to dilate and open the passages as well as divide the coagulated particles of the blood that so the circulation may be again performed and it is a doubt whether it would not be of more use even in mortifications than either the bark or any other medicine  before i conclude i would beg one thing if it be not too great a favor from the gentlemen of the faculty and indeed from all who desire health and freedom from pain either for themselves or their neighbors it is that none of them would condemn they know not what that they would hear the cause before they pass sentence that they would not peremptorily pronounce against electricity while they know little or nothing about it rather let every candid man take a little pains to understand the question before he determines it let him for two or three weeks at least try it himself in the abovenamed disorders and then his own senses will show him whether it is a mere plaything or the noblest medicine yet known in the world
