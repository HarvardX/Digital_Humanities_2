respect  j hawkesworth omagh jan        preface tired with the importunities of many i at length selected the following trifles and presume to present them to the public eye  how far idle verses essayed in early age may meet the public approbation i cannot tell but he who endeavors well surely ought not to be censured  juvenille compositions sometimes meet more goodnatured readers than rigid critics may such be the fate of this volume written by an author between his fifteenth and nineteenth years  such sensations as are in the bosom of a penitent criminal certain of immediate death but unknowing whither his immortal soul may go such strong sensations now beat high in me whilst with a trembling hand i pen these lines fearing the fatal consequences of flying from the safe scenes of privacy to meet in giddy haste the public eye  but as some of the productions of my boyish fancy had appeared in the different periodical papers i the more readily consented to this publication and the poems such as they are will be here found more correct  some people will perhaps accuse me of that vanity which so powerfully predominates in the youthful mind for attempting to climb that ascent down which so many have tumbled  in what i have written i meant well i therefore present it to the public not with the arrogance of an assuming young man but with all the submissive modesty of an author  the vanity of friendship a poem written after the manner of swift      the vanity of friendship a poem written after the manner of swift inscribed to rice harrison esquire who not needs shall

ends in short who had so many friends but now alas the time was come when jack had lost his stately home when he consumed his whole estate that fame might sound him goodly great when he had run in

will screen from laws turmoils till fortune more propitious smiles his case to samuel then he told him samuel cordially condold but costly aid he would not give yet seemed from teeth to greatly grieve when jack saw his dissembling mode he cursed the gifts he ill bestowed and hied to jamess to sojourn  but supplication meets with scorn he raped at door sent in his name the servant with this answer came  his honor says he does not know you and bid me the halldoor to show you thus baffled and abused by two he went to john and told his woe but john sir with a bow polite exclaimed his house was

feeling   i was brought the other day by some of my juvenile acquaintance into a cockpit and there heard the most gentle reproof that the tender lips of parental love could utter johannes a sage gentleman whom curiosity led to the pit chanced to see his son gallus at the opposite side holding wagers when the battle was terminated johannes asked gallus did he lose no replied he with the quick voice of joy i have won a crown i am sorry for it returned johannes then after shaking his head and making a long pause he continued  i hope that crown may not cost you five hundred pounds  these few words made so deep an impression on my mind that i instantly left the pit and vowed never to enter one again when i had got home reflection and sober reason made me plainly see the barbarity of that which is termed an amusement only by the unfeeling inconsiderate and mean  those people who are termed cockers are in general ignorant avaricious indolent fond of inebriety and fond of accumulating money in an easy way as they express themselves without once considering it is also an easy way of losing it what but a sordid desire of lucre makes a man go to such an opprobrious place youth should beware how they enter a cockpit if they win they bet on expecting to win more if they lose hope which is so predominant in the human mind stimulates them to bet on with the desire of recovering their own turn your steps far from this seat of immorality and corruption where the discordant voices of the blasphemers perpetually profane that awful name at the sound of which virtue shudders with a religious fear  how many illustrious personages have fallen unhappy victims to their insatiable passion for cockfighting and involved their rising families in ruin that fortune which should be theirs by hereditary right the hand of imprudence has squandered by discharging the honorable debts at the sod  the barbarity of this epidemic pastime no less affects the heart with sensations of pity than the sight of men who stake one half of their fortunes on a blackbreasted duckwing of yellow pile affects the mind with wonder a thousand pounds lost in a few minutes such in the course of years must exhaust a mans pecuniary resources were he master even of the riches of chili and peru what do cockers or gamblers of any denomination depend on chance blind chance the unpropitious termination of a single battle may perhaps hurl them headlong from the glittering pinnacles of magnificence to the vast profundity of poverty and from thence to the low gloomy mansions of confinement where they may pass away their dark days till death transports them from the miseries of life  the pathetic pope strongly inveighs against the cruelty practiced by man to inferior creatures and the unmanly diversions of cockfighting and throwing at cocks have been reprobated by him and many of his cotemporaries i knew a gentleman who tortured every creature that his visitors might compare him to domitian because that monster once filled the powerful chair of dominion i have seen him put two flies on a needle one at the eye the other at the point and while they in agonies would pull against each other he would cry  behold domitian  i shall conclude this paper with the story of zai which i recollect to have heard in the happy days of boyish innocence zai was the only son of amazar the wealthy who had amassed immense riches by bringing merchandise from egypt and selling it again at considerable profit amazar at the age of twentynine met with an irreparable loss which drove him to the height of melancholy this was the death of the beautiful hasora to whom he had been eight years joined in all the endearing bands of wedlock  the only consolation the disconsolate amazar had was in the glooms of retirement caressing little smiling zai the sole pledge of that pure love he had borne the amiable hasora  zai had now seen seven summers his lovely visage and engaging ways made him the delight of every who frequented his fathers house but let us now reverse the leaf behold the youth when the cold hand of death consigned the tender parent to the grave possessed of those riches which the hand of frugality had gathered to keep him independent of mankind the promising hope of the respected  amazar now spends his whole time in the company of ismaen the gambler see see how quickly he empties the foaming goblet of intoxication are those pale lips the once rosy ones of zai which were so often wont to kiss the cooling cup of limejuice and water  yes heaven they are  but what a metamorphosis  zais constitution was soon broke his money as soon spent what could he do he ran in debt to support nature and his merciless creditor thrust him in the dismal confines of a prison where he expired a victim to his inordinate desires  appendix appendix in the north of ireland i met with a gentleman to whose good nature i am indebted for a copy of the following poem it is the production of the late rev william pilkington curate of omagh capital of the county of tyrone this genius is reputed to have been a son of dean swifts by the celebrated mrs laetitia pilkinton i am told he was the exact image of swift and a man whose abilities were universally acknowledged his satiric talent which was very great procured him high disrespect from the brethren of the gown he was a graceful and eloquent preacher but not a very rigid observer of the doctrine he preached the burden of a large family with the attendant anxieties and cares extremely depressed the generous spirit of this pleasing companion thinking to drown the memory of his afflictions he frequented bacchanalian societies and latterly drank strong liquors when alone this at length put a period to his existence

the sparkling glass or splendid board yet you from harm i would still protect nor ever meant you disrespect nor have you met with aught abuse but what arose from want of use why then this rage let us
