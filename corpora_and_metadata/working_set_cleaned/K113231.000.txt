kind indulgence i am come to ask whilst i pursue my arduous mimic task  the paths contracted which i have sought to tread chance pops each fancied figure in my head no dint of labor gathered by degrees i cannot assume an object when i please but just when nature throws it in my way i take the hint and bear the form away i would not by this mimic trade offend my only motive is a private end chinking the pocket and who is here will say that i am to blame since all mankind are apt to do the same yet some there are methinks i hear em too who cry this fellows plan can never do damn his wry faces  he pretend to sing would he were taken off but once  to swing did ever mortal such an effort see he would fain persuade you that he takes off me how could the puppy ever think to please no more like me than i to hercules mimicking w  dw  d should i engagement seek  and by the by should i to aristophanes apply the satirist perhaps would thus reply  engage you sir no that can never be two of a trade you know can never agree you say i broil my characters like sprats and make me write a comedy of cats croak too the hellish language of a crow when all the world can tell i dont know how would you engage try to engage the town and then like me you will hobble to renown live by your wits sir that is the way to thrive why how the devil do you think i live i will take the hint and on myself depend i never yet found manager my friend by you supported boldly i will oppose my mimic powers against a host of foes roscius shall wake and strut about the stage and limping proteus grin with comic rage feeble othello shall the state address and toothless shylock lisp in macbeths dress declaiming richard in short accents breathe and bind his brows with a victorious wreathe the silken sons of italy shall squall and john roastbeef in vulgar accents bawl in fine  as far as mimickry can go at least as far as i can make it do these and some others of the changeful crew shall rise for judgment to your candid view and if some merit you shall chance to find some little genius in the lecturers mind oerlook his failings set his heart at ease nor damp an ardour which aspires to please lectures on mimickry a sudden transition from the gloomy shades of oblivion to the sunshine of prosperity has different effects on different objects the man of sense shows it in a modest reserve a coxcomb in a superficial glare of ostentation which renders him the laughing stock of all mankind a tomboy is always pleased with a new coat let it fit him ever so ill and when he should rather hide himself his vanity leads him into the great world hence he is proud of establishing a character though a ridiculous one  i beg leave to give my auditors a novel scene in another peep behind the curtain  fiddlestick hollo you carpenters what the devil are you all about there   carpenter drawing up the clouds to make room for an italian sky   fiddlestick why you make such a tugging and a pulling you will tear all the clouds to pieces   carpenter somebody has taken away the laurel from the figure of apollo sir and we have not another in the house   fiddlestick oh i have got that it fits me very well and i intend to wear it in the character of apollo at the masquerade this evening there there what the devil are you about now hey   carpenter it is only one of the ropes that snapd   fiddlestick the devil snap you what do you mean by that do you know that the fourth part of every rope in this house belongs to me   carpenter twas only the rope that was tied about the neck of apollo there is rope enough left to hang all the apollos in england   here jerry dowlas comes to offer himself dowlas a good morning sir pray sir is not your name mr fiddlestick   fiddlestick timothy fiddlestick esquire if you please   dowlas i beg your pardon sir   fiddlestick well what do you want here   dowlas sir i came to offer myself   fiddlestick offer yourself to do what   dowlas to play sir   fiddlestick hey well what do you play the fiddle   dowlas no sir   fiddlestick can you sing   dowlas no sir   fiddlestick then i would not give a fig for you   dowlas i am a tragedian sir   fiddlestick damn your tragedies and your comedies  i wish they were at the bottom of the sea with all my heart  it is a great pity they were ever introduced upon the stage  there is more sound sense in a good solo or a concerto than all the tragedies and comedies in the world but here comes mr smallcoal  you would better speak to him hey what well  mr smallcoal here is a gentleman who says he is a tragedian   smallcoal a tragedian is he sneering did you ever play in any company   dowlas oh yes sir very often   smallcoal what company sir   dowlas sometimes in one company and sometimes another   smallcoal but what company sir   dowlas sometimes at the faulcon in fetterlane sometimes at the horn in doctors commons sometimes at the gooseandgridiron in st pauls churchyard   smallcoal i never saw such a goose as you are i am sure laughing can you read sir   dowlas o yes sir   smallcoal can you write   dowlas yes sir   smallcoal then i will be damned if you will ever do for me for you fellows that write and read are always too conceited there is no making any thing of you   dowlas i thought it was impossible to be an actor without such requisites sir   smallcoal you thought  who gave you the privilege of thinking sir  that is another proof of your stupidity  an actor should never think for himself   dowlas no sir   smallcoal no he should always leave that to a manager  did you ever hear mrs hartichoke   dowlas no sir   smallcoal no  call her in  now you shall hear the very pattern of an actress enter hartichoke prithee my dear girl give me your favorite speech in shore  oh she has all the charming monotony of the cuckoo   hartichoke such is the fate unhappy women find and such the curse entailed upon our kind that man the lawless libertine may rove free and unquestioned through the wilds of love while woman sense and natures easy fool if poor weak woman swerve from virtues rule if strongly charmed she leave the thorny way and in the softer paths of pleasure stray ruin ensues reproach and endless shame and one false step entirely damns her fame in vain with tears the loss she may deplore in vain look back to what she was before she sets like stars that fall to rise no more  smallcoal there there what do you think of her   dowlas very clever indeed sir  but surely she could never have arrived at such a pitch of excellence without knowing how to write and read   smallcoal not a word sir  not a syllable  all nature and my assistance  besides when she has lost the power of acting  she will be able to get her living by squeezing oranges and lemons at a coffeehouse squeezing his hands   dowlas sir a good morning to you  i am sorry i have been so troublesome   smallcoal so am i sir hey fiddlestick but i am afraid you have the greatest trouble to come   dowlas what trouble sir   smallcoal the trouble of taking yourself away as you came hey fiddlestick   dowlas it is a sad misfortune to be bit by a mad player  however i have one

and your  za za za  this is a genius damn such geniusses i say exit   it will be acknowledged i believe that some the most ingenious of mankind who now stand dignified in the court of fame have been often more indebted to chance than industry  painters have drawn conversation pieces from the figures they have fancied to have seen in a fire beautiful landscapes from the broken plaster in a wall  formidable caverns and terrifick mountains from the inside of a rotten cheese  musicians have composed favorite airs from the creaking hinges of a door the gurgling in the neck of a bottle or the wind whistling through some little cranny  famous actors too have often formed their mode of speaking from the howling of a wolf the roaring of a lion or the braying of an ass  there is a modern theatrical hero whom i have heard many praise and highly too as hamlet says who fell in love with the monotony of a chimney sweeper  sth now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our stern alarms are changed to merry meetings grimvisagd war has smoothed his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys ehamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute  little peter pollish took his hints from a different object this gentleman has often been heard to say that a windmill was one of the most graceful structures in the world and that it always put him in mind of a flying mercury but how he made it out heaven only knows it is certain he had studied the motion of a windmill and the figure of a mercury for he had ever the action of the one and the attitude of the other it is said he was a profound politician too and has been often heard muttering to himself concerning the precarious and ticklish finances of poor old england our trade declining frequent bankruptcies combustions in the state city squabbling public complainings and no popery  once in a sudden gush of exclamation he broke out in a quotation from barbarossa sometimes ingeniously making one syllable into two  sigy now sleep and silence  beroods over the city the devoted sentinel now takes his lonely stand and idly dereams of that tomorrow which shall never come  in this deread interval oh busy thought from outward things descend into thyself bring with thee awful conscience and firem resolve that in the approaching hour of blood and horror i may stand unmoved and there he left off as stiff as a statue  a certain veteran of the stage perceiving a dearth of genius and the theater in an absolute decline stood forth at seventyfive to save it from a total fall othello he observed had lost his legs and roscius his inclination  shall we for ever bid good bye to romeo  adieu to castalio  and farewell to macbeth  no i will step forth myself and convince the world there is no occasion for leg tooth or eye to play such characters and without any of those corporeal requisites my auditors shall see that i will act them to a charm  mkn if it were done when it is done then twere well it were done quickly if the assassination could trammell up the consequence and catch with its surcease success that but this blow might be the beall and the endall  here but here upon this bank and shoal of time wed jump the life to come  but in these cases we still have judgment here that we but teach bloody instructions which being taught return to plague the inventor evenhanded justice returns the ingredients of our poisoned chalice to our own lips exit  end of the first part second part the italians make the ladies the objects of their imitation who does not laugh to hear a gigantic hero from whose appearance one might expect the roar of a bellowing taurus warble out the commands of the conqueror of the world with the execrable squeaking of a guineapig  gaudani what alas shall orpheus do whither go without his love euridice oh answer me i have lost my darling dove etc  i know no difference there can be in this between a cty in breeches and a sso in petticoats  cty when bickerings hot at high words got break out at gammyoram the golden rule their flame to cool is push about the jorum with fist on jug coifs who can hug or show me that glib speaker who her red rag in gibe can wag when her mouths brim full of liquor  it is not every ear that is so refined some will listen with more satisfaction to the natural and unaffected manner of an english singer than to the debilitated extravagance of an italian  dully with early horn salute the morn etc  now i will beg leave to introduce the manner of a gentleman who has a little more pudding in his voice  bnnr this is sir a jubilee music without melody verses without harmony that is sir a jubilee etc etc  there is generally a greater share of affectation in singers than in actors and they are frequently more indebted to art than to nature to imitate the dissonant jargon of an unpolished african requires a mimical capacity but no great share of vocal abilities  dbdn deer heart deer heart what a terrible life am i led etc   the italians whose ancestors were the sweetest of all poets seem to have abolished that celestial science as if they thought poetry and good sense unnecessary where there is fine singing a famous air in an italian opera has been literally translated thus where which and wherefore there this and therefore   paintings in still life seem to have lost their estimation  but we have capital singers in still life in high esteem who think it unnecessary to move hand or foot nay sometimes indeed even disdain to open their mouths  mrs barln from morn to night alone i set for liberty i sigh and fret like robin in his cage mamma too kills me with her care she tells me i am young and fair at a bewitching age etc etc  our most sanguine wishes are frequently disappointed by the most provoking contrarieties some there are who possess enchanting tones but are destitute of taste and on the other hand we meet with those who are endowed with every requisite but a voice when therefore a passion for imitation is guided by taste and judgment it will always give satisfaction and we are ever pleased to view good action fine feelings and superior taste supply the deficiency of a voice  vrnn think ah think within my breast while contending passions reign how my heart is robbed of rest and in pity ease my pain to a lover thus distressed torn with doubting hopes and fears every moment till he is blessed is a thousand thousand years  when an actor or a singer is possessed of an extravagance of action it destroys all effect of sense or sound and renders the most elegant composition farcical  mrs bddy the pride of all nature was sweet willy o the first of all swains he gladdend the plains none ever was like to the sweet willy o none ever was like to the sweet willy o etc etc  i have heard the tree of our immortal shakespeare celebrated in the melodious strains of an itinerant crier of wooden ware  by my bowl or platter buy my wooden ware kr behold this fair goblet was carved from the tree which oh my sweet shakespeare was planted by thee as a relic i kiss it and bow to the shrine what comes from thy hand must be ever divine all shall yield to the mulberry tree bend to thee blessed mulberry matchless was he that planted thee and thou like him immortal be  as i have already given mungo in distress and amintor in love give me leave to introduce them once more in the rustic ballad singers  vrnn ye warwickshire lads and ye lasses see what at the jubilee passes etc etc  dbdn be proud of the charms of your county where nature has lavished her bounty etc etc  vnn old ben thomas otway john dryden and half a score more we take pride in etc etc  dbdn there never was sure such a creature of all she was worth he robbed nature etc etc  end of the second part part iii it rarely happens that we meet with a roscius whose imitative genius can comprehend the great variety of human passions and arrive at superior excellence in each  there are many characters in which the figure of the figure of an actor gives us a disgust and were they possessed of every other requisite the part would always show an awkward deficiency  a crookbackd richard six feet high will prejudice us against the character  an othello or a mark anthony have the same effect when represented by a diminutive figure  but i have seen those characters acted by a modern tragedian who has impressed on me so strong an idea that i have sometimes thought he had just left the great originals and came to mimic them on the stage  bry most potent grave and reverend seniors my ever honored and approved good masters that i have taken away this old mans daughter it is most true  true i married her the very head and front of my offending has this extent  no more   it has been too often observed the managers of our theaters pay too little deference to their kings i have seen his majesty of denmark represented by a gentleman who would have made an excellent waiter at a tavern and cymbeline put into the hands of another who would have done more credit to snuffle in the mayor of garrat than any other actor on the stage  hst i have surely seen him his favor his familiar to me  boy thou have looked thyself into my grace i know not why  or wherefore to say live boy never thank thy master  live and ask of cymbeline what boon thou will fitting my bounty and thy state i will give it  when a hero makes his complaints they should be expressed with the spirit of a hero but when he whimpers them like a schoolboy it renders him perfectly ridiculous  plr it was upon a time  a curse the clock that struck the hour when i brought proof enough to make the noble leonatus mad whereupon methinks i see him now  rddh ah so thou do italian fiend ah me egregious murderer spit and throw stones at me set the dogs in the street at me let every thing be called posthumous leonatus oh imogen my life my wife my imogen  comedy has never a better effect on our passions than when two characters are happily contrasted like light and shade in painting each serves to foil the other  the ludicrous vociferation of a major sturgeon and the vacant timidity of a jerry sneak give a double satisfaction being opposed to each other  dialogue aristophanes fte billy buckram wstn buckram your servant master stophanes   aristophanes ah what my little waddling swaddling billy buckram how goes the world with you  i thought old charon had punted you over long enough ago  i thought you was lost   buckram no i am not lost  i was just found  i

and not very big oh had you been alive and there to see johnny pringle jenny pringle and little piggy johnny pringle sat him down and cried jenny pringle laid her down and died so there was an end of all the whole three johnny pringle jenny pringle and little piggy but i am aweary of this wicked world for all that   aristophanes its more than i am   buckram and yet by your shining face it seems to make you sweat too   aristophanes huh huh sweat  fry broil burn  i broil characters as you broil sprats   buckram broil characters i gad that is odd enough   aristophanes aye broil characters  what think you of dr squintum peter paragraph sir luke limp mother cole and the whole tribe of the nabobs   buckram oh they are parfectly burnt to a cinder now the town wants more coals fresh coals or any thing fresh    aristophanes they shall have em  i will tell you a secret  shut the door  i am going to have a new pantomime  i will tell you another  i shall play harlequin myself  such a magazine for the next campaign characters never thought of by any bard before  but to return to my pantomime  you shall be my perriot   buckram perriot oh if you make a peer of me master stophanes you will be a princely gentleman indeed   aristophanes hold your tongue you damned fool you i shall be harlequin and a nimble one   you must keep close to my heels if you can  and when we are pursued by all the mob of pantomimical figures with their constables staves redhot pokers pitchforks etc at last we are drove into some turnagain lane  how are we to make our escape    buckram i cannot tell how indeed   aristophanes you cannot why then i will tell you  i will turn you into a lion and myself into an ass   buckram i beg to be excused master stophanes   aristophanes hold your tongue ye fool   when the pantaloon and his mob comes to close quarters  you shall roar like a lion and i will bray like an ass   buckram cannot roar like a lion master stophanes   aristophanes i warrant you i will make you   buckram how will you make me   aristophanes by a charm to be sure   buckram but what sort of a charm   aristophanes you shall hear  when you are standing in a corner sucking your thumbs and wont roar i will lay my stick thawk across your shoulders  and i warrant you will roar like a lion in spite of your teeth   buckram but shall not i make use of the same charm to you master stophanes   aristophanes i beg to be excused  i have my part by heart  for instance what mob can stand this brays like an ass away they run  there is a touch for you   buckram a touch indeed   aristophanes now what is the next scene   buckram nay i cannot tell   aristophanes some beautiful waterworks  with a fine cascade  when i the gentle harlequin by the side of my pretty little columbine shall be discovered playing some tender air on my flute  suppose i give you a touch from bona figliola   buckram bona fififili   aristophanes oh that is too hard a bone for you to pick   buckram oh i shall like to hear it master stophanes though i dont understand it  i am not so much out of fashion as that   aristophanes why then you shall have it imitates the flute upon his stick there there is not that enough to charm any body  well in the midst of our felicity we are attacked again  and how do you think i got rid of em   buckram drown em all i suppose   aristophanes no  i will turn the waterworks into fireworks   buckram into fireworks   aristophanes yes fireworks  and you shall be my little matchman  i will be torre behind and you shall take care of the rockets in front  here goes

master stophanes   aristophanes why then youre a damned fool that is all  and now billy now for it   buckram now what is next   aristophanes why i shall turn the cathrinewheels into a couple of cats

scene   buckram but how will you introduce em master stophanes   aristophanes how  why you shall hear  suppose two cats on the top of a house making love to each other washing their faces for all your true lovers should go with clean faces hey billy  the gentleman shall address his lady thus  mimicks the cats moll mollrow mollrow now the she cat curwell curwell curwell now the he cat cur you love me cur you love me now the she cat no cur no cur no now the catastrophe hoo hoo oh you whore imitates the fighting of cats there is for you billy there is for you boy  if there should be a serious face in the house while that scene is going forward i shall pronounce it the face of a murderer or a methodist   end of the third part jerry sneaks return from the regatta i am just come from gatta am drenched like a hound it is twenty to one that i had not been drowned there were wife and myself and some brave jolly boys in a sixoard cutter amidst all the noise when a blundering broadbottomd country barge came bearing down on us  and then to our charge we were all overset should surely have sunk and have gone to the bottom if we had not been drunk there was never a one dead of us all but my wife but they towed her to shore and soon brought her to life she was dead as a fish and as pale as a clout but they rubbed her and scrubbd her and rolled her about till they made her to talk and to walk and to see and now she is as blithe and as brisk as a be but we boarded our cutter and ventured again determined to see what there was to be seen such a wonderful possy of pennants and colors such splashing and dashing with oars and scullers skiffs wherries and barges all huddld together such crying for shelter on account of the weather the people on shore who paid pounds for a seat got wet to the skin and were glad to retreat while we on the thames were so snug and so quiet amidst all the rain all the racket and riot there were courtiers and cits and the gay savageweavers with fifes and with drums with bones and with cleavers the men were all red and the women all white oh what a beautiful wonderful sight the like i never saw since born of my mother should i live till i die i should never see another for should i have been drowned again and again i would have gone every day such a sight to have seen there is nothing in drowning you know nowadays they have found out such wonderful comical ways were you dead as a stone you have no reason to fear they will bring you to life with a flea in your ear the barges some looked like a body of gold some new ones were made  out of those that were old with awnings of silk with some figure or trinket and many were covered  with naught but a blanket with whitelead and blacklead with paint and with pitch some large and some small some ragged some rich such a sight such a noise and such a sweet smell was never yet equaled on earth or in hell but we got to the gardens and landed at last in hopes to partake of the princely repast the tables were covered with many a thing you would have thought they would set out a fine feast for a king the aldermen fixed em each man to his plate one took off his wig and then rubbing his pate looked eagerly round with a face of despair for fear that he should not come in for his share then stuck his knife greedily into a ham unbuttond his waistcoat his stomach to cram laid bones of fat capons in many a heap that he eat and he drank till he fell fast asleep i was hungry too for as i am a sinner i would never a spare minute to get me a dinner so took me a plate and then slily sat down determined to get me a bit of the brown was resolved to have it the risque of my life in spite of that termagant teazer my wife but i would scarcely got down a good mouthful or two before she came up and made such ado cried i never should more go with her to a feast said i looked like a hog that i eat like a beast i would have looked if i could still more like a swine would have swilld all the night but could get me no wine and mine was the fate too often out of twenty there was naught but the artful appearance of plenty to canal next i went and there dipped in my hat to get me some water  there was plenty of that i heard some of the people most bitterly curse but i took it like marriage the better for worse the people all round seemed in wonderful pother did nothing but grumble and look at each other to me it appeared like a scene of confusion without a beginning or without a conclusion all the folks that were  turk christian or jew seemed plaguely puzzled to know what to do by the fate of st peter and well too they might twas the very first time they had seen such a sight twas a kind of rehearsal where none knew his part to act a regattas a wonderful part there was none of them perfect to be sure it was plain twill be much better done when they play it again but they all from that day have been fond of the water not a father or mother not a son or a daughter but what have sat off for a draught or a dip to get themselves cured of the scurvy and hyp oh were you at margate southampton or brighton to see them all sousd  it is enough to delight one it is sheepsheering time so they go there to feast the first to be washed well and then to be fleeced the townsmen have all got a wonderful knack of touching your pocket and stroking your back but give them a chance once of taking a pull at a fat golden fleece and they will have all his wool if you would not be apt now to think it too long i would finish my story good folks with a song song the books of brighton tune cold and raw the north does blow i the country is moorish the natives are boorish though ignorant yet they are cunning these are excellent places if youre of false faces with abundance of fleecing and funning ii i wish you much pleasure and mirth without measure my wishes i am sure they are fervent you may all believe me i do not deceive ye so believe me your most humble servant end of the fourth part a lecture on lectures by lancelot last as delivered with applause in the comic mirror written by g s carey ladies and gemmen i am going presently as you will presently find to give you a lecture on lectures but first and foremast i think it necessary that i should give some account of myself because why a man who can give no account of himself is to all intents and purposes a vagram  first as to my name lancelot last at your service by trade when i used to follow it a shoemaker but happening to see one of your lectures in our town i was inspired as it were and knowing him to be no better a schollard than myself i took off my apron threw down my lapstone kicked up my last gave up my awl and so sat off to lecture  i was a long time before i could determine with myself what subject to begin upon at last stronomy came into my head but i found the stars were out of my reach and whenever i dipped into that science i was presently lost as it were in a cloud  then ottamy came into my head i was at home to a peg in ottomy for as to plucking out a tooth picking out a corn or curing the gripes nobody is more skilful than myself but when i came to the imputation of a leg and as i am naturally tenderhearted i found it too cutting a business for me  then says i to myself what think thou lancelot last of chemistry i thought as how that business was something in my way for as to your consalves and presarves nobody is more larned in that way than myself but then thinks i again some of my auditors may have an objection to the name of physic and physic nowadays is nothing but a drug  then heraldry came into my head but happening to see the kings arms on a hackneycoach i thought the dignity of that science was gone to the dogs  i was advised by a friend to set about midwifery but my mind was big with a thousand apprehensions whenever i thought on midwifery so i gave it up because i thought i should never be able to deliver myself on that subject  i would have set about a lecture on heads but my friend alexander stevens had dissected every head in the kingdom so well that i should have been set down as one of his blockheads if i had meddled with ever a one  i thought the heart would be no bad subject but i could find so very few good ones that i had not a heart to set about it  thinking of bad hearts put the law into my head and i thought a lecture on the law would be no bad thing then says i to myself the law is no good thing in itself but would it not be better if i could make a good subject out of it i thought and i pondered about it till i found myself like a poor fly in a cobweb the law always puts me in mind of a coffin  once in your never out again  if none of these subjects will do what in the name of lucifer will do  lucifer who the devil is lucifer  a great orator mayhap  oddsbobbs an orator  it directly came into my head that a lecture on oratory would be the best thing i could set about and so i begins my lecture on oratory  ladies and gemmen now according to the learned and i am something of a schollard myself oratory means jawing because why why because no orator can speak without his jaws perhaps you will think i cannot give you a latin devination for it now you will find yourselves mistaken what is english for os why bon to be sure and the jaws being full of bones they are fixed proofs that the word oratory comes from os  now i think it is necessary that you should know what an orator is   and what is it you will say i answer it is a man  and what is he to do  i answer to speak words   and what are words  i answer letters put together but there can be no word without a wowel  because why why do you see because they cannot  what are the necessary qualities of an orator   the first he must spit then wipe his mouth then lay his hand upon his heart then turn up his eyes then out comes a word then another follows it and then like a post horse let him get on as fast as he can  an orator should be a good mimic too  oddsbobbs now i talk of mimics i must take care what i am about for i am surrounded by mimics here and they will be for taking me off perhaps now you shall see i will save them the trouble and take off myself  going off finis
