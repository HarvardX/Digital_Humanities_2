the evident advantages to great britain and its allies from the approaching war especially in matters of trade  to which is added two curious plans one of the port and bay of havana the other of portobelo  london printed and sold by j roberts in warwick lane and a dodd in the strand      price   s  february         this day is published the second edition of the evident approach of a war and something of the necessity of it in order to establish peace and preserve trade pax quaeritur bello to which is added an exact plan and description of the bay and city of gibraltar  preface the evident approach of a war having been spoken to with some approbation the evident advantages of it to great britain seem as natural to be spoken to as they are necessary  the same hand therefore applies it self to this part however officiously yet with the same sincerity to encourage the nation in the prosecuting of the war when it shall be begun  if the many disappointments which the spaniards have met with in forming their designs and the dull prospects they have before them in carrying them on have not prevailed on them to take better measures or to act a wiser part but that they will go on in spite not of reason only but even of nature that very obstinacy is an encouragement to us who have so many assurances of success in every branch of the war  but when the advantages to our commerce come to be weighed also and added to the advantages of the war one would be apt to say that as the spaniards seem infatuated in the beginning it we should all be infatuated if we did not take hold of the occasion  the author desires to capitulate for so much favor however otherwise discouraged that as this tract is written with the same sincere affection to the public interest as well of the government as of the whole nation as the former it may be accepted in the same manner he earnestly wishes that the advantages to our commerce which so evidently offer on the occasion of this war may be embraced that our trade which at this time suffers under many other difficulties may at least revive upon the follies of our enemies and by those very steps by which they think to ruin it  he is also ready at any time to disclose some remaining advantages of this war as they relate to commerce which seem yet not to be noticed by our superiors and to recommend them to practice and that without any prospect of interest or hopes of reward  the evident advantages to great britain and its allies from the approaching war chap i that the first scheme of the spaniards designs might be said to have some weight in them that the disappointments they have met with ought to have made them despair and give over but that their obstinate pursuing those broken measures notwithstanding their disappointments makes them appear ridiculous and absurd what has hitherto been spoken of the certainty and necessity of a war and of its evident approach has been founded upon the discoveries made by the enemy themselves or by the general knowledge of things as the public affairs of europe had an evident tendency in their consequences to a rupture what cannot be otherwise must be so  it is no great concession in this argument for an author to say he is no privycounsellor no secretservice man that he sees only without doors and judges only from what is to what may be the spaniards and even the imperialists who in this discourse and for this occasion in particular we call the enemy have taken care to act not as if they designed the thing should be a secret or that they would amuse the world about it and that we should be at an uncertainty in the question whether they designed to make a war of it or no they seem rather to be removing all possible doubts about it from our thoughts and making it appear not that they really intended it but that it can be no otherwise that the rubicon was past the thing determined and that it could not be avoided  this made the former discourse upon this subject bear the title of evident the evident approach etc intimating that the war was evident and visible in its approach and that they must have some defect in their understanding who made any longer doubt of it that the parties were as they say of armies in full march to engage indeed it seems to cost the spaniards some pains to obtain a belief among mankind that they were in earnest for such difficulties offered themselves in the thing it self to the meanest and most common observation that it was not easy to bring people to believe the spaniards weak enough to be in earnest or that they were really entering upon a war and especially making themselves aggressors in which they were as certain to be losers as as they were to be parties as certain to be beaten as to fight and in which indeed it could by the nature of things be no otherwise  for this reason i must confess it seemed a necessary piece of work to persuade the people to believe the spaniards intended a war and that therefore that was first to be laid down as a principle and rendered as undeniable as all principles in matters of dispute ought to be and how could this be done better than by the concurring testimony of the enemy themselves either declared in plain words at length or gathered as the natural consequences of all their actions  when i say the meaning of an enemy appears from the natural consequences of their actions i must be allowed to argue thus when i see plainly that a man resolves to put such hardships such pieces of injustice and such affronts upon me as he has good reason to know i will not and ought not to bear without the most scandalous reproach to my character the utmost damage and loss to my interest and the utmost danger and hazard to my life and that therefore he knows at the same time such usage of me will force me to resist him and repel force with force when i see him i say acting in such a manner i may without injury to him conclude that in short he designs to quarrel with me it is the natural consequence of the thing the language of his behavior speaks it as plain as if he sent me a challenge or defied me in words at length  thus in case of the conduct of the several powers we are now speaking of when we see them leaguing and confederating together forming a strength of interests entering into secret engagements and those secret engagements pointed directly and particularly at the interest of great britain at the person honor and royal dignity of his majesty as king of great britain  it we see them concerting measures for the somenting divisions feuds and factions among the people and raising rebellion and civil war in the heart of his majestys dominions  if we see them breaking all faith and honor pledged and engaged in the most solemn manner by espousing that despicable interest which they had renounced and promised effectually to abandon and reject i mean that of the pretender whom they had mutually engaged not to assist or support in any manner whatsoever and that those engagements were entered into in such terms the terms of the mutual engagement between the two courts of vienna and madrid are said to be expressly thus to undertake to place the pretender upon the throne of great britain as could not be broken without a violation of honor in such a manner as few persons of such dignity in the world could ever satisfy themselves to be guilty of  if we see them though crowned heads though princes and christian princes stooping so far below the dignity of crowned heads as to encourage treason and rebellion supporting subjects in traitorous designs against their sovereign which sovereign both these crowned heads had owned and received in the quality of lawful and rightful and had solemnly and in a particular manner engaged not to disturb in the possession of his said lawful and rightful government as above the sixth article of the treaty of utrecht runs thus the catholic king does promise as well in his own name as in that of his heirs and successors that they will not at any time disturb or molest the queen her heirs and successors of the protestant line being in possession of the crown of great britain and the dominions subject thereunto neither will the said catholic king or any of his successors give at any time any aid succor favor or counsel directly or indirectly to any person or persons who on any cause or pretense shall hereafter endeavor to oppose the said succession by open war or by any conspiracies against such prince and princes possessing the said throne of great britain as aforesaid   if we see them leaguing and confederating for the forming interests destructive to the commerce of these kingdoms laying open such branches of trade as by former leagues and conventions were expressly limited and restrained invading the commerce which it was expressly stipulated should not be invaded and breaking in upon the property of a nation as well as of particular persons in the said commerce  if i say these things are evident and that we know they are such as the nation of great britain will not sit down satisfied with or as we may justly say cannot but resent and that with the utmost indignation and that the said enemy must know they would be so resented we must conclude them likewise in earnest to quarrel with the people of great britain and to begin a war  it has not therefore been insignificant in order to convince the people of great britain of the stated and settled resolutions of the said spaniards and imperialists to insult and affront his majesty and to bring about a war in europe for the carrying those designs and resolutions on i say it has not been insignificant to those ends that methods have been taken to expose the private and as i may call them clandestine methods of the said confederating powers for the encouraging treason and rebellion among the kings subjects for animating disaffected parties and for forming unjustifiable schemes of trade such as must necessarily end in war and confusion  to prove that the enemy resolve to bring the allies to a necessity of making war in their own defense is to prove that a war will necessarily be the consequence and in such case if the spaniards resolve to prompt that necessity it is the spaniards make the war not the confederates  to put things upon us which it is not reasonable we should bear which no nation in their senses can bear and which they may depend upon his majesty will not bear or his allies either is indeed to begin the war or at least to declare the war to be inevitable  it was not therefore so remote from the question in hand to say we should go to the king of spain and to the emperor and ask them whether we shall have war or peace it is for them to answer that question and their actions have indeed determined it already they have made the war a thing not only certain but as i say inevitable nay they have begun the war by a secret clandestine conduct full of machinery full of secret and yet evident acts of hostility and by carrying on such mines and subterranean attacks against the hanover allies as they might easily know and be sure those allies would not bear and such as indeed they ought not to expect would be born with  in a word all the conduct of the hanover allies has been pacific healing and visibly endeavoring to heal and make up the breaches which have appeared and to preserve a good understanding between the powers of europe on the other hand all the conduct of the enemy has been menacing provoking and insulting clouds big with thunder though empty of force brutum fulmen noise without a bolt threats without a hand to execute pointing but not pointed in a word they have breathed war on every occasion that if possible they might make it necessary to the allies to begin it  it seems they have till this time been able to do little more than urge and provoke using all the methods possible to show their ill will except that of force which though they have been unable to make much use of they have shown evidently that they intend all that is or shall be in their power to injure and offend the hanover allies and his britannick majesty in particular that so a war may follow of course  not but that this consequence may happen much sooner than they will find for their advantage and before they may be thoroughly ready for it yet it might be very needful to ask upon what particular foundation they who are in reality so ill able to carry it on seem so very hasty for bringing it to pass whether they have not met with some disappointments since they begun thus to show themselves and whether those disappointments ever made any visible alterations in their schemes or no  that they have met with some disappointments is evident and that in several articles nothing is more certain than that they had a view of several things which in their embrio appeared probable and encouraging which they have since found reason to conclude will not answer their end and the deficiency of which renders their designs far less promising and hopeful than at first for example   it is evident they had hopes of obtaining some tolerable conditions for the preserving the east india trade that is to say for upholding the east india company erected at ostend by which commerce the imperial court depended upon it a large revenue would accrue to the public as does by the like company to the governments in england holland and france   it is evident they hoped for a mutual assistance and communication between the united powers of vienna and madrid the one assisting the other with money and the other reciprocally supplying powerful bodies of troops to carry on an offensive war the imperial court i doubt not depended upon vast supplies of money in specie at least all the stipulated sums which were very great by which money the imperial armies great and numerous already would be still made greater and more powerful and the war be carried on into the dominions of the hanover allies to great advantage   it is evident they hoped to bring off france from its attachment to the interest of the allies of hanover and particularly from its warm adherence to all such farther measures as might embarrass the said courts of spain and vienna in a war with france believing perhaps that at the worst france would not have come into an offensive alliance against spain and have turned its arms against a branch of the house of bourben in which also we doubt not they are happily disappointed   it is evident spain is particularly under a most mortifying disappointment in the british squadron blocking up their platefleet at portobelo and stopping the returns of those immense sums of money which should have been brought to europe by the galeons and the flota which had they come safe had as they tell us brought them at one time forty millions of pieces of eight in specie which with the merchandises loaded on board those ships at the same time amounted to above ten millions sterling which immense sum though much the greater part of it was the property of their own subjects and of the subjects of the allies as merchants yet perhaps the king of spain might have thought fit at such a juncture as that of a war to have borrowed some of or otherwise to have appropriated it to the public uses for the maintaining the engagements mentioned above perhaps however making satisfaction to the proprietors by some other way   i may name several other heads of disappointment in the first views which the spaniards had of these things in their order and which had they foreseen they would perhaps have acted something more warily than they have done and so have given less umbrage to the allies or at least stopped their hands till they had gotten the money upon which all the rest so much depended into their hands  but i must note as i go that here they have been overshot in their own bow here the allies have been too old for them and now it seems they are going on without their crutches walking without their legs and in a word making the war without the money i return to the disappointments  it is evident besides all this that the spaniards met with a very great disappointment in the baltic where we are pretty well assured they promised themselves great assistance and from whence we are told they expected a supply of naval strength which supply they found as effectually locked up in the port of revel as they did the money that was to pay for it in the haven of portobelo  the muscovites could no more part with their ships or cause a squadron of men of war to sail without money than the imperialists could cause their armies to march without the same supply and if they the spaniards expected it otherwise if they expected fifteen sail of russian men of war would come to their assistance without money they were much mistaken and acted more like fs than the spaniards generally used to do  nor is it less wonderful to me that the spaniards who used to act in former days with such consummate wisdom and by such impenetrable councils that it was said of don lewis de haro he obeyed the scripture in his politics whatever he did in his alms and that he did not let his right hand know what his left hand did that these very wary circumspect spaniards should let so much of their secret service come to light and act in such an unwary and impolitick manner as to have their measures be talked publicly of in the ordinary conversation at petersburgh as i have been informed has been the case  nothing can excuse the folly of it in my opinion unless i shall with some people suggest that the improbability of their schemes and chimeras being successful should argue they were not at all in earnest about them but this has so much of the jacobite in it and so little of the politician that i think it is scarce worth repeating it is much more certain that the locking up the muscovite fleet was an inexpressible disappointment to the spaniards and that it could not have been if their expectations of help from that russian fleet had not been very great  it is true under all these disappointments and more which i shall speak of presently it might have been expected the spaniards and the imperialists notwithstanding their confederacy should have laid aside the design it self and should have carried on the project no farther and indeed this gave occasion to my calling the design in general absurd and ridiculous supposing the spaniards could not be so weak as to go on with it and that if they were in earnest before they could not be so now  but since it is so that the spaniards or the imperialists think themselves still able to carry on their designs and that they are not sufficiently discouraged by their disappointments let us then turn the tables as they do and talk seriously of it as a thing really intended and here as i said before though the spaniards are not so considerable as to fright us i hope we may allow that they are not so inconsiderable as not to awaken us they are certainly strong enough to justify our preparations though not so strong as to fill us with apprehensions  hence all the precautions which have been made use of by our government and by his majestys particular direction have been not justified only but are to be esteemed as effects of the most wise and successful councils imaginable a prudence that has had something more than common in it and which has been the foundation of all those happy disappointments to the enemy happy disappointments i say to us unhappy enough to them and which at this time may be said to complete the history of the conduct and success of the vienna alliance  these precautions and provisions at the same time that they have disappointed the executions of the spaniards design have also made the carrying it on farther absurd and foolish have really turned the tables upon the enemy and made their toowellconcerted schemes become ridiculous the measures which as first proposed among themselves appeared rational and probable agreeable to a wise and prudent nation and to the counsel of able statesmen and ministers are by these means become scandalously vain and imprudent and we may bless the precaution i say at the same time that we make a jest of the spaniards obstinacy in carrying on these designs after they were so rendered ridiculous  to justify this argument let us return to the first scheme let us examine the first prospects upon which they were formed the foundation upon which the spaniards and the house of austria united and upon which the treaty of vienna was made and in doing this we shall not perhaps find the spaniards such weak people as they seem to be now we shall find that it is rather their obstinate persisting in their pursuit of a blasted undertaking that renders them ridiculous than any absurdity or incongruous acting in the first scheme or in the foundation those schemes were built upon  had the spaniards close in their councils and prudent in their conduct kept their affairs within the compass of their own cabinet as they formerly used to do and secured the secret in their own breasts had they been so far the masters of their own schemes as to have secured the supports and supplies they wanted so that they could neither have been kept from a squadron by blocking up revel or from the galeons by blocking up portobelo  had they first received the support of fifteen men of war which is said to be the number they expected from the czarina and the supply of forty millions of pieces of eight from portobelo had they brought in the king of sardinia and the king of sweden and the king of poland and the king of  and several other princes and powers into the vienna treaty as i make no doubt they at first expected and as they indeed at first reported  had they brought his most christian majesty and the states general to a neutrality as they say they have obtained of the king of portugal and the duke of lorrain and as i doubt not they earnestly endeavored with the two first  in a word had all these points been gained and had they met with none of the other disappointments already mentioned i most readily grant they had formed a body of power truly terrible and formidable to the protestant interest and we had had more reason much more reason to be alarmed and indeed frighted with the apprehensions of what might have been the consequence of these things than i hope we have had yet or are like to have now  not but even with all those i should still say and hope it would appear that the naval strength of great britain might under providence have been our protection against them all  but they have been disappointed in almost every part even the venetians themselves though a state under infinite obligations to the house of austria and to the crown of spain ever since the battle of lepanto yet so ill have they managed that we do not find they have been able to bring that wise people to espouse their cause or so much as to promise a neutrality or to act as auxiliars by land or by sea  this consideration however may serve to give us the useful reflection mentioned above  viz how just have been the cautions and how prudent have been the measures taken on this side be it by who you will to dive into these secrets to detect these contrivances and which is still more how successful happily successful the discovery how many ways has it been advantageous and particularly how useful in having given time for the preparations of the hanover allies nay for the forming the treaty it self and in having opened the eyes of other powers and bringing them into it who seemed doubtful whether they should accede or no  again of what use has the preventing those things been to us that from such a formidable appearance from such a deeplaid design that was capable of being made thus terrible they should be brought to so despicable and truly concontemptible a figure that it is hardly reasonable to talk of them at the same time or hardly think of them in the same class or under the same rank  had not his majestys penetrating councils evidently reached to the bottom of all their designs gotten the knowledge of their schemes and dived into the depth of all their most considerable projects none of all these preventive measures had been taken none of these preventive medicines had been made use of the several mischievous things which they had concluded on had not been calmly countermind and unhinged or the contrivers of them been so effectually detected and disappointed as now they are  i am far therefore from saying or suggesting that the designs and schemes of those powers had not been capable of great attempts that the naval power of spain and muscovy joined might not have been sufficient to have brought the pretender upon the stage in some part or other or at least to have given him some expectations and have put him and his easily deluded party in hopes of great things to be done for him that way or that the numerous armies of the muscovites and the king of spain united with such allies too as are mentioned might not have been able to have given us great uneasiness and to have even endangered the safety of all the protestant interests of europe as well as of these united kingdoms of great britain  as then i grant the danger to have been thus great had they gone on uninterrupted i must allow also that the discovery having been thus happy it behooves us to keep the hold that is gained to preserve the advantages of the discovery to keep the separated powers in the same state of separation to keep up the engaged powers to their engagements and by all lawful means to preserve the consederacy of the several nations that are thus confederated to cultivate the union that they are now brought to and if possible to increase it this i think is the only way to preserve our religion and liberties our superiority of power and also our commerce in the condition it stands in at this time  heavens be praised the snare is laid open the enchantment is broken the plot for the cementing the powers proposed is discovered no application can be too great no charge or expense ought to be spared to keep it where it is and therefore all that his majesty has recommended to the two houses of parliament for their engaging themselves vigorously in their own defense is of sufficient weight on that side nor can any one object that the utmost application ought not to be used to render all those attempts as abortive as i think they are now become ridiculous  to do this the proper steps are taken indeed the money is locked up and the ships are locked in the spaniards are disappointed and nothing remains but so to double and redouble the same efforts as to make those lockingsup more effectual and to take from the king of spain all hopes of removing those obstructions  i am told while these sheets were writing that i write too much with an air of contempt when i mention the spanish affairs as if a squadron of ships at portobelo could effectually stop the whole channel of silver and that not a ship could escape us that nothing could pass from america to old spain without our leave and that we are as sure of intercepting all the ships that shall stir out as if we had them in tow  but the objector is mistaken i no where suggest that the king of spain shall be able to bring no money home that we shall stop it all so that nothing shall go by us but i may venture to say the british squadrons if well posted and if the commanders do their duty will so narrowly watch the spaniards that they must run great hazards if they attempt to come away with any great quantity and that such hazards as i am persuaded the spaniards will not think fit to venture their treasure upon it  perhaps it may not be possible so effectually to shut up all the ports which the spaniards possess on the coast of america or so effectually to ply off and on upon all the coast of old spain as that no ship not one ship shall be able to slip out on the one hand or find its way in on the other without falling into our hands or into some of the hands of those that would be willing to snap and lay hold on them and i could fruitfully employ some pages here to show how and which way such things might probably be done and might more probably be prevented  but as in the first place our governors do not seem to want directions for the preventing it so on the other hand i am not spaniards enough to show the enemy if they stood in more need of it than they do how to defeat the measures taken by great britain to meet with and surprise them  but to go on i may grant that it is not probable the confederate fleets or squadrons however vigilant or how diligently soever they may guard the coast and spread the seas either on one side or the other should ever be able to surprise the spaniards so effectually that not one ship should be able to come safe in  the sea is a wide place and it must be very well spread to secure every ship and lie upon every point of the compass so that nothing should be able to go by we see here that notwithstanding admiral hosiers squadron on the coast of the isthmus and notwithstanding admiral hopson is cruising off of the southward cape yet fame tells us that three or four ships have found their way into the ports of spain and coming by such different courses as they have done it is not at all strange that they should it is true we are told they bring no silver at least none that we know of and had they been all deeply laden with silver it might have been the same thing and no body to blame neither  on the other hand we must have exceeding bad luck indeed and such as we have no reason to expect considering the numbers of our ships and the vigilance and expert knowledge of our seamen if they should go all safe and none of them should fall into our hands in which case i must add that the spaniards treasure comes in such good round lumps and such merry sums together that if it should be but now and then that a galeon should fall into our hands it would make the fortune of the war go smilingly forward on our side a few such prizes might make good a summers service and help the government to carry on the war  how often do we find the loading of but one ship amount to four five or six millions of pieces of eight and if we should chance to make such a ship or two find their way up to woolwich in a year or to deliver her loading at towerwharf it would go a great way toward carrying on the war and would be a much better way of raising money than four shillings in the pound upon land  this very consideration will no doubt exceedingly weigh with the spaniards in that particular case viz as to venturing out with their silver i mean not the loss only to themselves though that would be very considerable and the discouragement and damage to them in case of such a loss is not easily described but the encouragement it would be to their enemies the loss to themselves would be inexpressibly great especially as they have no other source of wealth no other fund of treasure all the produce of their own dominions is able to do little for them compared to this and if either the galeons are kept entirely back or should miscarry in coming forward and fall into the hands of the hanover allies we may without affronting the spaniards say they will be but in a sorry condition to carry on the war and to support their newbought friends  but that is not all the triumph of their enemies over them should the money fall into the hands of the hanover allies would be infinitely a greater mortification to spain as well to their pride as their power than the loss of the money for this would be enabling the said allies to carry on a war against spain at the spaniards expense and this i make no question they shall do though they should not take the treasure at sea at all but of that by it self  in the mean time we need not fear but we shall catch some by the way though it may not come all to hand as i said above we must have very bad luck indeed if none of their ships fall in our way and if any are taken they are generally worth bringing home  the probability of this is one of the reasons on which it has been so openly said that england may gain by a war with france but never loses by a war with spain of which we shall have room to say more from a particular enquiry into our english history where unless upon taking a spanish flota a vigo account should be given of it  viz where much should be lost and but little gained we might find large sums have been brought into england taken from the spaniards on all occasions of a war as particularly at the taking of cadiz by the english and dutch when it was said that besides the public gain upon redeeming the city and other articles all the officers and soldiers got not enough only but enough to make them rich but of this again in its place  in the mean time though the prizes we might take should be but few yet it is not unlikely we may have some share of booty in such a war as well private as public such as may amount to another disappointment to spain and that such a disappointment as spain will not easily recover and of which they may have time enough to repent and this brings me most naturally to the chief design of this work  viz the advantages spain is likely to make of this war which they are so forward to engage in or to speak plain the advantages the hanover allies are likely to make of it in our enquiry after which it may be determined by the most ordinary judgment whether i have passed a wrong censure in saying that the conduct of the spaniards is absurd and ridiculous or no  chap ii of the advantages which offer by this war to the hanover allies and to great britain in particular as they relate to the trade of the spanish west indies the necessity of a war has been spoken to the conduct of our enemies however ridiculous as well as the conduct of great britain however deliberate concur to make that necessity evident let the spaniards go on as the clarks say to a prisoner who they know will be hanged god send them a good deliverance  how backward have the hanover allies been to quarrel how have they been so far from seeking occasions that they have even refused to take occasion when offered  how reluctant have the british court been in drawing the sword how willing to prevent the feeble enemy from blustering with theirs  what pacific measures have they all along pursued what opportunities of offending have they passed over nay what needful defendings have they seemed to omit let us see a little into the nature of all these things  whether has the backwardness of the allies to a war been occasioned by their fear of the formidable power of the enemy or has it been from a full persuasion that the enemy having no advantages in view from the war could not be in earnest in all or in any thing they have said or done about it or at least would remain so but a very little while  as nothing they have said about war has been rational so nothing they have done toward a war hitherto seems to have been founded in reason  no man fights merely because he hates but because he hopes defensive war is entered into by force and necessity but it is too with hopes of being able to defend able to repel the force they fear  but offensive war is founded on a firm belief of victory and hope of conquest it can stand upon no other bottom and therefore in old times entering into war was usually called an act of faith rather than of hope being an opinion nay a confidence of success either trusting in heaven for it from the justice of the cause or in themselves from the strength of their arms  but here is a war to be undertaken with neither faith in heaven or hope on earth neither a view of defending or hope of offending how the heroes of spain will come off with the credit of their understanding that we see nothing of time must discover it  since then we cannot see any gain the spaniards can make of the war nor any loss we can sustain by it let us see what are like to be the consequences of it one way or other   if the spaniards are not like to gain let us enquire what they are like to lose by it for war is a game in which the parties seldom draw stakes they generally gain much or lose much   since the allies cannot with any manner of reason apprehend much loss by the war let us see what gain may be made by it on their side  the learned in politics have an ancient way of talking as old as queen elizabeth about englands making war which with a little amendment reads thus england may gain by a war with france but never loses by a war with spain  it is my stated opinion speaking without national prejudice that england is so far from being in danger by a war with spain that it would be no loss to us if we never had any peace with them and i believe we have much more to say for a continued war with spain than the spaniards have for a continued war with the turks and moors  it is plain as the spaniards themselves say they have carried on the war in africa these eighty years past without fighting and a commerce these hundred years without trading the moors have indeed besieged ceuta after their way for above forty years but the spaniards say that by the commissarys account of ammunition the garrison of cadiz have spent more powder at the puntals there in salutes than the garrison of ceuta have spent in defending themselves during all the siege the late particular expedition of the marquis de led excepted which was but short  this resolution of spain never to enter into any treaty with the moors has been derived from one or both of these two following simple causes   a religious rigid separation and fiery zeal against paganism and against mahomet resolving that the true catholic church should have no commerce no peace no communication with the enemies of christ the same futious zeal which they have likewise carried on against the jews or   and which i take to be the truer and more rational account of it a haughty insolence founded on the cruel animosity of that war which for so many years was carried on against the moors in spain till their utter extirpation in which war they gave no quarter took no prisoners not would admit even the remains of those people though willing to become their subjects so much as to live among them  unhappy pride how many nations as well as private people has it struck blind and covered their eyes from their own felicities the spaniards could carry on no trade in the world more to their own advantage than that with the moors of africa and yet they will not trade with them either from a civil pride that they will only make slaves of them or from a religious pride that they will not converse with infidels  trade knows no religions no sects no parties no divisions we may it is hoped be as zealous to hate gods enemies as the spaniards and yet we trade with the turks jews mahometans moors or pagan negroes and deal with the idolaters of china and malabar as well as with the native savages and cannibals of virginia and the carribees  there is no idolatry in commerce if the spaniards reject the gainful trade of africa on pretense of sanctity and religion is that a religious separation i say no it is not because they are wiser or better but because they are spaniards that is to say eaten up with pride selfopinion and haughtiness  that the spaniards might trade with the moors to great advantage is evident in that the little trade they have to africa and which they may be said to have with the place not with the people is very much to their gain and would be much more so if they extended it as they might do but they trade with the english and french merchants residing in africa not with the moors and rather buy the goods they demand there at second and third hand than take them directly of the moors so they give away their profit of the trade to the european nations to gratify the aversion they have to the people  it is an undoubted maxim in trade that we ought to trade with every nation and with every people that we can get money by this the spaniards are so far from pursuing that they will not deal with the moors even for the things which in commerce they may be said to be in distress for only because they will not deal with them  in the utmost distress which the spaniards are sometimes in for want of corn how do they choose to send to england to holland to the levant or indeed any where for corn rather than to africa rather than deal with the barbarians though the barbary coast sometimes has a great plenty and though they give two dollars per bushel for the corn which they could buy there for  s or thereabouts and sometimes for much less  in their rejecting now the manufactures of europe how easy would it be to supply themselves with a quantity of wool from barbary which with a small application would mix and work up with the spanish wool and make all the several manufactures of england to perfection and to the infinite advantage of spain it self but forsooth they must not buy or sell with the mahometans and enemies of christ though himself gave them a quite different example accepting of a draught of cold water from the samaritan with whom the jews  spaniardlike had no dealings  but contrary to the beneficent humble and gracious example of christ himself the proud spaniards pretending religion throw away their commerce scorn the blessings of an advantageous trade and rather maintain a constant unreconciled national feud a foolish faint and unactive war refusing to trade with the moors and carrying on neither peace or war  as this case stands with spain and the barbary shore the former is infinitely to blame and may be said to act ridiculously because as above speaking in the language of merchants every body should be traded with that you can gain by no nation willingly interrupt their own commerce or refuse to let their subjects trade with such other nations as they can gain by for a trading nation to prohibit the importation of such goods as they want is like prohibiting the bringing in corn in a famine or prohibiting arms and ammunition in a war when the war was hottest between england and france and the french king prohibited almost all the rest of our english goods forbidding upon the severest penalties the bringing any of those goods into any part of his dominions it was observable however that they always excepted wool leather and lead these were never prohibited the reason was plain they had none or but very little of their own and very much wanted them all nor could they be supplied at least not sufficiently from any other place  now the spaniards act by none of these prudentials for they refuse to trade with the moors or merchants of africa though they might gain very considerably by it the africans have corn copper wax wool all which the spaniards extremely want and yet will not buy because forsooth they dont like the moors worshipping mahomet as if religion had any thing to do with commerce and as if the bread made of african corn would infect their people with idolatry  now i allege and insist upon it that in a constant state of war between england and spain the case would be quite otherwise for here would be war without prohibition as in their management with the moors they have prohibition without war i explain my self thus  as we trade with spain the state of things lies so much to the advantage of spain that though the most violent war that it is possible to imagine was to be carried on between the nations the spaniards that is to say the merchants would endeavor with the utmost art to carry on the trade notwithstanding the strictest prohibitions the reason is plain  they would trade because they gain by the trade the trade to great britain takes off the growth and produce which they are ruined if they do not sell and supplies them with necessaries which they are ruined if they cannot buy in a word they have no commerce without us their whole export is stagnated their fruits their wines and their oil would rot upon the trees and not be worth gathering their lands lie uncultivated and no hands be employed the poor would starve and the rich be beggared and undone in short we buy nothing of spain but what we can very well be without and the spaniards take nothing of us but what they extremely want  on the other hand take the alternative in the commerce what the english buy in spain as it is the growth and produce of the country it is essential to the spaniards to have those goods taken off their hands and by the english too in particular the reason is because if the english do not take them off no other nation can do it for example  the growth and product of spain consists so far as it regards trade of wines that is to say sherry alicant tent mountainmalaga galitia and viana reds barcelona and been carlo reds and canary whites barcelonian brandy etc also fruits such as malaga and alicant raisins oranges limons almonds besides spanish wool spanish iron and lastly oil and soap  these things being the growth of spain the english buy in very great quantities if they are not bought off spain as to the trade of it is ruined and undone whereas if england bought none of those goods from spain they could either do without them for neither wine or brandy or raisins or oranges or lemons are so necessary to life or to trade as that we cannot as to the most of them live without them or as to trade have them somewhere else  so that upon the whole there is no absolute necessity on our side to have the growth of spain but there is a necessity on the side of spain to be traded with so as to have their goods taken off  it is true the taking off the british manufacture by the spaniards is very much the advantage of great britain but all that is advantageous is not necessary we are able to subsist in trade without the profits of our manufactures better than the spaniards are able to subsist in life without the use of them nor is that all for let the king of spain pass what negatives and prohibitions he pleases the necessity of those manufactures will make their own way and the people must wear them or wear nothing at all for they have no equivalent manufacture to place in the room of them and if they have them not from england they will have them from portugal from italy or from other places as has been the case in all the wars which have happened between england and spain in which commerce has been prohibited  but the weight does not lie in this part the spaniards may prohibit trade with england when they please they will punish themselves infinitely more than england but take the trade of america into the consideration and truly there let the spaniards have a care what they do let them take heed lest instead of prohibiting their people trading with us that is with england i say let them take heed that we  england do not prohibit their trade with one another and among themselves  by prohibiting the trade among themselves and with one another i mean for it requires explanation that it is in the power of england in consequence of this war and by the means of it entirely to interrupt nay to stop the commerce between america and old spain and thus i am come to my text namely to enquire into what the allies may gain by this war how it may be carried on by the english or british nation in such a manner as that old spain should never more have any commerce with america that is to say not exclusively that they should no more call it their own trade but the spaniards in america shall be entirely set free as to trade shall be independent of old spain receive no laws or limitations from them but be at full liberty to trade with all the world if they please or if we please rather for it would be meet to insist upon some limitation on our side too  nor do i concern the civil government of new spain in any part of this provision england or great britain seeks no conquests all they covet is to establish peace and extend trade and this we seem to have fairly before us in the approaching war if the spaniards cannot see the fate that attends them in it as it seems to me they do not they must go on and venture the consequences the thing is plain to me they run the hazard of losing all the sovereignty of their trade in america by a war  they may keep the sovereignty of the country if they please or if they can that is if the natives will submit to it but they would soon have no commerce to it no communication with it other than in common with the rest of europe  this i say england will have it in their power to limit and restrain that is it shall be in the power of england to take off all the restraints and limitations of trade which the spaniards have imposed and do now impose upon the americans and upon their own people there and lay the trade open to the whole world holding the hands of the spanish government so that they should have no power to impose any terms of commerce upon them in america any more  this is explaining my self fully as to the general head of commerce and as that commerce is now stated by the spanish government between their colonies in america and old spain or indeed all the rest of europe  it is observable that the state of the trade between old and new spain stands thus the spaniards having planted mexico and peru and all the vast country between in the nature of a colony conquered or extirpated the natives and taken possession of the country as their own in consequence of this right they give laws of commerce to the inhabitants as well natives as spaniards settled there these laws like our act of navigation are made up briefly thus viz that the spanish colonies in america should drive no trade or in any manner correspond or negotiate with any nation of europe directly or indirectly but by the licentiate or allowance of the consulade at seville that is to say the chamber of the contractration at seville and by their order and in such spanish ships and no other as shall be licensed in the same consulade or council of trade which by the way is called a royal council of commerce and so it is the license of the king  this council of commerce not only limits what ships shall go out but the persons who shall be allowed to go over in those ships and all the cargoes or quantities of goods that they shall carry with them and the returns made for them which are all registered in their books they have also other particular powers and limitations which the spanish trade is bound to submit to but i am now upon generals only i shall come farther into the particulars presently  as america is to old spain what we properly call a conquered country so they even the spaniards that are settled there are governed in an arbitrary way as a conquered nation and that notwithstanding their being subjects of old spain under the weight of this arbitrary government they submit to this among the rest that no ships are allowed to come into any of their ports from any place in the world except from old spain or by assiento from old spain as above or some place or other limited in the first establishment of old spain that is to say from guinea or any part of the coast of africa they may come laden by the said assiento with negroes and with them only  from the canary islands they may go so far as the havana carrying no other goods but wines and pipestaves the growth of that island and even of that the quantity is limited as well as the ships  thus the whole spanish interest is brought under one head of universal commerce and is called the trade of new spain or america and is strictly confined limited and restrained to old spain in particular as is mentioned above and the spaniards in america and the spaniards in old spain or new spain have no commerce or liberty of commerce one with another but by the license of their government  now there remains a question or two fit for the government of old spain to answer rather than an english author but which if they cannot answer to their own satisfaction it will be yet harder for them to answer another grand question which follows it the first questions are   are the people of new spain whether natives that is indians or natural spaniards completely easy and satisfied with those limitations and would they not shake them off if it lay in their power   are the government and people of old spain able to keep fast those bolts and bars by which the trade is limited and prevent the people of new spain trading with the europeans in case of a war   then the grand question follows viz how are the spaniards sure that if the inhabitants of america shall at any time come into a free trade with europe by the means of a war they will ever be brought to quit that commerce again having tasted the sweets of it especially if they in old spain cannot force them to it  these questions rightly inquired into will let the spaniards see if their eyes are not closed upon what precarious terms and conditions their tenure of the american trade stands and how soon they may irrecoverably lose it if they put the powers of europe upon a necessity of humbling their insolence by a war i shall speak more particularly to it in its place  chap iii the state of the spanish trade in america how though it is the property of spain yet it depends upon the justice and friendship of the rest of the powers of europe how those powers if they think fit to withdraw that friendship or are provoked to do themselves justice upon the spaniards in europe are able to lay open the trade to new spain at one blow and never suffer it to return to its former channel in almost all the treaties which the spaniards have made with the rest of the powers of europe whether treaties of peace or of commerce they have always from a sense of their own weakness in this particular case taken care to guarrantee their american commerce by negative clauses wherein the said nations and powers have generally consented not to interfere in the said trade that is to say not to suffer or at least not to authorize their subjects to carry on any trade immediately to new spain contenting themselves with carrying on the said commerce or such share of it as their subjects respectively carried on in the ordinary channel and that the spaniards should enjoy the said trade in property as their own  it is needless to look back to the several clauses in the treaties with spain and other nations for the confirmation of this article it is enough that it is particularly stipulated in the several treaties between england and spain and confirmed by subsequent treaties since that of    0 which i mention here not to enquire how well those treaties have been observed either on one side or other though it may not be improper to speak of that also in its place but i mention it here i say to let it be seen how sensible spain has always been of its own weakness and inability to preserve that commerce notwithstanding all the right they may claim to it without the voluntary consent of the european powers stipulating to yield and give it up as above  it is not thus with our possessions in america the english and even the french also have indeed the same exclusive right to the sole trade of their own colonies in america as the spaniards claim to these of new spain and they have laws likewise respectively enacted such as the act of navigation in particular binding their subjects to such particular restraints and limitations of commerce as are proper to secure the property and sovereignty of those trades to the respective powers whose subjects they are  but the english and french secure in their own strength and always believing themselves able to support and defend their own right have trusted to that strength for their defense not at all seeking the guarantee or protection of any other powers for the security of their trade  the first inference i draw from these premises is that a war breaking out supposing that part to be certain and especially the spaniards becoming aggressors and beginning that war the powers with whom such a war is begun are then evidently discharged from all the former obligations of those treaties their subjects become from that moment free from all the stipulated engagements and restraints relating to that trade our ships may then as freely trade to the ports of new spain as they may to any other part of the world i mean freely with respect to any restraint to be laid upon them from their own respective sovereigns as to the spaniards they must do as well as they can if their ships of war attack our merchants that is allowed to be but fair and we must bear it as well as we can but if their people will come off to our ships or sloops and buy or sell that can be no breach on our side for the war is begun already and all obligations to limit that commerce ceases  the argument is short and to the purpose the spaniards may indeed punish their own american subjects as they please and treat them as traitors for entering into this commerce as it is contraband and prohibited by their own laws which laws are binding to their own subjects  but the allies are by virtue of the war mutually declared against spain and by spain against them effectually and ipso facto discharged from all limitations of former treaties forbidding this commerce and i take the more notice of it because it is to be hoped the said allies especially the powers of great britain and the states general will consider very well of it at any subsequent treaty before they consent again to limit their own subjects from a commerce which is so many ways advantageous to them  what reason have trading nations to tie themselves down to the arbitrary laws of commerce which the spaniards may think fit tyrannically to impose upon their own people it is enough that they refuse to admit any of the protestant nations of europe so much as to set foot among them much less to trade and live among them a liberty which we no where deny to the spaniards i say it is enough to be thus excluded from residing among them but if their own people at whatever hazard are content to trade with us i cannot see why we should pay so much veneration to their government and their arbitrary laws as to tie down the merchants from a fair correspondence and commerce together  let trade take its course let exchange of goods and money take its due course and be uninterrupted on all sides let the spaniards and the allied powers come to a good understanding as soon as our government pleases let them fight and agree as his majesty thinks fit let the merchants be at liberty to extend the british commerce with their utmost skill this need be no interruption to a peace for what has the peaceable merchant to do with war and government  it is a strange fit of religious strictness which the spaniards think good to practice by the power of their right bloody inquisition  viz that they will suffer no strangers whatsoever unless roman catholics so much as to set a foot in new spain much less to live among them and if any englishman or dutchman attempt to live among them if they are discovered they are condemned to the mines and must go to work at potest  nay so cruel are they and so unmerciful that if an english ship should come upon their coast in the greatest distress whether in distress by storm and so wanting perhaps masts or sails anchors or cable or carpenters or in distress for provisions and are wanting fresh water bread and other provisions in none of these extremities will they as i have been informed give them relief though they are by express treaties obliged to do it a piece of inhumanity which i do not find the turks or pagans are arrived to in any of the known parts of the world  but these catholic christians on the other hand will even in these cases of distress which all other christian nations consider use all possible stratagems to get the ship into their hands in which case the cargo and ship is consiscated and the poor men though no way offending are perhaps made slaves and sent to the mines without redemption which by the way not to say any thing of the particular cruelty with which the spaniards treat their slaves and which few of them are able to survive many years is a degree beyond what is practiced either at algier or salle tunis or tripoli or by any the moors of the barbary coast  i need go no farther for the proof of these things than the authentic relations of those of our own country who have been upon the spot and who have partly suffered under those barbarities and partly been eyewitnesses to the sufferings of others and to the particular method by which the spaniards render themselves so odious to the rest of the christian world for cruelty and injustice  that no nation but the spaniards at least no christian or mohometan nation that i have read of do this but the spaniards i think i may appeal for the proof of to the general practice of the english dutch and french in like cases and in the same country  it is true that neither of these nations permit any other nations to trade in their respective colonies reasons of trade the interests of nations and the property of commerce demands it that it should be so that the trade of the particular colony may be reserved carefully separately and distinctly to the use and benefit of the respective nation to which it of right belongs  but in any of the said colonies if a ship belonging to another nation is manifestly driven into the port or harbor by stress of weather or is in distress for fresh water or provisions the government will allow them shelter and will allow them to take fresh water and purchase provisions for their voyage and this notwithstanding the strictest prohibitions of commerece according to the express scripturelaw if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he be thirsty give him water to drink prove xxv    for all ships of another nation are in the language of trade and in the sense of those laws of navigation a kind of enemy as to commerce i mean though otherwise in full amity and even if they were in confederacy it would be the same  it is true if the ship so distressed shall transgress the law and break in upon the hospitality which they meet with and shall clandestinely and privately offer to trade with the inhabitants shall break bulk as they call it and sell any part of her cargo other than shall be allowed by the government of the place for the payment of such provisions as they are allowed to buy in such case they are liable to be stopped feizd upon and the whole ship and goods confiscated and this is no wrong done to them because they are the offenders and know beforehand the consequence of such a trespass if it was discovered  yet even in this case though the ship and goods are confiscated yet the poor men are not made slaves on the contrary they are let go and may shift for themselves and are oftentimes relieved and treated with humanity as may be proved by very many examples even upon the spaniards themselves  again if a spaniard or a boat full of spaniards should come to any of the english or french colonies and land there so be it that they offer to bring no goods to land there against the constitution of the commerce mentioned above they are admitted to come on shore may land and go freely up and down take themselves a lodging may trade as merchants or dwell as strangers submitting only to all the particular laws of commerce which other people submit to nor will they meet with any molestation or obstruction while on the contrary the bare coming on shore among the spaniards in any of their american colonies is death or perpetual slavery which as the spaniards order it is worse than death for without injuring the spaniards as they are but indifferent servants when servitude is their lot so they are the worst masters in the world at least among either christians or turks  this then being the state of the spanish colonies and of the commerce and it being as is said conceded to by the european nations by sundry treaties of peace and commerce hence it follows that if any of the subjects of the said european nations tempted by the extraordinary gain of a private commerce with the spaniards do either lie off and on as they call it upon the coast with sloops and ships and so trade in the night with the spanish perioguas and canoes which come off to them as the english of jamaica and the dutch of curacao frequently do or do land in the bay of campeache and cut logwood as the english from jamaica and new england have always done or trade by force upon the coast of chili and peru as the french have done since their late license during the time of war  if i say in these cases the spaniards happen to fall upon them and take them burn or sink their ships and use the men after their usual spanish severity though it be too inhumane even to mention yet the several nations to which they belong do not usually make this any matter of complaint or reclaim the ships or men as if injuriously taken the trade it self being contraband an example of which we have lately had in some dutch ships taken on the coast of chartagena and saint martha or thereabouts by the spanish cruizers who they call guard de costas or guardships  not but that those card de costas as the spaniards call them commit several depredations and almost pyracies in taking ships which are not traders or trading and this the english complain of at this time and that i believe with good cause but that by the way  in general it is true that this right of an exclusive commerce as it was at first assumed by the spaniards as a property so it is conceded to them by the assent of their neighbor nations and agreed to by treaty the very obtaining of which treaty is a tacit acknowledgment that they are not able to maintain the exclusive commerce by their own power nor able either to restrain their own people or keep the ships of other nations from their coast and this is the reason of my entering thus far into the case of the limitations of the commerce which otherwise would not be to the purpose in the case before me  but to bring it down directly to the case in hand with a war in which war as it is evident the spaniards themselves are aggressors all these limitations and reserves of commerce cease at once the trade is laid open and it is fair working not only to break in upon their trade by all such methods as we find practicable but to make such gaps and openings in it as it shall never be in the power of the spaniards to close and make up again no not by a treaty of peace  thus the spaniards who in breach of those very treaties by which their exclusive trade was conceded to them have unjustly attempted to open the trade to a nation expressly shut out may find themselves left naked of the just defense which those former treaties always were to them and so may never be able to recover the exclusive commerce of the spanish west indies which has been of such infinite advantage to their whole nation or to call the trade their own any more  nor would it be any injustice to the spaniards especially as i say they are the aggressors in this war for if during the past ages those european nations now allied against spain were less opulent and less powerful in trade and which is above all the rest were less united in interests trading interests i mean than they may be now and were perhaps willing to keep measures with the spaniards which might in some things be to their disadvantage rather than to let them be laid too low or perhaps rather than another should reap the separate advantage of it as was the case in the late war when france obtained an admission into the trade to the spanish america i say though in those times these concessions might be made to the spaniards and their pretensions to an exclusive trade were so far confirmed it may not be always so  if this has been the case it was the spaniards business to have preserved the advantages which that divided situation of the affairs and interests of europe gave them and to have cultivated that friendship which alone was the safety of their commerce and not by such precipitate councils as these to open the door of that commerce to a people no way in condition to carry it on or to protect the spaniards in it and pretend i might say foolishly pretend to shut those out who are able to let themselves in and even to dispossess spain it self not of the trade only but of the very country too whenever they please  these are the advantages which i mean when i speak of the probable consequences of this war and this is that which i call going to the bottom of things a full enquiry into which will open the eyes of europe and let us see farther perhaps than ever before whether i have wronged the spaniards in saying they know not what they are doing that their measures are absurd and ridiculous in a word if i had said they were mad that is to say their ministers and managers whoever they are i say if i had concluded them mad or next door to it it had been in my opinion the kindest thing i could have said of them  to have said they had taken these steps with their eyes open with their reason in its full exercise with their politics free from distraction must have been to have suggested worse things of them than i am willing to charge them with and to have intimated that they were a set of men in a plot or conspiracy to betray their master and ruin their country  but be it which of the two you please it seems to me that spain may have an occasion to look back with some reproach upon its late politics in leaguing with a prince so very lately their enemy and so ill able to be their friend against two powers great britain and france so very able to ruin them and which should have been the two last nations in the world that spain ought to have differed with and out of which quarrel they will not find it so easy to deliver themselves as perhaps they imagine that is to say without deep wounds in their constitution especially as to trade and this is what i meant when i said as the clerks  culprit do to the prisoner who they know will be cast upon his trial god send you a good deliverance intimating at the same time that it is not at all likely  chap iv of the condition of the spaniards and their colonies in the west indies and the manner how this war may be carried on to the advantage of great britain without making any conquests upon the continent of america or to do no injury or offer any affront to any of the hanover allies trading nations seek no conquest aim at no increase of power or agrandising of persons or families great britain is rich and strong and opulent enough in her own wealth power and commerce she seeks no more but a peaceable possessing her just rights and preserving to her people the free extending their commerce that they may trade in peace with all the world and all the world with them  as is the nation so is the prince that governs them satisfied in his own greatness king george fights for the peace and good of his own people and of all mankind his majesty enters upon this war on the most honorable and most justifiable grounds in the world namely to establish the world upon the immovable basis of peace that every nation and every prince and every power restrained only by just and capitulated limitations may with safety enjoy their own and mutually guarrantee the property of all their subjects  contrary to the meaner principles upon which princes too often make war the king fights not for fame he is placed by heaven on a seat above all the empty things we foolishly call glory and were my business panegyric or my design flattery what could i not say here to exalt the happy prospect of his majestys present undertaking  even the king himself cannot look upon it without lifting up some thoughts to heaven and blessing the power that has singled his majesty out to act in a scene of so much superior glory superior to all the kings of the earth as it affimulates the deity and represents a king acting by immediate commission from his maker and in a perfect harmony with his providence  as thunders dissipate the noxious air and raging storms the sequent calms prepare so nations by his power restrained from feud are to their own felicity subdued with awful voice be calls at every door and warns their monarchs not to ronze his power his sword half drawn makes their commotions cease he frowns to smile and he contends for peace his rebels crushed are under conquest free and only are confined to liberty this seems then to be the state of the approaching war great britain acts the part of the worlds protector the king linking the nations in a strong confederacy opposes the aggressing disturbers with such an early and superior hand that they find themselves disabled in the very infancy of their undertaking  the spaniards obstinate and opiniatre beginning at the wrong end of their work break out into a war with so little prospect of success that the world looks on with surprise to see them act so as their friends can have no hope and their enemies no fear from the event of the undertaking  a town impregnable even by its situation and made more so by the addition of terrible fortifications open to the sea and their enemies masters of the bay able to relieve it as often as they please what strange unaccountable beginnings are these spain ought to remember their ancestors ill conduct at the siege of ostend which on the single article of its being easily relieved by sea held out a siege of three years and four months and cost the spaniards   000 men to conquer whereas being not to be relieved by sea the late duke of marlborough took it in twelve days  this town with all the advantages of situation and fortification has in it a numerous garrison of old veteran soldiers commanded by experienced officers furnished with all things needful for a vigorous defense and covered with a strong squadron of twelve large capital men of war such as no twenty ships that the king of spain may get together will dare to engage  to attack this place the spaniards whole infantry are about  0000 at the most who if i may speak without boasting are no more able to attack the town to any purpose than twenty men would be to take the tower of london  if the king of spain fails in this enterprise it is very likely he ruins the infantry who are before it and though his kingdoms are indeed very large yet we all know that it is not the easiest thing in the world to raise a new army in spain it is not like germany which as one says traveling through it is an inexhaustible storehouse for men and those men all born soldiers  but in spain it is quite a different case not but that the spaniards are very good troops when well paid well clothed disciplined and led abroad from home but spain is more fruitful of any thing than men there are so many go abroad and so very few stay at home so many turn priests and must not fight are poor dejected and cannot fight or are lazy dons among the gentry and will not fight that it is the hardest thing in the world to raise an army in spain at least with expedition  thus stands their affair at home and in this unhappy posture they are beginning the war a posture that i think they are the first people that ever began a war in before  as soon as they strike a stroke at gibraltar they ought to expect all the allies to declare against and fall upon them france in the first place we may suppose will be expected upon their frontiers with two armies one in navarr and the other in rousillion and in that figure we shall soon see how they will go on  let us now take a view of the situation of their affairs as to trade and particularly as to that part of their commerce of which i have spoken so much viz the trade of new spain  while the british squadron remains on the coasts of america suppose in the gulf of mexico or upon the coasts of portobelo and carthagena either the spaniards must fight that fleet or otherwise remove it or there is an end put to their commerce on that side all at once  it is objected that a british squadron may indeed interrupt the commerce in this or that particular place but that this will not effectually ruin the spanish trade the coast of america as possessed by the spaniards is a large place it is extended in a vast length from the gulf of florida or the northmost part of the gulf of mexico and in the latitude of    to    degrees to the coast of surinam and even to the month of the gulf of paria and the lsle of trinidado and farther to the latitude of five degrees so that here is a length of  000 miles or thereabouts in a line north and south besides reckoning the depth of the bay and the indentings of the coast of yacatan the bay of campeachy the gulf of honduras darien and others which make the coast above   00 miles in length of all which i shall speak again in the next chapter  in the mean time to give the objection its utmost stress they add that the heat of the climate the unhealthiness of the particular places where the station of such ships must be and the want of provisions are such as that no european fleet can bear to be constantly stationd in those seas  that as well at la vera cruz as at portobelo which are the two centres of the spanish commerce the air is so unhealthy by reason of the excessive heats that even the spaniards themselves cannot dwell there and only come at the particular times of trade when the ships from old spain arrive when they buy their goods deliver their money finish their dispatches and letters to europe and return again the former to the great city of mexico and the latter to panama and thence to lima and the other ports on the coast of peru and chili in the southseas  that this is evident at this time for that the galeons being as it were besieged or blocked up by the english squadron their men presently grow sickly and dye apace nor perhaps are the men in the squadron it self quite free though being better furnished with provisions than the spaniards for the country yields little or nothing thereabouts i say the british sailors being better furnished and better taken care of and better fed the men are by consequence better able to bear the inconvenience of the season yet the place is allowed to be such as admits no long stay  map of porto belo porto belo   that the scots in their settlement at darien which is but a little south from portobelo found by sad experience that there was no bearing the situation though the scots are as hardy a people and as able to bear the extremities of weather as most nations in europe  i am the more willing to give the utmost length to these seeming objections because when they shall be fully and unanswerably removed they will leave the less to say by a set of people who deal in misrepresentations and discouragements as a particular traffic of their own and calculated for a particular cause which wanting some cordials knows not where to find or make any better  it is true the coast of america as now possessed by the spaniards is exceeding large as is described and that the great gulf of mexico is not to be blocked up by a squadron of ships the several ports for trade being so remote one from another and that in the whole the coast may lie extended above  000 miles  it is likewise true that the ports of la vera cruz and porto belo which are at present the center of the spanish commerce in those parts are unhealthy dangerous climates the shores destitute of provisions the heats excessive airless and not refreshed with land breezes as in other places and that even the spaniards themselves are not able to bear the extremes of the intemperate seasons such as the summers heat and the winters rain especially about porto belo  but the mistake of all this lies in the ignorance of those that lay the stress of this cause upon the posting an english navy or squadron only for the interrupting this commerce whereas there is nothing more plain than that the allied powers are able at once not only to interrupt the spanish commerce but to put an entire end to it and in a word break off all settled correspondence between the two countries i mean of old spain and new spain and this without hazarding their ships or men to lie upon an unwholesome coast and poison themselves with the stagnate air of darien or the bastimentos  not but that on this occasion the galeons being in the port it became necessary to post a squadron as admiral hosier has been posted to stagnate the money as well as give the spaniards a taste of the stagnate vapors of the place and to keep them where they were if they are ill furnished with provisions if the country cannot supply them if the stores in their ships are not sufficient for them they are at home they must take care of themselves no doubt but by landcarriage or by the great lake of nicaragua which runs eighty leagues within the land and reaches within fifteen leagues of the south sea they may be sufficiently furnished with provisions at least may have some relief in their present exigence for it is very well known that the country of guatimala bordering on that great lake is the most fruitful pleasant and plentiful of any part of spanish america or else their own accounts of it are very false and they have described it much more to their own advantage than they can make out when they find occasion to make use of it  but if it should be so that they are distressed for provisions as i say above they are at home they are under no restraints they have no enemies landed upon them they may send for provisions where they are to be had and may send expresses to the governors of the several countries to supply them and to find means to convey them certainly the governors will not suffer the king of spains ships to want victualing or suffer the poor seamen to starve upon their own coasts and as may be said at their own doors  but we are not speaking of an advantage to great britain only in this present depending article of blocking up the spanish galeons which is a thing of today and as we may say will be over tomorrow is done to serve a particular occasion and will serve that occasion most effectually for we see how ill able the spaniards are to bear the disappointment and what a check it gives to their enterprises how low their credit runs in europe and how even their auxiliaries and confederates as it were stand still till they see from what other springs the promised streams of money will flow  the occasion therefore is abundantly served by the british admiral posting his squadron at the entrance of the harbor of porto belo and hindering the galeons from coming out spreading the sea with his cruisers and interrupting their commerce and in a word locking up their money so as that though it be in their own possession it is yet out of their reach and rendered at least for the present as useless to them as if it was in the mines at potost  and though it is far from being mentioned as any part of the advantages hinted at in my title and which are offered to the allies in the present war any farther than it is an accident to the beginning and a particular circumstance which falls in to the encouragement of our friends and the great disappointment of the enemy yet it must be acknowledged too that it is a very great advantage in its kind and it shows the world that the spaniards with all the funds of their immense treasure which it may be said they are masters of beyond all the nations of europe yet are so unhappily situated that they must as it were be obliged to ask their neighbors leave to bring it home and dare not venture abroad with it if but nine or ten men of war appear upon their coasts  but notwithstanding all this and supposing this expedition of portobelo were to be reckoned as nothing in the present account of the advantages of the war it is manifest that their whole west india commerce is in the hands and at the mercy of the allies in this war that we are able to put an end to it at once if we think fit and that not for the present only but for the time to come whenever the government thinks fit to enter into measures for that purpose  and not to pretend to lead our leaders or to direct them in whose direction the whole government is already so wisely steered i may venture to lay before you the schemes of former times and make some small inferences from them which if our governors please to make any use of they may doubtless very much improve and if they do not think fit to make use of they will it is hoped not be displeased at any welldesigning subject however injuriously misrepresented mentioning such things for their service as are apparently capable of answering the end if accepted and can be hurtful to none if rejected  nor can it be said that it is a discovering the weakness of the enemy to themselves and putting them upon securing themselves where they lie open since the enemy are far from being ignorant of the disadvantage they lie under they are not so insensible of the weak part and have been sensible of it many years ago but find there is no possibility of preventing the consequences but by being masters at sea which is an article that never was but once their chance and is never likely to happen to them again at least it will not in this war whatever it may do in aftertimes  if some things offer in this war which have not offered before at least not to be so practicable in any former war and if wiser heads than mine have not yet seen them or rather not looked into them so much as perhaps they may see reason to do hereafter i hope it will be no offense to give any lights however unworthy and illesteemd the person who so officiously offers them for the public service and however sinking under the weight of unjust calumny his opinion may be slighted yet he may boldly say his reasons shall not be confuted nor any scheme he lays down be justly objected against by the most envious either on one side or other as to their being made use of or not made use of that is an affair by it self and which at present it becomes him to say nothing about unless it is made his duty  chap v of the particular advantages the present prospect of a war offers to the british nation with respect to the commerce of the spanish west indies oliver cromwell whatever other things may be said of him and how ill soever his name may sound at the head of any affair as a precedent yet was certainly no fool he was no more void of counsel than of courage i do not find that his enemies even of those times ever gave it as a part of his character that he was either a fool or a coward  in consequence of his usurpation and while the administration might be said to be in his hands among all the foreign nations whom he differed with he declared war against the spaniards the reasons and occasion of the war are known history is full of them and i have no room for quotations the reading world know where to look for them  in that war france was a confederate as now and their forces in conjunction with the england took dunkirk but oliver who was not used to give up any thing he could keep took care also to have that important conquest put into his own hands and lest it to the englash government at his decease leaving the french to make the best of the war for themselves in remoter parts how the english kept it publish it not in gath   but oliver willing to touch the spaniards in a more sensible manner and in consequence of the experience of former ages observing that by attacking spain in the west indies he should not only wound that monarchy in the tenderest part of its government but carry on the war in that part of the world where most was to be gotten by it turned his eye toward america  in calling up this short piece of history i desire my readers to keep their eyes strictly upon the exact parallel of times and circumstances leaving the persons quite out of the question and to stand and fall as their fate has long ago directed and let it be oliver or olivers master the  it matters not here as the great andrew marvel said of him though his government did a tyrant resemble he made england great and her enemies tremble   his measures at home are nothing to me nor much indeed to any of us now they are over heaven suffered him to overturn things and then heaven overturnd things again and having visited the nation for their crimes visited their afflictors afterward scourged the scourgers and restored the government just as in ancient times he delivered up his people to the assyrian and then restored his people again and destroyed their destroyers  but i am talking not of olivers conduct at home or his measures with his governors but his measures with the spaniards and with them only  it was about the year      when the war with spain continuing after several other attempts the council of war received some proposals laid before them by the governments order for an expedition to the spanish west indies and as i had it not from history but by a very authentic though verbal relation from a member of the very council of war to whom it was referred a descent was proposed to be made upon the continent of new spain this was in order to seize some strength there keep the possession of it fortify and place a garrison in it to be defended afterward against all the power of the spaniards so by that means to extend themselves gradually into the country plant and cultivate still fortifying as they should go on till at length they might establish a colony there and so share with the spaniards the possession of america and perhaps lying between the two great empires which the spaniards possess viz north and south america or as in particular they may be called mexico and peru cut off the communication and possess the shores of both seas that is to say the ports of nombre de dios which is much the same as porto belo and panama  by this proposal it was supposed a door would be immediately opened to a commerce with the spaniards in america that a trade would be carried on to infinite advantage a vast expense of the woollen manufacture follow and a return in specie be immediately and directly made to england without trading about by old spain and under the limitations and restrictions of the spaniards as it always was before and that in particular while the war continued very great sums would frequently fall into the hands of the english by keeping a certain number of ships of war always cruising in those seas and having the port of such place as should be conquered to retreat into refit revictual and shelter themselves upon all occasions  the offer was specious the adventure bold and the success promising but upon farther and mature deliberation though the enterprise was accepted and undertaken in the general yet the measures were changed the place expected to be attacked was rejected and a new scheme as some said of his own was appointed for the expendition and that was to attack the havana the principal port and the chief strength of the spaniards in america at least it was and is still a place of the greatest importance to the spaniards of any in all their american dominions as shall appear presently the reasons given for this alteration of counsels were such as presently made an impression upon all that were consulted about it and the new undertaking was unauimously resolved on  in order to carry on an enterprise of such importance a fleet and an army was prepared and that with all the expedition and secrecy that such a design called for nor till the troops were ready to embark was it so much as guessed at whither they were designed  however the jealous spaniards made afraid from the mere importance of the place rather than by any certain knowledge of the design sent away some ships of war with stores of ammunition and supply of troops for the garrisons of the havana and of chartagena as the two most significant places they possessed in all their american dominions at least on that side and these ships arrived before the english some considerable time  the design was at last made known only to amuse the spaniards carthagena was given out as the place intended to be attacked the squauron sailed the troops about   or  000 men and commanded by the famed colonels penn and venables  the history of the voyage is but short in it self and i shall make it shorter still the design upon the havana miscarried principally by the disagreement in councils among the officers they were mistaken in every thing landed in a wrong  map of havana the port and bay of havana   place  viz at hispaniola the men were harrassd and fatigued and the spaniards by that encouraged they were repulsed in two or three places and at length they gave over the enterprise laying the blame one upon another reciprocally as in all humane disappointments it is very frequent to do  failing in this enterprise they reimbarkd their troops and though the army had suffered some loss abundance of men dead besides those killed and hurt in action which was too many and the rest very sickly the general very unavailing to come home emptyhanded and undertake nothing worthy an english army resolved to attempt the island of jamaica accordingly they sailed directly to the place entered the port landed the army and being made wise by their misfortunes and resolving not to be beaten unless cut in pieces they went on with more united councils and a better agreement than before by which means and the spaniards being not well provided for their defense they took the island and to shorten the story jamaica has been english ever since  it is not to be wondered at if the spaniards after this narrow escape went to work with the fortifications of the havana and made it very strong adding a strong castle at the north part of the town it self and adding several batteries at the entrance whereof one under the castle el morro has a particular battery of twelve exceeding long brass cannon which they call the twelve apostles and which carry if the spaniards may be believed a fiftysix pound ball  since this and even while they were alarmed with the coming of a french squadron into those seas in the late war under monsieur pointy when they took chartagena the spaniards apprehending the design was against the havana they caused the whole city to be accurately fortified and a fort and a citadel to be rebuilt by which the town as well as the port has obtained the name of a very strong place though far from being what the spaniards pretend to say of it invincible but if it really were so at this time or if it was fivefold stronger than it is it is of no value or importance in the scheme i am now to lay down nor shall it be of any use to the spaniards in the case before me any more than the strength of any other place for what signifies its strength when it is not to be attacked  it is not the fortifications upon the shore that will import any thing in this war the superiority by sea is the thing we lay the whole weight upon and being masters of the sea is that which the sum of affairs depends upon  however it is necessary a little to state the importance of this port of the havana in as brief terms as i can because this was the reason why oliver and his council pitched upon it to make their attack by the import of it i mean the import of it to the spaniards as they are now possessed of it and as it would have been to the english if olivers general had happened to take it  the havana is the best port without dispute in all the spanish west indies it is situate on the north side of the iste of cuba opposite to the gulf of florida in the latitude of twenty three degrees north  the gulf of florida being the only practicable outlet or passage from the gulf of mexico by which all the spanish ships make their return from america and by which they enter into ocean which they therefore call disemboguing i say the gulf being the only practicable way all the galeons from portobelo and the other ships called the flota from la vera craz come first to the havana in their passage home and there being in safety from either seas or enemies for it is a port as safe from winds and storms as from enemies they wait till they meet from all parts and as they call it make up their fleet  n b there is another way between cuba and hispaniola which the seamen call the windward passage which the ships from jamaica sometimes venture thorough but it is hazardous and difficult and the spaniards never make use of it especially with their fleet  n b it should also have been observed that the fleets from old spain make this port of the havana be the first place of their arrival when they are outward bound and coming so far in a body they then separate as their orders direct the ships for the south go away to portobelo and those to the west go to la vera cruz the men of war attending them or not as they see occasion and as inteiligence of things directs  so that both ways whether out or home the havana is the only place of safety where the plate fleet rendezvous and where they are covered from all dangers nor would the voyage be easily made without such a halfwayport to stop in to recruit to take in refreshments provisious and especially fresh water after so long a run as it is from cadiz thither in which they have no place to touch at forrefreshment except it be the canaryislands where their stay is but very short the road being not at all safe either from wind or weather or enemies even the turkish rovers not excepted  having thus given you a full account of the import of this place to the spaniards i have only this to add that in the proposed advantages to us for cutting off the spanish commerce and totally intercepting their correspondence with one another which is the scheme to be proposed this mighty port this wellfortified city and this excellent harbor shall be of no signification or importance one way or other it shall neither be worth any thing to us to take or to the spaniards to keep allowing england to have only the superiority of naval strength and to be masters of the sea which i think i may venture to say is not to be doubted and all the rest shall fall in of course the havana shall be as useless to the spaniards as majorca in the mediterranean comparatively speaking nor shall it be able or the spaniards by its help be able to prevent our interrupting their commerce and in short taking it wholly into our own hands  the case is thus  there is on the same island of cuba and on the same northside of it open to the same grand passage of the gulf of florida another port or harbor called the harbor or gulf of honda it is about nine leagues to the westward of the havana and upon the very same coast  the conveniences of this port among many others are some in particular which relate to the subject in hand viz   that it is a convenient place to form a settlement upon and to fortify so as with little expense to make it unapproachable by land and consequently not to be interrupted by the spaniards   that it commands a fruitful and plentiful and healthy country where not only all manner of provisions may be had but where such easy and secure planting would follow as not jamaica it self would go beyond it as well for trade as supply of inhabitants   but that which is above all the rest the situation is such by sea that not a ship much less a fleet of ships can go in or out to or from the havana from or to the gulf of mexico or the coast of carthagena portobelo etc but they must pass by this port and even in sight of the men of war riding here so that england has no more to do than to post a squadron of ships in this port making it their station and keeping some of them cruising upon the coast of the terra firma as they see occasion and let any one that understands the situation of the spanish commerce tell us how they will carry it on without our leave and which way they will get out of the gulf of mexico or out of the gulf of honduras or to use their own language how they will disembogus that is get into the ocean wihtout as i say asking us leave   if this is their case to make the just inference from things as i go will any man say i was too arrogant in saying the spaniards seemed not to know what they were doing when they begin a quarrel with england that their proceedings were absurd and ridiculons and that they seemed to be little off from distraction  the farther entering into this scheme of management for the interrupting the spanish commerce requires more room than can be allowed to any thing from so mean a pen but if any writer or writers master can raise one objection against it that cannot with unanswerable force be refuted i would be glad to see it  let the greatest friend to the spanish interest or the greatest enemy to the author of this tell me if they can which way the flotas from la vera cruz shall get out into the ocean which way the galeons shall beat it up against a leeward tide as the seamen call it from portobelo and not come under the command of this port or that of jamaica  there is a passage already mentioned which sometimes our ships from jamaica do make use of which is therefore called the windward passage and which runs from the east point of jamaica northwest and then fleering north goes between the islands of cuba and hispaniola and passing among innumerable islands sands shoals rocks and other dangers leaves the gulf of florida on the larboard side and goes out or disembogues into the ocean to the northeast of all the bahama islands and it is true that the spaniards may that is to say now and then a ship may make their escape this way  but i refer it to the judgment of the skilful mariner whether this is a practicable way for the whole trade and if it were so whether then the island of jamaica which is already british would not be of the same use for that course as the bay of honda would be for the other  i am no projector nor am i laying the thing down as a proposal at least not here but i think it is plain at least to me that a british squadron posted in this bay may when you please put an end to the spanish commerce in the west indies in such a manner that the spaniards could never carry on any considerable trade there again always supposing what we have reason to hope will ever be the case namely that the british fleet shall be masters of the sea  it may be pretended that the spaniards may coast along the south side of that they call the north seas that is to say under the north share of the south america the coast of st marta venezcula or the caratas and so to bosco del drago the gulf of paria and the isle de trimidada and so going away east get into the ocean that way and come home with the portuguese fleets from the brasils  all this eke what was said before of the windward passage is no more than like a city not entirely invested or that though besieged may have some such secret passages as that now and then a single messenger may escape in or out to carry a letter or bring particular intelligence but which signifies nothing at all toward its relief much less toward raising the stage and opening a communication  having thus stated the case of the spaniards in case of a war and on supposition of the british superiority at sea how their commerce with europe shall be interrupted and broken off and how they shall be no more able to trade no not with their own subjects but by leave from his britannick majesty and his allies the inference from hence is as natural and as plain as that mentioned above viz no man need to ask what are our advantages by a war with spain  i know some room lies here for a question thus suppose you should thus interrupt their commerce what immediate benefit or advantage would that be to us seeing though they cannot trade so freely with one another they may hinder the commerce of their own subjects with the subjects of others and so though the interruption of the trade be a loss to them it will be no gain to us  i state this question not because it is a question that any one who understands the nature of the commerce of new spain will ask but because there are some people that will ask more questions in half an hour than  etc and because some are as solomon says wiser in their own conceit than those that can render a reason the reasons to be given in answer to such questions if any should be weak enough to ask them are resolved into not argument but demonstration  if the spaniards of new spain cannot trade with the spaniards of old spain experience tells us they will trade with any body if their own ships cannot come at them to bring the merchandise of europe to them it is evident they must have those merchandises and they will seek to be supplied with them where they can  the spaniards themselves know this too well the marquis de puzz bueno in his late memorial complains of this as one of the effects of admiral hosiers squadron lying at the bestimentos viz that it covers and protects what he calls the contraband trade to the prejudice of their commerce  let any one grant me that taking post or stationing a squadron at the bay of honda shall command the commerce of mexico and peru as i think it evidently appears it would i will answer for the spaniards that they will grant it shall lay open their trade wholly to the allies  the spaniards in america rich and at case abound in money and have plenty of all manner of provisions wine excepted they have the most delicious fruits they have a profusion of sugars for preserving which they greatly delight in the finest sweet meats and confections in the world being to be had there in the greatest plenty they have the cocoa in such plenty that their chocolate which is their ordinary repast costs them very little they have flesh and fowl and fish in abundance infinitely more than they can consume and as for money their houses are filled with plate and their merchants warehouses piled up to the ceilings with chests of silver coin  but with all this affluence they have no clothes they have neither linen or woollen silk or hair of their own i mean manufactured and of their own making they have indeed some cotton and some wool and the indians or natives do in some remote places make some ordinary things for their own clothing chiefly of cotton and some course peruvian wool  but the spaniards like the lorddanes formerly in england from whole pride and laziness an idle fellow was afterward called a lurdan are too proud to stoop to any thing called work so that they have no merchandise and consequently no cloth except what they receive from europe and some east india goods such as callicoes and wrought silks of china from the philipine islands by the way of acapulco  this supply of manufactures is generally speaking the loading of the galeons including some wines and oil and fruit of the growth of old spain and these loadings chiefly consist of the woollen manufacture of england the silks of france and italy and the linen of holland and germany  this supply has sometimes been interrupted by a war as was in particular the case in the first war with france when the galeons were stopped for two or three years then it was the oddest thing in the world to see how shabby and ragged the spaniards appeared with their pockets full of gold their tables covered with plate and their warehouses as above heaped up with silver and the author of this speaks of particular knowledge that under one of these disappointments a spanish merchant came on board a trading sloop on the coast of st martha in a periagua and bought as many goods at several times as he paid   000 pieces of eight for and had himself not a pair of stockings on his legs and the rest of his clothes worn into such rags as an englishman with but  0 s in the world would scorn to be seen in  he acknowledged that they had money enough but no cloths that every thing bore such a price as tempted them that were merchants to sell till they were almost naked he brought  000 pieces of eight with him the first time and looking over the whole ships cargo bought as much as came to   000 the sum abovementioned stayed in the sloop all the next day when they stood off to sea to be out of sight and went on shore with his goods the next night returning again the night after with more money and so constantly till he had brought all his money and then sent three other merchants who bought all the rest of the cargo  if this trade was carried on thus when at the extremest hazard what would it be when under the protection of the men of war the ships and sloops should come boldly to their shores and the buyers be under no restraint necessity obliging them to consive at one another on shore and no guard de costias to take cognizance at sea  nay what would it be when the bay of honda should be a free fair and that all the spanish vessels that thought fit to come thither should trade under the protection of the place and be safe going and coming under shelter of the cruising men of war  will any man say that the trade will not be wholly our own that is to say the allies for the dutch at curacao and surinam and the french at martinico would have their share in the same commerce and any one may answer for it the advantage would be such that we should never be concerned though there was never to be any more peace with the spaniards either on this side of the world or on the other  finis
