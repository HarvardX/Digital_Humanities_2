oerthrow felt as he saw proud spains victorious scene the wound of shame the pointed shaft unseen that stings the heart yet then to valor true the palm of victory his thoughts pursue oh youth of mexico once valiant train raze from your radiant life this darkning stain say shall the breasts where valors flame should burn your lifeless hearts as sepulchers inurn thou western sun retard thy closing race nor to the godhead witness our disgrace our souls returning a new contest claim still thy last ray shall on our honor flame the daring chief with these exalting words each slackened heart to valors tone accords and as a cloud by adverse winds repelled returns full often with double force impelled then sailing pregnant with destructive storms diffuses darkness and the day deforms till now descending with terrific roar bursts from its womb the dire engendered store so vengeancestord the fierce returning train impetuous rush upon the sons of spain who ill the fierce destructive impulse meet while terror whispers to their souls  retreat that ignominious counsel they obey and urge precipitate their speedy way the warm pursuit the mexicans release night spreads her starry veil and all is peace when sudden from the towrs aspiring height the clarion the mexican historian takes notice of the sacred trumpet it was not permitted to any but the priests to sound it and that only when they animated the people on the part of their gods pierced the drowsy ear of night that sacred instrument whose voice renowned yields rarely to the world its tone profound talepo breathing through its brazen throat diffused around a deepinspiring note while on each youthful valourheaving breast religion her warm energy impressed now tenfold rage impels the martial train while leaps the pulse through every ardent vein fierce they pursue the fleeting spaniard host who from the neighboring lakes projected coast rush down as on their prey the falcons dart and trust to safety from their buoyant art vain hope see at the royal chiefs command of dauntless mexicans a chosen band prompt as the quickness of the lightnings gleam plunge with their leader in the roaring strem with one bold arm through clamorous waves they steer with one they raise aloft the threatening spear thus vehement they urge the hostile train inflicting vengeance on the sons of spain even till the widediffusing drops of blood spread like a scarlet mantle over the flood of mexico the genius now descends and near the angry waters as he bends the crystal goblet that his hand sustain he plunges thrice into the tinctured main then soars and on the neighboring mountains height the radiant power arrests his rapid flight where in full conclave a terrific band the spirits of illustrious chieftains stand  not with the patriot does his passion die it breathes  it is immortalitys ally still from the tomb the warm affections flow even as the sunsetsky retains a glow mark mark the genius said this precious vase here pleased affix here feast your raptured gaze the vast canal near mexico that flows assumes the color that this crystal shows its swelling surges dash the sounding shore inflamed and crimsoned with the hostile gore touched at the welcome tidings they rejoice and to the gale commit their feeble voice lo now disburdend of their pressing care they tower aloft and vanish into air though victory her sunbright glory shed full and unsullied round the heros head at natures voice he checks the smile of joy and funeral duties now his thoughts employ the deathground opening its capacious womb receives the dread deposite in its gloom now with uneven but persuasive strains to wake the bosom harmony complains while joy obedient to the magic lay dissolves like snow before the melting ray now fades the expiring sweetly plaintive sound while still as midnight silence reigns around chained is each voice while over the awestruck sense distill the sober horrors of suspense at length the chief the expecting silence broke while pointing to the patriot tomb he spoke hail sepulcher which every coward shuns thou glorious hecatomb of valors sons on thee oh sacred altar of renown the eternal being looks propitious down they they are dear to that allseeing eye who greatly daring act or bravely die let this suggestion soothe the bleeding heart in which despair has lodged his poisoned dart to you i speak ye fair afflicted train who weep for brothers friends and lovers slain to you i speak ye widows plunged in care and you whose sons stern fate refused to spare as thus he said  deep from some breast unknown burst unsubdued afflictions piercing moan now intermitting now returning loud  at length advancing through the wondering crowd a matronform the attentive hero viewed her robe neglected and her tresses rude with hurried step the royal youth she sought her wild eye speaking the inexpressive thought close at her side a lovely boy appears  now through opposing grief her voice she rears give give to me the virtue that repels the whelming surge of sorrow at it swells two valiant sons in age my comforts store my loved my duteous children are no more this morn this direful morn a prey to fears i bathed our parting with presaging tears that they expired on honors sacred bed that their souls mingle with the illustrious dead well do i know  and glory in the thought bright virtues flame perchance from me they caught from me the instructive lesson first they claimed this bosom nurtured and this voice inflamed yet ill with this vain pomp of splendid words my drooping loaded sinking heart accords ah still to glorys thought despair succeeds and the agonizing mother inly bleed this orphan babe to you i now bequeathe with honors brightest flowers his mind inwreathe the child halfconscious of the mothers grief as if attempting to dispense relief stretched forth his little arms and playful smiled in vain the boy her scorpion thoughts beguiled inclining at his call her anguishd face deathstruck she perished in the wished embrace twas then the hero thus his thoughts expressed fly wounded spirit to the realms of rest this orphan child committed to my care this tender object of thy closing prayer the blood that warms his breast his helpless years but most thy last request to me endears the hero added  shall the captive train partake the fate the rigid laws ordain as erring friends it is virtuous to forgive it is godlike to decree the foe to live ah then while pity does her thoughts suggest we feel the glowing god within our breast amid the captives one superior moves whose generous deeds humanity approves one whose pure bosom all the virtues claim respectful man las casas is his name he for religions sake religion wooed warm at her shrine the priest enamored stood when cruel havoc bade the war increase still over the plain he strewn the flowers of peace to soothe the prostrate foe his wisdom planned while hovered over the wound his healing hand yet not to these endearing acts confined he poured the balm of comfort on the mind let then the sacred priest your friendship share and at his voice the deathdoomd captives spare he said  and to the god of war ordained a spotless rite by human gore unstained see the character of this spanish bishop so celebrated for his humanity as it is drawn by the masterly hand of the abbe raynal in the third volume of his histoire philosophique et politic  now see the hero with the wedded fair while sportive fancy runs before repair by truth conducted to the dim alcove where pleasure rears the rosy couch of love talepo now the christian priest addressed while silence lulls the drooping world to rest let us enjoy the confrence of an hour within the bosom of this seret bower say mid the spoilers of this peaceful land that rude unfeeling bold destructive band who their base hands in guiltless blood imbrue oh priest of meekness what had thou to do say of your country thus inured to fight do all in strife and massacres delight say to what rigid deity ye bend if through our woes your prayers approved ascend las casas spoke  compelled to join the host reluctantly i sought your peaceful coast nor of my country with inhuman joy do all uplift their weapons to destroy nor is the deity to whom we bow such as your vague bewildring thoughts avow indignant he beheld the martial train with bloody purpose rushing over the main ill we deserve the blessings he bestowed for us he quitted the divine abode  as on the humble earth with man he trod through all her works awed nature owned her god the palsied suffrer left his weary bed while on his cheek healths brightest color bled and stranger still  the tenant of the tomb who long had dwelt in deaths relentless womb upborn abruptly from the yawning ground amazementsmitten cast his eyes around ah highly favored race talepo cried say wherefore was your bliss to us denied god of the christians speak the crime unknown for which an host of virtues cannot atone for which proscribed disgraced this hapless coast is ravished of those gifts your children boast ah now las casas hasten to relate the bright effects of your exalted state the fruits that ripen from celestial seeds heroic thoughts and burst of glorious deeds you pause  what means that sorrowshaded eye that fixed reluctance that betraying sigh forbear the priest returned thy vain request nor call the truth from this unwilling breast though many godlike deeds our faith endear the christian story blasts the expecting ear the godhead spoke  let meekness as a dove  brood in mans heart the sacred acts of love but mark the strange result  in hostile bands the christians hurry to remoter lands to death consigning deaf to pitys claim the realms unknowing of their founders name from these dire acts they roused to new alarms and on each other turned their reeking arms the general faith received destructions shock and as a vessel dashed against a rock was split into a thousand jarring creeds each breathing rage and sanguinary deeds then persecution waked the martyrs pile and hailed the sparkles with a greedy smile talepo said  the creed of distant tribes from your highfavourd realm remote imbibes no knowledge of your god  ah tell me true bright virtues path do we in vain pursue say do we nurse with ineffectual care the hope which soothes the pain that all must bear who speaks of bliss beyond this lower sphere and whispers comfort to the dying ear thrice virtuous sage the feeling priest rejoined ah let not doubt oershade thy spotless mind the different tenets that each nation claims  to heavenly power affixed the various names  are as the rays projecting from the sun are but the titles of the eternal one the many modes of worship as they tend to one refining pure celestial end even from that diverse homage may aspire a grateful offering to the immortal sire as from the flowers of variegated dies exhales a blended incense to the skies on us with energy the godhead beams and on thy valiant clime but faintly gleams yet be not thou disturbed nor fear to stray in quest of virtue far from virtues way as round his little path though gloomd by night the radiant insect throws a guiding light so all unerring see to act their part taught by the glittering glowworm of the heart talepo now to bright conviction won exclaimed enchanted oh thou better sun thy words like dayspring on the breast of night pour on my darkened soul the endearing light  but partial light for still within the mind full many a painful doubt remains behind what is that power we chance or fortune call who holds her veering ministry over all resembling still that spirit of the sky whose secret form eludes the human eye who now unmindful of its matchless power indulgent whispers to the vernal flower plays with her leaves and hovering over her bloom from her young breast allures the enclosed perfume and now envelopd in a sullen mood tempestuous rushes on the groaning wood armed with destructive energy invades despoils devasts the consecrated shades still with the cloud of ignorance oppressed enlightened priest unfold to my request of dire necessity the hidden cause who seems on freedoms ground to fix her laws and combats and distracts the human will as the wild storm confounds the pilots skill tell if thou can what power impels the mind when loath in narrow bounds to be confined she breaks disdainful from her native sphere and soars exulting in a new career and in her progress sends a daring glance along futuritys opaque expanse that dread depository veiled abode where breathe the secret counsels of the god still in my soul perplexing doubts remain all knowing sage that radiant power explain who when the world with lowering clouds is hung darts like the sun from his high orbit flung and winged with swiftness wild distracted flies dispersing terror through the conscious skies then the tremendous voice that speaks on high as if some angry god bade nature die thus through their converse stole with magic power all unobserved the slow nocturnal hour till as the shades forsook the morning sky the god of day disclosed his radiant eye which dropping luster on the conscious main showed to the deepdesponding sons of spain a kindred fleet by urging zephyrs fanned triumphant sailing to the impatient strand rich tablature by expectation glazed by hope highcolourd and by joy emblazd see cortez now emerging from despair for all the butchery of war prepare revenge and massacre the saints that crown the bloody altar of his base renown now goad him on to snatch the wealthy prize whose golden treasures glitter in his eyes meanwhile despondence like approaching night of indian valor dims the splendid light over mexicans her fenny pinions spreads and on their bosoms chilling feardrops sheds to raise their drooping soul the chief compels the magic seers to quit their lonely cells three awful forms appear  in white arrayed whose reverend temples silver tresses shade to them talepo  if your hallowed mind as fame reports by wisdoms ray refined can glance into futuritys contents and wander forth to meet the great events at distance sailing through their long career to take their station in this lower sphere then speak our fate  does ruin hover near and do we vainly grasp the hostile spear dracono spoke  thy wondering vision raise and mark yon angry comets threatening blaze have thou not heard loud howlings of despair and shrieks of horror vex the midnight air the dreaded power who from his baleful breath sends pains sends pestilence and sudden death amid the terrors of the conscious night that god malignant rushed upon my sight  advert to mexico s distressful state  behold the future picture of her fate he said  when lo a lowering cloud overspread and mantled mexicos imperial head tall columns of dun smoke encircling joined which wreaths of flame like angry snakes entwined peace terrourspreading priest the chief replied think not my people in your voice confide well i recall how in my early youth your dark predictions wandered far from truth the midday sun recoiled involved in night while thou the pander to the general fright did dastardlike thy voice prophetic rear and loud assert  the death of time was near  that at her floodgates stood destructions power to deluge nature in a fiery shower the trembling world the chain of silence bound while dreadful expectation hovered round when from his cloud emergd the god of day and nature burst into a grateful lay so from the lowering cloud of our distress may dart the glorious sunbeams of success to war to war let us again resort and victory by deeds of valor court he added not  but hastening to the shore he bade his warriors grasp the guiding oar determined on the bosom of the main to dare the proud augmented power of spain whose stately brigantines with spreading sail approach obedient to the sullen gale which like a mischiefurging spirit guides the hostile vessels over the rolling tides with ruin fraught the vast progressive scene disparting  leaves a dreadful space between to this dread space to war the stronger foe the daring chief directs his light canoe so mariners have seen the swordfish sail with bold intent to wound the giant whale now spanish art unlocks her deathful store while on the galleys bursts destructions roar dark over the scene impends a veil of smoke by frequent flashes of the cannon broke twas then fatality mysterious queen who reigns despotic over this lower scene unquestioned guides the rise and fall of realms an empire now exalts and now oerwhelms beheld her priestess revolution stand prompt on the mystic wheel to lay her hand urge urge thy task the fatal goddess said for mexico must bend her regal head the mystic wheel performs the appointed round and mark the chief in chains disgraceful bound ah see the youth approach the crowded shore while from the foe ascends the applauding roar now to the royal dome his steps he bends so lately peopled with his valiant friends there there oh fight accursed in evil hour he views proud cortez on the seat of power who meanly vain thus loud insulting said is all thy courage and resistance dead the loyal troops that tread thy subject plains do they consent to view their king in chains audacious mexican behold how vain to war against the uplifted arm of spain beneath yon plains in some sequestered scene well do i know that nature works unseen forms with creative hand the buried ore to you an useless and unheeded store does strong desire still prompt thy heart to live then give to my impatient sight oh give the cunning artist at her secret toil and glut my wishes with the glittering spoil the captive hero gave these words to flow while his eye flashed defiance on the foe these chains but only reach the exterior form the bulwark of the mind thou can not storm misjudging man think not thy proud control though all around your boasted thunders roll can ever invade the temple of the soul there lives the secret that thou would devour and laughs at thy vain impotence of power still shall thy haughtiness be taught to crouch the victor said  prepare the fiery couch pile glowing torches on the extended frame and clothe it with a robe of raging flame yet unappalld the godlike youth rejoined if through the night of thine umbrageous mind could radiant mercy dart a cheering ray and melt to softness thy tyrannic sway to thy distinction would i then confide that youthful captive to my blood allied ah on that venerable griefstruck sage look down and smooth the rugged path of age but most relenting to this mourner bend and over her days thy guardian care extend he ceased  and turning to the drooping fair who stood a monument of dumb despair while sorrows iron hand her bosom wrung he on her neck in mournful silence hung now from the chains that frame this fond delay victorious over himself he breaks away and now advances by rude ruffians led with step undaunted to the torturing bed alarmed to meet his kindred warrior there  oh thou he said who did the battle share must thou unhappy youth endure with me this last severe result of spains decree then raise thy heart superior to the task nor fear beneath those transient flames to bask even ere they fade the immortal soul shall rise and take its seat of bliss in yonder skies where to thy wondering vision shall expand adorned with heroes a refulgent land where valiant mexicans secure from woe look down contemptuous on the spanish foe he said  and to his rigid doom resigned along the flaming couch his form reclined the partner of his fate submissive bends and over the torturing bed his frame extends yet then unequal to the conquering pain he spoke his suffering in lamenting strain o royal master give me to disclose where in the mine the golden treasure glows  i shrink i faint inferior to my part and this frail frame betrays my daring heart amidst the raging flames that round him blazed the royal chief his martyred figure raised cast on the youth a calmreproaching eye and spoke  oh eloquent sublime reply oh heaven oh earth attend do i repose all on the silken foliage of the rose he ceased  and deep within his soul retired to honor firm triumphant he expired thy arduous task brave youth thoust well performed though perils threats and tortures round thee stormed over thy last scene admiring angels hung and at thy exit lound applauding sung thy spirit glowing with celestial fire to heaven is wafted by the angelic quire the gorgeous spectacle ascending high sails through the portal of the parting sky and at the living throne arrests its flight over which is spread a brilliant flood of light there the dread presence dwells in deep recess encompassed round with glorys rich excess now through the veil of bright redundant beams a voice is heard  from me creation streams  i am the power  i from the entombing earth exalt the virtuous to a second birth to them delighted i disclose the ray of immortalitys long summer day but see talepo venerable seer approach the scene impressed with busy fear when first the inhuman deed appalled his sight even as the cedar shrunk in sudden blight he stood  while at the dire appearance thrilled each function of the soul stiff horror chilled at length relenting into conscious grief he loud exclaimed   oh loved oh hapless chief the ashes still that feed yon lingering flame do they of all thou art the existence claim long schooled in pale adversitys rude porch where hopes gay domes are burnt by havocks torch for me with grief adjoind to age oppressed remained but this to cleave my careworn breast in early youth to me thou wast consigned i watched the dawn of thy celestial mind i saw by nature waked thy talents rise and virtue mark them with her brightest dies ah what avail these fruitless tears i shed though thou art gone  yet vengeance is not dead the pregnant womb of time  he added not  while from his eye a radiant meaning shot his bosom heaved with a prophetic throe till language gave his struggling thoughts to flow methinks futurity celestial maid through distant times dim lengthening isle displayed pours on my favored vision days unborn that pant impatient for the lingering morn smooth as the clear expanse of vernal skies a world of water claims my wondering eyes

extremity of one division to that of the other hume  mark how the gorgeous mass advancing ploughs the groaning main with high aspiring prows secure in all the haughtiness of strength it moves a crescent of tremendous length and big with thunders and destructive force to britains coast directs its threatening course often has las casas in applauding strain to me revealed that seaencircled

vessels shade a beggared remnant of the splendid throng that swept in conscious majesty along with prows disfigured and dishonored masts while through the rent sails mourn the hollow blasts in shattered mean dismantled rude array steal over the waves their ignominious way oh of thy brilliant and extensive train do these armada these alone remain who has overthrown the honors of thy helm the voice of fame replies  elizas realm where lurk thy galleons that surprised the deep loud fame replies  in oceans tomb they sleep and of hispania once the bright renown now glows an added gem to

tender dame these waves that wander to the sea wash in their pilgrimage a tree which spreads its lowly branches wide and dips them in the passing tide there in a shade composed of reeds an aged hermit tells his beads he generous sage will join our hands in wedlocks unremitting bands then to valclusa well repair where lauras soul informs the air where petrarchs spirit hovers round the guardian of the sacred ground forbidding still that fiend of art that shrewd perverter of the heart the snake inconstancy to rove within the paradise of love as when chill winter quits the land the snowdrop does her leaves expand so may chill fears your breast release till gently it expands to peace mild as these twilight breezes blow soft as the waves on which we flow ye walls where first i drew the air returned assured the beauteous fair ye turrets which but dimly seen increase the terror of the scene ye stately towers and rising spires from you camilla now retires thou tomb whose pious urn contains my sacred parents cold remains ye partners of my tender years whom youthful sympathy endears ye joys that crown my native coast well for placentio all are lost she ceased  and on her pensive soul

relick richenchasd this unambitious altar graced here flora natures priestess stood and round her fragrant offerings strewn the hermit spoke  hail virtuous pair may your misfortunes perish here though youth be yours yet well i know you have tasted deep of human woe control and art and baseness joined to cancel what your hearts designed but now misfortunes reign is over and pleasure opens all her store he paused  and now the youthful pair the irrevocable vow prefer and now the hermit closed their hands in willing and unvenal bands unspotted bands which mutual love and confidence and virtue wove finis
