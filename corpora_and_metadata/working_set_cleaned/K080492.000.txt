degenerate sons the faded fame deep in her anxious heart revolving sad bare was her throbbing bosom to the gale that hoarse and hollow from the bleak surge blew loose flowed her tresses rent her azure robe hung over the deep from her majestic brow she tore the laurel and she tore the bay nor ceased the copious grief to bathe her cheek nor ceased her sobs to murmur to the main peace discontented nigh departing stretched her dovelike wings and war though greatly roused yet mourned his fettered hands while thus the queen of nations spoke and what she said the muse recorded faithful in unbidden verse even not you sail that from the skymixt wave dawns on the sight and wafts the royal youth a freight of future glory to my shore even not the flattering view of golden days and rising periods yet of bright renown beneath the parents and their endless line through late revolving time can sooth my rage while unchastisd the insulting spaniard dares infest the trading flood full of vain war despise my navies and my merchants seize as trusting to false peace they fearless roam the world of waters wild made by the toil and liberal blood of glorious ages mine nor bursts my sleeping thunder on their head whence this unwonted patience this weak doubt this tame beseeching of rejected peace this meek forbearance this unnative fear to generous britons never known before and sailed my fleets for this on indian tides to float unactive with the veering winds the mockery of war while foul disease and sloth distempered swept off burning crowds for action ardent and amid the deep inglorious sunk them in a watery grave there now they lie beneath the rolling flood far from their friends and country unavengd and back the weeping warship comes again dispirited and thin her sons ashamed thus idly to review their native shore with not one glory sparkling in their eye one triumph on their tongue a passenger the violated merchant comes along that farsought wealth for which the noxious gale he drew and sweat beneath equator suns by lawless force detained a force that soon would melt away and every spoil resign were once the british lion heard to roar whence is it that the proud iberian thus in their own wellasserted element dares rouse to wrath the masters of the main who told him that the big incumbent war would not ere this have rolled his trembling ports in smoaky ruin and his guilty stores won by the ravage of a butchered world yet unattond sunk in the swallowing deep or led the glittering prize into the thames there was a time oh let my languid sons resume their spirit at the rouzing thought when all the pride of spain in one dread fleet swelled over the labring surge like a whole heaven of clouds widerolld before the boundless breeze gaily the splendid armament along exultant plowed reflecting a red gleam as sunk the sun over all the flaming vast tall gorgeous and elate drunk with the dream of easy conquest while their bloated war stretched out from sky to sky the gathered force of ages held in its capacious womb but soon regardless of the cumbrous pomp my dauntless britons came a gloomy few with tempest black the goodly scene deformed and laid their glory waste the bolts of fate resistless thundered through their yielding sides fierce over their beauty blazed the lurid flame and seized in horrid grasp or shattered wide amid the mighty waters deep they sunk then too from every promontory chill rank fen and cavern where the wild wave works i swept confederate winds and swelled a storm round the glad isle snatched by the vengeful blast the scattered remnants drove on the blind shelve and pointed rock that marks the indented shore relentless dashed where loud the northern main howls through the fracturd caledonian isles such were the dawnings of my liquid reign but since how vast it grew how absolute even in those troubled times when dreadful blake awed angry nations with the british name let every humbled state let europe say sustained and balanced by my naval arm ah what must these immortal spirits think of your poor shifts these for their countrys good who faced the blackest danger knew no fear no mean submission but commanded peace ah how with indignation must they burn if ought but joy can touch aetherial breasts with shame with grief to see their feeble sons shrink from that empire over the conquered seas for which their wisdom planned their councils glowed and their veins bled through many a toiling age oh first of human blessings and supreme fair peace how lovely how delightful thou by whose wide tie the kindred sons of men like brothers live in amity combined and unsuspicious faith while honest toil gives every joy and to those joys a right which idle barbarous rapine but usurps pure is thy reign when unaccursd by blood naught save the sweetness of indulgent showers trickling distills into the vernant glebe instead of mangled carcasses sadseen when the blythe sheaves lie scattered over the field when only shining shares the crooked knife and hooks imprint the vegetable wound when the land blushes with the rose alone the falling fruitage and the bleeding vine oh peace thou source and soul of social life beneath whose calm inspiring influence science his views inlarges art refines and swelling commerce opens all her ports blessed be the man divine who gives us thee who bids the trumpet hush his horrid clang nor blow the giddy nations into rage who sheaths the murdrous blade the deadly gun into the wellpild armoury returns and every vigor from the work of death to grateful industry converting makes the city flourish and the country smile unviolated him the virgin sings and him the smiling mother to her train of him the shepherd in the peaceful dale chaunts and the treasures of his labor sure the husbandman of him as at the plow or team he toils with him the sailor sooths beneath the trembling moon the midnight wave and the full city warm from street to street and shop to shop responsive rings of him nor joys one land alone his praise extends far as the sun rolls the diffusive day far as the breeze can bear the gifts of peace till all the happy nations catch the song what would not peace the patriot bear for thee what painful patience what incessant care what mixed anxiety what sleepless toil even from the rash protected what reproach for he thy value knows thy friendship he to human nature but the better thou the richer of delight sometimes the more inevitable war when ruffian force awakes the fury of an injured state then the good easy man whom reason rules who while unhurt knew nor offense nor harm roused by bold insult and injurious rage with sharp and sudden check the astonished sons of violence confounds firm as his cause his bolder heart in awful justice clad his eyes effulging a peculiar fire and as he charges through the prostrate war his keen arm teaches faithless men no more to dare the sacred vengeance of the just and what my thoughtless sons should fire you more than when your wellearnd empire of the deep the least beginning injury receives what better cause can call your lightning forth your thunder wake your dearest life demand what better cause than when your country sees the sly destruction at her vitals aimed for oh it much imports you it is your all to keep your trade entire entire the force and honor of your fleets over that to watch even with a hand severe and jealous eye in intercourse be gentle generous just by wisdom polished and of manners fair but on the sea be terrible untamed inconquerable still let none escape who shall but aim to touch your glory there is there the man into the lyons den who dares intrude to snatch his young away and is a briton seized and seized beneath the slumbring terrors of a british fleet then ardent rise oh great in vengeance rise oerturn the proud teach rapine to restore and as you ride sublimely round the world make every vessel stoop make every state at once their welfare and their duty know this is your glory this your wisdom this the native power for which you were designed by fate when fate designed the firmest state that ever was seated on the subject sea a state alone where liberty should live in these late times this evening of mankind when carthage rome and athens are no more the world almost in slavish sloth dissolved for this these rocks around your coast were thrown for this your oaks peculiar hardened shoot strong into sturdy growth for this your hearts swell with a sullen courage growing still as danger grows and strength and toil for this are liberal poured over all the fervent land then cherish this this unexpensive power undangerous to the public ever prompt by lavish nature thrust into your hand and unencumberd with the bulk immense of conquest whence huge empires rose and fell selfcrushd extend your reign from shore to shore wherever the wind your high behests can blow and fix it deep on this eternal base for should the sliding fabric once give way and on the brink of fate begin to nod soon blackened quite and past recovery broke it gathers ruin as it rowls along steeprushing down to that devouring gulf where many a mighty empire buried lies and should the big redundant flood of trade in which ten thousand thousand labors join their several currents till the boundless tide rolls in a radiant torrent over the land fruitful of wealth magnificence and joy of every glittering harvest richer far than what hesperian gardens bore of old should this bright stream the least inflected point its course another way over other lands the various treasure would resistless pour never to be won again its ancient tract left a vile channel desolate and dead with all around a miserable waste not egypt were her better heaven the nile turned in the pride of flow when over his rocks and roaring cataracts beyond the reach of dizzy vision pild in one wide flash an ethiopian deluge foams amain whence wondering fable traced him from the sky even not that prime of earth where harvests crowd on untilled harvests all the teeming year if of the fat overflowing culture robbed were then a more uncomfortable wild steril and void than of her trade deprived britons your boasted isle her princes sunk her highbuilt honor moulderd to the dust unnervd her force her spirit vanished quite with rapid wing her riches fled away her unfrequented ports alone the sign of what she was her merchants scattered wide her hollow shops shut up and in her streets her fields woods markets villages and roads the cheerful voice of labor heard no more oh let not then waste luxury impair that manly soul of toil which strings your nerves and your own proper happiness creates oh let not the soft penetrating plague creep on the freeborn mind and working there with the sharp tooth of many a newformd want endless and idle all eat out the heart of liberty the high conception blast the noble sentiment the impatient scorn of base subjection and the swelling wish for general good erazing from the mind while naught save narrow selfishness succeeds and low design the gloomy passions all let loose and reigning in the rankled breast induced at last by scarceperceivd degrees sapping the very frame of government and life a total dissolution comes sloth ignorance dejection flattery fear oppression raging over the waste he makes the human being almost quite extinct and the whole state in broad corruption sinks oh shun that gulf that gaping ruin shun and countless ages roll it far away from you ye heavenbelovd may liberty the light of life the sun of human kind whence heroes bards and patriots borrow flame even where the keen depressive north descends still spread exalt and actuate your powers while slavish southern climates beam in vain and may a public spirit from the throne where every virtue sits go copious forth wide over the land the finer arts inspire make thoughtful science raise his pensive head blow the fresh bay bid industry rejoice and the rough sons of lowest labor smile as when profuse of spring the loosened west lifts up the pining year and luscious breathes youth life and love and beauty over the world but haste we from these melancholy shores nor to deaf winds and waves our fruitless plaint pour out the country claims our active aid that let us rome and where we find a spark of public virtue blow it into flame the throne be chief our care the aetherial streams of wisdom justice and benevolence that issue thence refreshing all the land joyous to swell and over the lovely round of royal beauty which about it glows to hover fond prophetic of those days that frederick dawn delightful in thy eye and now my sons the sons of freedom meet in awful senate thither let us fly burn in the patriots thought flow from his tongue in fearless truth myself transformed preside and shed the spirit of britannia round this said her fleeting form and airy train sunk in the gale and naught but ragged rocks rushed on the broken eye and naught was heard but the rough cadence of the dashing wave finis
