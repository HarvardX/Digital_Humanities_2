the speech of r b sheridan esquire on summing up the second charge against warren hastings esquire before the high court of parliament in westminster hall tuesday june        and three subsequent days  london sold by j dicrie no   0 opposite exeterchange in the strand and by all the booksellers in london and westminster mdcclxxxviii  the speech of r b sheridan esquire on summing up the second charge against warren hastings esquire before the high court of parliament in westminster hall tuesday june        the general expectation from the speech of mr sheridan on summing up the second charge against mr hastings though exceeding all that has been recently witnessed on similar occasions was fully apparent in the brilliancy and fullness of the court this day before ten oclock the galleries for peers tickets and the peeresses box were crowded to an overflow in the seats for the commons so generally deserted there appeared upwards of three hundred members  those in fact who did not then see the court can scarcely form a judgment of the spectacle  to enumerate those of distinction who were present would be to enumerate all who are conspicuous for rank or claim celebrity from talents  that mind however must be insensible to excellence on which the splendour of the scene could make a more than transient impression the expectation was raised to an higher object and could the faint sketches of the memory communicate but a remote semblance of the reality we would assert to absent readers with more confidence that no degree of expectation was dismissed ungratified  the court being seated precisely at    oclock mr sheridan arose  it would be superfluous he observed for him to call the attention of their lordships to the magnitude and importance of the subject before them to advert to the parties who were engaged in the business or to depict the situation of those multitudes who were ultimately to be affected all this had already been done by the hon gentleman mr burke who opened the prosecution  by him who alone was equal to the task  by him to whom mankind was indebted for the embodied stand which was now made in defense of the general rights of humanity  neither was it his intention to enter into any detail which might be deemed foreign to the question immediately before the court  he would only indulge himself in a few words respecting some insinuations which had been thrown out against the persons concerned in this prosecution it had been whispered by whom he could not say that there was something malicious and something perhaps too violent in the manner in which it had been conducted speaking for himself and as far as the heart of man could be known for the other managers appointed by the commons he would boldly assert that they had acted solely from conviction  not a conviction born in error and nursed by prejudice but a conviction founded on deliberate and well grounded enquiry  that they had proceeded not as rejoicing in punishment but impeled by a sanguine hope of remedy  personal malice god forbid that they should indulge such a sensation against the unfortunate gentleman at the bar but how when they were to speak of rapine of cruelty and of extortion could such ideas be conveyed but in consonant language there was undoubtedly a difference between impeachment for capital crimes and those for misdemeanors only in proceedings on the mer every latitude had been indulged by usage every aggravation was employed and every act of the prisoner tortured into criminality no such privilege was claimed by the managers on the present occasion but yet it should be considered by those whose pity seemed to rise in proportion with the guilt of its object  that if such a mode of proceeding was admissible in the former case where the life of the prisoner was affected it was still more justifiable on an impeachment like the present where the utmost consequences of guilt when proved would be but a splendid exclusion of the criminal from that society which he had injured or a trifling deduction from the spoils of a longcontinued extortion  it had been observed what was undoubtedly true that no complaint from the natives of india had been presented in the course of these proceedings those however who were first to make this observation were fully convinced that meekness in suffering was there a part of the national character and that their terrors had been too deeply impressed not to be long remembered but though a despair of british justice had prevailed through that peninsula  though their subdued hearts could not even hope for relief  yet their claims on the justice and humanity of their lordships were not thereby diminished but recommended he would not mention this despair without accompanying the observation by proof he therefore read extracts from two letters the first lately received from lord cornwallis the second enclosed from capt kirkpatrick to his lordship from both which it appeared that such was the prevailing sense through india of the injuries inflicted by the english and of their repeated violations of every compact that it would be long indeed before their confidence in english faith or their reliance on english justice could again be restored  to these complaints their lordships were now to answer not by professions but by facts  not by remedial acts directed to the future but by an exemplary punishment inflicted on past delinqency it was incumbent on them to show to the oppressed natives of india and to future governors and judges that there could be no authority so high no office so sacred as not to be subject to the paramount power of british justice  he did not however mean to say that the the example should be made unless the guilt was first fully proved no god forbid that in this free and just land legal proof and legal guilt should ever be separated  though the greater part of the evidence on this occasion had been with a few exceptions wrung from the unrelenting accomplices of the prisoner  from men who had partook of the spoils and were involved in the guilt yet had he therefore no indulgence to demand nor had he to request that the court should take that as evidence on this occasion which on any other they might deem themselves bound to refuse he on the contrary was now to bring forward to their lordships a mass of evidence as full as strong as competent and as conclusive as ever established the guilt of a criminal or ever brought conviction home to the breasts of conscientious judges  in the performance of this task he observed he should have the less difficulty as their lordships had attended to the whole voluminous and complicated as it appeared with a diligence which did honor to their feelings and showed their individual sense of the dignity of that high tribunal which they collectively formed  the first part of this evidence to which he should call the attention of the court was the defenses delivered in by mr hastings to the house of commons and to their lordships  on these as being the voluntary admissions of the prisoner unextorted by any threat and unbiassed by any persuasion much stress had undoubtedly been laid to a part of these however an objection had been made the most extraordinary perhaps that had ever been advanced in a court of criminal justice  an objection which when mr hastings was well advised as he undoubted was when he was saved from his own rash guiance the managers could scarcely have expected this objection was that a part of the first defense in particular not having been written by mr hastings but by some of his friends that gentleman was not bound by any admissions therein contained mr hastings on appearing at the bar of the house of commons had pleaded the haste in which he had written in palliation of his inaccuracies he had even made a merit of doing that himself which would be less dangerous if he had committed it to another  but now said mr sheridan that he finds that there is something more than inaccuracy  something fraught with that actual danger which he had apprehended  he reverts to that plea which he had abandoned and declares that he had committed the trust to others  he disclaims all his former merits and avers that in making up his tale he had not trusted solely to his own powers  that he had put his memory into commission and parcelled out his conscience into different departments the structure it appeared went on whilst mr hastings was content with overseeing and cheering his laborers  mr shore said he you will take care to make me appear a good financier major scott my judgment is reposed in your hands  mr middleton my humanity is yours  the work being thus done  mr hastings surveyed it with a careless glance and adopted it as his own but now that its defects appear the child of his adoption becomes the object of his aversion his approbation ceases and his language is totally changed  the defense is in general made up of general denials of the charges intermixed with encomiums on his own conduct  yet mr hasting exclaims  subject me to all the other evidence against me  i know i can trust to their want of recollection and their force of attachment  bare my bosom to every shaft of enmity  but save me from the perils of my own panegyric  the haste in which these productions were written was also alleged by mr hastings as an apology for every error but did it follow that because a man wrote rapidly he should also write falsely or was it that the truth and candor of mr hastings were so deeply buried in his bosom that long study alone could bring them upwards whilst the natural falsehood floating on the surface could be transferred with extemporaneous readiness to every topic whether to be written or to be uttered  these were the apologies offered for the variations the admissions and the inconsistency of mr hastings defenses but these it was to be hoped for the sake of propriety and good sense would never again be repeated  mr sheridan on quitting this subject entered into a very full and happy delineation of the situation of the princesses of oude no perusal of the turkish history he observed nor attention to the precepts of the mohammedan religion could give their lordships any idea of the manners of the women of high casts in hindostan educated in a profound respect to the customs of their persian ancestors theo maintained a purer style of prejudice and a loftier degree of superstition dwelling perpetually within the precincts of their zenanas the simplicity of their sentiments was equalled only by the purity of their conduct in those innocent retreats they were circumscribed not immured for such was the force of prejudice that liberty would be looked on as a curse to those to whom the common gaze of men would be regarded as an unexpiable violation however mistaken their ideas they were placed there by the hand of piety and could not be disturbed but by a sacrilege they were as relics on an altar which though deposited by superstition none but the impious would disturb  in addition to those claims mr hastings himself had borne testimony to the duty which children owed to parents in hindostan yet the bhow begum or mother of the reigning nabob had still stronger demands on the affection of her son  in the year      when sujah dowlah after the battle of buxar was driven from that territory by the english which their politic generosity afterward restored she bore her private treasures to his assistance and was rewarded by the respectful attachment of his future life with the devise of all his territories to her son  she had also interfered in a quarrel between her son and her husband and when the savage father was about to strike down his son with a sabre at the expense of her blood preserved that life which she gave  there were pleas in her favor which would have exacted the reverence of any man  but one  but these pleas the sex the age and character of the begums  and what was yet more the deathbed recommendation of sujah dowlah were all of no weight with mr hastings  this was therefore the object of the present charge  that where he owed protection  he had been the severest oppressor  that the weakness which should have claimed his aid but excited his violence  that he had subjected the son thus to make him the ungracious instrument of his tyranny over the parent  and had first made him a slave in order that he might become  a monster  the interference of mr bristow in      in the differences between the begums and the nabob in consequence of the claims of the latter was the next ground of mr sheridans observations  mr bristow had then in a conversation with the superior or elder begum thrown out an insinuation that the treasures which she possessed were the treasures of the state  and on this insinuation so termed by mr bristow himself had mr hastings founded all his arguments on that head and on which he lately appeared to place so much reliance  the begums at that time gave up to the asoph ul dowla sums amounting to five hundred and fifty thousand pounds  of this a part was to be paid in goods which as they consisted of arms elephants etc the nabob alleged to be his property and refused to accept as payment this occasioned a dispute which was referred to the board of calcutta mr hastings then vindicated the right of the begums to all the goods in the zenana and brought over the majority of the council to his opinion the ideas then placed on record he had since found it convenient to disown as belonging not to him but to the majority of the council  how these opinions could be transferred it might be difficult for their lordships though well informed of the effects of majorities and minorities to determine as well might mr burke on a future day deliver an encomium on that great and good man mr hastings and if reminded of his share in the prosecution allege that he was not accountable for so nefarious a preceding that his opinions when once delivered were no longer his own that at the time he had constantly acted in a minority  the claims however it was observable of the nabob as to the treasure of the begums were at this time the only plea alleged for the seizure these were always founded on a passage of that koran which was perpetually quoted but never proved  not a word was then mentioned of the strange rebellion which was afterward conjured up and of which the existence and the notoriety were equally a secret  a disaffection which was at its height at the very time when the begums were dispensing their liberality to the nabob and exercising the greatest generosity to the english officers in distress  a disturbance in short without its parallel in history which was raised by two women  carried on by two eunuchs  and finally suppressed by an affidavit  mr sheridan then adverted to the negociations of mr middleton with the begums in      when the discontents of the superior begum would have induced her to leave the country unless her authority was sanctioned and her property secured by the guarantee of the company  this guarantee the counsel  or mr hastings had thought it necessary to deny as knowing that if the agreements with the elder begum were proved it would affix to mr hastings the guilt of all the sufferings of the women of the khord mahal the revenues for whose support were secured by the same engagement in treating this part of the subject the principal difficulty arose from the uncertain evidence of mr middleton who though concerned in the negotiation of four treaties could not recollect affixing his signature to three out of that number mr sheridan proved however from the evidence even of mr middleton that a treaty had been signed in october      wherein the rights of the elder begum were fully recognized a provision secured for the women and children of the late vizier in the khord mahal and that these engagements had received the fullest sanction of mr hastings these facts were confirmed by the evidence of mr purling a gentleman who mr sheridan said had delivered himself fairly and as having no foul secrets to conceal he had transmitted copies of these engagements in    0 to mr hastings at calcutta the answer returned was that in arranging the taxes on the other districts he should pass over the jaghires of the begums no notice was then taken of any impropriety in the transactions in      nor any notice given of an intended revocation of those engagements  but in june      when genesis clavering and col monson being no more and mr francis having returned to europe all the hoard and arrear of collected evil burst forth without restraint and mr hastings determined on his journey to the upper provinces  it was then that without adverting to intermediate transactions he met with the nabob asoph ul dowlah at chunar and received from him the mysterious present of  00000l to form a proper idea of this transaction it was only necessary to consider the respective situation of him who gave and him who received this present it was not given by the nabob from the superflux of his wealth nor in the abundance of his esteem for the man to whom it was given it was on the contrary a prodigal bounty drawn from a country depopulated  no matter whether by natural causes or by the grinding of oppression it was raised by an exaction which took what calamity had spared and rapine overlooked  and pursued those angry dispensations of providence when a prophetic chastisement had been inflicted on a fated realm  the secrecy which had marked this transaction was not the smallest proof of its criminality  when benaram pundit had a short time before made a present to the company of a lack of rupees mr hastings in his own language deemed it worthy the praise of being recorded but in this instance when ten times that sum was given neither mr middleton nor the council were acquainted with the transaction until mr hastings four months after felt himself compelled to write an account to england and the intelligence returned thus circuitously to his friends in india it was peculiarly observable in this transaction how much the distresses of the different parties were at variance mr hastings travels to the nabob to see no doubt and enquire into his distresses but immediately takes for him   0000l to be applied to the necessities of the distressed east india company but on farther deliberation these considerations vanish a third object arises more worthy than either of the former and the money is taken from the one and demanded from the other to be applied to the use of  the distressed mr hastings  the money it was alleged by mr hastings had been originally taken to discharge the arrear of the army it had not been applied to that use because it was received in bills on gopal dos a rich banker of benares who was then kept a prisoner by cheit sing  major scott being questioned on the subject declared that bills on gopal dos were as good as cash for that though the principal of the house was a prisoner that circumstance made no difference whatsoever with the other partners thus mr hastings was inconsistent with himself by alleging an objection which should have prevented his taking the money in the first instance for the purpose he had stated and major scott contradicting mr hastings removed the objection and restored the business to its original footing  but through all those windings of mysterious hypocrisy and of artificial concealment it was easy to mark the sense of hidden guilt mr hastings himself being driven from every other hold advanced the state plea of state necessity but of this necessity he had brought no proof it was a necessity which listened to whispers for the purpose of crimination and dealt in rumor to prove its own existence  to a general leading the armies of britain  to an admiral bearing her thunders over the seas the plea of necessity might be indulged if the wants of those were to be supplied whose blood had been spilt in the service of their country but then like the imperial eagle descending from its nest though it desolated the skirts of the rock the motive and the conduct would be equally conspicuous no concealment would then be necessary and they would disdain the veil which covered the dark mean arts of busy peculation  on the business of the treaty of chunar which succeeded the acceptance of this bribe mr sheridan was equally perspicuous and equally severe it was a proceeding he observed which as it had its beginning in corruption had its continuance in fraud and its end in violence the first proposition of the nabob after his recent liberality was that the army should be removed and all the english recalled from his dominions the bribe which he had given was the obvious price of their removal he felt the weight of their oppression  he knew to speak his own language  that when the english staid they staid to wing to watch the first buddings of its prosperity and to nip every every promise of future luxuriance  to this demand mr hastings had promised to accede and to recall every englishman from the province but by an evasion which mr middleton disclosed with so much difficulty to their lordships on the last day of his appearrnce had shaken the tree until nothing remained upon its leafless branches yet a new flight was on the ask for something though their predecessors had exhausted the revenue  though they the promise was virtually recalled no order were afterward given for the establishment of englishmen in the province but recommendations of the same effect with mr middleton and the vizier were sent and the practice coninued  in the agreement respecting the resumption of the jaghires the nabob had been duped by a similar deception he had demanded and obtained leave to resume those of certain individuals mr hastings however defeated the permission by making the order general knowng that there were some favorites of the nabobs whom he could be by no means brought to dispossess  such was the conduct of mr hastings not in the moment of cold or crafty policy but in the hour of confidence and the effervescence of his gratitude for the savor he had just received soaring above every common feeling he could deceive the man to whose liberality he stood in debted  even his gratitude was perilous  and a danger actually awaited on the return which he was to make to an effusion of generosity  the transactions in which sir elijah impey bore a share and the tenor of his evidence were the next objects of mr sheridans animadversion  the late chief justice of bengal he remarked had repeatedly stated that mr hastings left calcutta with two resources in his view  those of benares and of oude it appeared however from every circumstances that the latter resource was never in his contemplation until the insurrections in benares terminating in the capture of bedjeygur had destroyed all his hopes in that province at that instant the mind of mr hastings fertile in resources fixed itself on the treasures of the begums and sir elijah impey was dispatched to collect materials for their crimination but i have ever thought said mr sheridan the selection of such a personage for such a purpose one of the greatest aggravations of the guilt of mr hastings  that he the purity of whose character should have influenced his conduct even in his most domestic retirements  that he who if consulting the dignity of british justice should have remained as stationary as his court in calcutta  that such a man should be called to travel  00 miles for the transaction of such a business was a deviation without a plea and a degradation without example  this however was in some degree a question to be abstracted for the consideration of those who adorned and illumined the seats of justice in britain and the purity of whose character precluded the necessity of any further observations on so different a conduct  with respect to the manner in which sir elijah impey had delivered his evidence it required some observation though made without imputing to that gentleman the smallest culpability sir elijah had admitted that in giving his evidence he had never answered without looking equally to the probability and the consequences of the fact in question sometimes he had even admitted circumstances of which he had no recollection beyond the mere probability that they had taken place by consulting in this manner what was probable and the contrary he might certainly have corrected and his memory at times and mr sheridan said he would accept that mode of giving his testimony provided that the inverse of the proposition might also have place and that where a circumstance was improbable a similar degree of credit might be subtracted from the testimony of the witness five times in the house of commons and twice in that court for instance had sir elijah impey borne testimony that a rebellion was raging at fyzabad at the time of his journey to lucknow yet on the eighth examination he had contradicted all the former and declared that what he meant was that the rebellion had been raging and the country was then in some degree restored to quiet  the reasons assigned for the former errors were that he had forgotten a letter received from mr hastings informing him that the rebellion was quelled and that he had also forgotten his own proposition of traveling through fyzabad to lucknow with respect to the letter nothing could be said as it was not in evidence but the other observation would scarcely be admitted when it was recollected that in the house of commons sir elijah impey had declared that it was his proposal to travel through fyzabad which had originally brought orth the information that the way was obstructed by the rebellion  from this information sir elijah impey had gone by the way of illyabad  but what was yet more singular was that on his return he would again have returned by the way of fyzabad if he had not been again informed of the danger  so that had it not been for these friendly informations the chief justice would have run plump into the very focus of the rebellion  there were two circumstances however worthy of remark  the first was that sir elijah impey should when charged with so dangerous a commission as that of procuring evidence to prove that the begums had meditated the expulsion of their son from the throne and of the english from bengal should twice intend to pass through the city of their residence and that he as he alleged from mere motives of schoolboy curiosity should choose the primrose path  and wish when engaged in such a business to loiter in the way and idle in the sunshine  the second circumstance worthy of observation was that if a conclusion could be made from a cloud of circumstances the inference on this occasion would undoubtedly be that sir elijah impey was dissuaded by mr hastings and mr middleton from passing by the way of fyzabad as well knowing that if as a friend to mr hastings he were to approach the begums he would be convinced by his reception that nothing could be more foreign from the truth than the idea of their supposed disaffection  it was also observable that sir elijah impey at lucknow taking evidence in the face of day in support of this charge of rebellion against the begums when conversing with the nabob and his minister heard not a single word from either of a rebellion by which it was proposed to dethrone the nabob and to change the government of his dominions  and equally unaccountable it appeared that sir elijah impey who had advised the taking of those affidavits for the safety of mr hastings had never read them at the time for the purpose of seeing whether they were sufficient for the purpose or the contrary  after so long a reserve however and after declaring on oath that he thought it unnecessary the next step taken by sir elijah impey was to read the affidavits as however late they might contribute something to his information he had been led to this study by his own allegation from having been misled by mr sheridan one of the managers on the part of the commons who by looking at a book which he held in his hand had persuaded him to declare that a sworn interpreter was present on the receiving of those affidavits that major davy was present for that purpose  and that whoever it was he was perfectly satisfied with his conduct on the occasion when it was actually in evidence that that no interpreter whatsoever was present  now said mr sheridan how i by merely looking into a book could intimate the presence of an interpreter could inculcate the assistance of major davy and could also look the satisfaction conceived by sir elijah impey are questions which i believe that gentleman alone is able to determine  he should admit however he said that sir elijah impey had not strictly attended to for us on the occasion of taking those affidavits that he had merely directed the bible to be given to the whites and the koran to the blacks and had packed up in his wallet the returns of both without any further enquiry or that he had glanced over them in india having previously cut off all communication between his eye and his mind so that no consciousness was transferred from the former to the latter and that he had read them in england if possible with less information  however strange these circumstances might be he would admit them all  he would even admit that the affidavits were legally and properly taken  and yet would prove that those affidavits were not sufficient to sustain any one point of criminality against those who were the subjects of the present charge  after some brief observations on some parts of the affidavits particularly on those of a native officer who as mr sheridan observed gave a specimen of platoon firing in his evidence by giving three affidavits in one day he concluded with observing tha as it would tend very much to abbreviate the discussion of the present charge to enter more largely into the tendency of those affidavits he should therefore make a pause for the present and take the liberty of calling the attention of their lordships more particularly to this point on an ensuing day  mr sheridan spoke for four hours and a half nothing could be more perfect than his delivery but that at some distant intervals the excess of his feelings occasioned him to be less distinctly heard than usual  at half past four oclock the court adjourned  friday june        the court being seated at half past twelve after a short pause mr sheridan resumed his speech by expressing his satisfaction that in the interval of the adjournment the remaining part of the evidence etc had been printed and laid before their lordships as it was the wish of the managers that every document should be before the court at the time for the purpose of determining with more accuracy whether they had or had not borne out the charges which they presented  recurring then to the affidavits taken by sir elijah impey at lucknow they formed he observed a material article in the defense of mr hastings and on the decision of their lordships respecting the weight of the allegations which they contained a greater part of this question would finally depend  with respect to one part of charge made on the begums  their having shown an uniform spirit of hostility to the british government it had not only failed but was absolutely abandoned by the counsel for the prisoner as not being supported by a tittle of evidence in deciding on the other parts of this charge their having committed an overt act of rebellion  their having inflamed the jaghirdars  and excited the discontents in oude their lordships were to consider the situation in which mr hastings stood at the time when these charges were made  having failed in his attempt at benares his mind was entirely directed to the treasures of the begums he knew that such was the situation into which he had plunged the affairs of the company that he knew he could not address his venal masters unless some measure was found he had therefore stood forward as an accuser where he was also to preside as a judge  and with much caution should that judge be heard who has apparently a profit on the conviction and an interest in the condemnation of the party to be tried he would not from this infer however that the charge was groundless  but he would argue that until fully proved it should not meet with implicit credit  it was obvious also that the attempt said to have been made by the begums to dethrone the nabob and extirpate the english was in the highest degree improbable  but he would not infer from thence that it was impossible  there is in human nature a perverse propensity to evil which had sometimes caused the perpetration of bad acts without any obvious gratification resulting to the perpetrator all he should claim therefore was that the accusations brought by mr hastings against the begums should undergo a candid examination and that probable evidence at least should be brought to the support of charges in themselves improbable  mr hastings in his defense had complained that his prosecutor had attempted to blacken these affidavits as rash irregular and irrelevant when they had been authenticated by the presence of sir elijah impey and as he also observed being taken in an enquiry directed solely to establish the guilt of cheit sing they were merely an accessory evidence in the present case and were therefore less liable to suspicion the reasoning in this last instance mr sheridan observed would undoubtedly be good but that the assertion that the enquiries were exclusively directed to the crimination of cheit sing had been proved an absolute falsehood as they were really intended to justify what was afterward to be done with respect to the epithets bestowed on those affidavits by his hon friend the truth would best appear from a review of their contents  mr sheridan then proceeded to remark on the affidavits severally as far as they related to charges against the begums those of the jemmadars or native subaltern officers contained nothing it appeared but vague rumor and improbable surmise  hyder beg cawn the minister of the nabob though swearing both to rumor and to fact could mention no particulars of an insurrection which was to have dethroned his sovereign nor was the evidence of col hannay and the other english officers more conclusive loud suspicions appeared to have been propagated at a time of general disturbance and when the flames of war were raging in the neighboring province of benares mr middleton though swearing after he had received his final orders from mr hastings respecting the seizure of the treasures could only say  that he believed the begums had given countenance to the rebels and as he had heard some aid  the whole of the depositions mr sheridan observed were so futile that were they defended in an inferior court of justice he was convinced that he should be forbidden to reply and told that was combating with that which was nothing  with respect to the first part of the charge the rebellion of the begums he had examined with all the painful research of an antiquary but could find no trace of any such transaction no blow was struck  no march was made against the concealed enemy but the rebellion though commenced for a most unnatural purpose was suffered to die a natural death  the counsel had thought proper to dwell for a time on the nabob going to fyzabad on his return from chunar attended by a guard of  000 men mr middleton being asked whether these men were wellappointed though on another occasion he had declared himself no military man caught in the instant at gleam of martial memory and answered in the affirmative the contrary however was proved by the evidence of capt edwards who attended the nabob as his aiddecamp and also that those troops were actually mutinous for their pay who were then taken to stop the progress of disaffection yet he would agree to all that the counsel required  he would suffer the whole  000 men to enter full trot into the city of fyzabad for capt edwards had fully proved that it was merely the usual guard of the nabob  it would therefore have been disrespectful to have gone with less attendance he could have no motive for going incog unless he might have intended to make himself a perfect match for the insurrection which was also incog or thought that a rebellion without an army would be most properly subdued by a prince without a guard  another supposed proof of the disaffection of the begums was brought by alleging that  000 nudgics had been raised at fyzabad and sent to the assistance of cheit sing and this for no other reason than a detachment of the same number was in the list of the forces of that rajah this single circumstance was taken as a full and complete evidence of the identity of those troops it was no matter that the officer second in command with cheit sing had sworn that the detachment came from lucknow and not from fyzabad  this mr hastings would have to be a trisling mistake of one capital for another  the same officer however had also deposed that the troops were of a different description those of begum being swordsmen and those in the service of the rajah matchlock men  the inference to be made therefore undoubtedly was that the detachment did actually come from lucknow not sent perhaps by the nabob but by some of the jaghirdars his favorites who had abundant power for that purpose and whose aversion to the english had always been avowed  the name of sadib ally his halfbrother had been mentioned as being highly criminal in these transactions  but to the question why he was not punished sir elijah impey had given the best answer at that bar  by informing their lordships that sadib ally was miserably poor he had therefore found protection in his poverty and safety in his insolvency every common maxim of judging on such occasions was certain to be overturned by mr hastings  it was generally supposed that the needy were the most daring and that necessity was the strongest stmulus to innovation but the governor general inverting this proposition had laid it down as an axiom  that the actions of the poor were sufficiently punished by contempt  that the guilt of an offender should increase in a precise ratio with his wealth  and that in fine where there was no treasure there could undoubtedly be no treason  mr sheridan next read the letter of the begum to mr hastings complaining of the suspicions which had been so unjustly raised of her conduct and referring to capt gordon who could testify her innocence he also read the letter of capt gordon to the begum thanking her for her interference and acknowledging that he owed his life to her bounty it had been asked with an air of some triumph why capt gordon was not called to that bar he had answered then as now that he would not call on a man who in his affidavit had suppressed all mention of this important transaction he trusted that if ever he saw him at that bar he should witness a contrite zeal to do away the effects of that silence and behold a penitential tear for the part he had then taken he hoped however for the honor of human nature that capt gordon was then under a delusion  and that he was led on by mr middleton who was well informed of the business to act a part o which he did not know the consequences every feeling of humanity recoiled from the transaction taken in any other point of view it was difficult to imagine that any man could say to a benefactor the breath that i now draw next to heaven i owe to you  my existence is an emanation from your bounty  i am indebted to you beyond all possibility of return and therefore  my gratitude shall be your destruction  the original letters on this occasion from colonel hannay and captain gordon to the begum had been transmitted by her through major gilpin to mr middleton for the purpose of being shown to mr hastings but the leaves were torn from mr middletons letterbook in the place where hey should have appeared when examined on this subject he said that he had deposited persian copies of those letters in the office at lucknow but that he did not bring translates with him to calcutta  because he left lucknow the very day after he had received the originals this excuse mr sheridan said he could boldly assert was a flat and decided perjury it could be proved by corresponding dates that middleton had received those letters at least a month before he left lucknow he departed from that city on the   th of october but must have received those letters before the  0th of the preceding month he was therefore well aware of the purity of those in whose oppression he was engaged he knew that their attachment was fully proved at the very time when they were charged with disaffection but as their punishment was predetermined he in concert with his principal found it necessary to suppress the testimonials of their innocence  this mass of fraud and cruelty covered as it had been by every art which the vile agents could devise was now bared to the view by the aid of that power who can give a giants nerve even to an infant arm  the injured sufferers with tears more powerful than argument and with sighs more impressive than eloquence supplicated their lordships justice and called for that retribution which should take place on the detested but unrepenting author of their wrongs  the benevolent interference of the begum in favor of capt gordon had been assigned by mr hastings in his defense to her intelligence of the successes of the english at that period  that this allegation was founded in manifest falsehood could very easily be proved  the only success which the british forces at that time met with was that of col blair on the  d of september but where he himself acknowledged that another victory gained at such a loss would be equal to a defeat  the reports spread around the country at the time were of the most unfavorable cast  that mr hastings had been slain at benares and that the english were every where routed  these reports it was to be remarked were of infinitely more consequence to the present argument than the facts which really occurred but if any doubt remained on the mind of any man it was only necessary to recur to a neverfailing evidence in that of mr hastings against himself  in a letter to the council which was on record mr hastings acknowledged that from the   d of august to the   d of sept which included ofcourse the time of captain gordons liberation he had been confined in a situation of the utmost hazard that his safety during that time was extremely precarious and that the affairs of the english were generally thought to be unfavorable in the extreme in his defense however these admissions were totally forgotten there was also an observable inconsistency in what was there alleged that colonel hannay had written to the begum in the style of supplication  because in the desperate situation of affairs he knew of no other which he could adopt and yet in the same sentence it was averred that the begums had procured the release of captain gordon  from her knowledge of the prosperous advances of our army  it appeared therefore beyond the possibility of a doubt that those princesses had demonstrated the firmness of their attachment to the english not in the moment of success  not from the impulse of fear nor from the prospect of future protection  but at a time when the hoard of collected vengeance was about to burst over our heads when the measure of european guilt in india appeared to be completely filled by the oppressions which had just then been exercised on the unfortunate cheit sing and when offended heaven seemed to interfere to change the meek disposition of the natives to awaken their resentments and to inspirit their revenge  the second of the remaining parts of the charge against the begums was their having enflamed the jaghirdars it was evident however even from the letters of mr middleton himself that no such aid was wanted to awaken resentments which must unavoidably have arisen from the nature of the business  there were many powerful interests concerned  the jaghires which were depending were of a vast amount and as their owners by the resumption would be reduced at once to poverty and distress their own feelings were sufficient to produce every effect which had been described it was idle therefore to ascribe to the begums without a shadow of proof the inspiring of sentiments which must have existed without their interference i shall not waste the time of the court said mr sheridan on such a subject but appeal to your lordships individually to determine whether on a proposal being made to conficate your several estates  and the magnitude of the objects are not very unequal  the interference of any two ladies in this kingdom would be at all necessary to awaken your resentments and to rouse you to opposition etc  the discontents which prevailed in the province of oude had been also and with similar justice attributed to these princesses and formed the third and last article of charge against them but the conduct of the officers residing in that province the repeated complaints from the natives and the acknowledged rapacity of col hannay left no difficulty in tracing those discontents to the source where they had originated the nabob himself was so well convinced of the tyranny of col hannay that on a proposition coming from mr hastings to send him back into the province the nabob swore by mahomet that if the colonel was sent back he would quit the province and come to reside with mr hastings the governor general some time after sent an apology for the suggestion but it was then too late  col hannay was dead  and the province was desolate if a stranger just arrived and ignorant of every former transaction were then to survey the once fertile plains of oude he would ask  what savage invader had waged such terrible hostilities against the bounties of heaven and the works of man what civil fury or what religious frenzy had depopulated the scene even to a waste of desolation what pernicious monster sent by vindictive heaven had swept through its plains and with pestiferous breath blasted all it could not consume  to these questions some native with a tearful eye and subdued aspect would have answered  that no war no dissentions no monster had produced those effects which were all owing  to an alliance with the eglish  and that this disastrous connection had been fraught with more ills than the most incenced enemy could desire or a merciful providence descend to inflict  that this representation was not exaggerated would appear from the description of maj naylor who had succeeded colonel hannay and who had previously saved him from the vengeance which the assembled ryots of husbandmen were about to take on their oppressor the progress of extortion it appeared had not been uniform in that province  it had absolutely increased as its resources failed and as the labor of exaction became more difficult the price of that increased labor had been charged as an additionl tax on the wretched inhabitants  at length even in their meek bosoms where injury never before begot resentment nor despair aroused to courage increased oppression had its due effect they assembled round their oppressor and had nearly made him their sacrifice so deeply were they impressed with the sense of their wrongs that they would not accept of even life from those who had rescued col hannay they presented themselves to the swords of the soldiery and as they lay bleeding on the banks of their sacred stream they comforted themselves with the ghastly hopes that their blood would not descend into the soil but that it would ascend to the view of the god of nature and there claim a retribution for their wrongs  of a people thus injured and thus feeling it was an audacious fallacy to attribute the conduct to any external impulse  that god who gave them the form of man implanted also the wish to vindicate the rights of man though simple in their manners they were not so uninformed as not to know  that power is in every state a trust reposed for the general good and that the trust being once abused should of course be instantly resumed  though the innocence of the begums mr sheridan continued was thus proved beyond a possibility of doubt it could not but be allowed that he argued fairly if he did not immediately infer from that proof the guilt of mr hastings he would go so far as to admit that mr hastings might have been deluded by his accomplices and have been persuaded into a conviction of a criminality which did not exist if that were proved he would readily agree to acquit the prisoner of the present charge but if on the contrary there appeared in his subsequent conduct uch a concealment as denoted the fullest conciousness of guilt if all his narrations of the business were marked with inconsistency and contradiction that mind must be inaccessible to conviction which could entertain a doubt of his criminality  from the month of sept in which the seizure of the treasures took place until the january following had mr hastings wholly concealed the transaction from the council at calcutta if any thing could be more singular than this concealment it was the reasons by which it was afterward attempted to be justified mr hastings first pleaded a want of leisure he was writing to the council at a time when he complained of an absolute inaction  he found time to narrate some pretty eastern tales respecting the attachment of the seapoys to their cannon and their dressing them with flowers on particular occasions  but of a rebellion which convulsed an empire  of the seizure of the treasures to such an amount he could not find leisure to say one syllable until he had secured an excuse for his conduct in the possession of the money  the second excuse was that all communication was cut off with fyzabad and this was alleged at the time when letters were passing daily between him and mr middleton and when sir elijah impey had pronounced the road to be as free from interruption as that between london and brentford  the third excuse was that mr middleton had taken with him on his departure from chunar all the original papers which it was necessary for mr hastings to consult  that the original papers had not been removed was evident however from mr hastings sending a copy of the treaty of chunar to mr middleton on the fourth day after the residents departure though it appeared that it was after to be reinclosed at a proper time to mr hastings to be shown to the council a copy of the same had been shown to the oriental grotius sir elijah impey which he confessed his having read at the time when he declared his ignorance of the guarantee granted to the princesses of oude looking to the absurdity of reasons such as these assigned in defense of a silence so criminal mr sheridan declared that he would lay aside every other arguments  that he would not dwell on any other topic of guilt if the counsel for mr hastings would but join issue on this point and prove to the satisfaction of the court that any of these excuses were in the smallest degree sufficient for the purpose for which they were assigned  amidst the other artifices of concealment was a letter from col hannay dated oct         which mr sheridan proved beyond dispute could not have been written at the time but was fabricated at a subsequent period as it contained a mention of facts which could by no possibility have been known to col hannay at the time when it was pretended to have been written  whatever else could be done for the purpose of concealment was done in that mixture of canting and mystery of rhapsody and enigma  mr hastings narrative of his journey to benares  he there set out with a solemn appeal to heaven for the truth of his averments and a declaration of the same purport to mr wheeler the faith however thus pledged was broken both to god and man for it was already in evidence that no single transaction had occurred as it was there stated  the question would undoubtedly occur to every person who had attended to these proceedings  why mr hastings had used all these efforts to veil the whole of this business in mystery  it was not strictly incumbent on him to answer the question yet he would reply that mr hastings had obviously a bloody reason for the concealment  he had looked to the natural effect of strong injuries on the human mind as in the case of cheit sing he thought that oppression must beget resistance and the efforts which might be made by the begums in their own defense though really the effect he was determined to represent as the cause of his proceedings  even when disappointed in those aims by the natural meekness and submission of those with whom he was to act he could not abandon the idea  and accordingly in his letter to the directors of jan        had represented the subsequent disturbances in oude as the positive cause of the violent measures which he had adopted  two months before those disturbances had existence  he there congratulates his masters on the seizure of those treasures which by the law of mahomet he assures them were the property of asophul dowla thus the perturbed spirit of the mohammedan law according to mr hastings idea still hovered round those treasures and envied them to every possessor until it at length saw them safely lodged within the sanctuary of the british treasury  in the same spirit of piety mr hastings had assured the house of commons that the inhabitants of asia believed that some unseen power interfered and conducted all his pursuits to their destined end  that providence however which thus conducted the efforts of mr hastings was not the providence to which others profess themselves indebted which interferes in the cause of virtue and insensibly leads guilt toward its punishment it was not in fine that providence whose works are goodness and whose ways are right  the unseen power which protected mr hastings operated by leading others into criminality which as far as it respected the governor general was highly fortunate in its effects  if the rajah nundcomar brings a charge against mr hastings providence so orders it that the rajah has committed a forgery some years before which with some friendly assistance proves a sufficient reason to remove out of the way so troublesome an acquaintance  if the companys affairs are deranged through the want of money providence ordains it so that the begums though unconsciously fall into a rebellion and give mr hastings an opportunity of seizing on their treasures thus the successes of mr hastings depended not on any positive merit in himself it was to the inspired felonies the heavenborn crimes and the providential treasons of others that he was indebted for each success and for the whole tenor of his prosperity  it must undoubtedly bear a strange appearance that a man of reputed ability should even when acting wrongly have had recourse to so many bungling artifices and spread so thin a veil over his deceptions but those who testified any surprise at this circumstance must have attended but little to the demeanor of mr hastings through the whole course of his conduct he seemed to have adhered to one general rule  to keep as clear as possible off the fact which he was to related  observing this maxim his only study was to lay a foundation as fanciful and as ornamented as possible then by a superadded mass of fallacies the superstructure was soon complete though by some radical defect it never failed to tumble on his own head  rising from those ruins however he was soon found rearing a similar edifice but with a like effect  delighting in difficulties he disdained the plain and secure foundation of truth he loved on the contrary to build on a precipice and to encamp on a mine  inured to falls he felt not the danger and frequent defeats had given him a hardihood without impressing a sense of the disgrace  it had been a maxim once as much admitted in the practice of common life as in the school of philosophy that where heaven was inclined to to destroy the vice it began by debasing the intellect this idea was carried still farther by the right hon gentleman mr burke who opened the prosecution who declared that prudence and vice were things absolutely incompatible  that the vicious man being deprived of his best energies and curtailed in his proportion of understanding was left with such a shortsighted degree of penetration as could not come under the denomination of prudence  this sentiment did honor to the name of his right honorable friend if that name could now be mentioned with additional honor  but it was still to be remembered that there were other characters beside a caesar and a cromwell who acting on determinations inimical to virtue and hostile to the laws of society had proceeded if not with prudence yet with an allcommanding sagacity that was productive of similar effects those however were isolated characters which left the vice that dared to follow either in a state of despondent vassalage or involved it in destruction such was the present instance of failure and such it was always to be trusted would be that of every other who regarded such characters with an eye of emulation  such was the perpetual law of nature that virtue whether placed in a circle more contracted or enlarged moved with sweet consent in its allotted orbit  there was no dissonance to jar no asperity to divide  and that harmony which made its felicity at the same time constituted its protection  of vice on the contrary the parts were disunited and each in barbarous language clamoured for its preeminence  it was a scene where though one domineering passion might have sway the others still pressed forward with their dissonant claims and in the moral world effects still awaiting on their causes the discord of course ensured the defeat  after dwelling for some time time on this topic with a beauty which we find it impossible to describe and with a sublimity which has rarely if it ever had been equalled  mr sheridan reverted again to the subject of the claims made on the princesses of oude  whether those were first made by the nabob or suggested to him by his sovereign mr hastings though the counsel had labored much to prove the former appeared to him to carry very little difference if the seizure was made as a confiscation and punishment for supposed guilt then if ever there was a crime which ought to pass unwhipped of justice it was that where a son must necessarily be made the instrument of an infliction by which he broke his covenant of existence and violated the condition by which he held his rank in society if on the contrary it was meant as a resumption in consequence of a supposed right in the nabob then mr hastings should have recollected the guarantee of the company granted to the begums unless it was meant to say that mr hastings acted in that as in other instances and assured them of his protection  until the very moment when it was wanted  it was idle however to dwell on the conduct or free agency of a man who it was notorious had no will of his own what mr middleton asserted at that bar would scarcely be put in competition with a series of established facts by which it appeared that the nabob had submitted to every indignity and yielded to every assumption  it was an acknowleged fact that he had even been brought to join in that paltry artifice which had been termed the subornation of letters this practice was carried to such a length that he in the end complained in a manner rather ludicrous that he was really tired of sending different characters of mr bristow in pursuanc of the directions sent to the resident  he had pronounced black white and white black so often that he really knew not what to say and therefore begged that once for all the friends of mr hastings might be considered as his and that their enemies might also be the same  after this it was superfluous to argue that the nabob could direct his view to so important an object as the seizing of the treasures unless he had been impelled by mr middleton and authorized by mr hastings  at half past four oclock mr sheridan being apparently exhausted by so very animated a speech of four hours continuance the court adjourned  tuesday june  0 mr sheridan resumed his speech at the very point where he had concluded on friday last he felt himself too highly honored he said by the attention which had been paid by their lordships to think any repetition necessary he had already proved to every unbiassed mind the vassallage in which the nabob of oude was kept by mr hastings and his agents he had proved that if ever the nabob was independent if ever he was suffered to act from the suggestions of his own mind in this business of the begums he acted under a strong and systematic compulsion  he could also make it appear to their lordships that this dark and mysterious transaction had been conducted by three principals and three subordinates the principals were mr hastings sir elijah impey and mr middleton the subordinates colonel hannay hyder beg cawn the ostensible minister of the nabob and ali abram cawn another black agent in the business by those it would plainly appear the whole business was transacted that the mystery of the conduct could only be equalled by the iniquity of its conclusion  before he proceeded however to the main business of the charge he found it necessary to remark on two particular circumstances overlooked in his former comments on the evidence  the first of these was the pretended ignorance of sir elijah impey respecting the substance of the affidavits  he had declared that he had no conversation on the subject with mr hastings because he had left chunar on the day following their delivery  this however would not be looked on as a valid excuse when it was known that mr hastings and sir elijah impey left that place together and traveled in company with each other  and what was yet more strange he pleaded ignorance of the contents of those affidavits though in six days after he was found at buxar administering an oath to major davy with respect to the fidelity of his official translation of the affidavits from the persian language  the second circumstance which called for notice was the suppression of the evidence of hoolus roy the most active agent through the whole of these transactions  his affidavit was taken with the rest  from his situation it must have contained strong matter either to criminate or prove the innocence of the begums  but by some strange accident this strong affidavit was  by some means suppressed  mr sheridan then adverted at some length to the contradictory accounts given by mr hastings of the violence used toward the begums particularly with respect to the seizure of their jaghires that which was undoubtedly an attrocious violence and unjustifiable fraud was at one time inflicted as a punishment for their contumacy  at another the justice of the measure was so far a matter of doubt that even mr hastings professed his readiness to stipulate and to ensure to the princesses a proper equivalent for those jaghires the contradictions however were not confined to this circumstance the nabob it appeared from the correspondence marked as it was by that knavish halfconfidence which was incident to such transactions had offered to submit to the seizure of the treasures merely as an alternative less dangerous than the resumption of the jaghires much ingenuity was employed to make this appear as the suggestion of the nabob though it was clearly apparent that it was the proposition of mr hastings an equal ingenuity appeared in mr hastingss mode of accepting an alternative which was when one concession was proffered in lieu of another  to seize on both  the conduct of the governor general was also illustrated in a part of his defense where he admitted that there were private reasons for his conduct toward the begums  but which wanting the authenticity of according evidence he did not choose at present to bring forward there was even in this statement a modesty very unusual with mr hastings  he who in every other instance advanced assertions in the room of proof  in the present would not state any thing which wanted the validity of recorded evidence  there was however sufficient to show that in addition to the allowed rapacity of mr hastings there was not wanting the additional incentive of personal malice  the conduct of mr middleton was the next subject of discussion  his scruples with respect to the seizure of jaghires satisfied at first with a hint but afterward requiring a more formal sanction the difference between his public and private letters and his offers to change the tenor of the former at the will of the governorgeneral all underwent a severe animadversion these observations involved of course a very complicated detail which though necessary to the ends of justice could if pursued by us afford but little gratification  at half past two oclock when mr adam was reading some letters of mr middleton and major naylor mr sheridan felt such an increasing indisposition as compelled him to retire and shortly after mr fox informed their lordships that the hon manager who had taken up the present charge felt himself totally unable to proceed in such a manner as to do justice to the cause in which he was engaged  the court immediately arose and adjourned  friday june         the court notwithstanding the recent disappointment occasioned by the illness of mr sheridan was this day as full as ever  at twelve oclock the lord chancellor and the mover of the present charge appeared in their respective places and both we are happy to say in a state of recovered health  of the former we could only judge by his appearance  mr sheridan afforded other grounds to form our opinion  an animation which gave force to his sublimity  and an energy which spread itself through his hearers  his conclusion of this day formed a climax of such excellence as cannot be described  and which when fainter impressions are faded and forgotten will cause his hearers to be envied  mr sheridan began by apologizing for the interruption which his indisposition had caused on the former day he assured their lordships in the strongest terms that nothing but the importance of the cause to which he felt himself totally unable to do justice could have made him trespass on that indulgence which on other occasions he had so amply experienced  he had then concluded with submitting to their lordships the whole of the correspondence as far as it could be obtained between the principals and agents in the nefarious plot carried on against the nabob vizier and the begums of oude these letters were worthy the most abstracted attention of their lordships as containing not only a narrative of that foul and unmanly conspiracy but also a detail of the motives and ends for which it was formed and an exposition of the trick the quibble the prevarication and the untruth with which it was then acted and now attempted to be defended  the question would undoubtedly suggest itself why the correspondence was ever produced by the parties against whom it was now adduced in evidence and who had so much reason to distrust the propriety of their own conduct  to this the answer was that it was owing to a mutual and providential resentment which had broken out between the parties which was generally the case between persons concerned in such transactions mr middleton was incensed and felt as a galling triumph the confidence reposed by the governorgeneral in other agents  mr hastings was offended by the tardy wariness which marked the conduct of middleton by the various remonstrances by the agent  though as knowing the man to whom they were addressed they were all grounded on motives of policy not of humanity and of expediency which left justice entirely out of the question but the great ostensible ground of quarrel was that middleton had dared to spend two days in negotiation  though that delay had prevented the general massacre of upwards of two thousand persons  the real cause however of this difference was a firm belief on the part of mr hastings that mr middleton had inverted their different situations and kept the lions share of plunder to himself there were undoubtedly some circumstances to justify this suspicion at the time when mr hastings had first complained the nabobs treasury was empty and his troops so mutinous for their pay as even to threaten his life yet in this moment of gratitude and opulence middleton intimated the nabobs desire to make mr hastings a present of  00000l that facrifice however not being deemed sufficient mr middleton was recalled and major palmer was sent in his room with instructions to tell the nabob that such a donation was not to be attempted the prince however with an unfortunate want of recollection said that no such offer had ever been in his mind  thus it had always been considered as the heightening of a favor bestowed that the receiver should not know from what quarter it came but it was reserved for mr middleton to improve on this by such a delieate refinement that the person giving should be totally ignorant of the favor he conferred  but notwithstanding these little differences and suspicions mr hastings and mr middleton on the return of the latter to calcutta in october      continued to live in the same style of friendly collusion and fraudulent familiarity as ever but when mr bristow not answering the purposes of mr hastings was accused on the snborned letters procured from the nabob one of which pronounced him to be blackest character in existence whilst another of the same date spoke of him as a very honest fellow mr hastings thought it might appear particular and therefore after their late intimacy of six months accuses mr middleton also before the board at calcutta it was then that in the rash eagerness which distinguished his pursuit of every object mr hastings had incautiously but happily for the present purposes of justice brough forth those secret letters it mattered not what were the views which induced mr hastings to bring to bring that charge whether he had drawn up the accusation or obliged middleton with his aid in framing a defense the whole had ended in a repartee and a poetical quotation from the governor general the only circumstance material to the purposes of humanity was the production of instruments by which those who had violated every principle of justice and benevolence were to see their guilt explained and it was to be hoped to experience that punishment which they deserved  to those private letters it was that their lordships were to look for whatever elucidation of the subject could be drawn from the parties concerned written in the moments of confidence they declared the real motive and object of each measure the public letters were only to be regarded as proofs of guilt whenever they established a contradiction the counsel for the prisoner had chosen as the safest ground to rely on the public letters written for the concealment of fraud and purpose of deception they had for instance particularly dwelt on a public letter from mr middleton dated in december      which intimated some particulars of supposed contumacy in the begums with a view to countenance the transactions which shortly after took place and particularly the resumption of the jaghires but this letter both sir elijah impey and mr middleton had admitted in their examination at that bar to be totally false though if it were in every point true the apprehension of resistance to a measure could not by any means be made a ground for the enforcement of that measure in the first instance the counsel seemed displeased with mr middleton for the answer and therefore repeated the question the witness however did not readily fall into their humor for he declared that he did not recollect a particle of the letter and though memory was undoubtedly not the forte of mr middleton he was not perhaps entirely faulty on this occasion as the letter was certainly of a later fabrication and perhaps not from his hand this letter however was also in direct contradiction to every one of the defenses set up by mr hastings  another public letter which had been equally dwelt on spoke of the determination of the nabob to resume the jaghires it had appeared in evidence that the nabob could by no threats be compelled to yield to their measures  that it was not until mr middleton had actually issued his own perwannas for the collection of the rents that the nabob rather than be brought to the utmost state of degradation agreed to let the measure be brought forward on his own act the resistance of the begums to that measure was noticed in the same letter as an instance of female levity  as if their defense of the property assigned for their subsistence was to be made a reproach  or that they deserved a reproof for female lightness by entertaining a feminine objection  to their being starved  this resistance to the measure which was expected and the consoling slaughter on which mr hastings relied were looked to in all those letters as a justification of the measure itself there was not the smallest mention of the anterior rebellion which by prudent afterthought had been so greatly magnified there was not a syllable of those dangerous machinations which were to have dethroned the nabob  of those sanguinary artifices by which the english were to have been extirpated  not a particle concerning those practices was mentioned in any of middletons letters to hastings or in the still more confidential communication which he maintained with sir elijah impey though after the latter his letters were continually posting even when the chief justice was traveling round the country in search of affidavits when on the   th of november he was busies at lucknow on that honorable business and when three days after he was found at chunar at the distance of  00 miles prompting his instruments and like hamlets ghost exclaiming  swear  his progress on that occasion was so whimsically sudden when contrasted with the gravity of his employ that an observer would be tempted to quote again from the same scene   ha old truepenny can thou mole so fast in the ground  here however the comparison ceased  for when sir elijah made his visit to lucknow  to whet the almost blunted purpose of the nabob his language was wholly different from that of the poet  it would have been much against his purpose to have said taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught on the subject of those affidavits he would only make another single observation  sir elijah impey had denied all acquaintance with their contents though he had been actually accompanied to buxar by major davy who there translated them from the persian for the use of mr hastings  there was amongst them an affidavit taken in english from a native at buxar but which was first explained to the deponent by major davy in the presence of sir elijah impey  how far therefore the assertion of the chief justice was plausible and how far this fact was consistent with that assertion he should leave it to their lordships to determine  it was in some degree observable that not one of the private letters of mr hastings had been produced at any time  even middleton when all confidence was broken between them by the production of his private correspondence at calcutta either feeling for his own safety or sunk under the fascinating influence of his master did not dare to attempt a retaliation  the letters of middleton however were sufficient to prove the situation of the nabob when pressed to the measure of rescuing the jaghire in which he had been represented as acting wholly from himself  he was there described as lost in sullen melancholy  with feelings agitated beyond expression and with every mark of agonized sensibility to such a degree was this apparent that even middleton was moved to interfere for a temporary respite in which he might be more reconciled to the measure i am fully of opinion said he that the despair of the nabob must impel him to violence i know also that the violence must be fatal to himself  but yet i think that with his present feelings he will disregard all consequences  mr johnson also the assistant resident wrote at the same time to mr hastings to aver to him that the measure was dangerous that it would require a total reform of the collection which could not be made without a campaign  this was british justice this was british humanity mr hastings ensures to the allies of the company in the strongest terms their prosperity and his protection  the former he secures by sending an army to plunder them of their wealth and to desolate their soil  his protection is fraught with a similar security  like a vulture with talons infixed in the heart of his victim he frights away the lesser kites  and then calls the sacrifice  protection  in all the annals of human tyranny or human suffering  in the accurate illustrations of a tacitus or the luminous pages of a gibbon there did not occur such an instance of unexampled iniquity  the victims of this oppression were confessedly destitute of all power to resist their oppressors but that debility which from other bosoms would have claimed some compassion with respect to the mode of suffering here excited but the ingenuity of torture even when every feeling of the nabob was subdued nature made a lingering feeble stand within his bosom but even then that cold unfeeling spirit of malignity with whom his doom was fixed returned with double acrimony to its purpose and compelled him to inflict on a parent that destruction of which he was himself reserved but to be the last victim  to those who looked with an equal and impartial eye to the ends of justice and the interests of humanity it would appear that since the day of the original sin a scene so iniquitously cruel or so fraudfully detestable had never produced resentment or excited compassion  yet when cruelty seemed to have reached its bounds and guilt to have ascended to its climax there was something in the character of mr hastings which seemed to transcend the latter and overleap the former  and of this kind was the letter to the nabob which was dispatched on this occasion to rebuke mr middleton for his moderation as was instantly done was easily performed through the medium of a public and a private letter  but to write to the nabob in such a manner that the command might be conveyed and yet the letter afterward shown to the world was a task of more difficulty but which it appeared by the event was admirably suited to the genius of mr hastings his letter was dated the fifteenth of february      though the jaghires had been then actually seized  and it was in proof that it had been sent at a much earlier period he there assured the nabob of his coincidence with his wishes respecting the resumption of the jaghires  he declares that if he found any difficulty in the measure  he mr hastings would go to his assistance in person and lend his aid to punish those who opposed it  for that nothing could be more ardent than his friendship or more eager than his zeal for his welfare the most desperate intention was clothed in the mildest language  but the nabob knew by sad experience the character with whom he had to deal and therefore was not to be deceived he saw the dagger glistening in the hand which was treacherously extended as if to his assistance  and from that moment the last faint ray of nature expired in his bosom mr middleton from that time extended his iron scepter without resistance  the jaghires were seized every measure was carried and the nabob his feelings wounded and his dignity degraded was no longer considered as an object of regard  though these were circumstances exasperating to the human heart which felt the smallest remains of sensibility yet it was necessary in idea to review the whole from the time that this treachery was first conceived to that when by a series of artifices the most execrable it was brought to a completion mr hastings would there be seen standing aloof indeed but not inactive in the war he would be discovered reviewing his agents rebuking at one time the pale conscience of mr middleton and at another relying on the stouter villainy of hyder beg cawn with all the calmness of veteran delinquency his eye ranged through the busy prospect piercing through the darkness of subordinate guilt and arranging with congenial adroitness the agents of his crimes and the instruments of his cruelty  the feelings of the several parties at the time would be most properly judged of by their respective correspondence when the bhow begum despairing of redress from the nabob addressed herself to mr middleton and reminded him of the guarantee which he had signed she was instantly promised that the amount of her jaghire should be made good though mr middleton said he could not interfere with the sovereign decision of the nabob respecting the lands the deluded and unfortunate woman thanked god that mr middleton was at hand for her relief at the very instant when he was directing every effort to her destruction  when he had actually written the orders which were to take the collection out of the hands of her agents even when the begum was undeceived  when she found that british faith was no protection when she found that she should leave the country and prayed to the god of nations not to grant his peace to those who remained behind  there was still no charge of rebellion no recrimination made to all her reproaches for the broken faith of the enlish even when stung to madness she asked how long would be their reign no mention of her disaffection was brought forward the stress was therefore idle which the counsel for the prisoner strove to lay on these expressions of an injured and enraged woman  when at last irritated beyond bearing she denounced infamy on the heads of her oppressors who was there who would not say that she spoke in a prophetic spirit and that what she had then predicted had not even to its last letter been accomplished but did mr middleton even to this violence retort any particle of accusation no he sent a jocose reply stating that he had received such a letter under her seal but that from its contents he could not suspect it to come from her and begging therefore that she might endeavor to detect the forgery  thus did he add to foul injuries the vile aggravation of a brutal jest  like the tigers that prowl over the scene where his ravages were committed he showed the savageness of his nature by grinning over his prey and fawning over the last agonies of his unfortunate victim  those letters were then enclosed to the nabob who no more than the rest made any attempt to justify himself by imputing any criminality to the begums he only sighed a hope that his conduct to his farents had drawn no shame upon his head and declaredhis intention to punish  not any disaffection in the begums  but some officious servants who had dared to ferment the misunderstanding between them and the nabob  a letter was finally sent to mr hastings about six days before the seizure of the treasure from the begums declaring their innocence and referring the governor general to captain gordon whose life they had protected and whose safety should have been their justification that enquiry was never made it was looked on as unnecessary  because the conviction of their innocence was too deeply impressed  the council in recommending an attention to the public in preference to the privae letters had remarked in particular that one letter should not be taken as evidence because it was evidently and abstractedly private as it contained in one part the anxieties of mr middleton for the illness of his son  this was a singular argument indeed the circumstance undoubtedly merited strict observation though not in the view in which it was placed by the counsel  it went to show that some at least of those concerned in these transactions felt the force of those ties which their efforts were directed to tear asunder  that those who could ridicule the respective attachment of a mother and a son who would prohibit the reverence of the son to the mother who had given him life  who could deny to maternal debility the protection which filial tenderness should afford  were yet sensible of the straining of those chords by which they were connected  there was something in the present business with all that was horrible to create aversion  so vilely loathsome as to excite disgust  if it were not a part of his duty it would be superfluous to speak of the sacredness of the ties which those aliens to feeling  those apostates to humanity had thus divided  in such an assembly said mr sheridan as that before which i speak there is not an eye but must look reproof to this conduct  not a heart but most anticipate its condemnation  filial piety it is the primal bond of society  it is the sacrament of our existence it is almost an innate principle which starts unbidden to our lip which consults not our memory nor awaits our reason  it is a gratitude implanted for a thousand wakeful cares  a thousand nameless solicitudes for these attentions which not being remembered are the more entitled to our gratitude as having been exercised at a time when the dawning reason could not observe nor the inant memory record it is a sensation twined in the hearts inmost core and coeval with our earliest sense of existence  those who violated this solemn covenant must at the instant have stood convicted to themselves  the slowjudging formalities of the law are superfluous  they are returned as guilty by the general verdict of mankind  the jaghires being seized mr sheridan proceeded to observe the begums were left without the smallest share of that pecuniary compensation promised by mr middleton and as when tyranny and injustice take the field they are always attended by their campfollowers paltry pilfering and petty insult  so in this instance the goods taken from them were sold at a mock sale at inferior value even gold and jewels to use the language of the begums instantly lost their value when it was known that they came from them their ministers were therefore imprisoned to extort the deficiency which this fraud had occasioned and those mean arts were employed to justify a continuance of cruelty yet these again were little to the frauds of mr hastings after extorting upwards of  00000l he forbade mr middleton to come to a conclusive settlement  he knew that the treasons of our allies in india had their origin solely in the wants of the company he could not therefore say that the begums were entirely innocent until he had consulted the general record of crimes  in the cash account at calcutta  and this prudence of mr hastings was fully justified by the event  for there was actually found a balance of twentysix lacks more against the begums which   0000l worth of treason had never been dreamt of before talk not to us said the governor general of their guilt or innocence but as it suits the companys credit we will not try them by the code of justinian nor the institutes of timur  we will not judge them either by the british laws or their local customs no we will try them by the multiplication table we will find them guilty by the rule of three and we will condemn them according to the sapient and profound institutes of  cockers arithmetic  proceeding next to state the distresses of the begums in the zenana and of the women in the khord mahal mr sheridan remarked that some observation was due to the remark made by mr hastings in his defense where he declared   that whatever were the distresses there and whoever was the agent the measure was in his opinion reconcilable to justice honor and sound policy major scott  the incomparable agent of mr hastings had declared this passage to have been written by mr hastings with his own hand  then mr middleton it appeared had avowed his share in those humane transactions and blushingly retired mr hastings then cheered his drooping spirits  whatever part of the load said he yours cannot bear my unburdened character shall assume i will crown your labors with my irresistible approbation  then we twinwarriors shall go forth  do you find memory and i will find character  and assault repulse and contumely shall all be set at defiance  if i could not prove continued mr sheridan that those acts of mr middleton were in reality the acts of mr hastings i should not trouble your lordships by combating these assertions but as that part of his criminality can be incontestibly ascertained  i shall undoubtedly appeal to the assembled legislators of this realm and call on them to say whether those acts were justifiable on the score of policy  i shall appeal to all the august presidents in the courts of british justice and to all the learned ornaments of the profession to decide whether these actions were reconcilable to justice  i shall appeal to a reverend assemblage of prelates feeling for the general interests of humanity and for the honor of the religion to which they belong let them determine in their own minds whether those acts of mr hastings and mr middleton were such a christian ought to perform or a man to avow  he then proceeded to relate the circumstances of the imprisonment of bahar ally cawn and jewar ally cawn the minister of the nabob on the grounds above stated with them was confined that archrebel sumpshier cawn by whom every act of hostility that had taken place against the english was stated to have been committed  no enquiry however was made concerning his treason though many been held respecting the treasure of the others he was not so far noticed as to be deprived of his food nor was he even complimented with fetters and yet when he is on a future day to be informed of the michiefs he was now stated to have done he must think that on being forgotten he had a very providential escape  the others were on the contrary taken from their milder prison at fyzabad and when threats could effect nothing transferred by the meek humanity of mr middleton to the fortress of chunargur there where the british flag was flying they were doomed to deeper dungeons heavier chains and severer punishments three where that flag was displayed which was wont to cheer the depressed and to dilate the subdued heart of misery  these venerable but unfortunate men were fated to encounter something lower than perdition and something blacker than despair it appeared from the evidence of mr holt and others that they were both cruelly flogged though one was above seventy years of age to extort a confession of the buried wealth of the begums  being charged with a disaffection they proclaimed their innocence  tell us where are the remaining treasures was the reply  it is only a treachery to your immediate sovereigns  and you will then be fit associates for the representatives of british faith and british justice in india  oh faith oh justice exclaimed mr sheridan i conjure you by your sacred names to depart for a moment from this place though it be your peculiar residence nor hear your names profaned by such a sacrilegious combination as that which i am now compelled to repeat  it might have been hoped for the honor of the human heart that the begums had been themselves exempted from a share in these sufferings and that they had been wounded only through the sides of their ministers  the reverse of this however was the fact  their palace was surrounded by a guard which was withdrawn by major gilpin to avoid the growing resentments of the people and replaced by mr middleton through his fears from that dreadful responsibility which was imposed on him by mr hastings  the women of the khord mahal who had not been involved in the begums supposed crimes who had raised no subrebellion of their own and who it had been proved lived in a distinct dwelling were causelessly involved in the same punishment their residence surrounded with guards they were driven to despair by famine and when they poured forth in sad procession were driven back by the soldiery and beaten with bludgeons to the scene of madness which they had quitted those were acts mr sheridan observed which when told needed no comment he should not offer a single syllable to awaken their lordships feelings but leave it to the facts which had been proved to make their own impressions  the argument now reverted solely to this point whether mr hastings was to be answerable for the crimes committed by his agents it had been fully proved that mr middleton had signed the treaty with the superior begum in october      he had acknowledged signing some others of other dates but could not recollect his authority these treaties had been fully recognized by mr hastings as was fully proved by the evidence of mr purling in the year    0 in that of oct      the jaghire was secured which was allotted for the support of the women in the khord mahal on the first idea of resuming those jaghires a provision should have been secured to these unfortunate women and in this respect mr hastings was clearly guilty of a crime by his omission of making such provision but still he pleaded that he was not accountable for the cruelties which had been exercised this was the plea which tyranny aided by its prime minister treachery was always sure to set up mr middleton had attempted to strengthen this plea by endeavoring to claim the whole infamy of those transactions and to monopolize the guilt he dared even to aver that he had been condemned by mr hastings for the ignominious part he had acted  he dared to avow this because mr hastings was on his trial and he thought he should never be tried  but in the face of the court and before he left the bar he was compelled to confess that it was for the lenience not the severity of his proceedings that he had been reproved by mr hastings  it would not he trusted be argued that because mr hastings had not marked every passing shade of guilt and because he had only given the bold outline of cruelty that he was therefore to be acquitted  it was laid down by the law of england  that law which was the perfection of reason  that a person ordering an act to be done by his agent was answerable for that act with all his consequences middleton had been appointed in      the avowed and private agent  the secondself of mr hastings the governor general had ordered the measure middleton declared that it could not have been effected by milder means if he never saw nor heard afterward of the consequences of the measure he was answerable therefore for every pang that was inflicted and for all the blood that was shed but he had heard and that instantly of the whole he had written to arraign middleton of forbearance and of neglect  he commanded them to work upon their hopes and fears and to leave no means untried until  to speak their own language but which would be better suited to the banditti of a cavern  they obtained possession of the secret hoards of the old ladies  he would not allow even of a delay of two days to smooth the compelled approaches of a son to his mother on such an occasion  his orders were peremptory  and if a massacre did not take place it was the merit of accident  and not of mr hastings  after this would it be said that the prisoner was ignorant of the acts or not culpable for their consequences it was true he had not enjoined in so many words the guards the famine and the bludgeons he had not weighed the fetters nor numbered the lashes to be inflicted on his victims but yet he was equally guilty as if he had borne an active and personal share in each transaction it was as if he had commanded that the heart should be torn from the bosom and yet had enjoined that no blood should follow he was in the same degree accountable to the law to his country to his conscience and to his god  mr hastings had endeavored also to get rid of a part of his guilt by observing that he was but one of the supreme council and that all the rest had sanctioned those transactions with their approbation if mr hastings could prove however that others participated in the guilt it would not tend to diminish his own criminality but the fact was that the council had in nothing erred so much as in a criminal credulity given to the declarations of the governor general they knew not a word of those transactions until they were finally concluded  it was not until the january following that they saw the mass of falsehood which had been published under the title of mr hastings narrative they had been then unaccountably duped into the suffering a letter to pass dated the   th of november intended to deceive the directors into a belief that they had received intelligence at that time which was not the fact  these observations mr sheridan said were not meant to cast any obloquy on the council  they had undoubtedly been deceived and the deceit practiced on them by making them sign the narrative was of itself a strong accusation of mr hastings and a decided proof of his own consciousness of guilt when tired of corporal infliction his tyranny was gratified by insulting the understanding other tyrants though born to greatness such as a nero or caligula might have been roused it had been supposed by reflection and awakened into contrition  but here was an instance which spurned at theory and baffled supposition a man born to a state at least of equality inured to calculation and brought up in habits of reflection  and yet proving in the end that monster in nature a deliberate and reasoning tyrant  the board of directors received those advices which mr hastings thought proper to transmit but though unfurnished with any other materials to form their judgment they expressed very strongly their doubts and as properly ordered an enquiry into the circumstances of the alleged disaffection of of the begums pronouncing it at the same time a debt which was due to the honor and justice of the british nation  this enquiry however on the directions reaching india mr hastings thought it absolutely necessary to elude  he stated to the council that it being merely stated that if on enquiry certain facts appeared no enquiry was thereby directly enjoined  it would revive he said those animosities that subsisted between the begums and the vizier which had then subsided  if the former were inclined to appeal to a foreign jurisdiction they were the best judges of their own feeling and should be left to make their own complaint  all this however was nothing to the magnificent paragraph which concluded this minute and to which mr sheridan also requested the attention of the court  beside said mr hastings i hope it will not be a departure from official language to say  that the majesty of justice ought not to be approached without solicitation she ought not to descend to inflame or provoke but to withhod her judgment until she is called on to determine what was still more astonishing was that sir john macpherson who had before opposed mr hastings was caught by this bold bombastic quibble and rejoined in the same words that the majesty of justice ought not to be approached without solicitation  but my lords continued mr sheridan i rely on the judgment of your lordships for a very different opinion i hear you already call on me to turn from the illshaped pagod  from the monstrous idol which this bold man at your bar has thus set up and to which he has dared to give the appellation of justice  i hear you command me to turn from the debased caricature to contemplate the figure of justice where she sits in her more dignified form and her more august tribunal  here  to a justice commanding yet not rigorous efficient yet not sanguinary  to a justice active and regardful yet without without restlessness or suspicion  to a justice whose loveliest attribute appears in stooping to raise the oppressed and to bind up the wounds of the afflicted  to that justice i now make my confident appeal  in a cause the most important to the interests of humanity that has been ever brought to a decision  in a cause where though the injuries were widely extended the joyous and reverberant murmurs of redress would reach to a circle still more enlarged  i will not therefore adjure your lordships to dismiss every thing like party motives on this occasion as i well know that so perverse a bias cannot possibly intrude on your decision  but i will conjure you by the dignity of your several characters i will conjure you by the august solemnity of this high tribunal i will conjure by that sacred tie of houor to which you will appeal when laying your hands on your bosoms you give the important judgment  to weigh well the evidence which we have submitted to you let not quibbles on words do away the force of fact  let but the truth appear and our cause is gained  my lords  i have done  when mr sheridan had concluded the admiration of his auditors was too great for silent approbation it unanimously burst forth in a tumult of applause which the recollection of the scene as instantly suppressed  it was a tribute of feeling to genius such as form could not constrain no inferior consideration subdue  the court immediately rose and adjourned to the first tuesday in the next session of parliament  finis
