seduction a comedy  as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  by thomas holcroft  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternosterrow  m dcc lxxxvii  prologue spoken by mr barrymore among the tawny sons of indian lands the hero who aspires to lead their bands must proof afford ere he his cause can gain of resolution and contempt of pain ere they will confess him fit for them to die whips stings and fire his fortitude must try assembled chiefs the desperate contest view inflict the torture and the pang renew and should he while the flames his reins embrace heave one poor sigh or even breathe apace with scorn and ignominy he is expelled by boys and women in derision held but if to pain superior he comes forth equal to heroes of acknowledged worth applauding shouts reecho to the skies and all hearts claim him as his countrys prize severe the task  who would to fame aspire in lands like these where virtues tried by fire scarce less severe his task who pants for fame scorched by the ardour of poetic flame while fable diction pathos wit and taste like scorpion whips and racks are round him placed for while to conquer each defect he tries on the strong torture of the mind he lies rashly resolved to dare impending fate tonight comes forth a hardy candidate the critic lash the more than mortal stings when obloquy the poets bosom wrings when disappointment gnaws his bleeding heart and mad resentment hurls her venomed dart when angry noise disgust and uproar rude damnation urge and every hope exclude these dreadful though they are cannot quite repel the aspiring mind that bids the man excel though rules alone would yield a barren fame such praise as rules can merit he may claim each unitys preserved nor knows the play a lapse of time beyond the close of day no change of scene denotes a changed abode nor has he dared indulge one episode but rules of art no native tints bestow art never taught the beauteous rose to blow if nurtured not by dews and

not change and the stage is never vacant but at the end of an act the action is single  preface the immortal author of hudibras affirms the hardest task in the world is to write a play it is therefore no wonder that writers of plays are prone to regard their labors with fondness even to partiality or that they should perceive with regret the light esteem in which a part of the literary world have lately affected to hold them works of rudiment of disquisition nay even of mere compilation are often treated by criticism with a respect which a comedy or tragedy where wit invention genius and all the highest faculties of the mind have or ought to have been employed seldom meets the theater however it may be debased by the nightly intrusion of unhappy and improper persons has a most powerful and good influence on morals which increases with industry and as the means of gaining admission among the lower class increase much time is there spent to the best the noblest of purposes the bodys fatigues are forgotten the mind is beguiled of its cares the sad heart is made merry fictitious sorrow obliterates real and the soul imbibing virtuous and heroic principles is roused and impelled to actions that honor not only individuals but nations and give a dignity to human nature those who can doubt this are to be pitied and it is piteous most piteous that not only the learned but the political world should treat the stage with neglect nay with contempt that they do not combine and employ the high powers they possess to the encouragement and perfection of an art which being in its own nature so delightful so fascinating is capable of contributing so infinitely to the happiness as well as to the pleasure of mankind  these ideas have long and often occurred to my mind where they have acted with increasing force if i have written a comedy which perfectly moral in its tendency and counteracting a fashionable vice that is in danger of becoming a vulgar one has charms sufficient to attract spectators i am of opinion i have done my country an essential service that some who read this may call me vain or presumptuous is to me totally indifferent the theater is a subject of such consequence to virtue happiness and man that i cannot forbear speaking of it with a sense of feeling which i fear i cannot impart  i must now undertake a task of a very different and painful nature the cause of my undertaking it shall be given when i have told my story  in the summer of      i wrote the opera of the choleric fathers and the comedy of seduction they were both put into the hands of mr harris on certain conditions the substance of which was that if after reading he should approve the pieces they were both to be played during the ensuing season the first in november and the latter in january or the beginning of february      they were read by mr harris and both accepted on these conditions and so precise so perfectly explained were they that they were reduced to writing however certain objections arising on the part of mr harris concerning benefit nights not the time of performing the pieces for that remained determined i myself tore the written agreement saying i thought it improbable men who meant honestly and honorably should differ in trifles and that each others word was sufficient  when mr harris had read seduction though he objected to parts he was yet so well pleased with the whole that he said with evident and peculiar satisfaction i had given the theater a comedy which he thought would do it no harm  having made his objections alterations were agreed on and the comedy taken back further to prove how fully the word of mr harris was engaged how perfectly he understood himself pledged to abide by his agreement while the opera of the choleric fathers was preparing for representation mr harris sent to me to make a new proposal which according to him would highly benefit the theater this was that instead of january i should suffer the comedy to be brought out before christmas because he had a new pantomime omai that would in all probability be greatly beneficial to the theater after christmas and that his season would then be filled up and probably exceedingly productive that my interest might not suffer by this arrangement he promised in compensation to suffer the new pantomime to be played for my third benefit and if the comedy ran a certain number of nights for my fourth when he made this proposition i desired time to consider and consult my friends and at last from a sincere wish to oblige mr harris and serve the theater acquiesced this project however was deranged not by me or mr harris but by an event highly vexatious to both and which i shall not relate now perhaps never  in the mean time the play had received some alterations and the insertion of a character so atrocious yet so frequent in this town as to make in the opinion of mr harris the representation of it dangerous accordingly this was to be expunged still further alterations were undertaken and the comedy a third time delivered as it is at present played about the beginning of december      it will be necessary to remark that before this the choleric fathers had been performed and did not take that run which mr harris expected and i had hoped and that knowing the changeable disposition of mr harris i cautioned him against suffering this mediocrity of success to influence and prejudice his mind against the comedy he assured me it should not  i must likewise state that so selfdenying was i and desirous of promoting the welfare of the theater when mr harris informed me by mr lewis he had no further hopes from the opera which had then been played seven nights and that he would allow me the eighth instead of the ninth night but adding he doubted whether i should clear expenses i though there was no probability of loss and certainly some of gain gave up my third night to the theater telling mr lewis i would not deprive mr harris of a night under such circumstances  the comedy remained with mr harris who i was told was gone out of town till the beginning of january without my receiving any information of its being preparing for rehearsal i began to be alarmed and unable to obtain an interview or even discover where mr harris was i wrote a letter to him expressive of these alarms i need not describe what my feelings were a few days after on receiving the comedy back with a letter from mr harris in which these feelings were indeed little respected informing me it could not succeed the manner of sending it back was almost as extraordinary as the act it was brought loosely tied up with packthread in a bit of dirty brown paper unsealed by the servant of mr okeefe i mean not to insinuate any possible disadvantage to the character of mr okeefe far to the contrary i have often heard him honorably mentioned neither can i say how it came into his hands or that he knew what it was but this is no palliation of mr harriss conduct i returned no answer it would have been exceedingly wrong to have trusted the irritated mind at such a moment  i will now give my reasons for relating this transaction to the world to pretend i did not feel all the indignation which conduct like this must kindle would be to assume an apathy contrary to nature and even to virtue this however has worn off i act coolly at present and from a sense of duty not revenge as far as relates to myself i would wish the affair might never more be remembered but if men in similar situations might act thus always with impunity as they too often do what means could the weak and unprotected find of obtaining redress what security in their dealings with a man who regardless of probity and yielding to the caprice of opinion the dictates of pride or the narrow motives of selfinterest does not scruple to break his word so pledged and engagements thus formal  this narrative will scarcely be more disagreeable to mr harris to read than it has been to me to write it is not my own cause i plead for that was gained in the success of my comedy but the cause of the weak against the strong the cause of hereafter genius against hereafter injustice the cause of the man who endowed with gifts of which nature herself is proud but deprived of every benefit of fortune shall devote his days and nights to study and suffer every abstinence with resignation and even with delight cheered by the sweet hope of being some time known for what he is there is a momentary intoxication a delirium of soul in this hope which not the daily privation of pleasures the disappointments of years the labors of a life nor injustice itself can counterbalance it is this godlike sensation which has given the mind an impetus and made it produce works so various and so vast that glancing at their amplitude and sublimity it stands confounded at its own powers  that i may avoid all appearance of mingling flattery with an appeal to justice i shall forbear describing the conduct of the proprietors of drury lane except saying they have behaved to me like gentlemen and men of honor  my heart will not however suffer me to be equally reserved and silent concerning mr king the moment he was convinced the producing of this comedy would probably serve not injure the theater his zeal and activity in my cause were indefatigable how very essentially his powers as an actor have contributed to its success is too public for me had i a wish so selfish to conceal but this is not the first debt of gratitude from me to mr king his friendship or his philanthropy while i was struggling into notice and combating with adverse fortune did me a generous kindness which never can nor ever ought to be forgotten  the town have beheld with delight and surprise the increasing excellence of miss farren and thinking she had attained perfection have been astonished when they saw her next at their own mistake in the present instance her exertions and even the very manner of them have been as pleasing to me as they were beneficial to the comedy i can only add she has excelled herself and though that thought be old it never was more properly applied  having mentioned these it were injustice to the rest of the performers not to thank them both for the display of talents the merits of which are well known and the ardour i may say the anxiety they testified for my success yes i most sincerely thank them all and only forbear to name them individually because i cannot find expressions various and warm enough to convey my thoughts without making true and well deserved praise assume the form of labored panegyric  upper marylebone street march      seduction a comedy act i scene i a superb drawing room in the house of lord morden with several doorsleading to other apartments lapelle from lord mordens dressing room looking at his watch twenty minutes past ten  a shameful time of the morning for a gentlemans gentleman to be disturbed  my lord has lost his money cannot sleep himself and will not suffer others to take their natural rest  scene ii lapelle mrs pinup from lady mordens dressing room mrs pinup i declare upon my honor this is a most monstrous time of night for a ladys gentlewoman to be kept up dozing over a dull novel or nodding in an antichamber and an arm chair while others are taking their pleasure and losing their estates among their friends   lapelle good morrow mrs pinup   mrs pinup good morrow mr lapelle good night you mean  i have not been in bed yet   lapelle no   mrs pinup that vile bedside

lady who for my part i believe never sleeps at all   lapelle why yes your fashionable folks are a kind of ghosts that walk of nights and greatly trouble the repose of valets and ladys maids  and late hours like white paint are excellent promoters of cracked complexions   mrs pinup i declare upon my honor i am as tired as  as    lapelle a hackney coach horse on a rainy sunday   mrs pinup yes  and

reserved in her conduct fond of her husband contented with home and indeed a miraculous kind of exception among wives of quality whereas now she has suddenly turned fantastical in dress capricious in temper free of speech and what we halfbred folks should call light of carriage she games with the women coquettes with the men and seems in every respect ambitious to become  a woman of fashion as for my lord  why  he is a man of fashion   scene iv general burland lapelle genesis burland is your lady up mr lapelle   lapelle yes sir  i believe she has never been in bed   genesis burland who  what do

that i left her with as a pattern commanded her to observe to study to imitate in all things   scene vi general burland lapelle genesis burland well where is my daughter   lapelle i have called her

a gentleman   lapelle said he would call about one my lord   lord morden show him into my room and inform me the instant he comes   lapelle general burland is here   lord morden aside general burland zounds   lapelle came to town late last night my lord   lord morden tell him i am come down   scene xiii lord morden must not let him see the present temper of my mind  my guardian once he is determined never to think me of age  i need not his reproof to increase my present chagrin my own follies and lady mordens unexpected unaccountable reverse of conduct are sufficient  he will lay it all to me and perhaps with reason  heigho  here he comes  really one of these very prudent plainspoken friends is a very disagreeable person in these our moments of folly  well i must assume a cheerfulness i dont feel and ward off his wisdom with raillery  scene xiv lord morden general burland genesis burland good morrow my lord   lord morden general good morrow   genesis burland you seem scarcely awake   lord morden stretching slept ill  troubled with the nightmare   genesis burland your troubles i am afraid are rapidly increasing   lord morden how so general   genesis burland lady morden had a rout last night   lord morden oh and forgot to send you a card i suppose  is that my fault   genesis burland you are merry my lord but he who drinks poison out of a frolic will soon be glad to send for a physician out of fear and the chances are the doctor will come too late   lord morden trope and figure   genesis burland my lord my lord this levity is unseasonable blushes and shame would better become you   lord morden pff they are out of fashion   genesis burland yes you leave your friends to blush for your faults   lord morden my friends are very good nay indeed generous for were they but to spare a single blush for each of their own faults they would have none to bestow on mine   genesis burland fie the mirth of a madman is sport only to boys  i was your guardian i wished to prove myself your friend twas i first discovered that then angelic woman who is now lady morden i was the cause of her union with you and i am therefore accountable to myself to her and to society for her conduct   lord morden that is you are a kind of secondhand sponsor  godfatherinlaw as it were   genesis burland very well sir proceed despise reproof ridicule advice   lord morden nay good doctor you really wrong me it is not the advice but the physic i hate  at least i hate the form under which it is administered  but pray tell me when last you saw lady morden did you perceive any symptoms of that degeneracy in her ladyship you now complain so loudly of   genesis burland none i thought it impossible   lord morden and is it not rather extraordinary then that my example should so suddenly subdue what within this month seemed so invulnerable   genesis burland great surprise and energy it is extraordinary my lord most extraordinary but not less true and had you any sense of your duty to yourself your family or society the truth of it would make you tremble   lord morden see how differently different people understand things my acquaintance are every day wishing me joy of her ladyships reformation and telling me how surprisingly she has retrieved her character in the world   genesis burland sarcastically and sir frederic fashion no doubt among the rest   lord morden endeavouring to conceal his feelings hem  yes  yes he is one of our very first men you know and he is quite in raptures with her  swears she was born to lead and outshine us all   genesis burland with continued irony the approbation of so great an adept must give you vast pleasure   lord morden hem  a  infinite  not but this sudden change has rather surprised me   genesis burland how so   lord morden just as you left town her ladyships melancholy seemed increasing  wandering over the house like a perturbed spirit as the play says mournfully clanking her chains and frightening the gentle smiles and pleasures from her she seemed to waylay me and with moving look and melting eye entreat compassion till egad i really at last began to pity her   genesis burland you did   lord morden yes  but suddenly forsaking the  penseroso she broke in upon me one morning and with an air of levity and good humor and a small tincture of reproach then and there read me a very pretty wifelike remonstrance   genesis burland to which you listened with a truly picktooth insensibility   lord morden yes  you know my way   genesis burland and what was the subject of her discourse   lord morden why chapter the first was a recapitulation of my agreeable follies and her own perverse virtues  she was no partaker in my pleasures  i had forgot every endearment  she was left to dine sup and sleep by herself  i dined supped and slept nobody knew where  she more recluse than the abbess of a convent i more uncertain than the price of stocks or the place of prime minister   genesis burland with earnest concern and what did you say to this   lord morden aside i must face it out aloud say what could i say to such a simple woman   genesis burland you did not attempt to deny the charge then   lord morden what should i deny twas every syllable true and every syllable in my praise   genesis burland sighs humph  then you do not think the sweets of affection ought sometimes to alleviate the bitterness of neglect   lord morden sweets pshaw they are too cloying to the stomach and ought to be taken sparingly  i am fond of sweet music but too much of it sets me to sleep  besides a wife like a barrel organ can only play one set of tunes   genesis burland sighs well sir but the conclusion   lord morden a very unexpected one i assure you  i misunderstood this for a declaration of war and with a smile was very obligingly about to entreat her ladyship would hatch her melancholy into mischief her own way when turning short upon me she curtsied seemed abashed began to apologize applaud my conduct ridicule the silliness of her own and promised to become as fashionable a lady as i or any lord in christendom could wish   genesis burland your increase of happiness is then prodigious   lord morden hem  a  unspeakable  lady morden i own was certainly a kind of  demiangel though my wife  but then her  her goodness seemed to throw one at such a distance  so much in the back ground that there was only one figure noticed in the picture   genesis burland it is well sir you are so perfectly satisfied   lord morden nay general i will own i have often felt a kind of inclination a sort of wish as it were to become very prudent and wise and  and all that  but really one has so much to do that one does not know where to begin  besides you very good kind of people you  upon my honor you are in many respects the most queer precise particular species of beings and have such strange notions  instead of taking ones pleasure and doing just what one likes best which you know is so natural one must live for the good of ones country love ones wife and children pay tradesmen look over accounts reward merit and a thousand other of the  the most ridiculous whims  and what nobody absolutely nobody does   genesis burland intolerable profligacy  i have listened to you my lord with grief vexation astonishment and pity  your mind is degraded and the more dangerously so because you believe your worst vices to be your greatest merits you have had honor happiness and pleasure of the most perfect kind within your power and you have rejected them to clasp their shadows to merit pity by misconduct is humiliating but by misconduct to incur contempt is to a manly spirit insupportable and the latter will i fear be suddenly your lordships fate did not the remembrance of your noble father affect me i should look upon your approaching punishment with apathy because you wilfully have plunged to perdition but for your lady if i cannot retrieve if i cannot save her i shall mourn indeed   scene xv lord morden faith this good general is like a cuckoo always in a tune sighs he has reason  i have labored to laugh at my own follies but the farce is over the forced jest forgotten and the sorceress recollection conjures up the ugly phantom disgust  why what a child am i  oh lady morden  pshaw  absurd  i will not make myself the butt and byword of my acquaintance  i  i  i will laugh  ha ha ha  laugh at my ladys gallantries  i jealous  i  that have daily made jealousy a standing jest the criterion of an illbred vulgar mind  no no no sees lady morden and sir frederic fashion coming and is seized with a suspicious anxiety which he endeavors to conceal   scene xvi lord morden lady morden in an undress sir frederic fashion lady morden entering no no sir frederic you are partial   sir frederic not in the least madam   lady morden yes you are  good morrow to your lordship  yes you are  i feel i still retain a leaven of former silly prejudices but a little collision among you people of superior fashion will soon wear these asperities smooth and bring them to bear a proper polish   sir frederic ah madam you have a leaven of something celestial which we inferior people wonder at but cannot imitate   lord morden aside so   lady morden taps sir frederic with her fan fie flatterer  but you are always saying civil things and that i fancy makes you so agreeable   sir frederic serious and ardent no lady morden you wrong me  my tongue is forced to give utterance to the effusions of my heart  by heaven you are an angel and i am involuntarily obliged to repeat and repeat and repeat that you are an angel  you must not be angry with me for i cannot help it   lady morden no no  angry no  though i really believe i do improve  dont i my lord   lord morden certainly madam certainly   lady morden yes  i have discovered that one of my most capital errors formerly was being too sensible of my own defects  i find that to wear on ones countenance an open and avowed consciousness that one possesses every grace and perfection is the grand secret of really possessing them or at least of persuading the world one really does which is the same thing   sir frederic your ladyship is very right nothing can put a face of real fashion out of countenance the placid features are all fixed   lady morden oh immovable  like the owners names cut in brass and nailed to their doors   sir frederic ha ha ha charming   lady morden do but observe one of our wellbred beaus at a public assembly and you will see him enter plant himself in a spot elevate his eyebrows fix his eyes half open his mouth and stand like an automaton with its head turning on a pivot mimicks the manner   sir frederic ha ha ha charming charming   lord morden smiling but dont you think this a little tending to the ridiculous madam   lady morden oh dear no  nothing can be ridiculous that is fashionable   sir frederic oh no impossible   lady morden formerly i should have blushed if stared at but now i find the only way is to stare again  without looking  that is without betraying the least indication of knowing whether one is looking toward the man or the wall  thus   lord morden with forced pleasantry ha ha ha your ladyship is very right modesty  modesty is an obsolete bugbear   lady morden yes and like the  the ghost in the tragedy has been stared out of doors   sir frederic oh the very quakers despise it at present   lady morden yes  it is a shabby fellow whose acquaintance every body wishes to drop  to be sure i was a most absurd creature was not i my lord   lord morden i  upon my honor madam  i  you  no  no  not absurd  no   lady morden oh fie  not absurd  why do you know sir frederic  ha ha ha  i  ha ha ha i was downright in love with his lordship   sir frederic ha ha ha in love with his lordship   lady morden ha ha ha upon my honor it is true  is it not my lord   lord morden ha ha ha  ye  ye  yes  madam yes   lady morden thought him the most charming man in  in  in the whole world   sir frederic ha ha ha is that possible   lady morden why it  it is scarcely credible  but  but such is the fact  nay i doated on him  and continually reproached myself for wanting power and attractions to obtain my lords affection  for i never blamed him  ha ha ha  i  ha ha ha  i used to sit whole nights while my lord was out watching and weeping and whole days studying which way i could regain his love   sir frederic regain lady morden  why was his lordship ever so unfashionable as  as    lady morden as to love his wife  why yes really  i  i do believe he was so singular for  for a whole fortnight   sir frederic why ha ha ha why were you lord morden   lord morden forcing a laugh ha ha ha  i  i  with a little spleen i dont know sir what i was   lady morden nay dont be out of countenance my lord you hear i have the justice to relate my own foibles as well as your lordships  and mine  mine were infinitely the greatest  it is exceedingly strange but so  fascinated  was i that ha ha ha  i  ha ha ha suddenly becoming very serious  i am verily persuaded i could have died with pleasure to have insured his affection   lord morden ha ha ha  aside and turning away i cannot bear it   sir frederic ha ha ha these things are unaccountable   lady morden resuming her levity ay one wonders how one could be so weak  oh sir frederic i am going to christies there is a painting i have a mind to purchase they tell me it is very fine   sir frederic what is the story madam   lady morden the metamorphosis of actaeon   sir frederic ha ha ha a fashionable subject   lady morden yes  that  tha  that is the very reason i wish to have it  poor actaeon is taken at the precise moment when the  the change is taking place   sir frederic in his forehead   lady morden yes i am going down there now will you go with me sir frederic   sir frederic with pleasure madam  ha ha ha poor actaeon   lady morden ay poor actaeon  adieu my lord   scene xvii lord morden madam following stops short sdeath what am i about shall i at last sink into one of the vulgar and become jealous  wretched about a  oh no actaeon striking his forehead sure all men are idiots and never know the value of that most inestimable jewel a lovely and a loyal wife till in danger of having it purloined lord morden retires into his dressingroom   end of the first act act ii scene i lapelle coming from the door of the antichamber as if he had been listening so mr irishman by accident a lady in disguise that is the riddle is it  but hush  scene ii lord morden dressed harriet from the antichamber lord morden to lapelle leave the room  i am sorry we were disturbed your story madam has interested me deeply though too reprehensible for the irregularities of my own conduct i cannot but condemn the licentious libertinism of this sir frederic  indeed i  i have reason perhaps to dread it   harriet a man of honor among men the ruin of woman he thinks as necessary to his fame as to his pleasure and like too many others of your cruel sex holds it no crime to make war upon those who cannot defend themselves   lord morden but what do you propose by this disguise madam   harriet there is a contract which i indeed refused but which he forced upon me to demonstrate as he said the purity of his intentions wherein he bound himself in a penalty of ten thousand pounds to marry me within a month for in his fictitious raptures he protested no sum no proofs could sufficiently express the ardour and sanctity of his affection   lord morden and have you this contract   harriet oh no the day preceding that on which it was my good fortune to discover his real designs he asked to see and artfully exchanged it for a counterfeit copy   lord morden this contract you wish to regain   harriet if possible or some other unequivocal means of detection   lord morden and force him to marry you   harriet oh no  to own the truth i have a generous and a constant lover who perhaps has been a little ill used   lord morden as most generous and constant lovers are   harriet it is too true  to avenge him and humble the pride of one who thinks himself too cunning for our whole sex is my determination   lord morden well madam ours is a common cause  but as we have both been imprudent and invited misfortune we must both endeavor to conceal our true feelings mask our suspicions and  hush here he comes and with him a lady whose principles are as free as his own but who has had the art so well to conceal her intrigues and preserve appearances that she is every where received in society  i will introduce you in your assumed character   harriet not now let us withdraw  when he is alone the fewer eyes are on me the less liable i shall be to a discovery   lord morden and harriet return to the antichamber just as mrs modely and sir frederic appear scene iii mrs modely and sir frederic mrs modely really sir frederic there is no accounting for the strangeness of your present taste  i pity you  i foresee the downfall of your reputation  what you who have vanquished so many elegant coquettes and driven so many happy lovers mad you who were the very soul of our first societies and whose presence made palpitate the hearts of belles and beaux the first with hope and delight the latter with fear and envy you sighing at the feet of a prude and become the rival of a husband   sir frederic laughing deplorable   mrs modely have not you for this month past buried yourself in lady mordens sober society and dozed over crown whist with her night after night  nay have not you attended her even to church and there with a twang joined the amen chorus of charitychildren paupers and parishclerks sitting with your face drawn as long as its shadow at sunset and a look as demure and dismal    sir frederic as poor doctor faustus waiting for the devil to come and fetch him  ha ha ha  granted   mrs modely and what do you think has been said of you mean while in the polite circles you have abandoned  your very best friends have been the very first to condemn you   sir frederic that is natural  when we are guilty of any folly our very best friends are always the very first to condemn us to show they neither advise nor countenance us   mrs modely i thought the gay young beauty besieged by pleasures surrounded by flatteries who believes herself the goddess she is painted to fix her wandering fancy to humble and bring her to a sense of frailty or to supplant the happy the adored lover while yet the breath is warm that vows eternal constancy these i imagined were the only achievements worthy sir frederic fashion   sir frederic these have their eclat but to initiate a youthful beauteous wife who from her childhood has been accustomed to say her prayers believe in virtue and rank conjugal infidelity among the most heinous of the seven deadly sins to teach her to doubt fear wish tremble and venture to be a witness afterward of her repentance her tears involuntarily falling her eyes motionless her form fixed and the severe saint transformed to a statue of weeping sin to read her fall in the public papers be praised reproached admired and cursed in every family in england in short to be for ever immortalized in the annals of gallantry and the hero of the teatable for a whole month for this will be no common vulgar wonder this were glory equal to my ambition and this glory i am determined to acquire nay it is already within my grasp  this day or rather this night this very blessed ecstatic night shall i gain the greatest of all my victories   mrs modely insulting   sir frederic nay my dear mrs modely you know my enthusiasin and must not take exceptions  nor can i surely be blamed lady morden is a concealed hoard of native sweets that delights the senses while the madeup beauties we commonly meet like artificial flowers are all show and no fragrance   mrs modely raptures   sir frederic inferior to her in form and perfection as the venus of a dutch imagehawker to the genuine grecian antique   mrs modely it matters not wasting your rhetoric on this topic for i will not give my consent to your pursuing this affair any further sir frederic   sir frederic you will not   mrs modely i will not   sir frederic ha ha ha dont provoke me my dear mrs modely dont provoke me   mrs modely nay no threatening   sir frederic ha ha ha  well  to arms then  war is the word   mrs modely the choice remains with you   sir frederic ha ha ha   mrs modely lady morden is my relation and though i despise prudery and know the world    sir frederic aside that you do indeed   mrs modely yet  you can hardly suppose i will silently acquiesce in her ruin   sir frederic ha ha ha you  you forget yourself dear madam  these qualms would do vastly well in some places but to me    mrs modely and why not to you sir  though i do allow myself a little liberty of conscience    sir frederic not a little aside   mrs modely and though you  you  know i do must i  in short i have another favorite project which i am determined not to give up   sir frederic aside oh ho but it will be best to avoid a rupture  aloud may i ask what this favorite project may be   mrs modely you know the public affront general burland gave me last winter and you cannot suppose i have forgotten it   sir frederic aside no i know you better  aloud oh the general is an eccentric mortal licensed to say any thing and instead of being listened to is laughed at   mrs modely yes but i am determined he shall be punished   sir frederic which way   mrs modely his daughter emily is a pretty simple girl  i mean untutored in the world   sir frederic conceiving her design true   mrs modely to see her married to a man of fashion would at least break his heart   sir frederic laughs infallibly   mrs modely your fortune i believe sir frederic like your family seat begins to want repairs and she is a rich heiress with twenty thousand pounds at her own disposal beside the generals estate which must be hers  why do you laugh so   sir frederic oh the delights of anticipation   mrs modely an  an  anticipation   sir frederic still laughing it is a part of my plan to carry her off i mean to let her carry me off this very night   mrs modely who emily   sir frederic emily   mrs modely to night   sir frederic this active this important this blissful night   mrs modely lend me your eau de luce you divle   sir frederic ha ha ha  this surprise from you mrs modely is the supreme of panegyric   mrs modely and have you made any advances to emily   sir frederic yes yes  ha ha ha  i made advances to her and she made advances to me  the conquest was too easy  were it not for the circumstance of the elopement which will give the sauce a flavor the food wants it would scarcely invite my appetite   mrs modely but lady morden    sir frederic is mine whenever i please to make my final attack i am no bad orator in general but in company with her i seem inspired  am absolutely astonished at my own eloquence  nay i have several times spoken with such energy enthusiasm and momentary conviction in praise of virtue that i have actually been in imminent danger of making a convert of myself   mrs modely in praise of virtue   sir frederic in praise of virtue there is no making one of these virtuous visionaries rational but by flattering their bigotry and pretending to adore their idol by pursuing which method i have inured her to and made her as familiar with what is prudishly called vice and vicious sentiments as she is with her own thoughts   mrs modely yes yes vile rake but remember i will have no concern in this affair  i    sir frederic oh poh ay ay that is understood  you wink  and know nothing of the matter   mrs modely nay but i here publicly protest against your proceedings   sir frederic aside and will privately do your utmost to promote them   mrs modely i exclaim against such licentiousness   sir frederic i know you do  but if you are thus tender of her ladyships reputation you will feel no repugnance at assisting me to irritate hi lordships sensibility   mrs modely what do you mean   sir frederic to confess the truth i am a little piqued at lord mordens want of feeling  i wish i could make him jealous   mrs modely jealous fie he is too well bred   sir frederic that is unfortunate  the antics of a jealous husband add highly to the enjoyment as well as the reputation of an amor  the poor man is so injured so enraged so distressed so industrious to publish his calamity and is so sincerely pitied and laughed at  must positively rouse my lord to a sense of his misfortune or it will want poignancy  a turtle feast without french wines   mrs modely well should i find any opportunity of aiding you    sir frederic ay ay i have no doubt of your zeal in the cause   mrs modely nay but dont mistake me  i only mean as far as teazing his lordship is concerned   sir frederic oh certainly  certainly   mrs modely if his lordship had any real cause for jealousy i should for lady mordens ache be the  the  the  the  the most miserable creature upon earth   sir frederic to be sure   mrs modely but you seem mighty secure of your conquest   sir frederic i am no novice i can tell when a womans time is come  besides her ladyship has granted me a rendezvous   mrs modely when   sir frederic why this very evening to be sure   mrs modely where   sir frederic here in this very house   mrs modely since you are so very certain how came you not to take advantage of being alone with her after the rout   sir frederic i did that is should have done

sarvant gis heed to that there sort ostuff  as not likely to get rich   mrs modely upon my word   sir frederic so mr wilmots head is full of such nonsense is it   gabriel oh as brimful of such nonsense  and so were i while i lived wi he which wur the reason as i do suppose that they called me a simpleton  but i am not so simple as folk think me   sir frederic aside to mrs modely my dear mrs modely leave me for a moment with this fellow  you will be upon the watch to throw in any hints or aids you happen to see necessary and apropos   mrs modely yes yes  that is for emily and the

to her ladyship with your respects and as many compliments as you please   emily nay but dear sir consider  it will seem too abrupt lady morden is so good so kind  i would not give her a moments pain for the world  besides i have so many obligations to her ladyship   genesis burland i begin to be afraid child left you should have too many obligations to her ladyship   emily let me only stay tonight and tomorrow morning i will go with all my heart and as early as you please if you desire me   sir frederic aside i protest she is bantering him  oh the charming malicious little angel aloud  ay general let emily stay tonight i will answer for her she will go tomorrow morning as soon as you please if you desire her   genesis burland you will answer for her    sir frederic yes  will not you permit me emily   emily curtsies my dear papa knows i never attempt to break my word   genesis burland yes my child i do know you have hitherto been unspotted and pure as the morn blown lily and my anxiety that you should remain so makes me thus desirous of your quitting this house  when i brought you here these doors did not so easily fly open at the approach of such fine such accomplished gentlemen as sir frederic fashion   sir frederic with vast pleasure by heavens he anticipates his misfortunes aside   emily takes the generals hand do my dear papa consent only for today i dont ask any longer   sir frederic aside i could hug the charming hypocrite   genesis burland well well emmy you know i never deny you any thing for indeed you never yet asked any thing that could give the

than i hoped  yes general  you  you are a very good papa   genesis burland you think so   sir frederic yes  i do upon my soul   genesis burland then i am what you i am afraid will never be   scene viii sir frederic ha ha ha he does not suspect we are so soon to be so nearly related  ha ha ha i should like to be present when he first hears the news  he  he will foam and bounce like a cork from a bottle of champaigne  scene ix sir frederic lord morden from the antichamber lord morden well sir frederic is her ladyship returned   sir frederic yes she is dressing for dinner  she bought the actaeon   lord morden she did   sir frederic oh yes  she is a charming woman  the eyes of the whole room were upon her there were some smart things said  one observed a likeness between me and actaeon another thought it bore a far greater resemblance to your lordship   lord morden ha ha ha about the head no doubt   sir frederic for my part i said i thought the likeness was very capable of being improved   lord morden you were very kind   sir frederic oh pray have you heard that sir peter pry is going to sue for a bill of divorce   lord morden no   sir frederic it is very true i should not have suspected sir peter of such vulgar revenge but i find our married men of fashion are far less liberal in their sentiments than the ladies   lord morden ha ha ha yes they often want a womans philosophy in these matters   sir frederic yes  they are wasps that fly and feed wherever they can find honey but retain a sting for any marauder that shall approach their nests   lord morden somewhat selfish i own   sir frederic much more liable to be jealous than the women  and jealousy your lordship knows is the most ridiculous illbred contemptible thing in nature   lord morden ha ha ha yes yes  ha ha ha perfectly despicable   sir frederic oh nothing so laughable as the vagaries of a jealous husband no creature suffers so much or is pitied so little   lord morden ha ha ha ay  the thefts of love are applauded not punished   sir frederic yes and the poor robbed husband watchman like twirls his rattle alarms the neighborhood and collects assistants who never fail to aid the thief and laugh at him and his loss   lord morden ye  ye  yes ha ha ha  a husband is a very strange ignominious animal   sir frederic a jealous husband   lord morden a paltry mechanical    sir frederic without an idea of life or manners   lord morden ha ha ha very true  but come with me there is a young gentleman in the antichamber of a good family who wishes to be introduced to you  a very pretty fellow  has an ambition to do something which shall give him eclat and is therefore desirous of being known to us men of the world   sir frederic well i am yours for a few minutes but i must attend lady morden at her toilette presently   end of the second act act iii scene i general burland lord morden meeting gabriel introduces general burland genesis burl well my lord is lady morden to be seen   gabriel oh ees your worship hur will be anon for yonder is sir frederic helping the maid to dress her ladyship   genesis burland helping to dress her ladyship   gabriel ees  they sent me for some milk of roses here  shewing the phial and would you believe it i wur sich an oaf i had never heard before that roses gave milk   genesis burland ah  you are some halftaught country booby   gabriel why so i do find for in the country the folk do only clearstarch their aprons and ruffles but here ecod they clearstarch their faces   genesis burland well go carry in your milk and inform her ladyship i am waiting her leisure  laughing within   gabriel ecod here they all come your honor and rare and merry they be but you londoneers do lead a rare ranting life   scene ii general burland lord morden sir frederic lady morden mrs modely the three last from lady mordens dressing room laughing lady morden ha ha ha  oh you whimsical toad you  ha ha ha  you have halfkilled me  i am glad to see you in town general  we have been drawing the characters of our acquaintance and mrs modely and sir frederic fashion have been so droll and so satirical   genesis burland ah no doubt   lady morden i could not have thought there was so much satisfaction in remembering the failings of ones friends   mrs modely oh it makes one so cheerful   sir frederic and keeps one so charmingly in countenance   genesis burland aside which you stand in very great need of   sir frederic i assure your ladyship you have an exquisite turn for satire you cut with excessive keenness and yet with a dexterity that makes the very patient tingle with pleasure   lady morden you are partial a little more experience will make these things quite familiar but habit only can give one perfect ease   sir frederic oh habit  habit is a wonderful thing  have you heard the anecdote of the newmarketjockey   lady morden no what is it   sir frederic why a jockey having had a bad run at the last october meeting was willing to correct the errors of fortune by turning his lead to gold accordingly on epping forest he stopped major warboys and bade him deliver to which the major being one of those singular officers who think it some disgrace to be robbed replied by firing his pistol  the ball happened to be fatal  the horse set off  and to show the effect of habit the body of the jockey kept its seat as far as the stable door and there deliberately tumbled off nay some go so far as to assert it was seen to rise in the stirrups but that i believe wants confirmation   lord morden ha ha ha   mrs modely ha ha ha   lady morden pshaw you tragicomic wretch   lord morden i think you had not much company last night   lady morden your lordship was so well bred and made your visit so short else you would have found a great deal   mrs modely oh yes they poured in from all quarters   sir frederic sir nathan neaptide the yellow admiral came   lord morden an agreeable guest   mrs modely oh rude as his own boatswain   sir frederic would teach a starling blasphemy rather than want good conversation    lady morden he attempts satire   lord morden but utters abuse   mrs modely that makes him so much respected   lady morden yes like a chimneysweeper in a crowd he makes his way by being dirty   sir frederic i protest your ladyship is prodigiously brilliant today   lady morden no no  though i am a vast admirer of wit a person of wit has one very peculiar and enviable advantage   lord morden what is that madam   lady morden long life   lord morden long life   lady morden yes a wit has more ideas consequently lives longer in one hour than a fool in seven years   sir frederic for which reason your ladyship is already three times the age of old par   lady morden dear sir frederic that is so gallant   mrs modely and so new   genesis burland why yes  this is the first time i ever heard a lady told she was old and receive it as a compliment   lord morden but your visitors  who had you next   mrs modely there was sir jeremy stilllife   lady morden mimics and his bouquet he primmed himself up in one corner and seemed to think that like the image of a saint on a holyday he was powdered and painted on purpose to be adored   mrs modely he was not singular in that   lady morden oh no there was a whole row of them that like jars and mandarins on a mantlepiece looked vastly ornamental and served charmingly to fill up vacancies   genesis burland every trifle has its use   mrs modely lord index came and stalked round the rooms as if he had been loaded with the wisdom of his whole library   lady morden yes he looked as solemn as a monkey after mischief   sir frederic mimicking his solemnity and drew up his face in form like a writ of inquiry into damages with a takenotice engrossed in front   lord morden he would not stay late for his lordship is as careful of his health as he is vain of his understanding   lady morden and yet he is but a kind of rushcandle he may glimmer a long while but will never give much light   lord morden it seems strange that your people who have acquired a little knowledge always think they possess an infinite deal while those who are the best informed appear continually conscious of wanting more   genesis burland not strange at all my lord amassing knowledge is like viewing the sun through a telescope you enlarge the object but you destroy the glare   mrs modely did not you observe that notwithstanding the pearlpowder my lady blooms neck looked remarkably sallow   lord morden oh as a jews face under a green umbrella   sir frederic the widow twinkle as usual talked a vast deal about reputation   lady morden one is apt to admire a thing one wants   lord morden she always takes infinite pains to place her reputation like broken china in a buffet with the best side outward   lady morden she may plaster and cement but will never bring it to bear handling   mrs modely mr pensive the poet came in too   sir frederic yes but as nobody took any notice of him he presently went out again   genesis burland a great proof of his good sense   sir frederic your poets and sheriffsofficers are a kind of people every body has heard of but that nobody chooses to know   lady morden or if you are under the necessity of receiving a private call from them now and then it would be quite disgraceful to be seen with them in public   lord morden your ladyship used to be very partial to mr pensive   genesis burland yes her ladyship used to have many singular partialities she was once partial to merit and virtue wherever she found them she had a partiality for order economy and domestic duties likewise nay she even went so far as to cherish a partiality for your lordship   lady morden ha ha ha odious partialities   sir frederic ha ha ha   mrs modely   lord morden ma  ma  madam  odious   lady morden ha ha ha to  to be sure sir  is it not odious to be unfashionable   mrs modely certainly  ha ha ha ha   sir frederic ha ha ha  i protest general you  ha ha ha you are too severe   genesis burland am i   all together sir frederic ha ha ha you are really   mrs modely ha ha ha yes you are indeed general   lady morden ha ha ha yes yes you absolutely are   genesis burland humph  why dont you laugh my lord   lord morden i do ha ha ha  i  i  i do general  though as to severity i own i  i dont see it in that light   genesis burland no   lord morden no  i cannot accuse myself of any fault unless the love of pleasure be one   genesis burland hah sighs and your catalogue of pleasures i fancy is pretty extensive   lord morden not half so extensive as one could wish   genesis burland a dicebox for instance is one   lord morden a very principal one   lady morden my short experience hardly entitles me to venture an opinion but i find a wonderful similarity between gaming and a cold bath  you have a  a tremor  a  a hesitation at first but having once plunged in you are thrown into the most delightful glow   lord morden oh an ardent tingling    genesis burland beware sir that a shivering fit does not succeed   mrs modely ha ha ha   lady morden   sir frederic ha ha ha  you really have no mercy general  you hit so often and so hard egad   lord morden i am vastly  happy  to see you all so merry  though  upon my honor  i cannot find out the jest   genesis burland that is strange when you yourself make it   lady morden not in the least  there is many a professed joker who does not understand his own wit   genesis burland half aside i am tired disgusted with this mixture of folly and wickedness  aloud may i intrude so far upon your ladyship as to obtain half an hours private conversation   lady morden why  upon my word  general  i  i have so many affairs on hand to day that i must beg you  to excuse me  tomorrow you may command me for as long as you please   sir frederic ay do general have the complaisance to wait till tomorrow when my lady will be more at leisure   genesis burland deeply affected well madam i did not use to be thought an intruder by your ladyship and will not begin now  but since i cannot have the honor to tell you privately i still think myself bound to do my duty and inform you publicly you are in the hands of sharpers who will filch from you your good name  with great anxiety nay perhaps you are on the very eve of destruction  oh guile  can it be  my heart is full  i  goes up to her and most affectionately takes and presses her hand lady morden  i have no utterance  but if there be such a thing as sympathy some small portion of the horror i now feel will communicate itself to you   scene iii lord morden sir frederic lady morden mrs modely lady morden seems affected lord morden deeply so sir frederic and mrs modely disconcerted a pause lady morden endeavouring to recover herself the  the general  has the  strangest way of  affecting  and  harrowing  has not he my lord   lord morden ye  yes  upon my honor he  he  i dont know how  putting his hand to his heart   sir frederic ha ha ha  the general  the general is a true don quixote he first creates giants and then kills them   lady morden yes ha ha ha  his head is full of  of windmills to grind moral sentiments  but come mrs modely you have not seen my new purchase   mrs modely oh what the actaeon   sir frederic is it come home   lady morden oh yes  i could not rest till i had it talking as they are going off   mrs modely come my lord  i long to see it   lady morden the tints are charming   mrs modely so i hear  the grouping excellent   lady morden oh delightful   scene iv harriet from the antichamber sir frederic harriet hist  sir frederic   sir frederic turning back oh  well sir how proceeds your amor i thought you had been busied in schemes about that affair   harriet faidth and i am so  but i dont believe i can succeed without your assistance   sir frederic perhaps you are a little scrupulous about the means   harriet me  indeed and you have mistaken your man  why you dont think sir frederic i regard the complaints or tears of women  you and i sure seek our own gratification not their happiness  for if the love of man sought only the happiness of woman faidth there would be nothing but dull marriages fond husbands and legitimate children and we should lose all the satisfaction of seducing wives ruining daughters and of bringing so many fine sweet innocent craters upon the town   sir frederic oh it would strangely reverse the order of things   harriet order  faidth and it would occasion a blissed confusion  in doctors commons   sir frederic for my part present pleasure is my pursuit i never disturb my imagination with dismal conjectures on future consequences   harriet faidth and you are right  for as you say it would be dismal enough to trace these consequences into  into streets and hospitals and  places that the imagination sickens at   sir frederic marriage you say is not your object   harriet oh no i dont like that said matrimony music   sir frederic a mortgaged rentroll only can make it supportable a wife is like a childs whistle which every breath can play upon but which no art can make melodious   harriet faidth and you have viry proper notions about wives so whin the dare crater gave a marriage hint why i told her a dale of boister consarning an old cross fadther and being under age and that i could not marry these three months for you know one does not stand for a good double handful of oaths and lies whin one wants to ruin a sweet kind angel that one loves   sir frederic ha ha ha  suppose you were to make a sham marriage   harriet a sham marriage  faidth and i would make that if there were not a parcel of low rascals that make halters   sir frederic pshaw that is a paltry mechanical fear   harriet but you  you were telling me you know of  a  scheme    sir frederic oh the contract   harriet ay faidth the contract you said you would show it me   sir frederic i will  i have brought it for that purpose feeling for his pocketbook i lately found it an

scene oh madam how can i repay this bounty  this condescension  never  my life were a poor sacrifice to such sweetness and such charms   lady morden sir frederic this is a trying a decisive moment i am going to be either the most happy or the most wretched of women you tell me it is your wish your resolution to be no longer that general lover that man of the world you have hitherto been thought   sir frederic say not dear lady it is either my wish or resolution heaven can testify i have not the power to be any thing but what it shall please you to make me   lady morden i have owned to you that the levity i have lately affected is not natural to me that my heart sighs for an acquaintance a mate that like itself is subject to all the sweet emotions of sensibility  yes it was the first wish of my soul to find this correspondent heart a heart beating with the same ardour vibrating to the same sensations panting for the same pleasures shrinking from the same pangs pliant yet firm gentle yet aspiring passionate yet pure  such i once thought lord mordens  should i a second time be deceived   sir frederic i am poor in proofs of sincerity i have none to offer  my former errors are present punishments to deny or even palliate them would imply intentional deceit and this is a moment in which i would wish for men and gods to be witnesses of my truth  i have had i own most libertine opinions of your gentle sex but these i now solemnly renounce  had i before met with a lady morden i should before have made this renunciation  but perhaps the women it has been my misfortune to know
