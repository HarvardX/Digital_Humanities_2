retaliation a poem by doctor goldsmith including epitaphs on the most distinguished wits of this metropolis    london printed for g kearsly at no    in fleet street mdcclxxiv  to mr kearsly bookseller in fleet street sir i am unable to account for the mystery with which the poem i send you has been handed about   in some part of doctor goldsmiths works he confesses himself so unable to resist the hungry attacks of wretched compilers that he contents himself with the demand of the fat man who when at sea and the crew in great want of provisions was pitched on by the sailors as the properest subject to supply their wants he found the necessity of acquiescence at the same time making the most reasonable demand of the first cut off himself for himself when the doctor in his lifetime was forced by these anthropophagi to such capitulations what respect can we now expect from them will they not dine on his memory to rescue him from this insult i send you an authentic copy of the last poetic production of this great and good man of which i recommend an early publication to prevent spurious editions being ushered into the world  dr goldsmith belonged to a club of beaux esprits where wit sparkled sometimes at the expense of goodnature  it was proposed to write epitaphs on the doctor his country dialect and person furnished subjects of witticism  the doctor was called on for retaliation and at their next meeting produced the following poem which i think adds one leaf to his immortal wreath  retaliation a poem of old when scarron his companions invited each guest brought his dish and the feast was united if our landlord supplies us with beef and with fish let each guest bring himself and he brings the best dish our dean shall be venison just fresh from the plains our burke shall be tongue with a garnish of brains our will shall be wild fowl of excellent flavor and dick with his pepper shall heighten their savor our cumberlands sweetbread its place shall obtain and douglasss pudding substantial and plain our garricks a sallad for in him we see oil vinegar sugar and saltness agree to make out the dinner full certain i am that ridge is anchovy and reynolds is lamb that hickeys a capon and by the same rule magnanimous goldsmith a goosberry fool at a dinner so various at such a repast whod not be a glutton and stick to the last here waiter more wine let me sit while i am able till all my companions sink under the table then with chaos and blunders encircling my head let me ponder and tell what i think of the dead here lies the good dean reunited to earth who mixed reason with pleasure and wisdom with mirth if he had any faults he has left us in doubt at least in six weeks i could not find em out yet some have declared and it cannot be denied em that slyboots was cursedly cunning to hide em here lies our good edmund whose genius was such we scarcely can praise it or blame it too much who born for the universe narrowd his mind and to party gave up what was meant for mankind though fraught with all learning kept straining his throat to persuade tommy townsend to lend him a vote who too deep for his hearers still went on refining and thought of convincing while they thought of dining though equal to all things for all things he is fit too nice for a statesman too proud for a wit for a patriot too cool for a drudge disobedient and too fond of the right to pursue the expedient in short twas his fate unemployd or in play sir to eat mutton cold and cut blocks with a razor here lies honest william whose heart was a mint while the owner never knew half the good that was in it the pupil of impulse it forced him along his conduct still right with his argument wrong still aiming at honor yet fearing to roam the coachman was tipsy the chariot drove home would you ask for his merits alas he had none what was good was spontaneous his faults were his own here lies honest richard whose fate i must sigh at alas that such frolic should now be so quiet what spirits were his what wit and what whim now breaking a jest and now breaking a limb now rangling and grumbling to keep up the ball now teazing and vexing yet laughing at all in short so provoking a devil was dick that we wished him full ten times a day at old nick but missing his mirth and agreeable vein as often we wished to have dick back again here cumberland lies having acted his parts the terence of england the mender of hearts a flattering painter who made it his care to draw men as they ought to be not as they are his gallants are all faultless his women divine and comedy wonders at being so fine like a tragedy queen he has dizend her out or rather like tragedy giving a rout his fools have their follies so left in a crowd of virtues and feelings that folly grows proud and coxcombs alike in their failings alone adopting his portraits are pleased with their own say where has our poet this malady caught or wherefore his characters thus without fault say was it that vainly directing his view to find out mens virtues and finding them few quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf he grew lazy at last and drew from himself here douglas retires from his toils to relax the scourge of impostors the terror of quacks come all ye quack bards and ye quacking divines come and dance on the spot where your tyrant reclines where satire and censure encircld his throne i feared for your safety i feared for my own but now he is gone and we want a detector our dodds shall be pious our kenricks shall lecture macpherson write bombast and call it a style our townshend make speeches and i shall compile new laders and bowers the tweed shall cross over no countryman living their tricks to discover detection her taper shall quench to a spark and scotchman meet scotchman and cheat in the dark here lies david garrick describe me who can an abridgment of all that was pleasant in man as an actor confessed without rival to shine as a wit if not first in the very first line yet with talents like these and an excellent heart the man had his failings a dupe to his art like an ill judge in beauty his colors he spread and beplaisterd with rouge his own natural red on the stage he was natural simple affecting twas only that when he was off he was acting with no reason on earth to go out of his way he turned and he varied full ten times a day though secure of our hearts yet confoundedly sick if they were not his own by finessing and trick he cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack for he knew when he pleased he could whistle them back of praise a mere glutton he swallowed what came and the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame till his relish grown callous almost to disease who peppered the highest was surest to please but let us be candid and speak out our mind if dunces applauded he paid them in kind ye kenricks ye kellys and woodfalls so grave what a commerce was yours while you got and you gave how did grubstreet reecho the shouts that you raised while he was berossiad and you were bepraisd but peace to his spirit wherever it flies to act as an angel and mix with the skies those poets who owe their best fame to his skill shall still be his flatterers go where he will old shakespeare receive him with praise and with love and beaumonts and bens be his kellys above here hickey reclines a most blunt pleasant creature and slander itself must allow him goodnature he cherished his friend and he relished a bumper yet one fault he had and that one was a thumper perhaps you may ask if that man was a miser i answer no no for he always was wiser too courteous perhaps or obligingly flat his very worst foe cannot accuse him of that perhaps he confided in men as they go and so was too foolishly honest ah no then what was failing come tell it and burn ye he was could he help it a special attorney here reynolds is laid and to tell you my mind he has not left a better or wiser behind his pencil was striking resistless and grand his manners were gentle complying and bland still born to improve us in every part his pencil our faces his manners our heart to coxcombs averse yet most civilly staring when they judged without skill he was still hard of hearing when they talked of their raphaels corregios and stuff he shifted his trumpet and only took snuff                                         the end explanatory notes and observations on doctor goldsmiths poem entitled retaliation if our landlord supplies us with beef and with fish page   line   the master of the st jamess coffeehouse where the doctor and the friends he has characterised in this poem held an occasional club  that ridge is anchovy page   line  0 counselor john ridge a gentleman belonging to the irish bar the relish of whose agreeable and pointed conversation is admitted by all his acquaintance to be very properly compared to the above sauce  here lies the good dean page   line   dr bernard dean of derry in ireland author of many ingenious pieces particularly a reply to macphersons antiquities of great britain and ireland  here lies our good edmund page   line    mr edmund burke  to persuade tommy townshend to lend him a vote page   line   mr t townshend junior member for whitchurch hampshire  here lies honest william page   line    mr william burke late secretary to general conway and member for bedwin wiltshire  here lies honest richard page   line   mr richard burke collector of granada no less remarkable in the walks of wit and humor than his brother mr edmund burke is justly distinguished in all the branches of useful and polite literature  now breaking a jest and now breaking a limb page   line   the above gentleman having slightly fractured one of his arms and legs at different times the doctor has rallied him on those accidents as a kind of retributive justice for breaking his jests upon other people  here cumberland lies page  0 line   doctor richard cumberland author of the west indian fashionable lover the brothers and other dramatic pieces  here douglas retires from his toils to relax the scourge of impostors the terror of quacks  page    lines   and   doctor douglas an ingenious scotch gentleman who has no less distinguished himself as a citizen of the world than a sound critic in detecting several literary mistakes or rather forgeries of his countrymen particularly lauder on milton

antiquity  here lies david garrick page    line   david garrick esquire joint patentee and acting manager of the theater royal drury lane for the other parts of his character vide the poem  here hickey reclines page    line   a gentleman whose hospitality and good humor have acquired him in this club the title of honest tom hickey his profession the doctor tells us is that of an attorney but whether he meant the words an echo to the sense or not he has told us so in perhaps the only indifferent couplet of the whole poem to soften this censure however in some respect the english reader is to be told that the phrase of burn ye in the  th line of the   th page though it may seem forced to rhyme to attorney is a familiar method of salutation in ireland amongst the lower classes of the people  he shifted his trumpet and only took snuff page the last line the last sir joshua reynolds on whom this observation was made is so remarkably deaf as to be under the necessity of using an ear trumpet mostly in company he is at the same time equally remarkable for using a great quantity of snuff his manner in both of which taken in the point of time described must be allowed by those who have been witnesses of such a scene to be as happily given upon paper as that great artist himself perhaps could exhibit upon canvass  errors a few copies only have been printed with the following errors which the reader is requested to correct  page   line   for he is fit read unfit  line   for or in play read or in place  page  0 line    for when read where  page    line   for landers read lauders  page    line   for berossiad read berosciad  page    line   for what was failing read what was his failing
