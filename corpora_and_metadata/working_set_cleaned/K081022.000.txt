made a sacrifice to your ambition oh it smells foul indeed of rankest malice and the vile statesmans craft  you dare not sure thus bid defiance to each show of worth each claim of honor dare not injure thus your suffering country in her bravest son  burleigh ut why should stern reproach her angry brow et fall on me am i alone the cause that gives this working humor strength do i struct the public voice to warp his actions justice untaught shall poize the impartial scales and every curious eye may mark the beam  southampton the specious shield which private malice bears is ever blazoned with some public good behind that artful fence sculk low concealed the bloody purpose and the poisoned shaft ambition there and envy nestle close from thence they take their fatal aim unseen and honest merit is the destined mark  burleigh your warm distempered zeal puts rashly by the cool directing hand of wholesome reason no imputation oul shall rest on me my honest purposes defy aloud the slanderspreading tongue of busy faction to cast its venom on my fair report or tell posterity thus cecil did my countrys welfare and my queens comma have ever been my guiding stars through life my sure direction still  to these i now appeal  from these no doubt this lords miscond has widely strayed and reason not reviling must now befriend his cause  southampton how ill had providence disposed the suffering worlds oppressed affairs had sacred rights eternal rule been left to crafty politicians partial sway then power and pride would stretch the enormous  and call their arbitrary portion justice ambitions arm by avarice urged would pluck the core of honesty from virtues heart and plant deceit and rancour in its stead falsehood would trample then on truth and hono and envy poison sweet benevolence oh it is a goodly groupe of attributes and well befits some statesmens righteous rule out out upon such base and bloody doings the term of being is not worth the sin no human bosom can endure its dart then put this cruel purpose from thee far nor let the blood of essex whelm thy soul  burleigh it is well my lord your words no comment need no doubt they have well explained your

charge and vindicate their loyalty and mine  queen ha tell not me your smooth deceitful story i know your projects and your close cabals you would turn my favor into party feuds and use my scepter as
