windsorforest  to the right honorable george lord lansdown  by mr pope  non injussa cano te nostrae vare myricae te nemus omne canet nec phaebo gratior ulla est quam sibi quae vari praescripsit pagina nomen virg london printed for bernard lintott at the crosskeys in fleet street       windsorforest to the right honorable george lord lansdown thy forests windsor and thy green retreats at once the monarchs and the muses seats invite my lays be present sylvan maids unlock your springs and open all your shades granville commands your aid o muses bring what muse for granville can refuse to sing the groves of eden vanished now so long live in description and look green in song these were my breast inspired with equal flame like them in beauty should be like in fame here hills and vales the woodland and the plain here earth and water seem to strive again not chaoslike together crushed and bruised but as the world harmoniously confused where order in variety we see and where though all things differ all agree here waving groves a checkered scene display and part admit and part exclude the day as some coy nymph her lovers warm address nor quite indulges nor can quite repress there interspersed in lawns and opening glades thin trees arise that shun each others shades here in full light the russet plains extend there wrapped in clouds the blueish hills ascend even the wild heath displays her purple dies and midst the desert fruitful fields arise that crowned with tufted trees and springing corn like verdant isles the sable waste adorn let india boast her plants nor envy we the weeping amber or the balmy tree while by our oaks the precious loads are born and realms commanded which those trees adorn not proud olympus yields a nobler sight though gods assembled grace his towering height than what more humble mountains offer here where in their blessings all those gods appear see pan with flocks with fruits pomona crowned here blushing flora paints the enameled ground here ceres gifts in waving prospect stand and nodding tempt the joyful reapers hand rich industry sits smiling on the plains and peace and plenty tell a stuart reigns not thus the land appeared in ages past a dreary desert and a gloomy waste to savage beasts and the forest laws savage laws a prey and kings more furious and severe than they who claimed the skies dispeopled air and floods the lonely lords of empty wilds and woods cities laid waste they stormed the dens and caves for wiser brutes were backward to be slaves what could be free when lawless beasts obeyed and even the elements a tyrant swayed in vain kind seasons swelled the teeming grain soft showers distilled and suns grew warm in vain the swain with tears to beasts his labor yields and famished dies amidst his ripened fields no wonder savages or subjects slain were equal crimes in a despotick reign both doomed alike for sportive tyrants bled but subjects starved while savages were fed proud nimrod first the bloody chase began a mighty hunter and his prey was man our haughty norman boasts that barbarous name and makes his trembling slaves the royal game the alluding to the new forest and the tyrannies exercised there by william the first fields are ravished from the industrious swains from men their cities and from gods their fanes the levelled towns with weeds lie covered over the hollow winds through naked temples roar round broken columns clasping ivy twined over heaps of ruins stalked the stately hind the fox obscene to gaping tombs retires and wolves with howling fill the sacred quires awed by his nobles by his commons cursed the oppressor ruled tyrannick where he durst stretched over the poor and church his iron rod and treats alike his vassals and his god whom even the saxon spared and bloody dane the wanton victims of his sport remain but see the man who spacious regions gave a waste for beasts himself denied a grave stretched on the lawn his richard second son of william the conqueror second hope survey at once the chaser and at once the prey lo rufus tugging at the deadly dart bleeds in the forest like a wounded heart succeeding monarchs heard the subjects cries nor saw displeased the peaceful cottage rise then gathering flocks on unknown mountains fed over sandy wilds were yellow harvests spread the forests wondered at the unusual grain and secret transports touched the conscious swain fair liberty britannias goddess rears her cheerful head and leads the golden years ye vigorous swains while youth ferments your blood and purer spirits swell the sprightly flood now range the hills the thickest woods beset wind the shrill horn or spread the waving net when milder autumn summers heat succeeds and in the newshorn field the partridge feeds before his lord the ready spaniel bounds panting with hope he tries the furrowed grounds but when the tainted gales the game betray couched close he lies and meditates the prey secure they trust the unfaithful field beset till hovering over em sweeps the swelling net thus if small things we may with great compare when albion sends her eager sons to war pleased in the genrals sight the host lie down sudden before some unsuspecting town the young the old one instant makes our prize and high in air britannias standard flies see from the brake the whirring pheasant springs and mounts exulting on triumphant wings short is his joy he feels the fiery wound flutters in blood and panting beats the ground ah what avail his glossie varying dies his purple crest and scarletcircled eyes the vivid green his shining plumes unfold his painted wings and breast that flames with gold nor yet when moist arcturus clouds the sky the woods and fields their pleasing toils deny to plains with wellbreathed beagles we repair and trace the mazes of the circling hare beasts taught by us their fellow beasts pursue and learn of man each other to undo with slaughtring guns the unwearied fowler roves when frosts have whitened all the naked groves where doves in flocks the leafless trees oershade and lonely woodcocks haunt the watery glade he lifts the tube and levels with his eye strait a short thunder breaks the frozen sky often as in airy rings they skim the heath the clamorous plovers feel the leaden death often as the mounting larks their notes prepare they fall and leave their little lives in air in genial spring beneath the quivering shade where cooling vapors breathe along the mead the patient fisher takes his silent stand intent his angle trembling in his hand with looks unmoved he hopes the scaly breed and eyes the dancing cork and bending reed our plenteous streams a various race supply the brighteyd perch with fins of tyrian dye the silver eel in shining volumes rolled the yellow carp in scales bedropd with gold swift trouts diversified with crimson stains and pykes the tyrants of the watery plains now cancer glows with phoebus fiery car the youth rush eager to the sylvan war swarm over the lawns the forest walks surround rowze the fleet heart and cheer the opening hound the impatient courser pants in every vein and pawing seems to beat the distant plain hills vales and floods appear already crossed and ere he starts a thousand steps are lost see the bold youth strain up the threatening steep rush through the thickets down the valleys sweep hang over their coursers heads with eager speed and earth rolls back beneath the flying steed let old arcadia boast her spacious plain the immortal huntress and her virgin train nor envy windsor since thy shades have seen as bright a goddess and as chaste a queen whose care like hers protects the sylvan reign the earths fair light and empress of the main here as old bards have sung diana strayed bathed in the springs or sought the cooling shade here armed with silver bows in early dawn her buskined virgins traced the dewy lawn above the rest a rural nymph was famed thy offspring thames the fair lodona named  lodonas fate in long oblivion cast the muse shall sing and what she sings shall last scarce could the goddess from her nymph be known but by the crescent and the golden zone she scorned the praise of beauty and the care a belt her waste a fillet binds her hair a painted quiver on her shoulder sounds and with her dart the flying deer she wounds it chanced as eager of the chase the maid beyond the forests verdant limits strayed pan saw and loved and furious with desire pursued her flight her flight increased his fire not half so swift the trembling doves can fly when the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky not half so swiftly the fierce eagle moves when through the clouds he drives the trembling doves as from the god with fearful speed she flew as did the god with equal speed pursue now fainting sinking pale the nymph appears now close behind his sounding steps she hears and now his shadow reached her as she run his shadow lengthened by the setting sun and now his shorter breath with sultry air pants on her neck and fans her parting hair in vain on father thames she calls for aid nor could diana help her injured maid faint breathless thus she prayed nor prayed in vain  ah cynthia ah  though banished from thy train  let me o let me to the shades repair  my native shades  there weep and murmur there she said and melting as in tears she lay in a soft silver stream dissolved away the silver stream her virgin coldness keeps for ever murmurs and for ever weeps still bears the the river loddon name the hapless virgin bore and bathes the forest where she ranged before in her chaste current often the goddess laves and with celestial tears augments the waves often in her glass the musing shepherd spies the headlong mountains and the downward skies the watery landscape of the pendant woods and absent trees that tremble in the floods in the clear azure gleam the flocks are seen and floating forests paint the waves with green through the fair scene roll slow the lingering streams then foaming pour along and rush into the thames thou too great father of the british floods with joyful pride surveyst our lofty woods where towering oaks their spreading honors rear and future navies on thy banks appear not neptunes self from all his floods receives a wealthier tribute than to thine he gives no seas so rich so full no streams appear no lake so gentle and no spring so clear not fabled po more swells the poets lays while through the skies his shining current strays than thine which visits windsors famed abodes to grace the mansion of our earthly gods nor all his stars a brighter luster show than the fair nymphs that gild thy shore below here jove himself subdued by beauty still might change olympus for a nobler hill happy the man whom this bright court approves his sovereign favors and his country loves happy next him who to these shades retires whom nature charms and whom the muse inspires whom humbler joys of homefelt quiet please successive study exercise and ease he gathers health from herbs the forest yields and of their fragrant physic spoils the fields with chymic art exalts the minral powers and draws the aromatic souls of flowers now marks the course of rolling orbs on high over figured worlds now travels with his eye of ancient writ unlocks the learned store consults the dead and lives past ages over or wandering thoughtful in the silent wood attends the duties of the wise and good to observe a mean be to himself a friend to follow nature and regard his end or looks on heaven with more than mortal eyes bids his free soul expatiate in the skies amidst her kindred stars familiar roam survey the region and confess her home such was the life great scipio once admired thus atticus and trumbal thus retired ye sacred nine that all my soul possess whose raptures fire me and whose visions bless bear me oh bear me to sequestered scenes of bowry mazes and surrounding greens to thamess banks which fragrant breezes fill or where ye muses sport on coopers hill on coopers hill eternal wreaths shall grow while lasts the mountain or while thames shall flow i seem through consecrated walks to rove and hear soft music dye along the grove led by the sound i roam from shade to shade by godlike poets venerable made here his first lays majestic denham sung there the last numbers flowed from mr cowley died at chertsey on the borders of the forest and was from thence conveyed to westminster cowleys tongue o early lost what tears the river shed when the sad pomp along his banks was led his drooping swans on every note expire and on his willows hung each muses lyre since fate relentless stopped their heavenly voice no more the forests ring or groves rejoice who now shall charm the shades where cowley strung his living harp and lofty denham sung but hark the groves rejoice the forest rings are these revived or is it granville sings it is yours my lord to bless our soft retreats and call the muses to their ancient seats to paint anew the flowery sylvan scenes to crown the forests with immortal greens make windsor hills in lofty numbers rise and lift her turrets nearer to the skies to sing those honors you deserve to wear and add new luster to her silver star here noble henry howard e of surrey one of the first resiners of the english poetry famous in the time of henry the viiith for his sonnets the scene of many of which is laid at windsor surrey felt the sacred rage surrey the granville of a former age matchless his pen victorious was his lance bold in the lists and graceful in the dance in the same shades the cupids tuned his lyre to the same notes of love and soft desire fair geraldine bright object of his vow then filled the groves as heavenly myra now oh would thou sing what heroes windsor bore what kings first breathed upon her winding shore or raise old warriors whose adored remains in weeping vaults her hallowed earth contains with edward iii born here edwards acts adorn the shining page stretch his long triumphs down through every age draw kings enchaind and cressis glorious field the lillies blazing on the regal shield then from her roofs when verrios colors fall and leave inanimate the naked wall still in thy song should vanquished france appear and bleed for ever under britains spear let softer strains illfated henry vi henry mourn and palms eternal flourish round his urn here over the martyrking the marble weeps and fast beside him oncefeard edward iv edward sleeps whom not the extended albion could contain from old belerium to the german main the grave unites where even the great find rest and blended lie the oppressor and the oppressed make sacred charless tomb for ever known obscure the place and uninscribd the stone oh fact accursed what tears has albion shed heavens what new wounds and how her old have bled she saw her sons with purple deaths expire her sacred domes involved in rolling fire a dreadful series of intestine wars in glorious triumphs and dishonest scars at length great anna said  let discord cease she said the world obeyed and all was peace in that blessed moment from his oozy bed old father thames advanced his reverend head his tresses dropped with dews and over the stream his shining horns diffused a golden gleam engraved on his urn appeared the moon that guides his swelling waters and alternate tides the figured streams in waves of silver rolled and on their banks augusta rose in gold around his throne the seaborn brothers stood that swell with tributary urns his flood first the famed authors of his ancient name the winding isis and the fruitful tame the kennet swift for silver eels renowned the loddon slow with verdant alders crowned cole whose clear streams his flowery islands lave and chalky wey that rolls a milky wave the blue transparent vandalis appears the gulphy lee his sedgy tresses rears and sullen mole that hides his diving flood and silent darent stained with danish blood high in the midst upon his urn reclined his seagreen mantle waving with the wind the god appeared he turned his azure eyes where windsordomes and pompous turrets rise then bowed and spoke the winds forget to roar and the hushed waves glide softly to the shore hail sacred peace hail longexpected days which thamess glory to the stars shall raise though tybers streams immortal rome behold though foaming hermus swells with tides of gold from heaven it self though sevnfold nilus flows and harvests on a hundred realms bestows these now no more shall be the muses themes lost in my fame as in the sea their streams let volgas banks with iron squadrons shine and groves of lances glitter on the rhine let barbarous ganges arm a servile train be mine the blessings of a peaceful reign no more my sons shall dye with british blood red ibers sands or isters foaming flood safe on my shore each unmolested swain shall tend the flocks or reap the bearded grain the shady empire shall retain no trace of war or blood but in the sylvan chase the trumpets sleep while cheerful horns are blown and arms employed on birds and beasts alone behold the ascending villas on my side project long shadows over the crystal tide behold augustas glittering spires increase and temples rise the beauteous works of peace i see i see where two fair cities bend their ample bow a new white hall ascend there mighty nations shall inquire their doom the worlds great oracle in times to come there kings shall sue and suppliant states be seen once more to bend before a british queen thy trees fair windsor now shall leave their woods and half thy forests rush into my floods bear britains thunder and her cross display to the bright regions of the rising day tempt icy seas where scarce the waters roll where clearer flames glow round the frozen pole or under southern skies exalt their sails led by new stars and born by spicy gales for me the balm shall bleed and amber flow the coral redden and the ruby glow the pearly shell its lucid globe infold and phoebus warm the ripening ore to gold the time shall come when free as seas or wind unbounded thames shall flow for all mankind whole nations enter with each swelling tide and oceans join whom they did first divide earths distant ends our glory shall behold and the new world launch forth to seek the old then ships of uncouth form shall stem the tide and feathered people crowd my wealthy side while naked youth and painted chiefs admire our speech our color and our strange attire oh stretch thy reign fair peace from shore to shore till conquest cease and slavery be no more till the freed indians in their native groves reap their own fruits and woo their sable loves peru once more a race of kings behold and other mexicos be roofd with gold exiled by thee from earth to deepest hell in brazen bonds shall barbarous discord dwell gigantick pride pale terror gloomy care and mad ambition shall attend her there there purple vengeance bathed in gore retires her weapons blunted and extinct her fires there hateful envy her own snakes shall feel and persecution mourn her broken wheel there faction roars rebellion bites her chain and gasping furies thirst for blood in vain here cease thy flight nor with unhallowed lays touch the fair fame of albions golden days the thoughts of gods let granvilles verse recite and bring the scenes of opening fate to light my humble muse in unambitious strains paints the green forests and the flowery plains where peace descending bids her olives spring and scatters blessings from her dovelike wing even i more sweetly pass my careless days pleased in the silent shade with empty praise enough for me that to the listening swains first in these fields i sung the sylvan strains finis
