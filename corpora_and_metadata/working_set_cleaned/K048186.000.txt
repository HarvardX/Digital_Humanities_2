an essay on the writings and genius of pope  satyra quidem tota nostra est in qua primus insignem laudem adeptus est lucilius qui quosdam ita deditos sibi adhuc habet amatores ut eum non ejusdem modo operis autoribus sed omnibus poetis praeferre non dubitent quintilian london printed for m cooper at the globe in paternoster row mdcclvi  to the reverend dr young rector of welwyn in hertfordshire dear sir permit me to break into your retirement the residence of virtue and literature and to trouble you with a few reflections on the merits and real character of an admired author and on other collateral subjects that will naturally arise no love of singularity no affectation of paradoxical opinions gave rise to the following work i revere the memory of pope i respect and honor his abilities but i do not think him at the head of his profession in other words in that species of poetry wherein pope excelled he is superior to all mankind and i only say that this species of poetry is not the most excellent one of the art we do not it should seem sufficiently attend to the difference there is betwixt a man of wit a man of sense and a true poet done and swift were undoubtedly men of wit and men of sense but what traces have they left of pure poetry fontenelle and la motte are entitled to the former character but what can they urge to gain the latter which of these characters is the most valuable and useful is entirely out of the question all i plead for is to have their several provinces kept distinct from each other and to impress on the reader that a clear head and acute understanding are not sufficient alone to make a poet that the most solid observations on human life expressed with the utmost elegance and brevity are morality and not poetry that the epistles of boileau in rhyme are no more poetical than the characters of bruyere in prose and that it is a creative and glowing imagination acer spiritus ac vis and that alone that can stamp a writer with this exalted and very uncommon character which so few possess and of which so few can properly judge  for one person who can adequately relish and enjoy a work of imagination twenty are to be found who can taste and judge of observations on familiar life and the manners of the age the satires of ariosto are more read than the orlando furioso or even dante are there so many cordial admirers of spenser and milton as of hudibras  if we strike out of the number of these supposed admirers those who appear such out of fashion and not of feeling swifts rhapsody on poetry is far more popular than akensides noble ode to lord huntingdon the epistles on the characters of men and women and your sprightly satires my good friend are more frequently perused and quoted than lallegro and il penseroso of milton had you written only these satires you would indeed have gained the title of a man of wit and a man of sense but i am confident would not insist on being denominated a poet merely on their account non satis est puris versum perscribere verbis   it is amazing this matter should ever have been mistaken when horace has taken particular and repeated pains to settle and adjust the opinion in question he has more than once disclaimed all right and title to the name of poet on the score of his ethic and satiric pieces  neque enim concludere versum dixeris esse satis  are lines often repeated but whose meaning is not extended and weighed as it ought to be nothing can be more judicious than the method he prescribes of trying whether any composition be essentially poetical or not which is to drop entirely the measures and numbers and transpose and invert the order of the words and in this unadorned manner to peruse the passage if there be really in it a true poetical spirit all your inversions and transpositions will not disguise and extinguish it but it will retain its luster like a diamond unset and thrown back into the rubbish of the mine let us make a little experiment on the following wellknown lines  yes you despise the man that is confined to books who rails at human kind from his study though what he learns he speaks and may perhaps advance some general maxims or may be right by chance the coxcomb bird so grave and so talkative that cries whore knave and cuckold from his cage though he rightly call many a passenger you hold him no philosopher and yet such is the fate of all extremes men may be read too much as well as books we grow more partial for the sake of the observer to observations which we ourselves make less so to written wisdom because anothers maxims are drawn from notions and those from guess what shall we say of this passage  why that it is most excellent sense but just as poetical as the qui fit maecenas of the author who recommends this method of trial take any ten lines of the iliad paradise lost or even of the georgics of virgil and see whether by any process of critical chemistry you can lower and reduce them to the tameness of prose you will find that they will appear like ulysses in his disguise of rags still a hero though lodged in the cottage of the herdsman eumaeus  the sublime and the pathetic are the two chief nerves of all genuine poesy what is there very sublime or very pathetic in pope in his works there is indeed nihil inane nihil arcessitum  puro tamen fonti quam magno flumini propior as the excellent quintilian remarks of lysias and because i am perhaps ashamed or afraid to speak out in plain english i will adopt the following passage of voltaire which in my opinion as exactly characterizes pope as it does his model boileau for whom it was originally designed incapable peutetre du sublime qui eleve lame et du sentiment qui lattendrit mais fait pour eclairer ceux a qui la nature accorda lun et lautre laborieux severe precis pur harmonieux il devint enfin le poet de la raison  our english poets may i think be be disposed in four different classes and degrees in the first class i would place first our only three sublime and pathetic poets spenser shakespeare milton and then at proper intervals otway and lee in the second class should be placed such as possessed the true poetical genius in a more moderate degree but had noble talents for moral and ethical poesy at the head of these are dryden done denham cowley congreve in the third class may be placed men of wit of elegant taste and some fancy in describing familiar life here may be numbered prior waller parnell swift fenton in the fourth class the mere versifiers however smooth and mellifluous some of them may be thought should be ranked such as pit sandys fairfax broom buckingham lansdown in which of these classes pope deserves to be placed the following work is intended to determine  i am dear sir your affectionate and faithful servant  an essay on the writings and genius of pope sect i of the pastorals and the messiah an eclogue princes and authors are seldom spoken of during their lives with justice and impartiality admiration and envy their constant attendants like two unskilful artists are apt to overcharge their pieces with too great a quantity of light or of shade and are disqualified happily to hit upon that middle color that mixture of error and excellence which alone renders every representation of man just and natural this perhaps may be one reason among others why we have never yet seen a fair and candid criticism on the character and merits of our last great poet mr pope i have therefore thought that it would be no unpleasing amusement or uninstructive employment to examine at large without blind panegyric or petulant invective the writings of this english classic in the order in which they are arranged in the elegant edition of mr warburton as i shall neither censure nor commend without alleging the reason on which my opinion is founded i shall be entirely unmoved at the imputation of malignity or the clamours of popular prejudice  it is something strange that in the pastorals of a young poet there should not be found a single rural image that is new but this i am afraid is the case in the pastorals before us the ideas of theocritus virgil and spenser are indeed here exhibited in language equally mellifluous and pure but the descriptions and sentiments are trite and common that the design of pastoral poesy is to represent the undisturbed felicity of the golden age is an empty notion which though supported by a rapin and a fontenelle i think all rational critics have agreed to exstirpate and explode but i do not remember that even these lastmentioned critics have remarked the circumstance that gave origin to the opinion that any golden age was intended theocritus the father and the model of this enchanting species of composition lived and wrote in sicily the climate of sicily was delicious and the face of the country various and beautiful it is valleys and it is precipices it is grottos and cascades were sweetly interchanged and it is fruits and flowers were lavish and luscious the poet described what he saw and felt and had no need to have recourse to those artificial assemblages of pleasing objects which are not to be found in nature the figs and the honey which he assigns as a reward to a victorious shepherd were in themselves exquisite and are therefore assigned with great propriety idyll i ver      and the beauties of that luxurious landschape so richly and circumstantially delineated in the close of the seventh idyllium where all things smelt of summer and smelt of autumn  ver      were present and real succeeding writers supposing these beauties too great and abundant to be real referred them to the fictitious and imaginary scenes of a golden age  a mixture of british and grecian ideas may justly be deemed a blemish in the pastorals of pope and propriety is certainly violated when he couples pactolus with thames and windsor with hybla complaints of immoderate heat and wishes to be conveyed to cooling caverns when uttered by the inhabitants of greece have a decorum and consistency which they totally lose in the character of a british shepherd and theocritus during the ardors of sirius must have heard the murmurings of a brook and the whispers of a pine idyll i ver   with more homefelt pleasure than pope past iv ver   could possibly experience upon the same occasion we can never completely relish or adequately understand any author especially any ancient except we constantly keep in our eye his climate his country and his age pope himself informs us in a note that he judiciously omitted the following verse and listening wolves grow milder as they hear past ii  on account of the absurdity which spenser overlooked of introducing wolves into england but on this principle which is certainly a just one may it not be asked why he should speak the scene lying in windsor forest of the sultry sirius past ii ver    of the grateful clusters of grapes past iii ver    of a pipe of reeds past ii ver    the antique fistula of thanking ceres for a plentiful harvest ibid ver    of the sacrifice of lambs past iv ver    with many other instances that might be adduced to this purpose that pope however was sensible of the importance of adapting images to the scene of action is obvious from the following example of his judgment for in translating audiit eurotas jussitque ediscere lauros he has dexterously dropped the laurels appropriated to eurotas as he is speaking of the river thames and has rendered it thames heard the numbers as he flowed along and bade his willows learn the moving song ibid ver       in the passages which pope has imitated from theocritus and from his latin translator virgil he has merited but little applause it may not be unentertaining to see how coldly and unpoetically pope has copied the subsequent appeal to the nymphs on the death of daphnis in comparison of milton on lycidas one of his juvenile pieces     theocritus idyll i     where stray ye muses in what lawn or grove while your alexis pines in hopeless love in those fair fields where sacred isis glides or else where came his winding vales divides pope past ii     where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep closed over the head of your loved lycidas for neither were ye playing on the steep where your old bards the famous druids lie nor on the shaggy top of mona high nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream milton    the mention of places remarkably romantic the supposed habitation of druids bards and wizards is far more pleasing to the imagination than the obvious introduction of came and isis as seats of the muses  a shepherd in theocritus wishes with much tenderness and elegance both which must suffer in a literal translation would i could become a murmuring be fly into your grotto and be permitted to creep among the leaves of ivy and fern that compose the chaplet which adorns your head     idyll iii      pope has thus altered this image oh were i made by some transforming power the captive bird that sings within thy bower then might my voice thy listening ears employ and i those kisses he receives enjoy past ii     on three accounts the former image is preferable to the latter for the pastoral wildness the delicacy and the uncommonness of the thought i cannot forbear adding that the riddle of the royal oak in the first pastoral invented in imitation of the virgilian aenigmas in the third eclogue savours of pun and puerile conceit say daphnis say in what glad soil appears a wondrous tree that sacred monarchs bears ver     with what propriety could the tree whose shade protected the king be said to be prolific of princes  that pope has not equalled theocritus will indeed appear less surprising if we reflect that no original writer ever remained so unrivalled by succeeding copyists as this sicilian master  if it should be objected that the barrenness of invention imputed to pope from a view of his pastorals is equally imputable to the bucolics of virgil it may be answered that whatever may be determined of the rest yet the first and last eclogues of virgil are indisputable proofs of true genius and power of fancy the influence of war on the tranquillity of rural life i have been lately highly entertained with the accidental perusal of five pastorals written on this plan descriptive of the calamities supposed to have been felt by the shepherds of germany during the last war they abound in many new circumstances of pastoral distress and many tender images i cannot learn the name of the author  rendered the subject of the first new and interesting its composition is truly dramatic and the characters of it is two shepherds are well supported and happily contrasted and the last has expressively painted the changeful resolutions the wild wishes the passionate and abrupt exclamations of a disappointed and despairing lover  upon the whole the principal merit of the pastorals of pope consists in their correct and musical versification musical to a degree of which rhyme could hardly be thought capable and in giving the first specimen of that harmony in english verse which is now become indispensably necessary and which has so forcibly and universally influenced the public ear as to have rendered every moderate rhymer melodious pope lengthened the abruptness of waller and at the same time contracted the exuberance of dryden  i remember to have been informed by an intimate friend of pope that he had once laid a design of writing american eclogues the subject would have been fruitful of the most poetical imagery and if properly executed would have rescued the author from the accusation here urged of having written eclogues without invention  our author who had received an early tincture of religion a reverence for which he preserved to the last was with justice convinced that the scriptures of god contained not only the purest precepts of morality but the most elevated and sublime strokes of genuine poesy strokes as much superior to any thing heathenism can produce as is jehovah to jupiter this is the case more particularly in the exalted prophesy of isaiah which pope has so successfully versified in an eclogue that incontestably surpasses the pollio of virgil although perhaps the dignity the energy and the simplicity of the original are in a few passages weakened and diminished by florid epithets and useless circumlocutions see nature hastes her earliest wreaths to bring with all the incense of the breathing spring mess v     are lines which have too much prettiness and too modern an air the judicious addition of circumstances and adjuncts is what renders poesy a more lively imitation of nature than prose pope has been happy in introducing the following circumstance the prophet says the parched ground shall become a pool our author expresses this idea by saying that the shepherd  shall start amid the thirsty wild to hear new falls of water murmuring in his ear v  0  a striking example of a similar beauty may be added from thompson melisander in the tragedy of agamemnon after telling us he was conveyed in a vessel at midnight to the wildest of the cyclades adds when the pitiless mariners had left him in that dreadful solitude  i never heard a sound so dismal as their parting oars   on the other hand the prophet has been sometimes particular when pope has been only general lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves together they come to thee  the multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of median and ephah all they from sheba shall come they shall bring gold and incense and they shall show forth the praises of the lord all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee isaiah c lx v       in imitating this passage pope has omitted the different beasts that in so picturesque a manner characterize the different countries which were to be gathered together on this important event and says only in undistinguishing terms see barbarous nations at thy gates attend walk in thy light and in thy temple bend see thy bright altars thronged with prostrate kings and heaped with products of sabaean springs ver       as prosperity and happiness are described in this eclogue by a combination of the most pleasing and agreeable objects so misery and destruction are as forcibly delineated in the same isaiah by the circumstances of distress and desolation that were to attend the fall of that magnificent city babylon and the latter is perhaps a more proper and interesting subject for poetry than the former as such kinds of objects make the deepest impression on the mind pity being a stronger sensation than complacency accordingly a noble ode on the destruction of babylon taken from the fourteenth chapter of isaiah has been written by mr lowth whose latin prelections on the inimitable poesy of the hebrews abounding in remarks entirely new delivered in the purest and most expressive language are the richest augmentation literature has lately received and from which the following passage gradually unfolding the singular beauties of this prophecy is here closely though faintly translated and inserted as a pattern of just criticism  the prophet having predicted the deliverance of the jews and their return into their own country from their rigorous babylonish captivity instantly introduces them singing a certain triumphal song on the fall of the king of babylon a song abounding in the most splendid images and carried on by perpetual and those very beautiful personifications the song begins with a sudden exclamation of the jews expressing their joy and wonder at the unexpected change of their condition and death of the tyrant earth with her inhabitants triumphs the firs and cedars of libanus under which images the allegoric style frequently shadows the kings and princes of the gentiles rejoice and insult with reproaches the broken power of their most implacable foe she is at rest the whole earth is quiet they break forth into singing even the firs rejoice at thee the cedars of libanus since thou art laid low no feller is come up against us there follows a most daring prosopopeia of orcus or the infernal regions he rouzes his inhabitants the manes of princes and the shades of departed kings immediately all of them arise from their thrones and walk forward to meet the king of babylon they insult and deride him and gather consolation from his calamity art thou also made weak as we art thou made like unto us is thy pride dashed down to orcus the noise of thy harps the worm is strewn under thee the earthworm is thy covering the jews are again represented speaking they most strongly exaggerate his remarkable fall by an exclamation formed in the manner of funeral lamentations how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning thou art dashed down to the earth thou that did crush the nations they next represent the king himself speaking and madly boasting of his unbounded power whence the prodigiousness of his ruin is wonderfully aggravated nor is this enough a new personage is immediately formed those are introduced who found the body of the king of babylon cast out they survey it it closely and attentively and at last hardly know it is this the man who made earth tremble who shook the kingdoms who made the world a solitude and destroyed it is cities they reproach him with the loss of the common rite of sepulture which was deservedly denied to him for his cruelty and oppression and curse his name his race and posterity the scene is closed by a most awful speech of god himself menacing a perpetual extirpation to the king of babylon to his descendants and to his city and confirming the immutability of his councils by the ratification of a solemn oath  what images how various how thicksown how sublime exalted with what energy what expressions figures and sentiments are here accumulated together we hear the jews the cedars of libanus the shades of the departed kings the king of babylon those who find his body and lastly jehovah himself all speaking in order and behold them acting their several parts as it were in a drama one continued action is carried on or rather a various and manifold series of different actions is connected every excellence more peculiarly appropriated to the sublimer ode is consummatley displayed in this poem of isaiah which is the most perfect and unexampled model among all the monuments of antiquity the personages are frequent but not confused are bold but not affected a free lofty and truly divine spirit predominates through the whole nor is any thing wanting to crown and complete the sublimity of this ode with absolute beauty nor can the greek or roman poesy produce any thing that is similar or second to this ode praelect    ad calc     it cannot be thought strange that he who could so judiciously explain could as poetically express the ideas of isaiah the latter he has performed in many instances but in none more strikingly than in the following which magnificently represents the messiah treading the wine press in his anger and which and impartial judge not blinded by the charms of antiquity will think equal to any description in virgil in point of elegance and energy  ille patris vires indutus et iram dira rubens graditur per stragem et fracta potentum agmina prona solo prostratisque hostibus ultor insultat ceu praela novo spumantia musto exercens salit attritas calcator in uvas congestamque struem subigit caede atra recenti crura madent rorantque inspersae sanguine vestes prael      sect ii of windsorforest and lyric pieces descriptive poetry was by no means the shining talent of pope this assertion may be manifested by the few images introduced in the poem before us which are not equally applicable to any place whatsoever rural beauty in general and not the peculiar beauties of the forest of windsor are here described nor are the sports of setting shooting and fishing included between the ninetythird and one hundred and fortysixth verses to which the reader is referred at all more appropriated the stagchase that immediately follows although some of the lines are incomparably good see particularly ver     is not so full so animated and so circumstantiated as that of somerville  the digression that describes the demolition of the thirty villages by william the conqueror is well imagined particularly round broken columns clasping ivy twined over heaps of ruin stalked the stately hind the fox obscene to gaping tombs retires and savage howlings fill the sacred quires ver     though i cannot forbear thinking that the following picture of the ruins of godstownunnery drawn it should seem on the spot and worthy the hand of paul brill is by no means excelled by the foregoing qua nudo rosamonda humilis sub culmine tecti marmoris obscuri servat inane decus rara intermissae circum vestigia molis et sola in vacuo tramite porta labat sacrae olim seeds riguae convallis in umbra et veteri pavidum

magnified the law of the curfeubell by which every inhabitant of england was obliged to extinguish his fire and candles at eight in the evening has been usually alleged as the institution of a capricious tyrant but this law as voltaire ibid rightly observes was so far from being absurdly tyrannical that it was an ancient ecclesiastical custom established among all the monasteries of the north their houses were built of wood and so cautious a method to prevent fire was an object worthy a prudent legislator a more amiable idea than pope has here exhibited of the conqueror is given us of the same prince by that diligent enenquirer into antiquity the president henault in a passage that contains some curious particulars characteristical of the manner of that age this monarch

certain number of the skins of martens novel abrege chronologique de lhistoire de france tom   page     to this useful and entertaining work voltaire has been deeply indebted without confessing his obligation but to return the story of ver     lodona is prettily ovidian but there is scarcely a single incident in it but what is borrowed from some transformation of ovid the picture of a virtuous and learned man in retirement ver     is highly finished as it flowed from the soul of our poet who was here in his proper element recommending integrity and science he has no where discovered more poetic enthusiasm than where speaking of the poets who lived or died near this spot he breaks out i seem through consecrated walks to rove i hear soft music die along the grove led by the sound i roam from shade to shade by godlike poets venerable made ver      the enumeration of the princes who were either born or interred at windsor is judiciously introduced yet i have frequently wondered that he should have omitted the opportunity of describing at length it is venerable ancient castle and the fruitful and extensive prospects the great improvements lately made near windsorlodge by the duke of cumberland particularly the magnificent lake and cascade highly deserve to be celebrated by some future pope and would have contributed not a little to the beauty of the poem now before us which it commands he slides with dexterity and address from speaking of the miseries of the civil war to the blessings of peace ver     old father thames is raised and acts and speaks with becoming dignity and though the trite and obvious insignia of a river god are attributed yet there is one circumstance in his appearance highly picturesque his seagreen mantle waving with the wind ver     the relievo of his urn also is finely imagined the figured streams in waves of silver rolled and on their banks augusta rose in gold ver      he has with exquisite skill selected only those rivers as attendants of thames who are his subjects his tributaries or neighbors i cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing the passage first the famed authors of his ancient name the winding isis and the fruitful tame the kennet swift for silver eels renowned the loddon slow with verdant osiers crowned cole whose dark streams his flowery islands lave and chalky wey that rolls a milky wave the blue transparent vandalis appears the gulphy lee his sedgy tresses rears and sullen mole that hides his diving flood and silent darent stained with british blood ver        as i before produced a passage of milton which i thought superior to a similar one of pope i shall in order to preserve impartiality produce another from milton in which i think him inferior to the last quoted passage except perhaps in the third line first remarking that both authors are much indebted to spenser fairy queen b iv c    rivers arise whether thou be the son of utmost tweed or oose or gulphy dun or trent who like some earthborn giant spreads his thirty arms along the indented meads or sullen mole that runs underneath or severn swift guilty of maidens death or rocky avon or of sedgy lee or coaly tine or ancient hallowed dee or humber loud that keeps the scythians name or medway smooth or royaltowred them at a vacation exercise etc ver    milton was now aged but nineteen    the poets both ancient and modern are obliged to the rivers for some of their most most striking descriptions the tiber and the nile of virgil the aufidus of horace the sabrina of milton and the scamander of homer are among their capital figures  the influences and effects of peace and its consequence a diffusive commerce are expressed by selecting such circumstances as are best adapted to strike the imagination by lively pictures the selection of which chiefly constitutes true poetry an historian or prosewriter might say then shall the most distant nations crowd into my port a poet sets before your eyes the ships of uncouth form that shall arrive in the thames ver  00 et seq and feathered people crowd my wealthy side and naked youths and painted chiefs admire our speech our color and our strange attire and the benevolence and poetry of the succeeding wish are worthy admiration till the freed indians in their native groves reap their own fruits and woo their sable loves peru once more a race of kings behold and other mexicos be roofd with gold ver  0   the two epithets native and sable have peculiar elegance and force and as peru was particularly famous for its long succession of incas and mexico for many magnificent works of massy gold there is great propriety in fixing the restoration of the grandeur of each to that object for which each was once so remarkable  the groupe of allegorical personages that succeeds the last mentioned lines are worthy the pencil of rubens or julio romano it may perhaps however be wished that the epithets barbarous discord mad ambition hateful envy ver     et seq had been particular and picturesque instead of general and indiscriminating though it may possibly be urged that in describing the dreadful inhabitants of the portal of hell virgil has not always used such adjuncts and epithets as a painter or statuary might work after he says only ultrices curae mortiferum bellum mala mentis gaudia particularly malesuada is only applied to fames instead of a word that might represent the meagre and ghastly figure intended i make no scruple of adding that in this famous passage virgil has exhibited no images so lively and distinct as these living figures painted by pope each of them with their proper insignia and attributes  envy her own snakes shall feel ver     et seq  and persecution mourn his broken wheel there faction roar rebellion bite her chain and gasping furies thirst for blood in vain   a person of no small rank has informed me that mr addison was inexpressibly chagrined at this noble conclusion of windsorforest both as a politician and as a poet as a politician because it so highly celebrated that treaty of peace which he deemed so pernicious to the liberties of europe and as a poet because he was deeply conscious that his own campaign that gazette in rhyme contained no strokes of such genuine and sublime poetry as the conclusion before us  it is one of the greatest and most pleasing arts of descriptive poetry to introduce moral sentences and instructions in an oblique and indirect manner in places where one naturally expects only painting and amusement we have virtue as mr pope remarks iliad b    in the notes ver     put upon us by surprise and are pleased to find a thing where we should never have looked to meet with it i must do a noble english poet the justice to observe that it is this particular art that is the very distinguishing excellence of coopershill throughout which the descriptions of places and images raised by the poet are still tending to some hint or leading into some reflection upon moral life or political institution much in the same manner as the real sight of such scenes and prospects is apt to give the mind a composed turn and incline it to thoughts and contemplations that have a relation to the object this is the great charm of the incomparable elegy written in a country churchyard having mentioned the rustic monuments and simple epitaphs of the swains the amiable poet falls into a very natural reflection for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being ever resigned left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingering look behind   of this art mr pope has exhibited some specimens in the poem we are examining but not so many as might be expected from a mind so strongly inclined to a moral way of writing after speaking of hunting the hare he immediately subjoins much in the spirit of denham beasts urged by us their fellow beasts pursue and learn of man each other to undo ver      where he is describing the tyrannies formerly exercised in this kingdom cities laid waste they stormed the dens and caves he instantly adds with an indignation becoming a true lover of liberty as such he was for wiser brutes were backward to be slaves ver  0  but i am afraid our author in the following passage has fallen into a fault very uncommon in his writings into a reflection that is very farfetched and forced here waving groves a checkered scene display and part admit and part exclude the day as some coy nymph her lovers warm address nor quite indulges nor can quite repress ver       bohours would rank this comparison among false thoughts and italian conceits such particularly as abound in the works of marino the fallacy consists in giving design and artifice to the wood as well as to the coquette and in putting the light of the sun and the warmth of a lover on a level  a pathetic reflection properly introduced into a descriptive poem will have a still greater force and beauty and more deeply interest a reader than a moral one when pope therefore has described a pheasant shot he breaks out into a very masterly exclamation ah what avail his glossy varying dies his purple crest and scarletcircled eyes the vivid green his shining plumes unfold his painted wings and breast that flames with gold ver      where this exquisite picture heightens the distress and powerfully excites the commiseration of the reader to this purpose i may add a passage in an ode to fancy dodsleys miscell page  0 ver   which i have heard commended for a similar stroke of a pathetic nature after passing through various scenes the poet leads us  to some abbys mouldering towers where to avoid cold wintry showers the naked beggar shivering lies while whistling tempests round her rise and trembles least the tottering wall should on her sleeping infants fall the object of fear indicated in the two last lines is i believe new and unborrowed and interests us in the scene described under this head it would be unpardonable to omit a capital and i think the most excellent example extant of the beauty here intended in the third georgic of virgil ver     the poet having mournfully described a heifer struck with a pestilence and falling down dead in the middle of his work artfully reminds us of his former services quid labor aut benefacta juvant quid vomere terras invertisse graves by the epithet graves virgil insinuates after his manner the difficulty and laboriousness of the work  this circumstance would have been sufficient as it raised our pity from a motive of gratitude but with this circumstance the tender virgil was not content what he adds therefore of the natural undeviating temperance of the animal who cannot have contracted disease by excess and who for that reason deserved a better fate is moving beyond compare  atqui non massica bacchi munera non illis epulae nocuere repostae frondibus et vitu pascuntur simplicis herbae pocula sunt fontes liquidi atque exercita cursu flumina nec somnos abrumpit cura salubres   of english poets perhaps none have excelled the ingenious mr dyer in this oblique instruction into which he frequently steals imperceptibly in his little descriptive poem entitled grongar hill where he disposes every object so as it may give occasion for some observation on human life denham himself is not superior to this neglected author in this particular after painting a landschape very extensive and diversified he adds thus is natures vesture wrought to instruct our wandering thought thus she dresses green and gay to disperse our cares away another view from his favorite spot gives him an opportunity for sliding into the following moralities in this light also his poem on the ruins of rome deserves a perusal dodsleys miscell vol   page    how close and small the hedges lie what streaks of meadows cross the eye a step methinks may pass the stream so little distant dangers seem so we mistake the futures face eyed through hopes deluding glass as yon summits soft and fair clad in colors of the air which to those who journey near barren and brown and rough appear still we tread the same coarse way the presents still a cloudy day   the unexpected insertion of such reflections imparts to us the same pleasure that we feel when in wandering through a wilderness or grove we suddenly behold in the turning of the walk a statue of some virtue or muse  it may be observed in general that description of the external beauties of nature is usually the first effort of a young genius before he has studied manners and passions some of miltons most early as well as most exquisite pieces are his lycidas lallegro and il penseroso if we may except his ode on the nativity of christ which is indeed prior in the order of time and in which a penetrating critic might have discovered the seeds of that boundless imagination which was one day to produce the paradise lost this ode which by the way is not sufficiently read or admired is also of the descriptive kind but the objects of his description are great and striking to the imagination the false gods and goddesses of the heathen forsaking their temples on the birth of our savior divination and oracles at an end which facts though perhaps not historically true are poetically beautiful the lonely mountains over and the resounding shore a voice of weeping heard and loud lament

one is almost inclined to believe the superstitions here alluded to to be real and the succeeding circumstances make one start and look around in consecrated earth and on the holy hearth the lars and lemurs moan with midnight plaint in urns and altars round a drear and dying sound affrights the flamens at their service quaint methinks we behold the priests interrupted in the middle of the secret ceremonies they were performing in their temples dim gazing with ghastly eyes on each other and terrified and wondering from whence these aerial voices should proceed i have dwelt chiefly on this ode as much less celebrated than lallegro and il pensoroso which are now universally known but which by a strange fatality lay in a sort of obscurity the private enjoyment of a few curious readers till they were set to admirable music by mr handel and indeed this volume of miltons miscellaneous poems has not till very lately met with suitable regard shall i offend any rational admirer of pope by remarking that these juvenile descriptive poems of milton as well as his latin elegies are of a strain far more exalted than any the former author can boast let me add at the same time what justice obliges me to add that they are far more incorrect for in the very ode before us occur one or two passages that are puerile and affected to a degree not to be parallelled in the purer but less elevated compositions of pope the season being winter milton has said that in honor to jesus nature in awe to him had dofft her gaudy trim and afterward observes in a very epigrammatic and very forced thought unsuitable to the dignity of the subject and of the rest of the ode that she wooed the air to hide her guilty front with innocent show and on her naked shame miltons miscellaneous poems vol

voltaire davoir cru appercevoir quelques erreurs dinvention dans ce grand genie cest une consolation pour un esprit aussi borne que le mien detre bien persuade que les plus grands hommes se trompent comme le vulgaire  it would be unpardonable to conclude these remarks on descriptive poesy without taking notice of the seasons of thomson who had peculiar and powerful talents for this species of composition let the reader therefore pardon a digression if such it be on his merits and character thomson was blessed with a strong and copious fancy he has enriched poetry with a variety of new and original images which he painted from nature itself and from his own actual observations his descriptions have therefore a distinctness and truth which are utterly wanting to those of poets who have only copied from each other and have never looked abroad on the objects themselves thomson was accustomed to wander away into the country for days and for weeks attentive to each rural sight each rural sound while many a poet who has dwelt for years in the strand has attempted to describe fields and rivers and generally succeeded accordingly hence that nauseous repetition of the same circumstances hence that disgusting impropriety of introducing what may be called a set of hereditary images without proper regard to the age or climate or occasion in which they were formerly used though the diction of the seasons is sometimes harsh and inharmonious and sometimes turgid and obscure and though in many instances the numbers are not sufficiently diversified by different pauses yet is this poem on the whole from the numberless strokes of nature in which it abounds one of the most captivating and amusing in our language and which as its beauties are not of a fugacious kind as depending on particular customs and manners will ever be perused with delight the scenes of thomson are frequently as wild and romantic as those of salvator rosa pleasingly varied with precipices and torrents and castled cliffs and deep valleys with piny mountains and the gloomiest caverns innumerable are the little circumstances in his descriptions totally unobserved by all his predecessors what poet has ever taken notice of the leaf that toward the end of autumn incessant rustles from the mournful grove ver  000  often startling such as studious walk below and slowly circles through the waving air or who in speaking of a summer evening has ever mentioned the quail that clamours for his running mate or the following natural image at the same time of the year wide over the thistly lawn as swells the breeze a whitening shower of vegetable down amusive floats ver       where do we find the silence and expectation that precedes an april shower insisted on as in ver     of spring or where the stealing shower is scarce to patter heard by such as wander through the forest walks beneath thumbrageous multitude of leaves ver      how full particular and picturesque is this assemblage of circumstances that attend a very keen frost in a night of winter loud rings the frozen earth and hard reflects a double noise while at his evening watch the village dog deters the nightly thief the heifer lows the distant waterfall swells in the breeze and with the hasty tread of traveller the hollowsounding plain shakes from afar winter ver      in no one subject are common poets more confused and unmeaning than in their descriptions of rivers which are generally said only to wind and to murmur while their qualities and courses are seldom accurately marked examine the exactness of the ensuing description and consider what a perfect idea it communicates to the mind around the adjoining brook that purls along the vocal grove now fretting over a rock now scarcely moving through a reedy pool now starting to a sudden stream and now gently diffused into a limpid plain a various groupe the herds and flocks compose rural confusion summer ver      a groupe worthy the pencil of giacomo da bassano and so minutely delineated that he might have worked from this sketch  on the grassy bank some ruminating lie while others stand half in the flood and often bending sip the circling surface  he adds that the ox in the middle of them  from his sides the troublous insects lashes to his sides returning still summer ver     et seq  a natural circumstance that to the best of my remembrance has escaped even the natural theocritus nor do i recollect that any poet has been struck with the murmurs of the numberless insects that swarm abroad at the noon of a summers day as attendants of the evening indeed they have been mentioned resounds the living surface of the ground nor undelightful is the ceaseless hum to him who muses through the woods at noon or drowsy shepherd as he lies reclined with halfshut eyes summer ver      but the novelty and nature we admire in the descriptions of thomson is by no means his only excellence he is equally to be praised for impressing on our minds the effects which the scene delineated would have on the present spectator or hearer thus having spoken of the roaring of the savages in the wilderness of africa he introduces a captive who though just escaped from ver     prison and slavery under the tyrant of morocco is so terrified and astonished at the dreadful uproar that the wretch half wishes for his bonds again thus also having described a caravan lost and overwhelmed in one of those whirlwinds that so frequently agitate and lift up the whole sands of the desert he finishes his picture by adding that  in cairos crowded street summer ver      the impatient merchant wondering waits in vain and mecca saddens at the long delay and thus lastly in describing the pestilence that destroyed the british troops at the siege of carthagena he has used a circumstance inimitably lively picturesque and striking to the imagination for he says that the admiral not only heard the groans of the sick that echoed from ship to ship but that he also pensively stood and listened at midnight to the dashing of the waters occasioned by throwing the dead bodies into the sea heard nightly plunged into the sullen waves the frequent corse ver  0    a minute and particular enumeration of circumstances judiciously selected is what chiefly discriminates poetry from history and renders the former for that reason a more close and faithful representation of nature than the latter and if our poets would accustom themselves to contemplate fully every object before they attempted to describe it they would not fail of giving their readers more new images than they generally do a summer evening for instance after a shower has been frequently described but never that i can recollect so justly as in the following lines whose greatest beauty is that hinted above a simple enumeration of the appearances of nature and of what is actually to be seen at such a time they are not unworthy the correct and pure tibullus vespere sub verno tandem actis imbribus ether guttatim sparsis rorat apertus aquis aureus abrupto curvamine desuper arcus fulget et ancipiti lumine tingit agros continuo sensus pertentat frigoris aura vivida et insinuans mulcet amaenus odor pallentes sparsim accrescunt per pascua fungi laetius et torti graminis herba viret plurimus annosa decussus ab arbore limax in putri lentum tramite sulcat iter splendidus accendit per dumos lampada vermis roscida dum tremula semita luce micat these are the particular circumstances that usually succeed a shower at that season and yet these are new and untouched by any other writer the carmina quadragesimalia volume the second printed at oxford      from whence this is transcribed page    contain many copies of exquisite descriptive poetry in a genuine classical style see particularly the rivers page   the morning page    the house of care from spenser page    the mohammedan paradise page    the trees of different soils page    the birds nest page    geneva page    virgils tomb page    the indian page     the house of discord page     columbus first discovering the land of the west indies page     etc   these observations on thomson which however would not have been so large if there had been already any considerable criticism on his character might be still augmented by an examination and developement of the beauties in the loves of the birds in spring verse   0 a view of the torrid zone in summer verse     the rise of fountains and rivers in autumn verse     a man perishing in the snows in winter verse     and the wolves descending from the alps and and a view of winter within the polar circle verse  0  which are all of them highly finished originals excepting a few of those blemishes intimated above winter is in my apprehension the most valuable of these four poems the scenes of it like those of il penseroso of milton being of that awful and solemn and pensive kind on which a great genius best delights to dwell  mr pope it seems was of opinion that descriptive poetry is a composition as absurd as a feast made up of sauces and i know many other persons that think meanly of it i will not presume to say it is equal either in dignity or utility to those compositions that lay open the internal constitution of man and that imitate characters manners and sentiments i may however remind such contemners of it that in a sisterart landschapepainting claims the very next rank to historypainting being ever preferred to single portraits to pieces of stilllife to droll figures to fruit and flowerpieces that titian thought it no diminution of his genius to spend much of his time in works of the former species and that if their principles lead them to condemn thomson they must also condemn the georgics of virgil and the greatest part of the noblest descriptive poem extant i mean that of lucretius  we are next to speak of the lyric pieces of pope he used to declare that if mr dryden had finished a translation of the iliad he would not have attempted one after so great a master he might have said with more propriety i will not write a musicode after alexanders feast which the variety and harmony of its numbers and the beauty and force of its images have conspired to place at the head of modern lyric compositions this of mr pope is however indisputably the second of the kind the inferiority of addisons ode to pope on this subject is manifest and remarkable what prosaic tameness and insipidity do we meet with in the following lines cecilias name does all our numbers grace from every voice the tuneful accents fly in soaring trebles now it rises high and now it sinks and dwells upon the base this almost descends to burlesque what follows is hardly rhyme and surely not poetry consecrate the place and day to music and cecilia music the greatest good that mortals know  music can noble hints impart  there follows in this stanza which is the third a description of a subject very trite orpheus drawing the beasts about him pope showed his superior judgment in taking no notice of this old story and selecting a more new as well as more striking incident in the life of orpheus it was the custom of this time for almost every rhymer to try his hand in an ode on st cecilia we find many despicable rapsodies so called in tonsons miscellanies we have therefore also preserved another and an earlier ode of dryden on this subject one stanza of which i cannot forbear inserting in this note it was set to music      by i baptista dragh what passion cannot music raise and quell when jubal struck the chorded shell his listening brethren stood around and wondering on their faces fell to worship that celestial sound less than a god they thought there could not dwell within the hollow of that shell that spoke so sweetly and so well what passion cannot music raise and quell   this is so complete and engaging a historypiece that i knew a person of taste who was resolved to have it executed if an artist could have been found on one side of his salloon in which case said he the painter has nothing to do but to substitute colors for words the design being finished to his hands the reader doubtless observes the fine effect of the repetition of the last line as well as the stroke of nature in making these rude hearers imagine some god lay concealed in this first musicians instrument   propior tamen primo quam tertio to use an expression of quintilian the first stanza is almost a perfect concert of itself every different instrument is described and illustrated in numbers that admirably represent and correspond to its different qualities and genius the beginning of the second stanza on the power which music exerts over the passions is a little flat and by no means equal to the conclusion of that stanza the animating song that orpheus sung to the argonauts copied from valerius flaccus for that of apollonius is of a different nature is the happily chosen subject of the fourth on hearing which each chief his sevenfold shield displayed and half unsheathed the shining blade which effects of the song however lively do not equal the force and spirit of what dryden ascribes to the song of his grecian artist for when timotheus cries out revenge raises the furies and calls up to alexanders view a troop of grecian ghosts that were slain and left unburied inglorious and forgotten each of them waving a torch in his hand and pointing to the hostile temples of the persians and demanding vengeance of their prince he instantly started from his throne  seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy while thais and the attendant princes rushed out with him to set fire to the city the whole train of imagery in this stanza is alive sublime and animated to an unparallelled degree the poet had so strongly possessed himself of the action described that he places it fully before the eyes of the reader  the descent of orpheus into hell is gracefully introduced in the fourth stanza as it naturally flowed from the subject of the preceding one the description of the infernal regions is well imagined and the effects of the musicians lyre on the inhabitants of hell are elegantly translated from the fourth georgic of virgil ver   0 and happily adapted to the subject in question the supplicating song at the beginning of the sixth stanza is highly pathetic and poetical especially when he conjures the powers below by the heros armed shades glittering through the gloomy glades by the youths that died for love wandering in the myrtle grove these images are picturesque and appropriated and these are such notes as might draw iron tears down plutos cheek miltons il penseroso  and make hell grant what love did seek but the numbers that conclude this stanza are of so burlesque and ridiculous a kind and have so much the air of an hudibrastic song at a county election that one is amazed and concerned to find them in a serious ode and in an ode of a writer eminently skilled in general in accommodating his sounds to his sentiments thus song could prevail over death and over hell a conquest how hard and how glorious though fate had fast bound her with styx nine times round her yet music and love were victorious one would imagine that john dennis or some hero of the dunciad had been here attempting to travesty this description of the restoration of eurydice to life it is observable that this is the very measure addison thought was proper to use in the comic character of sir trusty by the introduction of which he has so strangely debased and degraded his opera of rosamond how unhappy is he that is tied to a she and famed for his wit and his beauty for of us pretty fellows our wives are so jealous they never have enough of our duty act i scene ii see also scene iv act i a song of grideline and trusty act iii scene iv  these numbers therefore according to addisons ear conveyed a low and ludicrous idea instead of being expressive of triumph and exultation the images here intended to be impressed by pope  virgil is again imitated throughout the sixth stanza which describes the behavior of orpheus on the second loss of eurydice i wish pope had inserted that striking circumstance so strongly imagined of a certain melancholy murmur or rather dismal shriek that was heard all around the lakes of avernus the moment orpheus looked back on his wife  terque fragor stagnis auditus avernis georgic        and as prosopopeias are a great beauty in lyric poetry surely he should not have omitted those natural and pathetic exclamations of eurydice the moment she was snatched back and which she uttered as she was gradually sinking to the shades especially where she movingly takes her last adieu jamque vale  and adds that she is now surrounded with a vast darkness feror ingenti circumdata nocte and in vain stretching out her feeble arms toward him invalidasque tibi tendens heu non tua palmas ver      this lively and pathetic attitude would have shone under the hands of pope the reader i presume feels the effect of the judicious placing in the verse heu non tua and of its repetition after tibi the places in which orpheus according to pope made his lamentations are not so wild so savage and dismal as those mentioned by virgil to introduce him beside the falls of fountains conveys not such an image of desolation and despair as the caverns on the banks of strymon and tanais the hyperborean deserts and the riphaean solitudes and to say of hebrus only that it rolls in meanders is flat and frigid and does not heighten the melancholy of the place there is an antithesis in the succeeding lines he glows amid rhodopes snows which i hope the poet did not intend as it would be a trivial and puerile conceit the death of orpheus is expressed with a beautiful brevity and abruptness suitable to the nature of the ode hark haemus resounds with the bacchanals cries ah see he dies yet even in death eurydice he sung where instead of sung virgil says vocabat which is more natural and tender and virgil adds a very moving epithet that he called miseram eurydicen i am sensible pope never intended an exact translation of the passages of the georgics here alleged i only hint that in my humble judgment he has omitted some of the most striking incidents in the story i have lately seen a manuscript ode entitled on the use and abuse of poetry in which orpheus in considered in another and a higher light according to ancient mythology as the first legislator and civilizer of mankind i shall here insert a stanza of it containing part of what relates to this subject antistrophe ii such was wise orpheus moral song the lonely cliffs and caves among from hollow oak or mountainden he drew the naked gazing men or where in turfbuilt sheds or rushy bowers they shivered in cold wintry showers or sunk in heapy snows then sudden while his melting music stole with powerful magic over each softening soul society and law and sacred order rose epode ii father of peace and arts he first the city built no more the neighbors blood was by his neighbor spilt he taught to till and separate the lands he fixed the roving youths in hymens myrtle bands whence dear domestic life began and all the charities that softened man the babes that in their fathers faces smiled with lisping blandishments their rage beguiled and tender thoughts inspired  etc i am not permitted to transcribe any more and therefore return to pope again  the beginning of the last stanza of the ode here examined seems to be a repetition of the subject of the second the power of music over the passions which may perhaps be reckoned a blameable tautology especially as these lines music the fiercest grief can charm and fates severest rage disarm music can soften pain to ease and make despair and madness please are inferior i am afraid to the former on the same subject which contain beautiful and poetical personifications melancholy lifts her head morpheus rouses from his bed sloth unfolds her arms and wakes listening envy drops her snakes intestine war no more our passions wage and giddy factions hear away their rage it is observable that this ode of pope and the alexanders feast of dryden both of them conclude with an epigram of four lines a species of wit as flagrantly unsuitable to the dignity and as foreign to the nature of the lyric as it is of the epic muse  it is to be regretted that mr handel has not set to music the former as well as the latter of these celebrated odes in which he has displayed the combined powers of verse and voice to a wonderful degree no poem indeed affords so much various matter for a composer to work upon as dryden has here introduced and expressed all the greater passions and as the transitions from one to the other are sudden and impetuous of which we feel the effects in the pathetic description of the fall of darius that immediately succeeds the joyous praises of bacchus the symphony and air particularly that accompanies the four words fallen fallen fallen fallen is strangely moving the mention of this pathetic air reminds me of a story of the celebrated lully who having been one day accused of never setting any thing to music but the languid verses of quinault was immediately animated with the reproach and as it were seized with a kind of enthusiasm he ran instantly to his harpsichord and striking a few cords sung in recitative these four lines in the iphigenia of racine which are full of the strongest imagery and are therefore much more difficult to express in music than verses of mere sentiment un pretre environne dune foul cruelle portera sur ma fille une main criminelle dechirera son sein et dun oeil curieux dans fon coeur palpitant consultera les dieux one of the company has often declared that they all thought themselves present at this dreadful spectacle and that the notes with which lully accompanied these words erected the hair of their heads with horror  the opinion of boileau concerning music is remarkable he asserts quon ne peut jamais fair un bon opera parceque la music ne sauroit narrer que les passions ny peuvent etre peintes dans toute letendue quelles demandent que dailleurs elle ne sauroit souvent mettre en chant les expressions vraiment sublimes et courageuses   and consists of a few simple and touching notes without any of those intricate variations and affected divisions into which in compliance with a vicious and vulgar taste this great master has sometimes descended even this piece of handel so excellent on the whole is not free from one or two blemishes of this sort particularly in the air with ravished ears etc  the moderns have perhaps practiced no species of poetry with so little success and with such indisputable inferiority to the ancients as the ode which seems owing to the harshness and untuneableness of modern languages abounding in monosyllables and crowded with consonants this particularly is the case of the english whose original is teutonic and which therefore is not so musical as the italian the spanish or even the french as not having so great a quantity of words derived from the latin but the latin language itself as well as all others must yield to the unparalled sweetness and copiousness of the greek tanto est sermo graecus latino jucundior says quintilian in his twelfth book ut nostri poetae quoties dulce carmen esse voluerunt illorum id nominibus exornent he gives some instances that are curious and worth attention quid quod pleraque nos illa quasi mugiente litera cludimus m qua nullum graece verbum cadit at illi n jucundam et in fine praecipue quasi tinnientem illius loco ponunt quae est apud nos rarissime in clausulis

praepositione b literae absonam et ipsam s subjiciendo apply these observations with proper alterations to the english tongue quintil l xii c  0 what line even in the italian poets is so soft and mellifluous as odys        or as in the tender bion  to instance in no more if we cast a transient view over the most celebrated of the modren lyrics we may observe that the stanza of petrarch which has been adopted by all his successors displeases the ear by its tedious uniformity and by the number of identical cadences and indeed to speak truth there appears to be little valuable in petrarch except the purity of his diction his sentiments even of love are metaphysical and far fetched neither is there much variety in his subjects or fancy in his method of treating them metastasio is a much better lyric poet when boileau attempted an ode he exhibited a glaring proof of what will be more fully insisted on in the course of this essay that the writer whose grand characteristical talent is satyric or moral poetry will never succeed with equal merit in the higher branches of this art in his ode on the taking namur are instances of the an instance of the first is to be found in the third stanza of the second in the ninth stanza qui domta lille contrai gand la superbe espagnole saint omer bezancon dole ypres mastricht et cambrai of the third sort is his making a star or comet fatal to his enemies of the white feather which the king usually wore in his hat bombastic of the prosaic and of the puerile and it is no small confirmation of the ruling passion of this author that he could not conclude his ode but with a severe stroke on his old antagonist perrault though the majesty of this species of compositions is so much injured by descending to personal satire the name of malherbe is respectable as he was the first reformer of the french poesy and the first who gave his countrymen any idea of a legitimate ode though his own pieces have hardly any thing but harmony to recommend them the odes of la motte are fuller of delicate sentiment and philosophical reflection than of imagery of figures and poetry there are particular stanzas eminently good but not one entire ode some of rousseau particularly that to fortune and some of his psalms and one or two of voltaire particularly to the king of prussia on his accession to the throne and on meaupertuiss travels to the north to measure the degrees of the meridian toward the equator seem to rise above that correct mediocrity which distinguishes the lyric poetry of the french in this ode of voltaire we find a prosopopeia of americus and afterward a speech of newton on the design of this traveller and his companions that approach to the sublime comme ils parloient ainsi newton dans lempiree newton les regardoit et du ciel entrouvert confirmez disoit il a la terre eclairee ce que jai decouvert i hope i shall not transgress a very sensible observation of mr pope who would have a true critic be still pleased to praise yet not afraid to blame if i should say we have lately seen two or three lyric pieces superior to any he has left us i mean an ode on lyric poetry and another to lord huntingdon by doctor akenside and a chorus of british bards by mr gilbert west at the end of the institution of the order of the garter both these are written with regular returns of the strophe antistrophe and epode which gives a truly pindaric variety to the numbers that is wanting not only to the best french and italian but even to the best latin odes in the pieces here commended the figures are strong and the transitions bold and there is a just mixture of sentiment and imagery and particularly they are animated with a noble spirit of liberty i must refer the reader to the characters of alcaeus and of milton in the two first and to the stanza of mr wests ode on the barons procuring magna charta which i choose to give at length because it contains almost all the different measures of which the english language seems capable on yonder plain along whose willowfringed side the silverfooted naids sportive train down the smooth thames amid the cygnets glide i saw when at thy reconciling word injustice anarchy intestine jarr despotic insolence the wasting sword and all the brazen throats of civil war were hushed in peace from his impetuous throne hurled furious down abashed dismayed like a chased lion to the savage shade of his own forests fell oppression fled with vengeance brooding in his sullen breast then justice fearless raised her decent head healed every grief each wrong redrest while round her valiant squadrons stood and bade her awful tongue demand from vanquished johns reluctant hand the deed of freedom purchased with their blood dodsleys miscellanies vol ii page     see also in the same volume an excellent ode of mr cobb   the next lyric compositions of pope are two choruses inserted in a very heavy tragedy altered from shakespeare by the duke of buckingham in which we see that the most accurate observation of dramatic rules without genius is of no effect these choruses are extremely elegant and harmonious but are they not chargeable with the fault which aristotle imputes to many of euripides that they are foreign and adventitious to the subject and contribute nothing toward the advancement of the main action whereas the chorus ought   to be a part or member of the one whole cooperate with it and help to accelarate the intended event as is constantly adds the philosopher the practice of sophocles whereas these reflections of pope on the baneful influences of war on the arts and learning and on the universal power of love seem to be too general are not sufficiently appropriated do not rise from the subject and occasion and might be inserted with equal propriety in twenty other tragedies this remark of aristotle tho he does not himself produce any examples may be verified from the following among many others in the phoenicians of euripides they sing a long and very beautiful but ill placed hymn to mars i speak of that which begins so nobly   v      o woeful mars why art thou still delighted with blood and with death and why an enemy to the feasts of bacchus and a still more glaring instance may be brought from the end of the third act of the troades in which the story of ganymede is introduced not very artificially v     to these may be added that exquisite ode in praise of apollo descriptive of his birth and victories which we find about the middle of the last act of the iphigenia in tauris v      and seq   on the other hand the choruses of sophocles never desert the subject of each particular drama and all their sentiments and reflections are drawn from the situation of the principal personage of the fable nay sophocles has artfully found a method of making those poetical descriptions with which the choruses of the ancients abound carry on the chief design of the piece and has by these means accomplished what is a great difficulty in writing tragedy has united poetry with propriety in the the subject and scene of this tragedy so romantic and uncommon are highly pleasing to the imagination see particularly his description of his being left in this desolate island v   0 his lamentation for the loss of his bow v    0 and also      and his last adieu to the island   0  one may here observe by the way that the ancients thought bodily pains and wounds etc proper objects to be represented on the stage philoctetes the chorus takes a natural occasion at verse     to give a minute and moving picture of the solitary life of that unfortunate hero and when afterward at verse     pain has totally exhausted the strength and spirits of philoctetes and it is necessary for the plot of the tragedy that he should fall asleep it is then that the chorus breaks out into an exquisite ode to sleep as in the antigone with equal beauty and decorum in an address to the god of love at verse     of that play and thus lastly when the birth of edipus is doubtful and his parents unknown the chorus suddenly exclaims  from which o my son of the immortal gods did thou spring was it some nymph afavourite of pan that haunts the mountains or some daughter of apollo for this god loves the remote rocks and caverns or was it mercury who reigns in cyllene or did bacchus  a god who dwells on the tops of the mountains beget you on any of the nymphs that frequent helicon with whom he frequently sports         the judicious author of the tragedy of elfrida has given occasion to a kind of controversy among the more curious critics concerning the utility of the chorus which after the model of the ancients he has endeavored to revive to imagine that the great grecian masters retained it only out of respect to its antiquity and from no intrinsic valuableness or propriety of the thing can scarcely be imagined the sentiments of the excellent brumoy are moderate and rational and seem to comprehend all that is necessary to be said on this subject i know says he the chorus is attended with inconveniences and that it has sometimes compelled the ancients to violate probability but it notwithstanding is apparent by the use they sometimes made of it that its advantages exceed its inconveniences sophocles had the address to withdraw his chorus for a few moments when their absence was necessary as in the ajax if the chorus therefore incommodes the poet and puts him under difficulties he must charge it solely to his own want of dexterity what advantage on the other hand may he not reap from a body of actors that fill the stage that render more lively striking and sensible the continuity of the action and give it the air of greater probability since it is not natural or conceivable that a great and illustrious action such as a revolution in a state should pass without witnesses we perceive and feel a kind of void on our stage on account of the absence of choruses and the successful attempt of racine who adopted and revived the use of them in his athalia and esther were sufficient one would imagine to undeceive and convince us of their importance and utility the banishment of the chorus has been the necessary consequence of the custom of the moderns to take for their representations all kinds of subjects whereas the ancients treated only such actions as were publicly transacted and to fill and indeed overcharge the action with incidents and surprises for how could these subjects and these various crowded events and incidents have been possibly introduced in a public place exposed to the view of courtiers and the people while the generality of our tragedies turn on particular and private affairs ou la cour et le peuple nentrent souvent pour rien the athenian spectators were ever accustomed to concern themselves in all public affairs and to be witnesses and judges of them the modern stage by its disuse of the chorus may perhaps have gained a great number of fine subjects for tragedy yet in return it is burdened with confidents it looses the continuity of action and is deprived of the magnificent spectacle that serves to support that action and which is if i may be allowed the expression le fonds ou l accompagnement du tableau le theater de grecs tom    0  and       i thought it more equitable as well as more convincing to quote at large the words of this admirable critic whose work is one of the most valuable that his elegant nation has produced than to adopt as some have done with small variations his opinion without acknowledging the debt an apology would be necessary for this digression if it was not my professed design in this essay to expatiate into such occasional disquisitions as naturally arise from the subject it has however kept us too long from surveying a valuable literary curiosity i mean the earliest production of pope written when he was not twelve years old his ode on solitude the first sketches of such an artist ought highly to be prized different geniuses unfold themselves at different periods of life in some minds the ore is a long time in ripening not only inclination but opportunity and encouragement a proper subject or a proper patron influence the exertion or the suppression of genius these stanzas on solitude are a strong instance of that contemplative and moral turn which was the distinguishing characteristic of our poets mind an ode of cowley which he produced at the age of thirteen years is of the same cast and perhaps not in the least inferior to this of pope the voluminous lopez de vega is commonly but i fear incredibly reported by the spaniards to have composed verses when he was five years old and torquato tasso the second of the italian poets for that wonderful original dante is the first is said to have recited poems and orations of his writing when he was seven it is however certain which is more extraordinary that he produced his rinaldo in his eighteenth year no bad precursor to the gierusalemma liberata and no small effort of that genius which was one day to show how fine an epic poem the italian language notwithstanding the vulgar imputation of effeminacy was capable of producing  those who are fond of biographical anecdotes which are some of the most amusive and instructive parts of history will be perhaps pleased with the following particulars in the life of pope he frequently declared that the time of his beginning to write verses was so very early in his life that he could scarcely recall it to his memory when he was yet a child his father who had been a merchant in london and retired to binfield with about twenty thousand pounds would frequently order him to make english verses it seems he was difficult to be pleased see his works vol   page    and would make the lad correct them again and again when at last he approved them he took great pleasure in perusing them and would say these are good rhymes these early praises of a tender and respected parent cooperating with the natural inclination of the son may possibly be the causes that fixed our young bard in a resolution of becoming eminent in this art he was taught to read very early by an aunt and of his own indefatigable industry learned to write by copying printed books which he executed with great neatness and exactness when he was eight years old he was put under the direction of one taverner a priest who taught him the rudiments of the latin and greek tongues together about this time he accidentally met with ogilbys translation of homer which notwithstanding the deadness and insipidity of the versification arrested his attention by the force of the story the ovid of sandys fell next in his way and it is said that the raptures these translations gave him were so strong that he spoke of them with pleasure to the period of his life about ten being now at school at hidepark corner whither he went from a popish seminary at twiford near winchester he was carried sometimes to the playhouse and being struck we may imagine with theatrical representations he turned the chief events into a kind of play made up of a number of speeches from ogilbys translation connected with verses of his own he persuaded the upper boys to act this piece which from its curiosity one would have been glad to have beheld the masters gardener represented the character of ajax and the actors were dressed after the pictures of his favorite ogilby far the best part of that book as they were designed and engraved by artists of note at twelve he retired with his father into windsorforest and it was there he first perused the writings of waller of spenser and of dryden the second is said to have made a poet of cowley that ogilby should give our author his first poetic pleasures is a remarkable circumstance on the first sight of dryden he abandoned the rest having now found an author whose cast was exactly congenial with his own his works therefore he studied with equal pleasure and attention he placed them before his eyes as a model of which more will be said in the course of these papers he copied not only his harmonious versification but the very turns of his periods it was hence he was enabled to give to rhyme all the harmony of which it is capable see works vol   page      about this time that is about fifteen years old he began to write his alcander an epic poem of which he himself speaks with so much amiable frankness and ingenuity in a passage restored to his excellent preface to his works i confess there was a time when i was in love with myself and my first productions were the children of selflvoe upon innocence i had made an epic poem and panegyrics on all the princes of europe and i thought myself the greatest genius that ever was i cannot but regret these delightful visions of my childhood which like the fine colors we see when our eyes are shut are vanished for ever atterbury had perused this early piece and we may gather from one of his letters advised him to burn it though he adds i would have interceeded for the first page and put it with your leave among my curiosities nec placet ante annos vates puer omnia justo tempore proveniant  vidae poet l   i have been credibly informed that some of the anonymous verses quoted as examples of the art of sinking in poetry in the incomparable satire so called were such as our poet remembered from his own alcander so sensible of its own errors and imperfections is a mind truly great  quintilian whose knowledge of human nature was consummate has observed that nothing very correct and faultless is to be expected in very early years from a truly elevated genius that a generous extravagance and exuberance are its proper marks and that a premature exactness is a certain evidence of future flatness and sterility his words are incomparable and worthy consideration lib   instit cap   ad init audeat haec aetas plura et inveniat et inventis gaudeat sint licet illa non satis interim sicca et severa facile remedium est ubertatis sterilia nullo labor vincuntur illa mihi in pueris natura nimium spei dabit in qua ingenium judicio praesumitur materiam esse primum volo vel abundantiorem atque ultra quam oportet fusam multum inde decoquent anni multum ratio limabit aliquid velut usu ipso deteretur sit modo unde excidi possit et quod exculpi erit autem si non ab initio tenuem laminam duxerimus et quam caelatura altior rumpat  quare mihi ne maturitas quidem ipsa festinet nec musta in lacu statim austera sint sic et annos ferent et vetustate proficient this is very strong and masculine sense expressed and enlivened by a train of metaphors all of them elegant and well preserved whether these early productions of pope would not have appeared to quintilian to be rather too finished correct and pure and what he would have inferred concerning them is too delicate a subject for me to enlarge upon let me rather add an entertaining anecdote when guido and domenichino had each of them painted a picture in the church of saint andrew annibal carrache their master was pressed to declare which of his two pupils had excelled the picture of guido represented saint andrew on his knees before the cross that of domenichino represented the flagellation of that apostle both of them in their different kinds were capital pieces and were painted in fresco opposite each other to eternize as it were their rivalship and contention guido said carrache has performed as a master and domenichino as a scholar but added he the worth of the scholar is more valuable than that of the master in truth one may perceive faults in the picture of domenichino that guido has avoided but then there are noble strokes not to be found in that of his rival it was easy to discern a genius that promised to produce beauties to which the sweet the gentle and the graceful guido would never aspire  the last piece that belongs to this section is the ode entitled the dying christian to his soul written in imitation of the well known sonnet of hadrian addressed to his departing spirit concerning which it was our authors judicious opinion that the diminutive epithets with which it abounds such as vagula blandula were by no means expressions of levity and indifference but rather of endearment of tenderness and concern this ode was written we find at the desire of steel and our poet in a letter to him on that occasion says  you have it as cowley calls it just warm from the brain it came to me the first moment i waked this morning yet you will see it was not so absolutely inspiration but that i had in my head not only the verses of hadrian but the fine fragment of sappho in longinus sect  0 quoted by him is a model of that sublime which combines together many various and opposite passions and sensations    it appears however that our author had another composition in his head besides those he here refers to for there is a close and surprising resemblance see the adventurer vol   ii ed p   0 between this ode of pope and one of a very obscure and justly forgotten rhymer of the age of charles the second namely thomas flatman from whose dunghill as well as from the dregs of crashaw has very well translated the dies irae to which translation roscommon is much indebted in his poem on the day of judgment crashaw of carew of herbert and others for it is well known he was a great reader of all those poets pope has very judiciously collected gold and the following stanza is perhaps the only valuable one flatman of whom says lord rochester not that slow drudge in swift pindaric strains flatman who cowley imitates with pains and rides a jaded muse whipped with loose reins  has produced when on my sick bed i languish full of sorrow full of anguish fainting gasping trembling crying panting groaning speechless dying methinks i hear some gentle spirit say be not fearful come away the third and fourth lines are eminently good and pathetic and the climax well preserved the very turn of them is closely copied by pope as is likewise the striking circumstance of the dying mans imagining he hears a voice calling him away vital spark of heavenly flame quit o quit this mortal frame trembling hoping lingering flying has not here any force and does not heighten the sense flying o the pain the bliss of dying hark they whisper angels say sister spirit come away   i am sensible of the difficulty of distinguishing resemblances from thefts and of what a late critic has urged that a want of seeming originality arises frequently not from a barrenness and timidity of genius but from invincible necessity and the nature of things that the works of those who profess an art whose essence is imitation must needs be stamped with a close resemblance to each other since the objects material or animate extraneous or internal which they all imitate lie equally open to the observation of all and are perfectly similar descriptions therefore that are faithful and just must be uniform and alike the first copier may be perhaps entitled to the praise of priority but a succeeding one ought not certainly to be condemned for plagiarism  these general observations however true do not i think extend to the case before us because not only the thoughts but even the words are copied and because the images especially the last are such as are not immediately impressed by sensible objects and which therefore on account of their singularity did not lie in common for any poet to seize let us however moderate the matter and say what perhaps is the real fact that pope fell into the thoughts of flatman unawares and without design and having formerly read him imperceptibly adopted this passage even without knowing that he had borrowed it that this will frequently happen is evident from the following curious particulars related by menage antibaillet tom ii  0  which because much has been said of late on this head by many writers of criticism i shall here insert i have often heard m chapelain and m dandilly declare that they wrote the following line darbires de la paix de foudres de la guerre without knowing it was in malherbe and the moment i am making this remark recollect that the same thing happened to m furetiere i have often heard corneille declare that he inserted in his polyeucte two celebrated lines concerning fortune without knowing they were the property of m godeau bishop of vence et comme elle a leclat du verre elle en a la fragilite    godeau had inserted them in an ode to cardinal richleiu fifteen years before polyeucte was written porphyry in a fragment of his book on philology quoted by eusebius in the tenth book of his evangelical preparation makes mention of an author named aretatedes who composed an entire treatise on this sort of resemblances and st jerome relates that his preceptor donatus explaining that sensible passage in terence nihil est dictum quod non dictum suit prius railed severely at the ancients for taking from his his best thoughts pereant qui ante nos nostra dixerunt  menage makes these observations on occasion of a passage in the poetics of vida intended to justify borrowing the thoughts and even expressions of others which passage is very applicable to the subject before us aspice ut exuvias veterumque insignia nobis aptemus rerum accipimus nunc clara reperta nunc seriem atque animum verborum verba quoque ipsa nec pudet interdum alterius nos ore locutos lib   v      menage adds that he intended to compile a regular treatise on the thefts and imitations of the poets as his reading was very extensive his work would probably have been very entertaining for surely it is no trivial amusement to trace an applauded sentiment or description to its source and to remark with what dryden says prettily of ben johnsons many imitations of the ancients you track him every where in their snow judgment and art it is adapted and inserted provided this be done with such a spirit of modesty and candor as evidently shows the critic intends merely to gratify curiosity and not to indulge envy malignity and a petulant desire of dethroning established see the fruitless and impudent attack of lauder on milton reputations thus for instance says the rambler no     it can scarcely be doubted that in the first of the following passages pope remembered ovid and that in the second the works of cardinal bembo and of casa of annibal caro and tasso himself are full of entire lines taken from dante and petrarch he copied crashaw because there is a concurrence of more resemblances than can be imagined to have happened by chance saepe pater dixit studium quid inutile tentas maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes  sponte sua carmen numeros veniebat ad aptos et quod conabar scribere versus erat ovid i left no calling for this idle trade no duty broke no father disobeyed while yet a child ever yet a fool to fame i lispd in numbers for the numbers came pope  this plain floor believe me reader can say more than many a braver marble can here lies a truly honest man crashaw this modest stone what few vain marbles can may truly say here lies an honest man pope  two other critics have also remarked some farther remarkable coincidencies of popes thought and expressions with those of other writers which are here inserted as they cannot fail of entertaining the curious pride malice folly against dryden rose in various shapes of parsons critics beaus pope lignorance and lerreur a ses naissantes pieces of moliere  en habits de marquis

from grave to gay from lively to severe pope  dune voix legere passer du grave au doux du plaisant au severe boileau the conclusion of the epitaph on gay where he observes that his honor consists not in being entombed among kings and heroes but that the worthy and the good may say striking their pensive bosoms here lies gay is adopted from an old latin elegy on the death of prince henry this conceit of his friends being enshrined in the hearts of the virtuous is by the way one of the most forced and farfetched that pope has fallen into the adventurer no      ben johnson as another ingenious critic has remarked wrote an elegy on the lady anne pawlet marchioness of winton the beginning of which pope seems to have thought of when he wrote his verses to the memory of an unfortunate lady johnson begins his elegy what gentle ghost besprent with april dew hayles me so solemnly to yonder yew and beckoning woes me  in the underwood   in which strain pope beautifully breaks out what beckning ghost along the moonlight shade invites my steps and points to yonder glade it is she  as johnson now lies before me i may perhaps be pardoned for pointing out another passage in him which pope probably remembered when he wrote the following from shelves to shelves see greedy vulcan roll and lick up all their physic of the soul dunciad  thus johnson speaking of a parcel of books these had thou pleased either to dine or sup had made a meal for vulcan to lick up see observations on the faery queen of spenser by thomas warton sect vii p        i should be sensibly touched at the injurious imputation of so ungenerous and indeed impotent a design as that of attempting to diminish or fully the reputation of so valuable a writer as pope by the most distant hint or accusation of his being a plagiary a writer to whom the english poesy and the english language is everlastingly indebted but we may say of his imitations what his poetical father dryden said of another who deserved not such a panegyric so justly as our author he invades authors like a monarch and what would be theft in other poets is only victory in him on dram poesy p    for indeed he never works on the same subject with another without heightening the piece with more masterly strokes and a more artful pencil and as was observed of augustus what he finds merely coarse brick he leaves magnificent marble those who flattered themselves that they should diminish the reputation of boileau by printing in the manner of a commentary at the bottom of each page of his works the many lines he has borrowed from horace and juvenal were grossly deceived the verses of the ancients which this poet has turned into french with so much address and which he has happily made so homogeneous and of a piece with the rest of the work that every thing seems to have been conceived in a continued train of thought by the very same person confer as much honor on m despreaux as the verses which are purely his own the original turn which he gives to his translations il y a du merit a fair un pareil larcin parcequ on ne scauroit le fair bien sans peine and sans avoir du moins le talent de lexpression il faut autant

intellecturos facilius esse herculi clavum quam homero versum surripere donat ed ultraject   0       sect iii of the essay on criticism we are now arrived at a poem of that species for which our authors genius was particularly turned the didactic and the moral it is therefore as might be expected a masterpiece in its kind i have been sometimes inclined to think that the praises addison has bestowed on it spectator no     were a little partial and invidious the observations says he follow one another like those in horaces art of poetry without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose writer it is however certain that the poem before us is by no means destitute of a just integrity and a lucid order each of the precepts and remarks naturally introduce the succeeding ones so as to form an entire whole the ingenious mr hurd has also usefully shown that horace observed a strict method and unity of design in his epistle to the pisones and that although the connexions are delicately fine and almost imperceptible like the secret hinges of a wellwrought box yet they artfully and closely unite each part together and give coherence uniformity and beauty to the work the spectator adds the observations in this essay are some of them uncommon there is i fear a small mixture of ill nature in these words for this essay though on a beaten subject abounds in many new remarks and original rules as well as in many happy and beautiful illustrations and applications of the old ones we are indeed amazed to find such a knowledge of the world such a maturity of judgment and such a penetration into human nature as are here displayed in so very young a writer as was pope when he produced this essay for he was not twenty years old correctness and a just taste are usually not attained but by long practice and experience in any art but a clear head and strong sense were the characteristical qualities of our author and every man soonest displays his radical excellencies if his predominant talent be warmth and vigor of imagination it will break out in fanciful and luxuriant descriptions the coloring of which will perhaps be too rich and glowing if his chief force lies in the understanding rather than in the imagination it will soon appear by solid and manly observations on life or learning expressed in a more chaste and subdued style the former will frequently be hurried into obscurity or turgidity and a false grandeur of diction the latter will seldom hazard a figure whose usage is not already established or an image beyond common life will always be perspicuous if not elevated will never disgust if not transport his readers will avoid the grosser faults if not arrive at the greater beauties of composition the eloquentiae genus for which he will be distinguished will not be the plenum and erectum and audax and praecultum but the pressum and mite and limatum quintil l xi c   in the earliest letters of pope to wycherly to walsh and cromwell we find many admirable and acute judgments of men and books and an intimate acquaintance not only with some of the best greek and roman particularly the latter but the most celebrated of the french and italian classics  du bos sect x   fixes the period of time at which generally speaking the poets and the painters have arrived at as high a pitch of perfection as their geniuses will permit to be the age of thirty years or a few years more or less virgil was near thirty when he composed his first eclogue horace was a grown man when he began to be talked of at rome as a poet having been formerly engaged in a busy military life racine was about the same age when his andromache which may be regarded as his first good tragedy was played corneille was more than thirty when his cid appeared despreaux was full thirty when he published his satires such as we now have them moliere was full forty when he wrote the first of those comedies on which his reputation is founded but to excel in this species of composition it was not sufficient for moliere to be only a great poet but it was more necessary for him to gain a thorough knowledge of men and the world which is seldom attained so early in life but without which the best poet would be able to write but very indifferent comedies raphael was about thirty years old also when he displayed the beauty and sublimity of his genius in the vatican for it is there we behold the first of his works that are worthy the great name he at present so deservedly possesses when our shakespeare wrote his lear milton his paradise lost spenser his fairy queen and dryden his music ode they were all of them past the middle age of man from this short review it appears that few poets ripened so early as pope who seems literally and strictly to have fulfilled the precept of horace in each of it is circumstances multa tulit fecitque puer he was laborious and indefatigable in his pursuits of learning  sudavit et alsit and above all what is of the greatest consequence in preserving each faculty of the mind in due vigor abstinuit venere et vino these are the two temptations to which a youthful bard is principally subject and into whose snares he generally falls if the imagination be lively the passions will be strong true genius seldom resides in a cold and phlegmatic constitution the same temperament and the same sensibility that makes a poet or a painter will be apt to make a man a lover and a debauchee pope was happily secured from falling into these common failings the bane of so many others by the weakness and delicacy of his body and the bad state of his health the sensual vices were too violent for so tender a frame he never fell into intemperance and dissipation may i add that even his bodily make was of use to him as a writer for one who was acquainted with the heart of man and the secret springs of our actions has observed with great penetration  bacons essays    it is good to consider deformity not as a sign which is more deceivable but as a cause which seldom fails of the effect whosoever has any thing fixed in his person that does induce contempt has also a perpetual spur in himself to rescue and deliver himself from scorn i do not think it improbable that this circumstance might animate our poet to double his diligence to make himself distinguished and hope i shall not be accused by those who have a knowledge of human nature of assigning his desire of excellence to a motive too mean and sordid as well as too weak and inefficacious to operate such an effect what crops of wit and honesty appear from spleen from obstinacy hate or fear see anger zeal and fortitude supply even avarice prudence sloth philosophy nor virtue male or female can we name but what will grow on pride or grow on shame essay on man ep ii v      it was another circumstance equally propitious to the studies of pope in this early part of his life that he inherited a fortune that was a decent competence and sufficient to supply the small expenses which both by constitution and reflection he required he had no occasion to distract his thoughts by being sollicitous de lodice paranda he needed not to wait  pour diner le success dun sonnet boileau art poet c    his father retired from business at the revolution to a little convenient box at binfield near oakingham in berkshire see works ver       and having converted his effects into money is said to have brought with him into the country almost twenty thousand pounds as he was a papist he could not purchase nor put his money to interest on real security and as he adhered to the interests of king james he he made a point of conscience not to lend it to the new government for right hereditary taxed and fined he stuck to poverty with peace of mind he therefore kept this sum in his chest and lived upon the principal till by that time his son came to the succession it was almost all fairly spent there was however enough left to supply the occasions of our author he afterward acquired a considerable fortune by his translation of the iliad which was published for his own benefit by a subscription so large that it does honor to this kingdom mr warburton informs us that he sold it to lintot the bookseller on the following terms twelve hundred pounds paid down and all the books for his subscribers the odyssey was published in the same manner and sold on the same conditions except only that instead of twelve he had but six hundred pounds he was assisted in this latter work by broom and fenton to the first of whom he gave six hundred pounds and to the latter three hundred this translation has proved a good estate to the bookseller and to keep him from the two most destructive enemies to a young genius want and dependence i can easily conceive says a late moralist that a mind occupied and overwhelmed with the weight and immensity of its own conceptions glancing with astonishing rapidity from heaven to earth and from earth to heaven cannot willingly submit to the dull drudgery of examining the justness and accuracy of a butchers bill to descend from the widest and comprehensive views of nature and weigh out hops for a brewing must be invincibly disgusting to a true genius to be able to build imaginary palaces of the most exquisite architecture but yet not to pay a carpenters bill is a cutting mortification and disgrace the adventurer no  0   on the other hand opulence and high station would be equally pernicious and unfavourable to a young genius as they would almost unavoidably embarrass and immerse him in the cares the pleasures the indolence and the dissipation that accompany abundance and perhaps the fortune most truly desirable and the situation most precisely proper for a young poet are marked out in that celebrated saying of charles the ninth of france equi et poetae alendi sunt non saginandi  the essay on criticism which occasioned the introduction of these reflections was first i am well informed written in prose according to the precept of vida and the practice of racine quinetiam prius effigiem formare solutis totiusque operis simulacrum fingere verbis proderit atque omnes ex ordine nectere parts et seriem rerum et certos sibi ponere fines per quos tuta regens vestigia tendere pergas poetic lib   ver     when racine had fixed on a subject for a play he wrote down in plain prose not only the subject of each of the five acts but of every scene and every speech so that he could take a view of the whole at once and see whether every part cohered and cooperated to produce the intended event when his matter was thus regularly disposed he was used to say my tragedy is finished  i now propose to make some observations on and illustrations of such passages and precepts in this essay as on account of their utility novelty or elegance deserve particular attention and perhaps i may take the freedom to hint at a few imperfections in this sensible performance i shall cite the passages in the natural order in which they successively occur    in poets as true genius is but rare ver     it is indeed so extremely rare that no country in the succession of many ages has produced above three or four persons that deserve the title the man of rhymes may be easily found but the genuine poet of a lively plastic imagination the true maker or creator is so uncommon a progidy that one is almost tempted to subscribe to the opinion of sir william temple where he says that of all the numbers of mankind that live within the compass of a thousand years for one man that is born capable of making a great poet there may be a thousand born capable of making as great generals or ministers of state as the most renowned in story miscell essay   part   there are indeed more causes required to concur to the formation of the former than of the latter which necessarily render it is production more difficult    true taste as seldom is the critics share v     la bruyere says very sensibly i will allow the good writers are scarce enough but then i ask where are the people that know how to read    let such teach others who themselves excel and censure freely who have written well v     it is somewhere remarked by dryden i think that none but a poet is qualified to judge of a poet the maxim is however contradicted by experience aristotle is said indeed to have written one ode but neither bossu nor hurd are poets the penetrating author of the reflections on poetry painting and music will for ever be read with delight and with profit by all ingenious artists il ne savait pourtant pas la music says voltaire louis    p     il navoit jamais pu fair de verse and navoit pas un tableau mais il avoit beaucoup lu vu entendu and reflechi and lord shaftesbury speaks with some indignation on this subject if a musician performs his part well in the hardest symphonies he must necessarily know the notes and understand the rules of harmony and music but must a man therefore who has an ear and has studied the rules of music of necessity have a voice or hand can no one possibly judge a fiddle but who is himself a fiddler can no one judge a picture but who is himself a layer of colors characteristics v   p   0 quintilian and pliny who speak of the works of the ancient painters and statuaries with so much taste and sentiment handled not themselves either the pencil or the chissel nor longinus nor dionysius the harp but although such as have actually performed nothing in the art itself may not on that account be totally disqualified to judge with accuracy of any piece of workmanship yet perhaps a judgment will come with more authority and force from an artist himself hence the connoisseurs highly prize the treatise of rubens concerning the imitation of antique statues the art of painting by leonardo da vinci and the lives of the painters by vasari as for the same reasons rameaus dissertation on the thorough bass and the introduction to a good taste in music by the excellent but neglected geminiani demand a particular regard the prefaces of dryden would be equally valuable if he did not so frequently contradict himself and advance opinions diametrically opposite to each other some of corneilles discourses on his own tragedies are admirably just and one of the best pieces of modern criticism the academys observations on the cid was we know the work of persons who had themselves written well and our authors own excellent preface to his translation of the iliad one of the best pieces of prose in the english language is an example how well poets are qualified to be critics    some neither can for wits nor critics pass as heavy mules are neither horse or ass those halflearnd witlings numerous in our isle as half formed insects on the banks of nile unfinished things one knows not what to call their generations so equivocal v     these lines and those preceding and following them are excellently satirical and were i think the first we find in his works that give an indication of that species of poetry to which his talent was most powerfully bent and in which though not as we shall see in others he excelled all mankind the simile of the mule heightens the satire and is new as is the application of the insects of the nile pope never shines so brightly as when he is proscribing bad authors    in the soul while memory prevails the solid power of understanding fails where beams of bright imagination play the memorys soft figures melt away v     i hardly believe there is in any language a metaphor more appositely applied or more elegantly expressed than this of the effects of the warmth of fancy lock who has embellished his dry subject with a vast variety of pleasing similitudes and allusions has a passage relating to the retentiveness of the memory so very like this before us and so happily worded that i cannot forbear giving the reader the pleasure of comparing them together only premising that these two passages are patterns of the manner in which the metaphor should be used and of the method of preserving it unmixed with any other idea and not continuing it too far our minds represent to us those tombs to which we are approaching where though the brass and marble remain yet the inscriptions are effaced by time and the imagery moulders away how much the constitution of our bodies are concerned in this and whether the temper of the brain makes this difference that in some it retains the characters drawn on it like marble in others like freestone and in others little better than sand i shall not here enquire though it may seem probable that the constitution of the body does sometimes influence the memory since we sometimes find a disease quite strip the mind of all its ideas and the flames of a fever in a few days calcine all those images to dust and confusion which seemed to be as lasting as if graved in marble essay concerning human understanding chap  0 sect     with respect to the truth of this observation of pope experience abundantly evinceth that the three great faculties of the foul here spoken of are seldom found united in the same person there have yet existed but a few transcendant geniuses who have been singularly blessed with this rare assemblage of different talents all that i can at present recollect who have at once enjoyed in full vigor a sublime and splendid imagination a solid and profound understanding an exact and tenacious memory are herodotus plato tully livy tacitus galilaeo bacon des carts malebranche milton burnet of the charterhouse berkley and montesqueiu bacon in his novum organum divides the human genius into two sorts men of dry distinct heads cool imaginations and keen application they easily apprehend the differences of things are masters in controversy and excel in confutation and these are the most common the second sort are men of warm fancies elevated thought and wide knowledge they instantly perceive the resemblances of things and are poets or makers in science invent arts and strike out new light wherever they page  0 carry their views this general observation has in it all that acuteness comprehension and knowledge of man which so eminently distinguished this philosopher    one science only will one genius fit so vast is art so narrow human wit  not only bounded to peculiar arts but often in those confined to single parts v  0  when tully attempted poetry he became as ridiculous as bolingbroke when he attempted philosophy and divinity we look in vain for that genius which produced the dissertation on parties in the tedious philosophical works of which it is no exaggerated satire to say that the reasoning of them is sophistical and inconclusive the style diffuse and verbose and the learning seemingly contained in them not drawn from the originals but picked up and purloined from french critics and translations and particularly from bail from rapin and thomassin as perhaps may be one day minutely shown together with the assistances that our cudworth and stanley happily afforded a writer confessedly ignorant of the greek tongue who has yet the insufferable i cannot forbear subjoining a passage of an excellent writer and accomplished scholar which is so very apposite to the present purpose that one would think the author had bolingbroke in his eye if his valuable work had not been published before the world was blessed with the first philosophy he who pretends to discuss the sentiments of pythagoras plato aristotle or any one of the ancient philosophers or even to cite and translate him except in trite and obvious sentiments without accurately knowing the greek tongue in general the nice differences of many words apparently synonymous the peculiar style of the author whom he presumes to handle the new coined words and new significations given to old words used by such author and his sect the whole philosophy of such sect together with the connections and dependencies of its several parts whether logical ethical or physical he i say that without this previous preparation attempts what i have said will shoot in the dark will be liable to perpetual blunders will explain and praise and censure merely by chance and though he may possibly to fools appear as a wise man will certainly among the wise ever pass for a fool such a mans intellect comprehends ancient philosophy as his eye comprehends a distant prospect he may see perhaps enough to know mountains from plains and seas from woods but for an accurate discernment of particulars and their character this without farther helps it is impossible he should attain hermes by harris book   chap   page   0 arrogance to vilify and censure and to think he can confute the best writers in that best language  when fontaine whose tales indicated a truly comic genius brought a comedy on the stage it was received with a contempt equally unexpected and undeserved terence has left us no tragedy and the mourning bride of congreve notwithstanding the praises bestowed on it by pope in the dunciad b   v   0 in the notes is certainly a despicable performance the plot is unnaturally intricate and overcharged with incidents the sentiments trite and the language turgid and bombast heemskirk and teniers could not succeed in a serious and sublime subject of historypainting the latter it is well known designed cartoons for tapestry representing the history of the turriani of lombardy both the composition and the expression are extremely indifferent and some nicer virtuosi have remarked that in the serious pieces into which hogarth has deviated from the natural biass of his genius there are some strokes of the ridiculous discernible which suit not with the dignity of his subject in his preaching of st paul a dog snarling at a cat and in his pharaohs daughter the figure of the infant moses who expresses rather archness than timidity are alleged as instances that this artist unrivalled in his own walk could not resist the impulse of his imagination toward drollery his picture however of richard iii is pure and unmixed with any ridiculous circumstances and strongly impresses terror and amazement the modesty and good sense of the ancients is in this particular as in others remarkable the same writer never presumed to undertake more than one kind of dramatic poetry if we except the cyclops of euripides a poet never presumed to plead in public or to write history or indeed any considerable work in prose the same actors never recited tragedy and comedy this was observed so long ago as by plato in the third book of his republic they seem to have held that diversity nay universality of excellence at which the moderns frequently aim to be a gift unattainable by man we therefore of great britain have perhaps more reason to congratulate ourselves on two very singular phenomena i mean shakespeares being able to pourtray characters so very different as falstaff and mackbeth and garricks being able to personate so inimitably a lear or an abel drugger nothing can more fully demonstrate the extent and versatility of these two original geniuses corneille whom the french are so fond of opposing to shakespeare produced very contemptible comedies and the plaideurs of racine is so close a resemblance of aristophanes as it ought not to be here urged the most universal of authors seems to be voltaire who has written almost equally well both in prose and verse and whom either the tragedy of merope or the history of louis xiv would alone have immortalized    those rules of old discovered not devised are nature still but nature methodizd nature like liberty is but restrained by the same laws which first herself ordained ver     the precepts of the art of poesy were posterior to practice the rules of the epopea were all drawn from the iliad and the odyssey and of tragedy from the edipus of sophocles a petulant rejection and an implicit veneration of the rules of the ancient critics are equally destructive of true taste it ought to be the first endeavor of a writer says the excellent rambler no     to distinguish nature from custom or that which is established because it is right from that which is right only because it is established that he may neither violate essential principles by a desire of novelty nor debar himself from the attainment of any beauties within his view by a needless fear of breaking rules where no literary dictator had authority to prescribe the same penetrating and judicious author who always thinks for himself has also another passage too full of strong sense and too apposite to the subject before us to be here omitted  criticism though dignified from the earliest ages by the labors of men eminent for knowledge and sagacity and since the revival of polite literature the favorite study of european scholars has not yet attained the certainty and stability of science the rules that have been hitherto received are seldom drawn from any settled principle or selfevident postulate nor are adapted to the natural and invariable constitution of things but will be found upon examination to be the arbitrary edicts of dictators exalted by their own authority who out of many means by which the same end may be attained selected those which happened to occur to their own reflection and then by an edict which idleness and timidity were willing to obey prohibited any new experiments of wit restrained fancy from the indulgence of her innate inclination to hazard and adventure and condemned all the future flights of genius to pursue the path of the maeonian eagle  the authority claimed by critics may be more justly opposed as it is apparently derived from them whom they endeavor to control for we are indebted for a very small part of the rules of writing to the acuteness of those by whom they are delivered the critics have generally no other merit than that of having read the works of great authors with attention they have observed the arrangement of their matter and the graces of their expression and then expect honor and reverence for precepts which they never could have invented so that practice has introduced rules rather than rules have directed practice  for this reason the laws of every species of writing have been settled by the ideas of him by whom it was first raised to reputation without much enquiry whether his performances were not yet susceptible of improvement the excellencies and the faults of celebrated writers have been equally recommended to posterity and so far has blind reverence prevailed that the number of their books has been thought worthy of imitation no         this liberal and manly censure of critical bigotry extends not to those fundamental and indispensable rules which nature and necessity dictate and demand to be observed such for instance in the higher kinds of poetry that the action of the epopea be one great and entire that the hero be eminently distinguished move our concern and deeply interest us that the episodes arise easily out of the main fable that the action commence as near the catastrophe as possible and in the drama that no more events be crowded together than can be justly supposed to happen during the time of representation or to be transacted on one individual spot and the like but the absurdity here animadverted on is the scrupulous nicety of those who bind themselves to obey frivolous and unimportant laws such as that an epic poem should consist not of less than twelve books that it should end fortunately that in the first book there should be no simile that the exordium should be very simple and unadorned that in a tragedy only three personages should appear at once upon the stage and that a tragedy must consist of five acts by the rigid observation of which last unnecessary precept the poet is deprived of using many a moving story that would furnish matter enough for three perhaps but not for five acts with others of the like nature for the rest as voltaire observes essay sur la poesy epique page     tom   whether the action of an epopea be simple or complex completed in a month or in a year or a longer time whether the scene be fixed to one spot as in the iliad or that the hero voyages from sea to sea as in the odyssey whether he be furious like achilles or pious like eneas whether the action pass on land or sea on the coast of africa as in the luziada of camoens in america as in the araucana of alonzo dercilla in heaven in hell beyond the limits of our world as in the paradise lost all these circumstances are of no consequence the poem will be for ever an epic poem an heroic poem at least till another new title be found proportioned to its merit if you scruple says addison to give the title of an epic poem to the paradise lost of milton call it if you choose a divine poem give it whatever name you please provided you

when indulge our flights ver     in the second part of shaftesburys advice to an author is a judicious and elegant account of the rise and progress of arts and sciences in ancient greece to subjects of which sort it were to be wished this author had always confined himself as he indisputably understood them well rather than that he had blemished and belied his patriotism by writing against the religion of his country i shall give the reader a passage that relates to the origin of criticism which is curious and just when the persuasive arts which were necessary to be cultivated among a people that were to be convinced before they acted were grown thus into repute and the power of moving the affections become the study and emulation of the forward wits and aspiring geniuses of the times it would necessarily happen that many geniuses of equal size and strength though less covetous of public applause of power or of influence over mankind would content themselves with the contemplation merely of these enchanting arts these they would the better enjoy the more they refined their taste and cultivated their ear  hence was the origin of critics who as arts and sciences advanced would necessarily come withal into repute and being heard with satisfaction in their turn were at length tempted to become authors and appear in public these were honored with the name of sophists a character which in early times was highly respected nor did the gravest philosophers who were censors of manners and critics of a higher degree disdain to exert their criticism on the inferior arts especially in those relating to speech and the power of argument and persuasion when such a race as this was once risen twas no longer possible to impose on mankind by what was specious and pretending the public would be paid in no false wit or jingling eloquence where the learned critics were so well received and philosophers themselves disdained not to be of the number there could not fail to arise critics of an inferior order who would subdivide the several provinces of this empire characteristics vol i   mo page         know well each ancients proper character his fable subject scope in every page religion country genius of his age ver      from their inattention to these particulars many critics and particularly the french have been guilty of great absurdities when perrault impotently attempted to ridicule the first stanza of the first olympic of pindar he was ignorant that the poet in beginning with the praises of water   alluded to the philosophy of thales who taught that water was the principle of all things and which philosophy empedocles the sicilian a cotemporary of pindar and a subject of hiero to whom pindar wrote had adopted in his beautiful poem homer and the greek tragedians have been likewise censured the former for protracting the iliad after the death of hector and the latter for continuing the ajax and phoenissae after the deaths of their respective heroes but the censurers did not consider the importance of burial among the ancients and that the action of the iliad would have been imperfect without a description of the funeral rites for hector and patroclus as the two tragedies without those of polynices and eteocles for the ancients esteemed a deprivation of sepulture to be a more severe calamity than death itself it is observable that this circumstance did not occur to pope iliad    note i  when he endeavored to justify this conduct of homer by only saying that as the anger of achilles does not die with hector but persecutes his very remains the poet still keeps up to his subject by describing the many effects of that anger till it is fully satisfied and that for this reason the two last books of the iliad may be thought not to be excrescencies but essential to the poem i will only add that i do not know an author whose capital excellence suffers more from the readers not regarding his climate and country than the incomparable cervantes there is a striking propriety in the madness of don quixote not frequently taken notice of for thuanus informs us that madness is a common disorder among the spaniards

after so many volumes of criticism as have been spent upon them yet the following remarks have a novelty and penetration in them that may entertain especially as the treatise from which they are taken is extremely scarce quae variae inter se notae atque imagines animorum a principibus utriusque populi poetis homero and virgilio mirifice exprimuntur siquidem homeri duces and reges rapacitate

life and writings of homer has taken many observations from this valuable book particularly in his twelfth section     some beauties yet no precepts can declare for there is a happiness as well as care music resembles poetry in each are nameless graces which no methods teach and which a masterhand alone can reach ver      pope in this passage seems to have remembered one of the essays of bacon of which he is known to have been remarkably fond there is no excellent beauty that has not some strangeness in the proportion a man cannot tell whether apelles or albert durer were the more trifler whereof the one would make a personage by geometrical proportions the other by taking the best parts out of diverse faces to make one excellent such personages i think would please nobody but the

track but how can a horse snatch a grace or gain the heart     some figures monstrous and mishapd appear considered singly or beheld too near which but proportioned to their light or place due distance reconciles to time and place ver      by this excellent observation delivered in a beautiful metaphor all the faults imputed to homer may be justified those who censure what is called the

work of marcello every recitative air or chorus is of equal excellence a continued elevation of this kind no author ever came up to nay if we consider that variety which in all arts is necessary to keep up attention we may perhaps affirm with truth that inequality makes a part of the character of excellence that something ought to be thrown into shades in order to make the lights more striking

your design said the other scholar provided you omit the combat in the lists let him have a care of that said don quixote interrupting him that is the best part of the plot but sir quoth the bachelor if you would have me adhere to aristotles rules i must omit the combat aristotle replied the knight i grant was a man of some parts but his capacity was not unbounded and give me leave to tell you his authority does not extend over combats in the list which are far above his narrow rules would you suffer the chaste queen of bohemia to perish for how can you clear her innocence believe me combat is the most honorable method you can pursue and besides it will add such grace to your play that all the rules in the universe must not stand in competition with it well sir knight replied the bachelor for your sake and for the honor of chivalry i will not leave out the combat and that it may appear the more glorious all the court of bohemia shall be present at it from the princes of the blood to the very footmen but still one difficulty remains which is that our common theaters are not large enough for it there must be one erected on purpose answered the knight and in a word rather than leave

forbear mentioning who have been studious of this beauty they are parnelle pit in his translations from vida west in his pindar thomson in the castle of indolence and the author of an elegant ode to summer published in a miscellany entitled the union edinburgh      page         a needless alexandrine ends the song ver      although the alexandrine may be supposed to be a modern measure yet i would remark that it was first used or invented by robert of gloucester whose poem consists entirely of alexandrine verses with the addition of two syllables as does that of warners albions england with many of the lives in the mirror of magistrates and draytons polyolbion most of the psalms of sternhold and hopkins are really written the man is blessed who has not lent to wicked read his ear in this measure though commonly printed otherwise dryden was the first who introduced it in our english heroic for we do not ever find it in sandys or waller     and praise the easy vigor of a line where denhams strength and wallers sweetness join ver   0  fenton in his entertaining observations on waller has given us a curious anecdote concerning the great industry and exactness with which waller published even his smallest compositions when the court was at windsor these verses only ten in number were writ in tasso of her royal highness at mr wallers request by the late duke of buckinghamshire and i very well remember to have heard his grace say that the author employed the greatest part of a summer in composing and correcting them so that however he is generally reputed the parent of those swarms of insectwits who affect to be thought easy writers it is evident that he bestowed much time and care on his poems before he ventured them out of his hands fentons waller edit   mo observations page          true ease in writing comes from art not chance as those move easiest who have learned to dance ver      it is well known that the writings of voiture of sarassin and fontaine cost them much pains and were labored into that facility for which they are so famous with repeated alterations and many rasures moliere is reported to have past whole days in fixing upon a proper epithet or rhyme although his verses have all the flow and freedom of conversation this happy facility said a man of wit may be compared to gardenterraces the expense of which does not appear and which after the cost of several millions yet seem to be a mere work of chance and nature i have been informed that addison was so extremely nice in polishing his prose compositions that when almost a whole impression of a spectator was worked off he would stop the press to insert a new preposition or conjunction     soft is the stream when zephyr gently blows and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows but when loud surges lash the sounding shore the hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw the line too labors and the words move slow not so when swift camilla scours the plain flies over thunbending corn and skims along the main ver      these lines are usually cited as fine examples of adapting the sound to the sense but that pope has failed in this endeavor has been lately demonstrated by the rambler the verse intended to represent the whisper of the vernal breeze must surely be confessed not much to excel in softness or volubility and the smooth stream runs with a perpetual clash of jarring consonants the noise and turbulence of the torrent is indeed distinctly imaged for it requires very little skill to make our language rough but in the lines which mention the effort of ajax there is no particular heaviness or delay the swiftness of camilla is rather contrasted than exemplified why the verse should be lengthened to express speed will not easily de discovered in the dactyls used for that purpose by the ancients two short syllables were pronounced with such rapidity as to be equal only to one long they therefore naturally exhibit the act of passing through a long space in a short time but the alexandrine by its pause in the midst is a tardy and stately measure and the word unbending one of the most sluggish and slow which our language affords cannot much accelerate its motion no         be thou the first true merit to befriend his praise is lost who stays till all commend ver      when thomson published his winter it lay a long time neglected till mr spense made honorable mention of it in his essay on the odyssey which becoming a popular book made the poem universally known thomson always acknowledged the use of this early recommendation and from this circumstance an intimacy commenced between the critic and the poet which lasted till the lamented death of the latter who was of a most amiable benevolent temper     and such as chaucer is shall dryden be ver      waller has an elegant copy of verses on the mutability of the english tongue which bears a strong resemblance to this passage of pope poets that lasting marble seek must carve in latin or in greek we write in sand our language grows and like the tide our work overflows chaucer his sense can only

when the faithful pencil has designed some bright idea of the masters mind when a new world leaps out at his command and ready nature waits upon his hand when the ripe colors soften and unite and sweetly melt into just shade and light where mellowing years their full perfection give and each bold figure just begins to live the treacherous colors the fair art betray and all the bright creation fades away ver      i have quoted these beautiful lines at lenth as i believe nothing was ever so happily expressed on the art of painting a subject of which pope always speaks con amore of all poets whatever milton has spoken most feelingly of music and pope of painting the reader may however compare the following passage of dryden on the same subject more cannot be by mortal art expressed but venerable age shall add the rest for time shall with his ready pencil stand retouch your figures with his ripening hand mellow your colors and imbrown the tint add every grace which time alone can grant to future ages shall your same convey and give more beauties than he takes away dryden to kneller    if pope has so much excelled in speaking in the properest terms of this art it may perhaps be ascribed to his having practiced it the same may be said of milton with respect to music it may perhaps be wondered at that a proficiency in these arts is not now frequently found in the same person i cannot at present recollect any painters that were good poets except salvator rosa and charles vermander of mulbrac in flanders whose comedies are much esteemed but the satires of the former contain no strokes of that fervid and wild imagination so visible in his landschapes     if wit so much from ignorance undergo ver  0   the inconveniences that attend wit are well enumerated in this excellent passage poets who imagine they are known and admired are frequently mortified and humbled boileau going one day to receive his pension and the treasurer reading these words in his order the pension we have granted to boileau on account of the satisfaction his works have given us asked him of what kind were his works of masonry replied the poet i am a builder racine always reckoned the praises of the ignorant among the chief sources of chagrin and used to relate that an old magistrate who had never been at a play was carried one day to his andromaque this magistrate was very attentive to the tragedy to which was added the plaideurs and going out of the theater he said to the author i am extremely pleased sir with your andromaque i am only amazed that it ends so gaily javois dabord en quelque envy de pleurer mais la vue des petits chiens ma fait rire     now they who reach parnassus lofty crown employ their pains to spurn some others down ver      the arts used by addison to suppress the rising merit of pope which are now fully laid open give one pain to behold to what mean artifices envy and malignity will compel a gentleman and a genius to descend it is certain that addison discouraged pope from inserting the machinery in the rape of the lock that he privately insinuated that pope was a tory and a jacobite and had a hand in writing the examiners that addison himself translated the first book of homer published under tickels name and that he secretly encouraged gildon to abuse pope in a virulent pamphlet for which addison paid gildon ten guineas this usage extorted from pope the famous character of atticus which is perhaps the finest piece of satire extant it is said that when racine read his tragedy of alexander to corneille the latter gave him many general commendations but advised him to apply his genius as not being adapted to the drama to some other species of poetry corneille one would hope was incapable of a mean jealousy and if he gave this advice thought it really proper to be given     when love was all an easy monarchs care seldom at council never in a war ver      the dissolute reign of charles ii justly deserved the satirical proscription in this passage under the notion of laughing at the absurd austerities of the puritans it became the mode to run into the contrary extreme and to ridicule real religion and unaffected virtue the king during his exile had seen and admired the splendour of the court of louis xiv and endeavored to introduce the same luxury into the english court the common opinion that this was the augustan age in england is excessively false a just taste was by no means yet formed what was called sheer wit was alone studied and applauded rochester it is said had no idea that there could be a better poet than cowley the king was perpetually quoting hudibras the neglect of such a poem as the paradise lost will for ever remain a monument of the bad taste that prevailed it may be added that the progress of philological learning and of what is called the belle lettres was perhaps obstructed by the institution of the royal society which turned the thoughts of men of genius to physical enquiries our style in prose was but beginning to be polished although the diction of hobbes is sufficiently pure which philosopher and not the florid spratt was the classic of that age if i was to name a time when the arts and polite literature were at their height in this nation i should mention the latter end of king william and the reign of queen anne     with mean complacence never betray your trust nor be so civil as to prove unjust ver      our poet practiced this excellent precept in his conduct toward wycherley whose pieces he corrected with equal freedom and judgment but wycherley who had a bad heart and an insufferable share of vanity and who was one of the professed wits of the lastmentioned age was soon disgusted at this candor and ingenuity of pope insomuch that he came to an open and ungenerous rupture with him     fear not the anger of the wise to raise those best can bear reproof who merit praise ver      the freedom and unreservedness with which boileau and racine communicated their works to each other is hardly to be parallelled of which many amiable instances appear in their letters lately published by the son of the latter particularly in the following jai trouve que la trompette and les sourds etoient trop joues and quil ne falloit point trop appuyer sur votre incommodite moins encore chercher de lesprit sur ce sujet page     see also page         boileau communicated to his friend the first sketch of his ode on the taking namur it is entertaining to contemplate a rude draught by such a master and is no less pleasing to observe the temper with which he receives the objections of racine page     jai deja retouche a tout cela mais je ne veux point lachever que ja naie recu vos remarques qui surement meclaireront encore lesprit the same volume informs us of a curious anecdote that boileau generally made the second verse of a couplet before the first that he declared it was one of the grand secrets of poetry to give by this means a greater energy and meaning to his verses that he advised racine to follow the same method and said on this occasion i have taught him to rhyme difficilement     no place so sacred from such fops is barred nor is pauls church more safe than pauls churchyard nay fly to altars there they will talk you dead for fools rush in where angels fear to tread ver      this stroke of satire is literally taken from boileau gardezvous dimiter ce rimeur furieux qui de ses vains ecrits lecteur harmonieux aborde en recitant quiconque le salve et poursuit de ses verse les passans dans la rue il nest temple si saint des anges respect qui soit contre sa muse un lieu du surete art poet chant iv  which lines allude to the impertinence of a french poet called du perrier who finding boileau one day at church insisted upon repeating to him an ode during the elevation of the host and desired his opinion whether or no it was in the manner of malherbe without this anecdote the pleasantry of the satire would be overlooked it may here be occasionally observed how many beauties in this species of writing are lost for want of knowing the facts to which they allude the following passage may be produced as a proof boileau in his excellent epistle to his gardener at anteuil says mon maitre diroistu pass pour un docteur et parle quelquefois mieux quun predicateur epitre       it seems our the names of corneille and racine being often mentioned in this work it will not be improper to add an ingenious parallel of their respective merits written by fontenelle  i corneille had no excellent author before his eyes whom he could follow racine had corneille ii corneille found the french stage in a barbarous state and advanced it to great perfection racine has not supported it in the perfection in which he found it iii the characters of corneille are true though they are not common the characters of racine are not true but only so far forth as they are common iv sometimes the characters of corneille are in some respects false and unnatural in that they are noble and singular those of racine are often in some respects low on account of their being natural and ordinary v he that has a noble heart would choose to resemble the heroes of corneille he that has a little heart is pleased to find his own resemblance in the heroes of racine vi we carry from hearing the pieces of the one a desire to be virtuous and we carry the pleasure of finding men like ourselves in foibles and weaknesses from the pieces of the other vii the tender and the graceful of racine is sometimes to be found in corneille the grand and sublime of corneille is never to be found in racine viii racine has painted only the french and the present age even when he designed to paint another age and other nations we see in corneille all those ages and all those nations that he intended to paint ix the number of the pieces of corneille is much greater than that of racine corneille notwithstanding has made fewer tautologies and repetitions than racine has made x in the passages where the versification of corneille is good it is more bold more noble and at the same time as pure and as finished as that of racine but it is not preserved in this degree of beauty and that of racine is always equally supported xi authors inferior to racine have written successfully after him in his own way no author not even racine himself dared to attempt after corneille that kind of writing which was peculiar to him this comparison of the justness of which the reader is left to judge is said greatly to have irritated boileau the invariable friend and defender of racine it may be remarked that boileau had mentioned fontenelle with contempt in a stanza that originally concluded his ode to the king at present omitted these were the lines jaime mieux nouvel jcare dans les airs cherchant pindare tomber du ciel le plus haut que love de fontenelle razer craintive hirondelle la terre comme perault this ode was parodied in france but not with such incomparable humor as by our prior in england  to these remarks of fontenelle may be added what voltaire says with his usual vivacity and brevity corneille alone formed himself but louis xiv colbert sophocles and euripides all of them contributed to form racine   author and racine returned one day in high spirits from versailles with two honest citizens of paris as their conversation was full of gaiety and humor the two citizens were vastly delighted and one of them at parting stopped boileau with this compliment i have traveled with doctors of the sorbonne and even with religious but i never heard so many fine things said before en verite vous parlez cent fois mieux quun predicateur  it is but justice to add that the fourteen succeeding verses in the poem before us containing the character of a true critic are superior to any thing in boileaus art of poetry from which however pope has borrowed many observations     the mighty stagyrite first left the shore spread all his sails and durst the deep explore he steered securely and discovered far led by the light of the maeonian star ver      a noble and just character of the first and the best of critics and sufficient to repress the fashionable and nauseous petulance of several impertinent moderns who have attempted to discredit this great and useful writer whoever surveys the variety and perfection of his productions all delivered in the chastest style in the clearest order and the most pregnant brevity is amazed at the immensity of his genius his logic however at present neglected for those redundant and verbose systems which took their rise from lockes essay on the human understanding is a mighty effort of the mind in which are discovered the principal sources of the art of reasoning and the dependencies of one thought on another and where by the different combinations he has made of all the forms the understanding can assume in reasoning which he has traced for it he has so closely confined it that it cannot depart from them without arguing inconsequentially his physics contain many useful observations particularly his history of animals to assist him in which alexander gave orders that creatures of different climates and countries should at a great expense be brought to him to pass under his inspection his morals are perhaps the purest system in antiquity his politics are a most valuable monument of the civil wisdom of the ancients as they preserve to us the description of several governments and particularly of crete and carthage that otherwise would have been unknown but of all his compositions his rhetoric and poetics are most complete no writer has shown a greater penetration into recesses of the human heart than this philosopher in the second book of his rhetoric where he treats of the different manners and passions that distinguish each different age and condition of man and from whence horace plainly took his famous description in the art of poetry ver     la bruyere rochefoucault and montaigne himself are not to be compared to him in this respect no succeeding writer on eloquence not even tully has added any thing new or important on this subject his poetics which i suppose are here by pope chiefly referred to seem to have been written for the use of that prince with whose education aristotle was honored to give him a just taste in reading homer and the tragedians to judge properly of which was then thought no unnecessary accomplishment in the character of a prince to attempt to understand poetry without having diligently digested this treatise would be as absurd and impossible as to pretend to a skill in geometry without having studied euclid the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth chapters wherein he has pointed out the properest methods of exciting terror and pity convince us that he was intimately acquainted with those objects which most forcibly affect the heart the prime excellence of this precious treatise is the scholastic precision and philosophical closeness with which the subject is handled without any address to the passions or imagination it is to be lamented that the part of the poetics in which he had given precepts for comedy did not likewise descend to posterity     horace still charms with graceful negligence and without method talks us into sense ver      the vulgar notion that horace wrote his epistle to the pisos without method has been lately confuted as we hinted before page  0 it is equally false that that epistle contains a complete art of poetry it being solely confined to the state and defects of the roman drama the transitions in the writings of horace are some of the most exquisite strokes of his art many of them pass at present unobserved and that his cotemporaries were equally blind to this beauty he himself complains though with a seeming irony cum lamentamur non apparere labores nostros et tenui deducta poemata filo epist i ver     lib    it seems also to be another common mistake that one of horaces characteristics is the sublime of which indeed he has given a very few strokes and those taken from pindar and probably from alcaeus his excellence lay in exquisite observations on human life and in touching the foibles of mankind with delicacy and urbanity it is easy to perceive this moral turn in all his compositions the writer of the epistles is discerned in the odes elegance not sublimity was his grand characteristic horace is the most popular author of all antiquity the reason is because he abounds in images drawn from familiar life and in remarks that come home to mens business and bosoms hence he is more frequently quoted and alluded to than any poet of a higher cast     see dionysius homers thoughts refine and call new beauties forth from every line ver      these prosaic lines this spiritless elogy are much below the merit of the critic whom they are intended to celebrate pope seems here rather to have considered dionysius as the author only of his little treatise concerning homer and to have in some measure overlooked or at least not to have sufficiently insisted on his most excellent book pepi synthseos onoaton in which he has unfolded all the secret arts that render composition harmonious one part of this discourse i mean from the beginning of the twentyfirst to the end of the twentyfourth section is perhaps one of the most useful pieces of criticism extant he there discusses the three different species of composition which he divides into the nervous and austere the smooth and florid and the middle which partakes of the nature of the two others as examples of the first species he mentions antimachus and empedocles in heroics pindar in lyric aeschylus in tragic poetry and thucydides in history as examples of the second he produces hesiod as a writer in heroics sappho anacreon and simonides in lyric euripides only among tragic writers among the historians ephorus and theopompus and isocrates among the rhetoricians all these says he have used words that are leia chai alaka chai papthenopa the writers which he alleges as instances of the third species who have happily blended the two other species of composition and who are the most complete models of style are homer in epic poetry stesichorus and alcaeus in lyric in tragic sophocles in history herodotus in eloquence demosthenes in philosophy democritus plato and aristotle   0 fancy and art in gay petronius please the scholars learning with the courtiers ease ver      for what merit petronius should be placed among useful critics i could never discern there are not above two or three pages containing critical remarks in his work the chief merit of which is that of telling a story with grace and ease his own style is more affected than even that of his cotemporaries when the augustan simplicity was laid aside many of his metaphors are farfetched and mixed of which this glaring instance may be alleged neque concipere aut edere partum mens potest nisi ingenti flumine literarum inundata page  0  ed amstael      where animal conception and delivery are confounded with vegetable production his character of horace however celebrated horatii curiosa faelicitas is surely a very unclassical inversion for he ought to have called it the happy carefulness of horace rather than his careful happiness i shall observe by the way that the copy of this author found some years ago bears many signatures of its spuriousness and particularly of its being forged by a frenchman for we have this expression ad castella sese receperunt that is to their chateaux instead of ad villas     in grave quintilians copious work we find the justest rules and clearest method joined to commend quintilian barely for his method and to insist merely on this excellence is below the merit of one of the most rational and elegant of roman writers considering the nature of quintilians subject he afforded copious matter for a more appropriated and poetical character no author ever adorned a scientifical treatise with so many beautiful metaphors quintilian was found in the bottom of a tower of the monastery of st gal by poggius as appears by one of his letters dated      written from constance when the council was then sitting the monastery was about twenty miles from that city silius italicus was found at the same time and place     thee bold longinus all the nine inspire and bless their critic with a poets fire ver      this abrupt address to longinus is more spirited and striking and more suitable to the character of the person addressed than if he had coldly spoken of him in the third person the taste and sensibility of longinus were exquisite but his observations are too general and his method too loose the precision of the true philosophical critic is lost in the declamation of the florid rhetorician instead of showing for what reason a sentiment or image is sublime and discovering the secret power by which they affect a reader with pleasure he is ever intent on producing something sublime himself and strokes of his own eloquence instead of pointing out the foundation of the grandeur of homers imagery where he describes the motion of neptune the critic is endeavoring to rival the poet by saying that there was not room enough in the whole earth to take such another step he should have shown why the speech of phaeton to his son in a fragment of euripides was so lively and picturesque instead of which he ardently exclaims would not you say that the soul of the writer ascended the chariot with the driver and was whirled along in the same flight and danger with the rapid horses we have lately seen a just specimen of the genuine method of criticizing in mr harriss accurate discourse on poetry painting and music i have frequently wondered that longinus who mentions tully should have taken no notice of virgil i suppose he thought him only a servile copier of the greeks     from the same foes at last both felt their doom and the same age saw learning fall and rome ver      it was the fate of rome to have scarce an intermediate age or single period of time between the rise of arts and fall of liberty no sooner had that nation begun to lose the roughness and barbarity of their manners and learn of greece to form their heroes their orators and poets on a right model than by their unjust attempt upon the liberty of the world they justly lost their own with their liberty they lost not only their force of eloquence but even their style and language itself the poets who afterward arose among them were mere unnatural and forced plants their two most finished who came last and closed the scene were plainly such as had seen the days of liberty ann felt the sad effects of its departure advice to an auth vol i     edit   mo   shaftesbury proceeds to observe that when despotism was fully established not a statue picture or medal not a tolerable piece of architecture afterward appeared  and it was i may add the opinion of longinus and addison who adopted it from him that arbitrary governments were pernicious to the fine arts as well as to the sciences modern history however has afforded an example to the contrary painting sculpture and music have been seen to arrive to a high perfection in rome notwithstanding the slavery and superstition that reign there nay superstition itself has been highly productive of these fine arts for with what enthusiasm must a popish painter work for an altarpiece neither dante ariosto or tasso flourished in free governments and it seems see enquiry into the life and writings of homer sect iv chimerical to assert that milton would never have written his paradise lost if monarchy had then remained michael angelo raphael and julio romano lived in despotic states the fine arts in short are naturally attendant upon power and luxury but the sciences require unlimited freedom to raise them to their full vigor and growth in a monarchy there may be poets painters and musicians but orators historians and philosophers can exist in a republic alone     a second deluge learning thus oerrun and the monks finished what the goths begun ver      every custom and opinion that can degrade and deform humanity was to be found in the times here alluded to the most cruel tyranny and the grossest superstition reigned without control men seemed to have lost not only the light of learning but of their common reason duels divinations the ordeal and all the oppressive customs of the feudal laws were universally practiced witchcraft possessions revelations and astrology even so late as the reign of charles v we are informed by christina of pisa that her father who

considerable sum for that time were generally believed the they celebrated in many churches particularly at rouen what was called the feast of the ass on this occasion the ass finely dressed was brought before the altar and they sung before him this elegant anthem  eh eh eh sire ane eh eh eh sire ane clergy were so ignorant that in some of the most solemn acts of synods such words as these

sister or wife or had committed the most enormous pollutions on a survey of these absurd abominations one is apt to cry out in the emphatical words of lucretius quae procul a nobis flectat fortuna

method was made use of till the year    0 when they began to place a pendulum instead of the balance can it scarcely be believed says mr henault that there ever was so little intercourse between the provinces of france that an abbot of clugni being invited by bouchard count of paris to bring his religious to st maurdesfosses excused himself from making so long a journey into a country unknown and

civilize his barbarous subjects was as arduous and worthy his great genius as his noble project to open a communication between the ocean and the euxine sea and to join the rhine to the danube by a canal     at length erasmus that great injured name the glory of the priesthood and the shame stemd the wild torrent of a barbarous age and drove those holy vandals off the stage ver      it were to be wished our author had drawn a larger and fuller portrait of this wonderful man of whom he appears to have been so fond as to declare in the letters vol   page     that he had some design of writing his life in latin i call erasmus a wonderful man not only on account of the variety and classical purity of his works but of that penetration that strong and acute sense which enabled him to pierce through the absurdities of the times and expose them with such poignant ridicule and attic elegance a work of humor and of humor directed to expose the priests in that age was indeed a prodigy the irony of the encomium on folly has never been excelled erasmus though a commentator had taste and though a catholic had charity his learning was enlivened with wit and his orthodoxy was tempered with moderation he was never dazzled with what was called erudition or misled by that blind and undistinguishing veneration which was naturally paid to the ancients on the first discovery of their writings by his ciceronianus he repressed the affectation of imitating tullys manner of expression in every species of composition in his ecclesiastes very excellent rules are laid down for preaching in his dialogues the superstitions of the romish church are exposed with all the pleasantry of lucian an author to whom his genius bore great resemblance and some of whose dialogues he has translated with their original spirit indeed among the many translators of greek authors who flourished at that time erasmus seems to have been in all respects the most eminent to him was the restoration of literature principally owing more than one prince solicited his friendship and invited him to their courts we see in a letter of erasmus written in the year      that francis i who shared with leo x the glory of reviving sciences and arts in europe having declared to petit his confessor that he intended to bring into france the most learned men he could find petit had charged budaeus and cop the royal physician to write to erasmus to engage him to settle in france that stephen poncher ambassador from the king at brussels pressed him still more but that erasmus made his excuses because his catholic majesty charles v had retained him in the low countries the life of erasmus which deserves the finest pen has been wretchedly and frigidly written by knight although indeed the materials he has collected are curious and useful     but see each muse in leos golden days starts from her trance and trims her withered bays romes ancient genius over its ruins spread shakes off the dust and rears his reverend head ver      history has recorded five ages of the world in which the human mind has exerted itself in an extraordinary manner and in which it is productions in literature and the fine arts have arrived at a perfection not equalled in other periods the first is the age of philip and alexander about which time flourished socrates plato demosthenes aristotle lysippus apelles phidias praxiteles thucydides xenophon aeschylus euripides sophocles aristophanes menander philemon the second age which has never yet been sufficiently taken notice of was that of ptolomy philadelphus king of egypt in which appeared lycophron aratus nicander apollonius rhodius theocritus callimachus eratosthenes philichus erisistratus the physician timaeus the historian cleanthes diogenes the painter and sostrates the architect this prince from his love of learning commanded the old testament to be translated into greek the third age is that of julius caesar and augustus marked with the illustrious names of laberius catullus lucretius cicero livy varro virgil horace propertius tibullus ovid phaedrus vitruvius dioscorides the fourth age was that of julius ii and leo x which produced ariosto tasso fracastorius sannazarius vida bembo sadolet machiavel guiccardin michael angelo raphael titian the fifth age is that of louis xiv in france and of king william and queen anne in england in which or thereabouts are to be found corneille moliere racine boileau fontaine bossuet rochefoucault paschal bourdaloue patru malbranche de retz bruyere st real fenelon lully le

clarke kneller thornill jervas dahl purcell mead friend  concerning the particular encouragement given by leo x to polite literature and the fine arts i forbear to enlarge because a friend of mine is at present engaged in writing the history of the age of leo x it is a noble period and full of those most important events which have had the greatest influence on human affairs such as the discovery of the west indies by the spaniards and of a passage to the east by the portugueze the invention of printing the reformation of reliligion with many others all which will be insisted upon at large and their consequences displayed i shall only here transiently observe that some efforts to emerge from barbarity had long before this time appeared in italy dante wrote his sublime see particularly the beginning of the third canto of the inferno as also the beginning of the sixth and original poem which is a kind of satirical epic and which abounds in images and sentiments equal to the best of homer but whose works he had never seen about the year    0 giotto the disciple of cimabue the friend of dante and subject of his praises was employed about the same time by benedict xi and a picture of mosaic work done by him over the gate of st peters church at rome is still remaining a tuscan called guy of arezzo invented the musical notes in use at present and bruneleschi built palaces at

acute searcher into antiquity whose death is justly lamented the learned scipio maffei has informed us teatro italiano in verona      tom i page   in a curious passage that this was not so much owing to petrarch as to albertino mussato a native of padua with whose merit the learned seem not to be sufficiently acquainted mussato died very old after having borne the greatest offices in his country in the year      that is to say thirtyfive years before petrarch he wrote not only many books of a history of his own times but also an heroic poem on the siege of padua by the veronese under the great can together with eclogues elegies epistles in verse and an ovidian cento however to form a full judgment in this case one need only peruse his two latin tragedies entitled eccerinis and achilles which he composed in the style and manner of seneca and which were the first regular and perfect dramas that are to be found since the barbarous and obscure ages     immortal vida on whose honored brow the poets bays and critics ivy grow ver  0   the merits of vida seem not to have been particularly attended to in england till pope had bestowed this commendation upon him although the poetics had been correctly published at oxford by basil kennet some time before the silkworms of vida are written with classical purity and with a just mixture of the styles of lucretius and virgil it was a happy choice to write a poem on chess quest ce quun grand captain un homme admire de beaucoup inferieur a un grand joueur dechechs qui ne lest pas mes pensees ccxlii  nor is the execution less happy the various stratagems and manifold intricacies of this ingenious game so difficult to be described in latin are here expressed with the greatest perspicuity and elegance so that perhaps the game might be learnt from this description amidst many prosaic flatnesses there are many fine strokes in the christiad particularly his angels with respect to their persons and insignia are drawn with

of sophronia and olindo so commonly censured e rispondendogli io liberamente si come soglio egli na fatto un volume e mandato al signior scipio gonzaga per cosa sua e non mia ma io ne chiariro il mondo     and boileau still in right of horace sways ver      may i be pardoned for declaring it as my opinion that boileaus is the best it was translated into portugueze verse by count dericeyra art of poetry extant the brevity of his precepts enlivened by proper imagery the justness of his metaphors the harmony of his numbers as far as alexandrine lines will admit the exactness of his method the perspicacity of his remarks and the energy of his style all duly considered may render this opinion not unreasonable it is scarcely to be conceived how much is comprehended in four short cantos it is remarkable boileau declared he had never read vida he that has well digested these cannot be said to be ignorant of any important rule of poetry the tale of the physician turning architect in the fourth canto is told with vast pleasantry it is to this work boileau owes his immortality which was of the highest utility to his nation in diffusing a just way of thinking and writing banishing every species of false wit and introducing a general taste for the manly simplicity of the ancients on whose writings this poet had formed his taste boileaus chief talent was the didactic his fancy was not the predominant faculty of his mind fontenelle has thus characterised him il etoit grand et excellent versificateur pourvu cependant que cette louange se renferme dans ses beaux jours dont la difference avec les autres est bien marquee et faisoit souvent dire helas et hola mais il netoit pas grand poet si lentend par ce mot comme on le doit celui qui fait qui invente qui cree oevres de fontenelle tom   page     a paris           such was the muse whose rules and practice tell  natures chief masterpiece is writing well ver      this high panegyric procured to pope the acquaintance and afterward the constant friendship of the duke of buckingham who in his essay here alluded to has followed the method of boileau in discoursing on the various species of poetry to no other purpose than to manifest his own inferiority the piece is indeed of the satyric rather than of the preceptive kind the coldness and neglect with which this writer formed only on the french critics speaks of milton must be considered as proofs of his want of critical discernment or of critical courage i can recollect no performance of buckingham that stamps him a true genius his reputation was owing to his rank in reading his poems one is apt to exclaim with our author what woeful stuff this madrigal would be in some starved hackney sonnetteer or me but let a lord once own the happy lines how the wit brightens how the style refines before his sacred name flies every fault and each exalted stanza teems with thought   the best part of buckinghams essay is that in which he gives a ludicrous account of the plan of a modern tragedy i should add that his compliment to pope prefixed to his poems contains a pleasing picture of the sedateness and retirement proper to age after the tumults of public life and by it is moral turn breathes the spirit if not of a poet yet of an amiable old man   0 such was roscommon ver      an essay on translated verse seems at first sight to be a barren subject yet roscommon has decorated it with may precepts of utility and taste and enlivened it with a tale in imitation of boileau it is indisputably better written than the lastmentioned essay roscommon was more learned than buckingham he was bred under bochart at caen in normandy he had laid a design of forming a society for the refining and fixing the standard of our language in which project his intimate friend dryden was a principal assistant this was the first attempt of that sort and i fear we shall never see another set on foot in our days even though mr johnson has lately given us so excellent a dictionary it may be remarked to the praise of roscommon that he was the first critic who had taste and spirit enough publicly to praise the paradise lost with a noble encomium of which and a rational recommendation of blank verse he concludes his performance fenton in his observations on waller has accurately delineated his character his imagination might have probably been more fruitful and sprightly if his judgment had been less severe but that severity delivered in a masculine clear succinct style contributed to make him so eminent in the didactical manner that no man with justice can affirm he was ever equalled by any of our own nation without confessing at the same time that he is inferior to none in some other kinds of writing his genius seems to have wanted fire to attain the point of perfection but who can attain it edit   mo page          such late was walsh the muses judge and friend ver   0  if pope has here given too magnificent an elogy to walsh it must pardonably be attributed to friendship rather than to judgment walsh was in general a flimzy and frigid writer the rambler calls his works pages of inanity his three letters to pope however are well written his remarks on the nature of pastoral poetry on borrowing from the ancients and against florid conceits are worthy perusal vol   page    etc  pope owed much to walsh it was he who gave him a very important piece of advice in his early youth for he used to tell our author that there was one way still left open for him by which he might excel any of his predecessors which was by correctness that though indeed we had several great poets we as yet could boast of none that were perfectly correct and that therefore he advised him to make this quality his particular study  correctness is a vague term frequently used without meaning and precision it is perpetually the nauseous cant of the french critics and of their advocates and pupils that the english writers are generally incorrect if correctness implies an absence of petty faults this perhaps may be granted if it means that because their tragedians have avoided the irregularities of shakespeare and have observed a juster economy in their fables that therefore the athalia for instance is preferable to lear the notion is groundless and absurd the henriade is free from any very gross faults but who will dare to rank it with the paradise lost the declamations with which some of their most perfect tragedies abound may be reckoned as contrary to the nature of that species of poetry and as destructive of it is end as the fools or gravediggers of shakespeare that the french may boast some excellent critics particularly bossu boileau fenelon and brumoy cannot be denied but that they are sufficient to form a taste upon without having recourse to the genuine fountains of all polite literature i mean the grecian writers no one but a superficial sciolist can allow   i conclude these reflections with a remarkable fact in no polished nation after criticism has been much studied and the rules of writing established has any very extraordinary work ever appeared this has visibly been the case in greece in rome and in france after aristotle horace and boileau had written their arts of poetry in our own country the rules of the drama for instance were never more completely understood than at present yet what uninteresting though faultless tragedies have we lately seen so much better is our judgment than our execution how to account for the fact here mentioned adequately and justly would be attended with all those difficulties that await discussions relative to the productions of the human mind and to the delicate and secret causes that influence them whether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated by that timidity and caution which is occasioned by a regard to the dictates of art or whether that philosophical that geometrical and systematical spirit so much in vogue which has spread itself from the sciences even into polite literature by consulting only reason has not diminished and destroyed sentiment and made our poets write from and to the head rather than the heart or whether lastly when just models from which the rules have necessarily been drawn have once appeared succeeding writers by ambitiously endeavoring to surpass those just models and to be original and new do not become distorted and unnatural in their thoughts and diction  sect iv of the rape of the lock if the moderns have excelled the ancients in any species of writing it seems to be in satire and particularly in that kind of satire which is conveyed in the form of the epopee a pleasing vehicle of satire never used by the ancients as the poet disappears in this way of writing and does not deliver the intended censure in his own proper person the satire becomes more delicate because more oblique add to this that a tale or story more strongly engages and interests the reader than a series of precepts or reproofs or even of characters themselves however lively and natural an heroicomic poem may therefore be justly esteemed the most excellent kind of satire  the invention of it is usually ascribed to alessandro tassoni who in the year      published at paris a poem composed by him in a few months of the year      entitled la secchia rapita or the rape of the bucket to avoid giving offense it was first printed under the name of androvini melisoni it was afterward reprinted at venice corrected with the name of the author and with some illustrations of gasparo salviani but the learned and curious crescembini in his istoria della volgar poesia lib i page    in roma per il chracas school informs us that it is doubtful whether the invention of the e tal poesia puo diffinirsi e chiamarsi immitazione dazione seria fatto con riso crescembini ibid heroicomic poem ought to be ascribed to tassoni or to francesco bracciolini who wrote lo scherno de gli dei which performance though it was printed four years after la secchia is nevertheless declared in an epistle prefixed to have been written many years sooner the real subject of tassonis poem was the war which the inhabitants of modena declared against those of bologna on the refusal of the latter to restore to them some towns which had been detained ever since the time of the emperor frederic ii the author artfully made use of a popular tradition according to which it was believed that a certain wooden bucket which is kept at modena in the treasury of the cathedral came from bologna and that it had been forcibly taken away by the modenese crescembini adds that because tassoni had severely ridiculed the bolognese bartolomeo bocchini to revenge his countrymen printed at venice mdcxli a tragicoheroicomic poem entitled le pazzie de savi overo il lambertaccio in which the modenese are spoken of with much contempt the italians have a fine turn for works of humor in which they abound they have another poem of this species called malmantile racquistato written by lorenzo lippi in the year mdclxxvi which crescembini page     lib   highly commends calling it spiritosisimo e legiadrissimo poema giacoso it was afterward reprinted at florence mdclxxxviii with the useful annotations of puccio lamoni a florentine painter who was himself no contemptible poet  the lutrin of boileau was the second remarkable poem in which the serious and comic were happily blended boileau himself has given a circumstantial account of what gave occasion to this poem which account because it is entertaining and not printed in the common editions of his works i will insert at length i shall not here act like ariosto who frequently when he is going to relate the most absurd story in the world solemnly protests it to be true and supports it by the authority of archbishop turpin for my part i freely declare the whole poem of the desk is nothing but pure fiction that it is all invented even to the name itself of the place where the action passes an odd occasion gave rise to this poem in a company i was lately engaged in the conversation turned upon epic poetry every one delivered his opinion according to his abilities when mine was asked i confirmed what i had advanced in my art of poetry that an heroic poem to be truly excellent ought to be charged with little matter which it was the business of invention to support and extend the opinion was warmly contested but after many reasons for and against it happened as it generally does in this sort of disputes that nobody was convinced and that each continued in his own opinion the heat of dispute being over we talked on other subjects and laughed at the violence into which we had been betrayed in discussing a question of so little consequence we moralized on the folly of men who pass almost their whole lives in treating the greatest trifles in a serious manner and in making to themselves an important affair of something quite indifferent to this purpose a country gentleman related a famous quarrel that had lately happened in a little church in his province between the treasurer and the chantor the two principal dignitaries of that church about the place in which a readingdesk was to stand we thought it a droll affair upon this one of the critics in company who could not so soon forget our late dispute asked me if i who thought so little matter necessary for an heroic poem would undertake to write one on a quarrel so little abounding in incidents as this of the two ecclesiastics jeus plutot dit pourquoi non que je neus fait reflection sur ce quil me demandoit this made the company laugh and i could not help laughing with them not in the least imagining that i should ever be able to keep my word but finding myself at leisure in the evening i revolved the subject in my mind and having considered in every view the pleasantry that it would admit of i made twenty verses which i showed to my friends they were diverted with this beginning the pleasure which i saw these gave them induced me to write twenty more thus from twenty verses to twenty i lengthened the work to near nine hundred this is the whole history of the trifle i now offer to the public  this is a new kind of burlesque which i have introduced into our language for as in the other kind of burlesque that of scarron dido and aeneas spoke like fishwomen and porters in this of mine a altered afterward to a barber clockmaker and his wife talk like dido and aeneas i do not know whether my poem will have all the qualities requisite to satisfy a reader but i dare flatter myself that it will at least be allowed to have the grace of novelty because i do not conceive that there are any works of this nature in our language the defaites des bouts rimes of sarasin being rather a mere allegory than a poem as this is  on a subject seemingly so unpromising and incapable of ornament has boileau found a method of raising a poem full of beautiful imagery which appears like that magnificent city petersburg which the greatest of princes caused to be built in a morass boileau has enlivened this piece with many unexpected incidents and entertaining episodes maxima de nihilo nascitur historia prop particularly that of the perruquier in the second canto and of the battle of the books in the fifth the satire throughout is poignant though polite to the last degree the indolence and luxury of the priests are ridiculed with the most artful delicacy what a picture has he drawn of the chamber and bed of the treasurer where

chant      his knowledge of the rents of his church and of the mortgages belonging to it his scorn of the pious and laborious arnauld his contempt of learning and above all his ruling passion of goodeating are strokes highly comic it is wonderful the ecclesiastics of france were not as much irritated by the publication of the lutrin as by the tartuffe of moliere which was suppressed by their interest after it had been acted a few nights although at the same time a very profane farce was permitted to have a long run when louis xiv expressed to the prince of conde his wonder at the different fates of these two pieces and asked the reason of it the prince answered in the farce religion only is ridiculed but moliere in the tartuffe has attacked even the priests  boileau has raised his subjects by many personifications particularly in the beginning of the sixth canto piety who had retired to the great carthusian monastery on the alps is introduced as repairing to paris accompanied by faith hope and charity in order to make her complaint to themis to which may be added the monstrous figure of chicanery attended by famine want sorrow and ruin in the beginning of the fifth canto the chief divinity that acts throughout the poem is discord which goddess is represented as coming from a convent of cordeliers a fine stroke of satire but imitated from the satirical ariosto who makes michael find discord in a cloister instead of silence whom he there searched for in vain night is also introduced as an actress with great propriety in the third canto where she repairs to the famous old tower at montlery in order to find out an owl which she may convey into the desk and which afterward produces so ridiculous a consternation sloth is another principal personage she also is discovered in the dormitory of a monastery les plaisirs nonchalans soletrent a lentour lun paitrit dans un coin lembonpoint des chanoines lautre broie en riant le vermillon des moines chant    the speech she afterward makes has a peculiar beauty as it ends in the middle of a line and by that means shows her inability to proceed  the third heroicomic poem was the dispensary of garth a palpable imitation of the lutrin and the best satire on the phisicians extant except the sangrado of le sage who have indeed been the object of almost every satirist the behavior and sentiment of sloth the first imaginary being that occurs are almost literally translated from boileau particularly the compliment that sloth pays to king william whose actions disturb her repose or if some cloysters refuge i implore where holy drones over dying tapers sore the peals of nassaus arms these eyes unclose mine he molests to give the world repose cant    je croyois loin des lieux don ce prince mexile que leglise du moins massuroit un azile mais envain jesperois y regner sans effroi moines abbes prieurs tout sarme contre moi chant    garth in ridiculing the clergy speaks of that order with more acrimony than boileau who merely laughs at them but garth was one of the freethinking wits at buttons he has introduced many excellent parodies of the classics among which i cannot forbear quoting one which is an imitation of some passages which the reader will remember in virgils sixth book and where the circumstances are happily inverted boileau says admirably of his phisician chant   art poet le rhume a son aspect se change en pleurisy et par lui la migraine est bientot phrenesie  since said the ghost with pity you will attend know i am guiacum once your firmest friend and on this

repose this wants his palate that demands his nose and here they execute stern plutos will and ply me every moment with a pill cant      this author has been guilty of a strange impropriety which cannot be excused in making the fury disease talk like a critic give rules of writing and a panegyric on the best poets of the age cant    the descent into the earth in the sixth canto is a fine mixture of poetry and philosophy the hint is taken from the syphilis of fracastorius garths versification is flowing and musical his style perspicuous and neat and the poem in general abounds with sallies of wit and nervous satire  the rape of the lock now before us is the fourth and most excellent of the heroicomic poems the subject was a quarrel occasioned by a little piece of gallantry of lord petre who in a party of pleasure found means to cut off a favorite lock of mrs arabella fermours hair pope was desired to write it in order to put an end to the quarrel it produced by mr caryl who had been secretary to queen mary author of sir solomon single a comedy and of some translations in drydens miscellanies pope was accustomed to say what i wrote fastest always pleased most the first sketch of this exquisite piece which addison called merum sal was written in less than a fortnight in two cantos only but it was so universally applauded that in the next year our poet enriched it with the machinery of the sylphs and extended it to five cantos when it was printed with a letter to mrs fermour far superior to any of voiture the insertion of the machinery of the sylphs in proper places without the least appearance of it is being aukwardly stitched in is one of the happiest efforts of judgment and art he took the idea of these invisible beings so proper to be employed in a poem of this nature from a little french book entitled le comte de gabalis of which i have lately met with an account in an entertaining writer the abbe villars who came from thoulouse to paris to make his fortune by preaching is the author of this diverting work the five dialogues of which it consists are the result of those gay conversations in which the abbe was engaged a la port de richelieu with a set of men of fine wit and humor like himself when this book first appeared it was universally read as innocent and amusing but at length it is consequences were perceived and reckoned dangerous at a time when this sort of curiosities began to gain credit our devout preacher was denied the chair and his book forbidden to be read it was not clear whether the author intended to be ironical or spoke all seriously the second volume which he promised would have decided the question but the unfortunate abbe was soon afterward assassinated by ruffians on the road to lions the laughers gave out that the gnomes and sylphs disguised like ruffians had shot him as a punishment for revealing the secrets of the cabala a crime not to be pardoned by these jealous spirits as villars himself has declared in his book melanges dhistoire et de literature by dom noel dargonne disguised under the name of vigneul marville tom prem page     edit roterdam   00  it may not be improper to give a specimen of this authors manner who has lately been well imitated in the way of mixing jest with earnest in an elegant piece called hermippus redivivus the comte de gabalis being about to initiate his pupils into the most profound mysteries of the rosicrusian philosophy advises him to consider seriously whether or no he had courage and resolution sufficient to renounce all those obstacles which might prevent his arising to that height which the figure of his nativity promised le mot de renoncer says the scholar meffraya et je ne doutay point quil nallast me proposer de

diligent perusal of this book i cannot find that pope has borrowed any particular circumstances relating to these spirits but merely the general idea of their existence  these machines are vastly superior to the allegorical personages of boileau and garth not only on account of their novelty but for the exquisite poetry and oblique satire which they have given the poet an opportunity to display the business and petty concerns of a fine lady receive an air of importance from the notion of their being perpetually overlooked and conducted by the interposition of celestial agents  it is judicious to open the poem by introducing the guardian sylph warning belinda against some secret impending danger the account which ariel cant   ver    to ver     gives of the nature office and employment of these inhabitants of air is finely fancied into which several strokes of satire are thrown with great delicacy and address think what an equipage thou have in air and view with scorn two pages and a chair the transformation of women of different tempers into different kinds of spirits cannot be too much applauded these images have been lately expressed in latin with much purity and elegance and deserve to be here inserted mortua lascivum resoluta liquescit in ignem aut abit in molles singula nympha notos aethereosque trahens haustus tenuissima turba versat ad aestivum lucida

description of the cant   ver     toilette which succeeds is judiciously given in such magnificent turns as dignify the offices performed at it belinda dressing is painted in as pompous a manner as achilles arming the canto ends with a circumstance artfully contrived to keep this beautiful machinery in the readers eye for after the poet has said that the fair heroine repairs her smiles awakens every grace and calls forth all the wonders of her face cant   ver      he immediately subjoins the busy sylphs surround their darling care these set the head and those divide the hair some fold the sleeve whilst others plait the gown and bettys praised for labors not her own   the mention of the lock cant   ver     on which the poem turns is rightly reserved to the second canto the sacrifice of the baron to implore success to his undertaking is another instance of our poets judgment in heightening the subject cant   ver     the succeeding scene of sailing upon the thames is most gay and riant and impresses the most pleasing pictures upon the imagination here too the machinery is again introduced with much propriety ariel summons his denizens of air who are thus painted with a rich exuberance of fancy some to the sun their insect wings unfold waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold transparent forms too thin for mortal sight their fluid bodies half dissolved in light loose to the wind their airy garments flew thin glittering textures of the filmy dew dipped in the richest tincture of the skies where light disports in evermingling dies while every beam new transient colors flings colors that change whenever they wave their wings cant   ver     ariel afterward enumerates the functions and employments of the sylphs in the following manner where some are supposed to delight in more gross and others in more refined occupations ye know the spheres and various tasks assigned by laws eternal to thaerial kind some in the fields of purest ether play and bask and brighten in the blaze of day some guide the course of wandering orbs on high or roll the planets through the boundless sky some less refined beneath the moons pale light pursue the stars that shoot across the night or suck the mists in grosser air below or dip their pinions in the painted bow or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main or over the glebe distill the kindly rain cant   ver     those who are fond of tracing images and sentiments to their source may perhaps be inclined to think that the hint of ascribing tasks and offices to such imaginary beings is taken from the fairies and the ariel of shakespeare let the impartial critic determine which has the superiority of fancy the employment of ariel in the tempest is said to be  to tread the ooze of the salt deep to run upon the sharp wind of the north to do  business in the veins of the earth when it is baked with frost  to dive into the fire to ride on the curled clouds and again  in the deep nook where once thou calldst me up at midnight to fetch dew from the stillvext bermoothes  nor must i omit that exquisite song in which his favorite pastime is expressed where the be sucks there suck i in a cowslips bell i lie there i couch when owls do cry on the bats back i do fly after sunset merrily merrily merrily shall i live now under the blossom that hangs on the bough with what wildness of imagination but yet with what propriety are the amusements of the fairies pointed out in the midsummer nights dream amusements proper for none but fairies  before the third part of a minute hence some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds some war with rearmice for their leathern wings to make my small elves coats and some keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our queint spirits  shakespeare only could have thought of the following gratifications for titanias lover and they are fit only to be offered to her lover by a fairyqueen be kind and courteous to this gentleman hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes feed him with apricocks and dewberries with purple grapes green figs and mulberries the honeybags stral from the humblebees and for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs and light them at the fiery glowworms eyes to have my love to bed and to arise and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes if it should be thought that shakespeare has the merit of being the first who assigned proper employments to imaginary persons in the foregoing lines yet it must be granted that by the addition of the most delicate satire to the most lively fancy pope in the following passage has excelled any thing in shakespeare or in any other author our humbler province is to tend the fair not a less pleasing though less glorious care to save the powder from too rough a gale nor let the imprisoned essences exhale to draw fresh colors from the vernal flowers to steal from rainbows ever they drop in showers a brighter wash to curl their waving hairs assist their blushes and inspire their airs nay often in dreams invention we bestow to change a flounce or add a furbelow cant   ver       the seeming importance given to every part of female dress each of which is committed to the care and protection of a different sylph with all the solemnity of a general appointing the several posts in his army renders the following passage admirable on account of it is politeness poignancy and poetry haste then ye spirits to your charge repair the fluttering fan be zephyrettas care the drops to thee brillante we consign and momentilla let the watch be thine do thou crispissa tend the favorite lock ariel himself shall be the guard of shock cant   ver      the celebrated raillery of addison on the hooppetticoat has nothing equal to the following circumstance which marks the difficulty of guarding a part of dress of such high consequence to fifty chosen sylphs of special note we trust the important charge the petticoat often have we known that sevenfold fence to fail though stiff with hoops and armed with ribs of mail form a strong line about the silver bound and guard the wide circumference around cant   ver      ridet hoc inquam venus ipsa rident simplices nymphae ferus et cupido   our poet still rises in the delicacy of his satire where he employs with the utmost judgment and elegance all the implements and furniture of the toilette as instruments of punishment to those spirits who shall be careless of their charge of punishment such as sylphs alone could undergo each of the delinquents shall feel sharp vengeance soon overtake his sins be stopped in vials or transfixed with pins or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie or wedged whole ages in a bodkins eye gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain while clogged he beats his silver wings in vain or alumstyptics with contracting power shrink his thin essence like a rivelld flower or as ixion fixed the wretch shall feel the giddy motion of the whirling mill in fumes of burning chocolate shall glow and tremble at the sea that froths below cant   ver      if virgil has merited such perpetual commenmendation for exalting his bees by the majesty and magnificence of his diction does not pope deserve equal praises for the pomp and luster of his language on so trivial a subject  the same mastery of language appears in the lively and elegant description of the game at ombre which is certainly imitated from the scacchia of vida and as certainly equal to it if not superior both of them have elevated and enlivened their subjects by such similes as the epic poets use but as chess is a play of a far higher order than ombre pope had a more difficult task than vida to raise this his inferior subject into equal dignity and gracefulness here again our poet artfully introduces his machinery soon as she spreads her hand thaerial guard descend and sit on each important card first ariel perched upon a mattadore cant   ver     the majesty with which the kings of spades and clubs and the knaves of diamonds and clubs are spoken of is very amusing to the imagination and the whole game is conducted with great art and judgment i question whether hoyle could have played it better than belinda it is finely contrived that she should be victorious as it occasions a change of fortune in the dreadful loss she was speedily to undergo and gives occasion to the poet to introduce a moral reflection from virgil which adds to the pleasantry of the story in one of the passages where pope has copied vida he has lost the propriety of the original which arises from the different colors of the men at chess thus when dispersed a routed army runs etc cant   ver     non aliter campis legio se buxea utrinque composuit duplici digestis ordine turmis adversisque ambae fulsere coloribus alae quam gallorum acies alpino frigore lactea corpora si tendant albis in praelia signis aurorae populos contra et phaetonte perustos insano

as atalantis shall be read or the small pillow grace a ladys bed while visits shall be paid on solemn days when numerous waxlights in bright order blaze while nymphs take treats or assignations give

virgil and milton canto v verse    are judiciously introduced in their several places are perhaps superior to those boileau or garth have used and are worked up with peculiar pleasantry the mind of the reader is engaged by novelty when it so unexpectedly finds a thought or object it had been accustomed to survey in another form suddenly arrayed in a ridiculous garb a mixture of comic and ridiculous images with serious and important ones is also no small beauty to this species of poetry as in the following passages where real and imaginary distresses are coupled together not youthful kings in battle seized alive cant   ver    not scornful virgins who their charms survive not ardent lovers robbed of all their bliss not ancient ladies when refused a kiss not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die nay to carry the climax still higher not cynthia when her manteaus pinned awry ever felt such rage resentment and despair this is much superior to a similar passage in the dispensary which pope might have had in his eye at this the victors own such ecstasies cant   ad calc  as memphian priests if their osiris sneeze or champions with olympic clangor fired or simpring prudes with spritely nantz inspired or sultans raised from dungeons to a crown or fasting zealots when the sermons done these objects have no reference to garths subject as almost all of popes have in the passage

the spleen   nothing can equal this beautiful panegyric but the satirical touches that go before   speech of umbriel a gnome to this malignant deity the vial of female sorrows the speech of thalestris to aggravate the misfortune the breaking the vial with its direful effects and the speech of the disconsolate belinda all these circumstances are poetically imagined and are far superior to any of boileau and garth how much in character is it for belinda to mark a very dismal and solitary situation by wishing to be conveyed where the gilt chariot never marks the way where none learn ombre none ever taste bohea cant   ver      nothing is more common in the poets than to introduce omens as preceding some important and dreadful event virgil has nobly described those that preceded the death of

china shook without a wind cant   ver      and still more to aggravate the direfulness of the impending evil nay poll sat mute and shock was most unkind   the chief subject of the fifth and last canto is the battle that ensues and the endeavors of the ladies to recover the hair this battle is described as it ought to be in very lofty and pompous terms a game of romps was never so well dignified before the weapons made use of are the most proper imaginable the lightening of the ladies eyes intolerable frowns a pinch of snuff and a bodkin the machinery is not forgot triumphant umbriel on a sconces height clapped his glad wings and sat to view the fight cant   ver     again when the snuff is given to the baron the gnomes direct to every atom just the pungent grains of titillating dust ibid ver     boileau and garth have also each of them enlivened their pieces with a mockfight but boileau has laid the scene of his action in a booksellers shop where the combatants happen to encounter each other by chance this conduct is a little inartificial but has given the satyrist an opportunity of indulging his ruling passion the exposing the bad poets with which france at that time abounded swifts battle of the books at the end of the tale of a tub is evidently taken from this chant   battle of boileau which is excellent in its kind the fight of the physicians in the dispensary is one of its most shining parts there is a vast deal of propriety as well as pleasantry in the weapons garth has given to his warriors they are armed much in character with caustics emetics and cathartics with buckthorn and steelpills with syringes bedpans and urinals the execution is exactly proportioned to the deadliness of such irresistible weapons and the wounds inflicted are suitable to the nature of each different instrument said to inflict them cant     we are now arrived to the grand catastrophe of the poem the invaluable lock which is so eagerly sought is irrecoverably lost and here our poet has made a judicious use of that celebrated fiction of ariosto that all things lost on earth are treasured in the moon how such a fiction can have place in an epic poem it becomes the defenders of this extravagant and lawless rhapsodist to justtify but in a comic one it appears with grace and consistency the whole passage in ariosto is full of wit and satire for wit and satire were the chief and characteristical excellencies of ariosto for the best and most judicious account i know of the genius of ariosto see wartons observations on the fairy queen of spenser consult particularly pages                 of that work where his merits are adjusted impartially  in this repository in the lunar sphere says the sprightly italian were to be found le lachrime e i sospiri de

glu perdesti may la su saltendo ritrovar potrai orlando furioso cant     it is very remarkable that the poet had the boldness to place among these imaginary treasures the famous deed of gift of constantine to pope silvester if says he i may be allowed to say this questo era il dono se pero dir lece che constantino al buon silvestre fece it may be observed in general to the honor of the poets both ancient and modern that they have ever been some of the first who have detected and opposed the false claims and mischievous usurpations of superstition and slavery nor can this be wondered at since these two are the greatest enemies not only to all true happiness but to all true genius  the denouement as a pedantic disciple of bossu would call it of this poem is well conducted what is become of this important lock of hair it is made a constellation with that of berenice so celebrated by callimachus as it rises to heaven the sylphs behold it kindling as it flies cant   ver   0  and pleased pursue its progress through the skies one cannot sufficiently applaud the art of the poet in constantly keeping in the readers view the machinery of the poem to the very last even when the lock is transformed the sylphs who had so carefully guarded it are here once again artfully mentioned as finally rejoicing in it is honorable transformation  in reading the lutrin i have always been struck with the impropriety of so serious a conclusion as boileau has given to so ludicrous a poem piety and justice are beings rather too awful to have any concern in the celebrated desk they appear as much out of place and season as would the archbishop of paris in his pontifical robes in an harlequin entertainment  pope does not desert his favorite lock even after it becomes a constellation and the uses he assigns to it are indeed admirable this the beau monde shall from the mall survey cant   ver      and hail with music it is propitious ray this the blessed lover shall for venus take and send up prayers from rosamundas lake this partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies when next he looks through galileos eyes and hence the egregious wizard shall foredoom the fate of louis and the fall of rome this is at once dulce loqui and ridere decorum  upon the whole i hope it will not be thought an exaggerated panegyric to say that the rape of the lock is the best satire extant that it contains the truest and liveliest picture of modern life and that the subject is of a more elegant nature as well as more artfully conducted than that of any other heroicomic poem pope here appears in the light of a man of gallantry and of a thorough knowledge of the world and indeed he had nothing in his carriage and deportment of that affected singularity which has induced some men of genius to despise and depart from the established rules of politeness and civil life for all poets have not practiced the sober and rational advice of boileau que les verse ne soient pas votre eternel emploi

produced one or two more poems of the burlesque kind that are excellent particularly the splendid shilling that admirable copy of the solemn irony of cervantes who is the father and unrivalled model of the true mockheroic and the muscipula written with the purity of virgil whom the author so perfectly understood and with the pleasantry of lucian to which i cannot forbear adding the scribleriad of mr cambridge this learned and ingenious writer has made a new remark in his preface worth examination and attention he says that in first reading the four celebrated mock heroic poems he perceived they had all some radical defect that at last he found by a diligent perusal of don quixote that propriety was the fundamental excellence of that work that all the mavelous was reconcilable to probability as the author led his hero into that species of absurdity only which it was natural for an imagination heated with the continual reading of books of chivalry to fall into that the want of attention to this was the fundamental error of those poems for with what propriety do churchmen physicians beaux and belles or booksellers in the lutrin dispensary rape of the lock and dunciad address themselves to heathen gods offer sacrifices consult oracles or talk the language of homer and of the heroes of antiquity   if some of the most candid among the french critics begin to acknowledge that they have produced nothing in point of sublimity and majesty equal to the paradise lost we may also venture to affirm that in point of delicacy elegance and fineturned raillery on which they have so much valued themselves they have produced nothing equal to the rape of the lock it is in this composition pope principally appears a poet in which he has displayed more imagination than in all his other works taken together it should however be remembered that he was not the first former and creator of those beautiful machines the sylphs on which his claim to imagination is chiefly founded he found them existing ready to his hand but has indeed employed them with singular judgment and artifice  sect v of the elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady the prologue to cato and the epilogue to jane shore the elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady which is next to be spoken of as it came from the heart is very tender and pathetic more so i think than any other copy of verses of our author we are unacquainted with her history and with that series of misfortunes which seems to have drawn on the melancholy catastrophe alluded to in the beginning of this elegy she is said to be the same person to whom the duke of buckingham has addressed some lines viz to a lady designing to retire into a monastery this design is also hinted at in popes letters vol vii page     octavo edition  where he says in a letter addressed i presume to this very person if you are resolved in revenge to rob the world of so much example as you may afford it i believe your design will be vain for even in a monastery your devotions cannot carry you so far toward the next world as to make this lose sight of you but you will be like a star that while it is fixed in heaven shines over all the earth wheresoever providence shall dispose of the most valuable thing i know i shall ever follow you with my sincerest wishes and my best thoughts will be perpetually waiting upon you when you never hear of me or them your own guardian angels cannot be more constant nor more silent  this elegy opens with a striking abruptness and a strong image the poet fancies he beholds suddenly the phantom of his murdered friend what beckning ghost along the moonlight shade invites my steps and points to yonder glade it is she  but why that bleeding bosom gored why dimly gleams the visionary sword this question alarms the reader and puts one in mind of that lively and affecting image in the prophecy of isaiah so vigorously conceived that it places the object full in ones eyes who is this that comes from edom with dyed garments from bosra chap    ver    akenside has begun one of his odes in the like manner o fly it is dire suspicions mein and meditating plagues unseen the sorcress hither bends behold her torch in gall imbrued behold her garments drop with blood of lovers and of friends the execrations on the cruelties of this ladys relations which had driven her to this deplorable extremity are very spirited and forcible especially where the poet says emphatically thus if eternal justice rules the ball thus shall your wives and thus your children fall he describes afterward the desolation of this family by the following lively circumstance and prosopopoeia there passengers shall stand and pointing say while the long funerals blacken all the way lo these were they whose souls the furies steeled and cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield so perish all whose breast never learned to glow for others good or melt at others woe the incident of her dying in a country remote from her relations and acquaintance is touched with great tenderness and introduced with propriety to aggravate and heighten her lamentable fate no friends complaint no kind domestic tear something like that pathetic stroke in the philoctetes of sophocles who among other heavy circumstances of distress is said not to have near him any  ver      not to be translated  pleased thy pale ghost or graced thy mournful bier by foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed by foreign hands thy decent limbs composed by foreign hands thy humble grave adorned by strangers honored and by strangers mourned the force of the repetition of the significant epithet foreign need not be pointed out to any reader of sensibility the rite of sepulture of which she was deprived from the manner of her death is glanced at with great delicacy nay and a very poetical use is made of it what though no sacred earth allow thee room nor hallowed dirge be muttered over thy tomb yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be dressed and the green turf lie lightly on thy breast there shall the morn her earliest tears bestow there the first roses of the year shall blow   if this elegy be so excellent it may be ascribed to this cause that the occasion of it was real for it is certainly an indisputable maxim that nature is more powerful than fancy that we can always feel more than we can imagine and that the most artful fiction must give way to truth when polus the celebrated actor once affected his audience with more than ordinary emotions it was luctu et lamentis veris by bursting out into real cries and tears for in personating electra weeping over the supposed urn of her brother orestes he held in his hands the real ashes of his own son lately dead aul gell noct attic lib   cap    events that have actually happened are after all the properest subjects for poetry the best eclogue of the first virgil the best ode of ode    lib   horace are founded on real incidents if we briefly cast our eyes over the most interesting and affecting stories ancient or modern we shall find that they are such as however adorned and a little diversified are yet grounded on true history and on real matters of fact such for instance among the ancients are the stories of joseph of edipus the trojan war and and its consequences of virginia and the horatii such among the moderns are the stories of king lear the cid romeo and juliet and oronooko the series of events contained in these stories seem far to surpass the utmost powers of human imagination in the bestconducted fiction some mark of improbability and incoherence will still appear  i shall only add to these a tale literally true which the admirable dante has introduced in his inferno and which is not sufficiently known i cannot recollect any passage in any writer whatever so truly pathetic ugolino a florentine count is giving the description of his being imprisoned with his children by the archbishop ruggieri the hour approached when we expected to have something brought us to eat but instead of seeing any food appear it was thought not improper to distinguis the more moving passages by italics mr barettis just translation is here used see his dissertation on the italian poets i heard the doors of that horrible dungeon more closely barred i beheld my little children in silence and could not weep my heart was petrified the little wretches wept and my dear anselm said tu guardi si padre che hai father you look on us what ails you i could neither weep nor answer and continued swallowed up in silent agony all that day and the following night even till the dawn of day as soon as a glimmering ray darted through the doleful prison that i could view again those four faces in which my own image was impressed i gnawed both my hands with grief and rage my children believing i did this through eagerness to eat raising themselves suddenly up said to me my father our torments would be less if you would allay the rage of your hunger upon us i restrained myself that i might not increase their misery we were all mute that day and the following quel di e laltro stemmo tutti muti ah cruel earth why do not thou swallow us up at once the fourth day being come gaddo falling extended at my feet cried padre mio che non majuti my father why do not you help me and died the other three expired one after the other between the fifth and sixth days famished as thou see me now and i being seized with blindness began to go groping upon them with my hands and feet and continued calling them by their names three days after they were dead etre di li chiamai poiche fur morti then hunger vanquished my grief  if this inimitable description had been to be found in homer the greek tragedies or virgil how many commentaries and panegyrics would it have given rise to what shall shall we say or think of the genius able to produce it there are many of the same nature and perhaps the inferno of dante is the next composition to the iliad in point of originality and sublimity and with regard to the pathetic let this tale stand a testimony of his abilities for my own part i truly believe it was never carried to a greater height it is remarkable that chaucer appears to have been particularly struck with this tale in dante having highly commended this great poet of italy for this narration with a summary of which he concludes the monkes tale urrys chaucer page     ver       the prologue to addisons tragedy of cato is superior to any prologue of dryden who notwithstanding is so justly celebrated for this species of writing the prologues of dryden are satirical and facetious this of pope is solemn and sublime as the subject required those of dryden contain general topics of criticism and wit and may precede any play whatsoever even tragedy or comedy this of pope is particular and appropriated to the tragedy alone which it was designed to introduce the most striking images and allusions it contains are taken with judgment from some passages in the life of cato himself such is that fine stroke more lofty than any thing in the tragedy itself where the poet says that when caesar amid the pomp and magnificence of a triumph showed rome her catos figure drawn in state as her dead fathers reverend image past the pomp was darkened and the day overcast the triumph ceased  tears gushed from every eye the worlds great victor passed unheeded by her last good man dejected rome adored and honored caesars less than catos sword such again is the happy allusion to an old story mentioned in martial of this sage going into the theater and immediately coming out of it again such plays alone should win a british ear as catos self had not disdained to hear from which he draws an artful panegyric on the purity and excellence of the play he was celebrating  with respect to sprightly turns and poignancy of wit the prologues of dryden have not been equalled the curious reader may consult particularly a collection of twenty of them together in the first edition of the first volume of tonsons miscellanies page      many of them and the most excellent written on occasion of the players going to oxford a custom for the neglect of which no good reason can be assigned except perhaps that even the players must now forsooth follow the contemptible cant of decrying that most learned university and of doing nothing that may contribute to its pleasure and emolument at this time dryden was so famous for his prologues that no piece was relished nor would the theaters scarcely venture to produce it if it wanted this fashionable ornament to this purpose an anecdote is recorded of southern who on bringing his first play on the stage did not fail to bespeak a prologue of the artist in vogue the usual price had ever been four guineas in the present case dryden insisted that he must have six for his work which said the mercantile bard is out of no disrespect to you young man but the players have had my goods too cheap  the tragedy of cato itself is a glaring instance of the force of party when addison spoke of the secretary of state at that time he always called him in the language of shakespeare  that cankered bolingbroke notwithstanding this addison assured pope he did not bring his tragedy on the stage with any party views nay desired pope to carry the poem to the lords oxford and bolingbroke for their perusal the play however was always considered as a warning to the people that liberty was in danger during that tory ministry to obviate the strong impressions that so popular a performance might make on the minds of the audience lord bolingbroke in the midst of their violent applauses sent for booth who played cato one night into his box between the acts and presented him with fifty guineas in acknowledgment as he expressed it with great address for defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator  so heavy and declamatory a drama would never have met with such rapid and amazing success if every line and sentiment had not been particularly tortured and applied to recent events and the reigning disputes of the times the purity and energy of the diction and the loftiness of the sentiments copied in a great measure from lucan tacitus and seneca the philosopher merit approbation but i have always thought that those pompous roman sentiments are not so difficult to be produced as is vulgarly imagined and which indeed dazzle only the vulgar a stroke of nature is in my opinion worth a hundred such thoughts as when vice prevails and impious men bear sway the post of honor is a private station cato is a fine dialogue on liberty and the love of ones country but considered as a dramatic performance nay as a model of a just tragedy as some have affectedly represented it it must be owned to want action and pathos the two hinges i presume on which a just tragedy ought necessarily to turn and without which it cannot subsist it wants also character although that be not so essentially necessary to a tragedy as action syphax indeed in his act   scen   interview with juba bears some marks of a rough african the speeches of the rest may be transferred to any of the personages concerned the simile drawn from mount atlas and the description of the numidian traveller smothered in the desert are indeed in character but sufficiently obvious how addison could fall into the false and unnatural custom of ending his three first acts with similes is amazing in so chaste and correct a writer the loves of juba and marcia of portius and lucia are vicious and insipid episodes debase the dignity and destroy the unity of the fable  one would imagine from the practice of our modern playwrights that love was the only passion capable of producing any great calamities in human life for this passion has engrossed and been impertinently introduced into when the resolution of medea to kill her children is almost disarmed and destroyed by looking at them and by their smiling upon her she breaks out    heu heu cur me oculis aspicitis liberi cur arridetis hoc extremo risu heu heu quid faciam cor enim mihi disperit euripid medea ver  0   no sentiments of the lover can be so tender and so deeply touching as thse of the mother all subjects in the cinna of corneille which the prince of conde called the breviary of kings maximus whines like a shepherd in the pastor fido amidst profound political reflections that excel those of tacitus and machiavel and while the most important event that could happen to the empire of the world was debating in his imitation of the orestes of sophocles crebillon has introduced a frigid loveintrigue achilles must be in love in the iphigenia of racine and the rough mithridates must be involved in this allsubduing passion a passion however it is that will always shine upon the stage where it is introduced as the chief subject but not subordinate and secondary lamour furieux criminel malheureux suivi de remords arrache de nobles larmes point de milieu il faut ou que lamour domine en tiran ou quil ne paroisse pas oeuvres de voltaire tom    page     i have just been told that crebillon has also very lately made poor philoctetes in love in his desert island    thus perhaps there cannot be finer subjects for a drama than phaedra romeo othello and monimia the whole distress in these pieces arises singly from this unfortunate passion carried to an extreme the introduction of female actresses on the modern stage together with that importance which the ladies in these latter ages have justly gained in comparison to what the ancients allowed them are the two great reasons among others of the prevalence of these tender tales the ladies of athens had not interest enough to damn a piece of sophocles or euripides  the greater passions were the constant subjects of the grecian the tenderer ones of the french and english theaters terror reigned in the former pity occupies the latter the moderns may yet boast of some pieces that are not emasculated with this epidemical effeminacy racine was at last convinced of its impropriety and gave the public his athaliah in which were no parts commonly called by the french lamoreux et de lamoreuse which were always given to their two capital actors the merope and orestes of voltaire are likewise free from any illplaced tenderness and romantic gallantry for which he has merited the praises of the learned father tournemine in a letter to his friend father brumoy les oevres de voltaire tom      but lear and macbeth are also striking instances what interesting tragedies may be written without having recourse to a lovestory it is pity that the tragedy of cato in which all the rules of the drama as far as the mechanism of writing reaches is not exact with respect to the unity of time there was no occasion to extend the time of the fable longer than the mere representation takes up all might have passed in the compass of three hours from the morning with a description of which the play opens if the poet in the fourth scene of the fifth act had not talked of the setting sun playing on the armor of the soldiers  having been imperceptibly led into this little criticism on the tragedy of cato i beg leave to speak a few words on some other of addisons pieces the tickell has ridiculously marked the authors age to be but twenty two and twenty seven as if these verses were extraordinary efforts at that age to these however addison owed his introduction at court and his acquaintance with that polite patron lord summers first of his poems addressed to dryden sir john summers and king william are languid prosaic and void of any poetical imagery or spirit the letter from italy is by no means equal to a subject so fruitful of genuine poetry and which might have warmed the most cold and correct imagination one would have expected a young traveller in the height of his genius and judgment would have broke out into some strokes of enthusiasm with what flatness and unfeelingness has he spoken of statuary and painting raphael never received a more flegmatic elogy the slavery and superstition of the present romans are well touched upon toward the conclusion but i will venture to name a little piece on a parallel subject that greatly excells this celebrated letter and in which are as much lively and original imagery strong painting and manly sentiments of freedom as i have ever read in our language it is a copy of verses written at virgils tomb and printed in dodsleys vol   page     miscellanies  that there are many well wrought descriptions and even pathetic strokes in the campaign it would be stupidity and malignity to deny but surely the regular march which the poet has observed from one town to another as if he had been a commissary of the army cannot well be excused there is a passage in boileau so remarkably opposite to this fault of addison that one would almost be tempted to think he had the campaign in his eye when he wrote it if the time would admit but the art of poetry was written in the year      many years before the campaign addison might have profited by this rule of his acquaintance for whom he had a great respect it loin ces rimeurs craintiss dont lesprit phlegmatique guard dans ses fureurs un order didactique qui chantant dun heroes les progres eclatans

vigor and his compliment to kneller on the picture of king george the first the occasion of this last poem is peculiarly happy for among the works of phidias which he enumerates he selects such

believe any instance where mythology has been applied with so much delicacy and dexterity and has been contrived to answer in its application so minutely exactly and in so many corresponding circumstances  whatever censures we have here too boldly perhaps ventured to deliver on the professed poetry of addison yet must we heartily own that in various parts of his proseessays are to be found many strokes of genuine and sublime poetry many marks of a vigorous and exuberant imagination particularly in the noble allegory of pain and pleasure the vision of mirza the story of maraton and yaratilda of constantia and theodosius and the beautiful eastern tale of abdallah and balsora and many others together with several strokes in the essay on the pleasures of imagination it has been the lot of many great names not to have been able to express themselves with beauty and propriety in the fetters of verse in their respective languages who have yet manifested the force fertility and creative power of a most poetic genius in prose in some of the eastern stories lately published in the adventurer a vast and noble invention is displayed and this too by an author that i have never heard has written any considerable verses see particularly the story of amurath no  0 of nouraddin and amana no    and of carazan no     by mr hawkesworth this was the case of plato of lucian of fenelon of sir philip sidney and of dr t burnet who in his theory of the earth has displayed an imagination very nearly equal to that of milton  maenia mundi discedunt totum video per inane geri res after all the chief and characteristical excellency of addison was his humor for in humor no mortal has excelled him except moliere witness the character of sir roger de coverly so original so natural and so inviolably preserved vol ii during the month of july see the characters of will wimble moll white and the justices of the quorum p  00 and seq and vol   sir roger at westminster abbey     and at the tragedy of the distressed mother with the spectator particularly in the month which the spectator spends at his hall in the country witness also the drummer that excellent and neglected comedy that just picture of life and real manners where the poet never speaks in his own person or totally drops or forgets a character for the sake of introducing a brilliant simile or acute remark where no train is laid for wit no jeremys or bens are suffered to appear  the epilogue to jane shore is the last piece that belongs to this section the title of which by this time the reader may have possibly forgot it is written with the air of gallantry and raillery which by a strange perversion of taste the audience expects in all epilogues to the most serious and pathetic pieces to recommend cuckoldom and palliate adultery is their usual intent i wonder mrs oldfield was not suffered to speak it for it is superior to that which was used on the occasion in this taste garrick has written some that abound in spirit and drollery rowes genius there are however some images in row strongly painted such particularly as the following which is worthy of spenser speaking of the tower methinks suspicion and distrust dwell here staring with meagre forms through grated windows lady jane gray act   sc   was rather delicate and tender than strong and pathetic his compositions sooth us with a tranquil and

versification highly melodious his plays are declamations rather than dialogues and his characters are general and undistinguished from each other such a furious character as that of bajazet is easily drawn and let me add easily acted there is a want of unity in the fable of tamerlane the deaths head dead body and stage hung in mourning in the fair penitent are inartificial and mechanical methods of affecting an audience in a word his plays are musical and pleasing poems but inactive and unmoving tragedies this of jane shore is i think the most interesting and affecting of any he has given us but probability is sadly violated in it by the neglect of the unity of time for a person to be supposed to be starved during the representation of five acts is a striking instance of the absurdity of this violation in this piece as in all of rowes are many florid speeches utterly inconsistent with the state situation of the distressful personages who speak them when shore first meets with her husband she says act   sc   art thou not risen by miracle from death thy shroud is fallen from off thee and the grave was bid to give thee up that thou might come the messenger of grace and goodness to me  he has then added some lines intolerably flowery and unnatural give me your drops ye soft descending rains give me your streams ye neverceasing springs that my sad eyes may still supply my duty and feed an everlasting flood of sorrow this is of a far distant strain from those tender and simple exclamations she uses when her husband offers her some rich conserves  ibid how can you be so good and again  have you forgot the costly string of pearl you brought me home and tied about my neck how could i leave you she continues to gaze on him with earnestness and instead of eating as he entreats her she observes  youre strangely altered  say gentle belmour is he not how pale your visage is become your eyes are hollow  nay you are wrinkled too  to which she instantly subjoins struck with the idea that she herself was the unhappy cause of this alteration  alas the day my wretchedness has cost you many a tear and many a bitter pang since last we parted what she answers to her husband when he asks her movingly why do thou fix thy dying eyes upon me with such an earnest such a piteous look as if thy heart was full of some sad meaning thou could not speak  is pathetic to a great degree and forgive me but forgive me  these few words far exceed the most pompous declamations of cato the interview betwixt jane shore and alicia in the middle of this act is also very affecting where the madness of alicia is well painted but of all representations of madness that of clementina in the history of sir charles grandison is the most deeply interesting i know not whether even the madness of lear is wrought up and expressed by so many little strokes of nature and genuine passion it is absolute pedantry to prefer and compare the madness of orestes in euripides to this of clementina  it is probable that this is become the most popular and pleasing tragedy of all rowes works because it is founded on our own history it is to be wished that our writers would more frequently search for subjects in the annals of england which afford many striking and pathetic events proper for the stage we have been too long attached to grecian and roman stories in truth the domestica facta are more interesting as well as more useful more interesting because we all think ourselves concerned in the actions and fates of our countrymen more useful because the characters and manners bid the fairest to be true and natural when they are drawn from models with which we are exactly acquainted the turks the persians and americans of our poets are in reality distinguished from englishmen only by their turbans and feathers and think and act as if they were born and educated within the bills of mortality the historical plays of milton has left in a manuscript thirty three subjects for tragedies all taken from the english annals which manuscript the curious reader may see printed in newtons edit of milton oct vol   page     and in birchs life of milton prefixed to his edition of miltons proseworks and in pecks miscellanea curiosa shakespeare are always particularly grateful to the spectator who loves to see and hear our own harrys and edwards better than all the achilless or brutuss that ever existed in the choice of a domestic story however much judgment and circumspection must be exerted to select one of a proper era neither of too ancient or of too modern a date the manners of times very ancient we shall be as apt to falsify as those of the greeks and romans and recent events with which we are thoroughly acquainted are deprived of the power of impressing solemnity and awe by their notoriety and familiarity age softens and wears away all those disgracing and depreciating circumstances which attend modern transactions merely because they are modern lucan was much embarrassed by the proximity of the times he treated of on this very account as well as others the best tragedy that could be possibly written on the murder of charles i would be coldly received racine ventured to write on a recent history in his bajazet but would not have attempted it had he not thought that the distance of his heros country repaired in some measure the nearness of the time in which he lived major a longinquo reverentia  pope it is said had framed a design of writing an epic poem on a fact recorded in our old annalists and therefore more engaging to an englishman on the arrival of brutus the supposed grandson of aeneas in our island and the settlement of the first foundations of the british monarchy a full scope might have been given to a vigorous imagination to embellish a fiction drawn from the bosom of the remotest antiquity some tale equally venerable and ancient it was also the purpose of milton whether he intended as a poet expresses it to record old arthurs magic tale and edward fierce in sable male sing royal brutus lawless doom and brave bonduca scourge of rome great pendragons fairbranched line stern arvirage or old locrine the union page     an historical poem says milton in the above mentioned manuscript may be founded somewhere in alfreds reign especially at his issuing out of edelingsey on the danes whose actions are well like those of ulysses in miltons history of england may be seen the story of brutus here in question with which he seems pleased as it suited the romantic turn of his mind see his mansus siquando indigenas revocabo in carmina reges arthurumque etiam etc ipse ego dardanias rutupina per aequora puppes dicam and pandrasidos regnum vetus inogeniae brennumque arviragumque etc and particularly the epitaphium damonis   to adorn for he says in his reason of church government page    i am meditating what king or knight before the conquest might be chosen in whom to lay the pattern of a christian hero but shall i be pardoned for suspecting that pope would not have succeeded in this design that so didactic a genius would have been deficient in that sublime and pathetic which are the main nerves of the epopea that he would have given us many elegant descriptions and many general characters well drawn but would have failed to set before our eyes the reality of these objects and the actions of these characters for homer professedly draws no characters but gives us to collect them from the looks and behavior of each person he introduces that popes close and constant reasoning had impaired and crushed the faculty of imagination that the political reflections in this piece would in all probability have been more numerous than the affecting strokes of nature that it would have more resembled the henriade than the iliad or even the gierusalemme liberata that it would have appeared if this scheme had been executed how much and for what reasons the man that is skilful in painting modern life and the most secret foibles and follies of his cotemporaries is therefore disqualified for representing the ages of heroism and that simple life which alone epic poetry can gracefully describe in a word that this composition would have shown more of the philosopher than of the poet add to all this that it was to have been written in rhyme a circumstance sufficient of itself alone to overwhelm and extinguish all enthusiasm and produce endless tautologies and circumlocutions are not these suppositions strengthened by what dr warburton vol iii has informed us namely that pope in this poem intended to have treated amply of all that regarded civil regimen or the science of politics that the several forms of a republic were here to have been examined and explained together with the several modes of religious worship as far forth as they affect society than which surely there could not have been a more improper subject for an epic poem  it is not impertinent to observe for the sake of those who are fond of the history of literature and of the human mind in the progress of it that the very first poem that appeared in france any thing like an epic poem was on this identical subject of brutus arriving in england it was written by master eustache so early as in the reign of louis the seventh surnamed the young who ascended the throne in the year      and who was the husband of the celebrated eleonora afterward divorced and married to our henry the second the author called it le roman de brut every piece of poetry was at that time denominated a romance the latin language ceased to be regularly spoken in france about the ninth century and was succeeded by what was called the romancetongue a mixture of the language of the francs and of bad latin the species of writing called romans began in the tenth century according to the opinion of the benedictine fathers hist lit t      who have well refuted m fleuri and calmet who make them less ancient by two hundred years the poem or roman we are speaking of is full of wonderful and improbable tales and supernatural adventures suited to the taste of so barbarous an age it is matter of some curiosity to see a specimen of the style of this eldest of the french poets this is his exordium qui veut ouir qui veut scavoir de roi en roi and dhoir en hoir qui cils furent and dou cils vinrent qui angleterre primes tinrent we may judge from this passage of the state of the language master eustache has been particularly careful to mark the time in which he lived and wrote by his two concluding lines lan mil cent cinquante  cinq ans fit maistre eustache ces romans i will take leave to add that the second poem now remaining in the french language was entitled the romance of alexander the great it was the confederated work of four authors famous in their time lambert le court and alexander of paris sung the exploits of alexander peter de saint clost wrote his will in verse the writing the will of a hero being then a common topic and john le nivelois added a book concerning the manner in which his death was revenged it is remarkable that before this time all the romans had been composed in verses of eight syllables but in this piece the four authors first used verses of twelve syllables as more solemn and majestic and this was the origin though but little known of those verses which we now call alexandrines the french heroic measure the name being derived from alexander the hero of the piece or from alexander the most celebrated of the four poets concerned in this work these were the most applauded poets of that age fauchet highly commends this poem particularly a passage where a cavalier is struck to the ground with a lance who says the old bard du long comme il etoit mesura la campaign which is not inferior to virgils hesperiam metire jacens  one would not imagine this line had been written so early as the middle of the twelfth century a great and truly learned antiquary the president henault histoire de france tom   p     a paris      has remarked for the honor of our country that about this time    0 appeared the first traces of any theater a monk called geoffry who was afterward abbot of st albans in england employed in the education of youth made his pupils represent with proper scenes and dresses tragedies of piety the subject of the first dramatic piece was the miracles of saint catharine which says my author appeared long before any of our representations of the mysteries  sect vi of the epistle of sappho to phaon and of eloisa to abelard it is no small merit in ovid to have invented this beautiful species of writing epistles under feigned characters it is a high improvement on the greek elegy to which its dramatic nature renders it greatly superior it is indeed no other than a passionate soliloquy in which the mind gives vent to the distresses and emotions under which it labors but by being directed and addressed to a particular person it gains a degree of propriety that the bestconducted soliloquy in a tragedy must ever want our impatience under any pressures of grief and disorder of mind makes such passionate expostulations with the persons supposed to cause such uneasinesses very natural judgment is chiefly shown by opening the interesting complaint just at such a period of time as will give occasion for the most tender sentiments and the most sudden and violent turns of passion to be displayed ovid may perhaps be blamed for a sameness of subjects in these epistles of his heroines whose distresses are almost all occasioned by their lovers forsaking them his epistles are likewise too long which circumstance has forced him into a repetition and languor in the sentiments it would be a pleasing task and conduce to the formation of a good taste to show how differently ovid and the greek tragedians have made medea phaedra and deianira speak on the very same occasions such a comparison would abundantly manifest the fancy and wit of ovid and the judgment and nature of euripides and sophocles if the character of medea was not better supported in the tragedy which ovid is said to have produced and of which quintilian speaks so advantageously than it is in her epistle to jason one may venture to declare that if this drama had survived the romans would not yet have been vindicated from their inferiority to the greeks in tragic poesy  the epistle before us is translated by pope with faithfulness and with elegance and much excells any that dryden translated in the volume he published many of which were done by some of the mob of gentlemen that wrote with ease that is sir c scroop caryl pooly wright tate buckingham cooper and other careless rhymers a good translation of these epistles is as much wanted as one of juvenal for out of sixteen satires of that poet dryden himself translated but six we can now boast of happy translations in verse of almost all the great poets of antiquity whilst the french have been poorly contented with only prose translations of homer and horace which says cervantes can no more resemble the original than the wrong side of tapestry can represent the right the inability of the french tongue to express many greek or roman ideas with facility and grace is here visible but the italians have horace translated by pallavacini theocritus by ricolotti ovid by anguillara the aeneid admirably well in blank verse by annibal caro and the georgics in blank verse also by daniello  i return to ovid by observing that he has put into the mouth of his heroine a greater number of pretty panegyrical epigrams than of those tender and passionate sentiments which suited her character and made her sensibility in amors so famous what can be more elegantly gallant than this compliment to phaon sum fidem and pharetram fies manifestus apollo accedant capiti cornua bacchus eris this thought seems indisputably to have been imitated in that most justly celebrated of modern epigrams lumine acon dextro capta est leonilla sinistro et potis est forma vincere uterque deos blande puer lumen quod habes concede sorori sic tu coecus amor sic erit illa venus my chief reason for quoting these delicate lines was to point out the occasion of them which seems not to be sufficiently known they were made on louis de maguiron the most beautiful man of his time and the great favorite of henry iii of france who lost an eye at the siege of issoire and on the princess of eboli a great beauty but who was deprived of the sight of one of her eyes and who was at the same time mistress of philip ii king of spain  it was happily imagined to write an epistle in the character of sapho who had spoken of the joys of love with more warmth and feeling than any writer of antiquity and who described the violent symptoms attending this passion in so strong and lively a manner that the physician erasistratus is said to have discovered the secret malady of the prince antiochus who was in love with his motherinlaw stratonice merely by examining the symptoms of his patients distemper by this description addison has inserted in two of his spectators no     and      an elegant character of this poetess and has given a translation of two of her fragments that are exquisite in their kind a translation which we may presume addison himself revised and altered for his friend philips as these two pieces are pretty wellknown by being found in so popular a book as the spectator i shall say no more of them but shall add two more of her fragments which though very short are yet highly beautiful and tender the first represents the languor and listlessness of a person deeply in love we may suppose the fair author looking up earnestly on her mother casting down the web on which she was employed and suddenly exclaiming     dulcis matter non possum texere telum amore victa pueri per acrem venerem the other fragment is of the descriptive kind and seems to be the beginning of an ode addressed to evening it is quoted by demetrius phalereus edit oxon p  0     vesper omnia fers fers um fers capram fers matri fiam from these little fragments the first of which is an example of the pathetic and the second of the picturesque the manner of sappho might have been gathered if the two longer odes had not been preserved in the treatises of dionysius and of longinus i cannot help adopting the application addison has made of his two lines of phoedrus to these remains of our poetess which is perhaps one of the most elegant and happy applications that ever was made from any classic whatever o suavis anima qualem te dicam bonam antehac fuisse tales cum sint reliquiae phaedr fab l   v   the versification of this translation of pope is in point of melody next to that of his pastorals i am of opinion that the two following lines in which alliteration is successfully used are the most harmonious verses in our language i mean in rhyme ye gentle gales beneath my body blow and softly lay me on the waves below the peculiar musicalness of the first of these lines in particular arises principally from it is consisting entirely of iambic feet which have always a striking although unperceived effect in an english verse as for example y gentl gales bneath my body blow even if the last foot alone be an iambic it casts a harmony over a whole line see warton on spenser sect xi page     etc rapt into future times the bard bgun there are many niceties in our versification which few attend to and which would demand a regular treatise fully to discourse we should surely use every possible art to render our rough northern language harmonious  fenton also has given us a translation of this epistle to phaon but it is in no respect equal to popes he has added another of his own invention of phaon to sappho in which the story of the transformation of the former from an old mariner to a beautiful youth is well told fenton pope highly valued him in a letter to gay vol   p     he says i have just received the news of the death of a friend whom i esteemed almost as many years as you poor fenton he died at easthamstead of indolence and inactivity let it not be your fate but use exercise craggs who had never received a learned education had some time before commissioned pope to find out for him some polite scholar whom he proposed to take into his family that he might acquire a taste of literature by the conversation and instruction of the person pope should recommend he accordingly chose fenton but craggs died unluckily for the execution of this scheme mr craggs had the candor to make no objection to fenton tho he was a nonjuror being i presume convinced he was honest as well as learned was an elegant scholar and had an exquisite taste the books he translated for pope in the odyssey are superior to bromes in his miscellanies are some pieces worthy notice particularly his epistle to southern the fair nun imitated from fontaine olivia a character and an ode to lord gower written in the true spirit of lyric poetry of which the following allegory is an example enamored of the seine celestial fair the blooming pride of thetis azure train bacchus to win the nymph who caused his care lashed his swift tigers to the celtic plain there secret in her sapphire cell he with the nais wont to dwell leaving the nectard feasts of jove and where her mazy waters flow he gave the mantling vine to grow a trophy to his love his tragedy of mariamne has merit tho the diction be too figurative and ornamental it does indeed superabound in the richest poetic images except this may be palliated by urging that it suits the characters of oriental heroes to talk in so high a strain and to use such a luxuriance of metaphors  from this epistle of sappho i may take occasion to observe that this species of writing beautiful as it is has not been much cultivated among us drayton no despicable genius attempted to revive it and has left us some good subjects though not very artfully handled the best of his englands heroical epistles are king john to matilda elinor cobham to duke humphry william de le poole to queen margaret jane shore to edward iv lord surrey to geraldine and lady jane gray to lord gilford dudley in his barons wars there are many strokes not unworthy of spenser and his nymphidia must be allowed to be a perfect pattern of pastoral elegance  we have also a few of this sort of epistles by the late lord hervey in the fourth volume of dodsleys miscellanies page  0 and seq flora to pompey arisbe to marius and monimia to philocles in which last are some pathetic strokes and roxana to usbeck taken from the incomparable lettres persans a geneve      letters of the late president montesquieu a fine lady wortley montague who resided so long at constantinople said one would have thought the baron de montesqieu had been born and bred a turk he has described that people and the women particularly so very accurately  i had rather have written the short history of the troglodites consisting only of ten pages than the admirable the immortal history of thuanus in ten great volumes mes pensees ccxlv original work in which the customs and manners of the persians are painted with the utmost truth and liveliness and which have been faintly imitated by the jewish chinese and other letters the beauty of this writer is his expressive brevity which lord hervey has lengthened to a degree that is unnatural especially as roxana is supposed to write just after she has swallowed a deadly poison and during it is violent operations i have lately seen several pieces of this species which as the subjects are striking will i hope one day see the light they are

to alboinus king of the lombards  but of all stories ancient or modern there is not perhaps a more proper one to furnish out an elegiac epistle than that of eloisa and abelard their distresses were of a most singular and peculiar kind and their names sufficiently known but not grown trite or common by too frequent usage pope was a most excellent improver if no great original inventor for as we have seen what an elegant superstructure he has raised on the little dialogues of the comte de gabalis so shall we perceive in the sequel of this section how finely he has worked up the hints of distress that are scattered up and down in abelards and eloisas letters and in a little french printed at the hague      history of their lives and misfortunes which he made great use of he was born born at palais near nantes in britanny at the beginning of the twelfth century and studied at paris under william champeaux abelard was reputed the most handsome as well as most learned man of his time according to the kind of learning then in vogue an old chronicle quoted by in his call abel p      and the high opinion that was held of his learning may appear from his epitaph by pet de clugny gallorum socrates plato maximus hesperiarum noster aristoteles logicis quicunque fuerunt aut par aut melior studiorum cognitus orbi princeps ingenio varius subtilis and acer omnia vi superans rationis and art loquendi  andrew du chesne informs us that scholars flocked to his lectures from all quarters of the latin world and his contemporary st bernard relates that he numbered among his disciples many principal ecclesiastics and cardinals at the court of rome abelard himself boasts that when he retired into the country he was followed by such immense crowds of scholars that they could get neither lodgings nor provisions sufficient for them ut nec locus hospitiis nec terra sufficeret alimentis abelardi opera p     he met with the fate of many learned men to be embroiled in controversy and accused of heresy for st the character of this st bernard was singular the president henault thus speaks of him il avoit ete done a cet homme extraordinaire de dominer les esprits one beholds him

very great got his opinion of the trinity condemned at a council held at sens    0 but the talents of one is sometimes surprised to see the honors and veneration formerly paid to men of literature in comparison of what they meet with at present as every human advantage is attended with inconveniences the change of mens ideas in this particular may probably be ascribed to the invention of printing which has rendered books so common that even men of slender fortunes can have access to them humes history of great britain p     abelard were not confined to theology jurisprudence philosophy and the thorny paths of scholasticism he gave proofs of a lively genius by many poetical performances insomuch that he was reputed to be the author of the famous romance of the rose which however was indisputably written by john of meun a little city on the banks of the loire about four leagues from orleans which gave occasion to marot to exclaim de jean de meun senfle le course de loire of this ancient french poet much more will be said in the course of this work when we come occasionally to speak of chaucer suffice it at present to observe that he certainly continued and finished the romance of the rose which whom marot praises as the ennius of france notre ennius guillaume de lorris he took his name from the town of lorris where he was born william de lorris had left imperfect forty years before if chronology did not absolutely contradict the notion of abelards being the author of this very celebrated piece yet are there internal arguments sufficient to confute it the mistake seems to have flowed from his having given eloisa the name of rose in one of the many sonnetts he addressed to her in this which was certainly written an hundred years after abelard flourished romance there are many severe and satirical strokes on the character of eloisa which the pen of eloisa speaks thus of abelards poetry and skill also in music for he sung his own verses duo autem fateor tibi specialiter inerant quibus foeminarum quarumlibet animos statim allicere poteras dictandi videlicet and cantandi gratia quae caeteros minime philosophos assecutos esse novimus quibus

frequentata tuum in ore omnium nomen incessanter tenebant ut etiam illiteratos melodiae dulcedo tui non sineret esse immemores epist   heloissae p    edit       it is observable that pope judiciously softened and harmonized her name to eloisa from heloissa   abelard never would have given in one passage she is introduced speaking with indecency and obscenity in another all the vices and bad qualities of women are represented as assembled together in her alone qui les maeurs feminins savoit car trestous en soi les avoit in a very old epistle dedicatory addressed to philip the fourth of france by this same john of meun and prefixed to a french translation of boethius a very popular book at that time it appears that he also translated the epistles of abelard to heloisa which were in high vogue at the court he mentions also that he had translated vegetius on the art military and a book called the wonders of ireland these works show us the taste of the age his words are tenvoye ores chaucer also translated this piece  boethius was a most admired classic of that age indeed he deserves to be so of any boece de consolation que jai translate en francois jacoit que bien entendes le latin this sentence strongly also characterises the times  it is to be regretted that we have no exact picture of the person and beauty of eloisa abelard himself says that she was facie non infima her extraordinary learning many circumstances concur to confirm particularly one which is that the nuns of the paraclete are wont to have the office of whitsunday read to them in greek to perpetuate the memory of her understanding that language the curious may not be displeased to be informed that the paraclete was built in the parish of quincey upon the little river arduzon near to nogent upon the seine happening to be in france a few years ago i had the curiosity to visit the very spot which i surveyed with much veneration a lady learned as was eloisa in that age who indisputably understood the latin greek and hebrew tongues was a kind of prodigy her literature says abel opera p  0 abelard in toto regno nominatissimam fecerat and we may be sure more thoroughly attached him to her bussy rabutin speaks in high terms of commendation of the purity of eloisas latinity a judgment worthy a french count there is a force but not an elegance in her style which is blemished as might be expected by many phrases unknown to the pure ages of the roman language and by many hebraisms borrowed from the translation of the bible  i now propose to pass through the the compliment which prior paid our author on this epistle is at once full of elegance and very lively imagery he addresses it to abelard and says that pope has wove a silken web and never shall fade its colors gently he has laid the mantle over thy sad distress and venus shall the texture bless he over the weeping nun has drawn such artful folds of sacred lawn that love with equal grief and pride shall see the crime he strives to hide and softly drawing back the veil the god shall to his votries tell each conscious tear each blushing grace that decked dear eloisas face alma p  0  epistle in order to give the reader a view of the various turns and tumults of passion and the different sentiments with which eloisa is agitated and at the same time to point out what passages are borrowed and how much improved from the original letters from this analysis her struggles and conflicts between duty and pleasure between penitence and passion will more amply and strikingly appear  she begins with declaring how the peacefulness of her situation has been disturbed by a letter of her lover accidentally falling into her hands this exordium is beautiful being worked up with an awakening solemnity she looks about her and breaks out at once v   in these deep solitudes and awful cells if i was ordered to find out the most happy and the most miserable man in the world i would look for them in a cloister said a man of penetration  where heavenlypensive contemplation dwells and evermusing melancholy reigns what means this tumult in a vestals veins why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat why feels my heart it is longforgotten heat she then resolves neither to mention or to write the name of abelard but suddenly adds in a dramatic manner v     quanto rectius hoc quam tristi laedere versu pantolabum scurram nomentanumque nepotem hor sat l   s  0  0 the name appears already written  wash it out my tears she then addresses herself to the convent where she was confined in fine imagery v    relentless walls whose darksom round contains repentant sighs and voluntary pains this and several other circumstances in the scenery view of the monastery which denote antiquity may perhaps be a little blamed on account of their impropriety when introduced into a place so lately founded as was the paraclete but are so well imagined and highly painted that they demand excuse ye rugged rocks

silent grown i have not yet forgot myself to stone forget myself to marble is an expression of milton as is also caverns shaggd with horrid thorn and the epithets paleeyed and twilight are first used in the smaller poems of milton which pope had just perhaps been reading  she proceeds to enumerate the effects which abelards relation of their misfortunes has had upon her yet notwithstanding what she suffers from them she entreats him still to write v    yet write o write me all that i may join griefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine this is from the letters  per ipsum itaque christum

banished lover or some captive maid they live they speak they breathe what love inspires warm from the soul and faithful to it is fires it is to be hoped that some of the fair sex of the abilities of

excuse the blush and pour out all the heart de quibuscunque autem nobis scribas non parvum nobis remedium conferes hoc saltem uno quod te nostri memorem esse monstrabis she then quotes epist p    an unnecessary passage of seneca and adds si imagines nobis amicorum absentium jucundae sunt quae memoriam renovant and desiderium absentiae falso atque inani solatio levant quanto jucundiores sunt literae quae amici absentis veras notas afferunt the origin of eloisas passion is with much art and knowledge of human nature ascribed to her admiration of her handsome preceptor this circumstance is

expectavi et si uxoris nomen sanctius ac validius videtur dulcius mihi semper extitit amicae vocabulum aut si non indigneris concubinae vel scorti  pope has added a very injudicious thought v    the jealous god when we profane his fires those restless passions in revenge inspires and again v    love free as air at fight of human ties spreads his light wings and in a moment flies it is improper for a person in the situation of eloisa to mention cupid mythology is here out of its place the letters also furnished the next thought v    not caesars empress would i deign to prove no make me mistress of the man i love   deum testem invoco si me augustus universo praesidens mundo matrimonii honor dignaretur totumque mihi orbem confirmaret in perpetuo praesidendum charius mihi and dignius videretur tua dici meretrix quam illius imperatrix next she describes their unparallelled happiness in the full and free enjoyment of their loves but all at once stops short and reclaims with eagerness as if she at that instant saw the dreadful scene alluded to v  00 alas how changed what sudden horrors rise a naked lover bound and bleeding lies where where was eloise her voice her hand her poniard had opposed the dire command barbarian stay that bloody stroke restrain the crime was common common be the pain it was difficult to speak of this catastrophe that befell abelard with any dignity and grace our poet however has done it i know not where castration is the chief cause of distress in any other poem except in a very extraordinary one of catullus where atys struck with madness by berecynthia in a fit of enthusiasm inflicts this punishment on himself after which he laments his condition in very pathetic strains the poem has been so little remarked on that i shall take the liberty of inserting the following passage in the speech of atys which is very dramatic full of spirit and sudden changes of passion egone a mea remota haec ferar in memora domo patria bonis amicis genitoribus abero abero foro palestra stadio gymnasiis miser ah miser querendum est etiam atque etiam anime quod enim genus figura est ego numquid abierim ego mulier  ego adolescens ego ephebus ego puer ego gymnasii fui flos ego eram decus olei mihi januae frequentes mihi limina tepida mihi floridis corollis redimita domus erat linquendum ubi esset orto mihi sole cubiculum egone deum ministra and cybeles famula ferar egone maenas ego mei pars ego vir sterilis ero ego viridis algida idae nive amicta loca colam ego vitam agam sub altis phrygiae columinibus ubi cerva sylvicultrix ubi aper nemorivagus jam jam dolet quod egi jam jam quoque paenitet this whole poem being of a strain superior to any thing in the roman poesy and more passionate and sublime than any part of virgil and being also so much above the tender and elegant genius of catullus whose name it bears inclines me to think it a translation from some grecian writer and perhaps if the reader will peruse the whole it will give him the truest notion of an old dithyrambic of any poem antiquity has left us the text is in some places much corrupted but enough remains pure and intelligible to place it at the head of latin poetry how strangely soever it has been neglected it ought to be observed that the seventh eighth and ninth lines of this quotation bear a wonderful resemblance to a fine passage in the book of job chapter    ver   and seq  one knows not which most to applaud the lively imagery the pathetic or the artful decency with which this trasaction is delicately hinted at in these most excellent lines which are the genuine voice of nature and passion and place the object intended to be impressed on the reader full in his sight  she next reminds abelard of the solemnity of her taking the veil from verse one hundred and six to one hundred and eighty four which are highly beautiful particularly these circumstances attending the rite  v     as with cold lips i kissed the sacred veil the shrines all trembled and the lamps grew pale these two circumstances are fancied with equal force and propriety and this supposed prognostic of the uneasiness she would undergo in the monastic life is very affecting but her passion intruded itself even in the midst of this awful act of devotion the strength of which she represents by this particular v     yet then to these dread altars as i drew not on the cross my eyes were fixed but you here she gives her fondness leave to expatiate into many luscious ideas v     still on that breast enamored let me lie still drink delicious poison from thy eye pant on thy lip and to thy heart be pressed and then follows a line exquisitely passionate and worthy the sensibility of sappho or of eloisa give all thou can  and let me dream the rest suddenly she here checks the torrent of this amorous transport  v     ah no  instruct me other joys to prize with other beauties charm my partial eyes full in my view set all the bright abode and make my soul quit abelard for god she puts him in mind of his being the father and founder of the monastery and entreats him to visit his flock on that account this topic is taken from the letters v     from the false world in early youth they fled by thee to mountains wilds and deserts led you raised these hallowed walls the desert smiled and paradise was opened in the wild nihil hic super alienum aedificasti fundamentum totum quod hic est tua creatio est solitudo haec feris tantum sive latronibus vacans nullam hominum habitationem noverat nullam domum habuerat in ipsis cubilibus ferarum in ipsis latibulis latronum ubi nec nominari deus solet divinum erexisti tabernaculum and spiritus sancti proprium dedicasti templum nihil ad hoc aedificandum ex regum vel principum opibus intulisti cum plurima posses and maxima ut quicquid fieret tibi soli posset ascribi which last sentence is finely improved by pope being at once heightened with pathos and poetic imagery and containing an oblique satire on benefactions raised by avarice or extorted by fear v     no weeping orphan saw his fathers stores our shrines irradiate or emblaze our floors no silver saints by dying misers given here bribed the rage of illrequited heaven but such plain roofs as piety could raise   no part of this poem or indeed of any of popes productions is so truly poetical and contains such strong painting as the passage to which we are now arrived  the description of the convent where popes religion certainly aided his fancy it is impossible to read it without being struck with a pensive pleasure and a sacred awe at the solemnity of the scene so picturesque are the epithets v     in these lone walls their days eternal bound these mossgrown domes with spiry turrets crowned where awful arches make a noonday night and the dim windows shed a solemn light thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray all the circumstances that can amuse and sooth the mind of a solitary are next enumerated in this expressive manner and the reader that shall be disgusted at the length of the quotation i pronounce has no taste either for painting or poetry v     the darksome pines that over yon rocks reclined wave high and murmur to the hollow wind the wandering streams that shine between the hills the grots that echo to the tinckling rills the dying gales that pant upon the trees the lakes that quiver to the curling breeze no more these scenes my meditation aid or lull to rest the visionary maid the effect and influence of melancholy who is beautifully personified on every object that occurs and on every part of the convent cannot be too much applauded or too often read as it is founded on nature and experience that temper of mind casts a gloom on all things v     but over the twilight groves and dusky caves longsounding isles and intermingled graves black melancholy sits and round her throws a deathlike silence and a dread repose her gloomy presence saddens all the scene shades every flower and darkens every green deepens the murmur of the falling floods and breathes a browner horror on the woods the figurative expressions throws and breathes and browner horror are i verily believe the strongest and boldest in the english language the image of the goddess melancholy sitting over the convent and as it were expanding her dreadful wings over its whole circuit and diffusing her gloom all around it is truly sublime and strongly conceived  eloisa proceeds to give an account of the opposite sentiments that divide and disturb her soul these are hinted in the letters also v   0 ah wretch believed the spouse of god in vain confessed within the slave of love and man i ought to grieve but cannot what i ought i mourn the lover not lament the fault this however is improved greatly on the original castam me praedicant qui non deprehendunt hypocritam  quomodo paenitentia peccatorum quantacunque sit corporis afflictio si mens adhuc ipsam peccandi retinet voluntatem and pristinis aestuat desideriis epist p    she then fondly calls on abelard for assistance v  00 o come o teach me nature to subdue renounce my love my life myself and  you till my fond heart win god alone for he alone can rival can succeed to thee fired with this idea of religion she takes occasion to dwell on the happiness of a blameless vestal one who has no such sin on her conscience as she has to bemoan the life of such an one is described at length by such sorts of pleasure as none but a spotless nun can partake of the climax of her happiness is finely conducted v     for her the spouse prepares the bridal ring for her white virgins hymeneals sing for her the unfading rose of eden blooms and wings of seraphs shed divine persumes to sounds of heavenly harps she dies away and melts in visions of eternal day what a judicious and poetical use has pope here made of the opinions of the mystics and quietists how would fenelon have been delighted with these lines true poetry after all cannot well subsist at least is never so striking without a tincture of enthufiasm the sudden transition has a fine effect v     far other dreams my erring soul employ far other raptures of unholy joy which raptures are painted with much sensibility and in very animating colors nec etiam dormienti suis illusionibus parcunt ep p   again v     oh cursed dear horrors of allconscious night how glowing guilt exalts the keen delight this is very forceibly expressed she proceeds to recount a dream in which i was always heavily disappointed because the imagined distress is such as might attend the dreams of any person whatever it is partly from didos dream v      methinks we wandering go through dreary wastes and weep each others woe where round some mouldring tower pale ivy creeps and low browd rocks hang nodding over the deeps sudden you mount you beckon from the skies clouds interpose etc these are indisputably picturesque lines but what i want is a vision of some such appropriated and peculiar distress as could be incident to none but eloisa and which should be drawn from and have reference to her single story what distinguishes homer and shakespeare from all other poets is that they do not give their readers general ideas every image is the particular and unalienable property of the person who uses it it is suited to no other it is made for him or her alone even virgil himself is not free from this fault but is frequently general and indiscriminating where homer is minutely circumstantial she next compares his situation with her own v   0 for thee the fates severely kind ordain a cool suspense from pleasure and from pain thy life a long dead calm of fixed repose the four fimiles that follow drawn from religion are admirable  no pulse that riots and no blood that glows here eloisa glances with great modesty and delicacy at the irreparable misfortune of her mutilated husband which however she always mentions with regret i question whether it may be improper to alleviate the dryness of these critical remarks with the following story which i wish had fallen into the hands of fontaine the greeks waged war upon the duke of benevento and made him very uneasy thedbald marquis of spoleto his ally marching to his assistance and having taken some prisoners ordered them to be castrated and in that condition sent them back to the greek general with orders to tell him that he had done it to oblige the emperor whom he knew to be a lover of eunuchs and that he would endeavor to send him in a short time a much greater number of them the marquis was preparing to be as good as his word when one day a woman whose husband had been taken prisoner came all in tears to the camp and begged to speak to thedbald the marquis having asked her the cause of her grief my lord says she i wonder that such a valiant hero as you should trifle away your time in warring with women when men are unable to resist you thedbald replied that since the days of the amazons he had never heard that war had been made upon women my lord answered the greek woman can a crueller be made upon us than to deprive our husbands of what gives us health pleasure and children when you make eunuchs of them it is mutilating us not them you have lately taken away our cattle and goods without any complaint from me but this being an irreparable loss to several of my neighbors i could not avoid imploring the compassion of the conqueror the whole army was so pleased with this womans ingenuous declaration that they restored her husband to her and all they had taken from her as she was going away thedbald asked her what she would be willing should be done to her husband if he was found in arms again he has eyes said she a nose hands and feet these are his own which you may take from him if he deserves it but leave him if you please what belongs to me bibliotheque universelle tom    p  0   a hint in the letters has been beautifully heightened and elevated into exquisite poetry in the next paragraph eloisa says only inter ipsa missarum solemnia ubi purior esse debeat oration obscoena earum voluptatum phantasmata its sibi penitus miserrimam captivant animam ut turpitudinibus illis magis quam orationi vacem nec solum quae egimus sed loca pariter and tempora  let us see how this has been improved v     what scenes appear wherever i turn my view the dear ideas where i fly pursue rise in the grove before the altar rise  then follows a circumstance peculiarly tender and proper as it refers to a particular excellence of abelard v     thy voice i seem in every hymn to hear with every bead i drop too soft a tear to which succeeds that sublime description of a high mass which came from the poets soul and is very striking v     when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll and swelling organs lift the rising soul one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight priests tapers temples swim before my sight in seas of flame my plunging soul is drowned while altars blaze and angels tremble round   i believe few persons have ever been present at the celebrating a mass in a good choir but have been extremely affected with awe if not with devotion which ought to put us on our guard against the insinuating nature of so pompous and alluring a religion as popery lord bolingbroke being one day present at this solemnity in the chapel at versailles and seeing the archbishop of paris elevate the host whispered his companion the marquis de  if i were king of france i would always perform this ceremony myself  eloisa now acknowledges the weakness of her religious efforts and gives herself up to the prevalence of her passion v   0 come with one glance of those deluding eyes blot out each bright idea of the skies take back that grace that sorrow and these tears take back my fruitless penitence and prayers snatch me just mounting from the blessed abode assist the fiends and tear me from my god suddenly religion rushes back on her mind and she exclaims eagerly v  00 no fly me fly me far as pole to pole  ah come not write not think not once of me nor share one pang of all i felt for thee thy oaths i quit thy memory resign forget renounce me hate whatever was mine this change is judicious and moving and the following invocation to hope faith and christian grace to come and take full possession of her soul is solemn and suited to the condition of her mind for it seems to be the poets intention to show the force of religion over passion at last and to represent her as a little calm and resigned to her destiny and way of life to fix her in which holy temper the circumstance that follows may be supposed to contribute for she relates an incident to abelard which had made a very deep impression on her mind and cannot fail of making an equal one on the mind of those readers who can relish true poetry and strong imagery the scene she paints is awful she represents herself lying on a tomb and thinking she heard some v  0  spirit calling to her in every low wind  virgil may however have given the hint  hinc exaudiri voces and verba vocantis visa viri  l     0 here as i watched the dying lamps around from yonder shrine i heard a hollow found come sister come if said or seemed to say thy place is here sad sister come away once like thyself i trembled wept and prayed it is well contrived that this invisible speaker should be a person that had been under the very same kind of misfortunes with eloisa  loves victim then but now a sainted maid this scene would make a fine subject for the pencil and is worthy a capital painter he might place eloisa in the long i will of a great gothic church a lamp should hang over her head whose dim and dismal ray should afford only light enough to make darkness visible she herself should be represented in the instant when she first hears this aerial voice and in the attitude of starting round with astonishment and fear and this was the method a very great master took to paint a sound if i may be allowed the expression this subject was the baptism of jesus christ and in order to bring into this subject the remarkable incident of the voice from heaven which cried aloud this is my beloved son he represented all the assembly that attended on the banks of jordan gazing up into heaven with the utmost ardor of amazement  at this call of a sister in misfortune who had been visited with a sad similitude of griefs with her own eloisa breaks out in a religious transport i come i come prepare your roseate bowers celestial palms and everblooming flowers thither where sinners may have rest i go she then calls on abelard to pay her the last sad offices and to be present with her in the article of death see my lips tremble and my eyeballs roll  and then a circumstance of personal fondness intervenes suck my last breath and catch the flying soul but she instantly corrects herself and would have her abelard attend her at these last solemn moments only as a devout priest and not as a fond lover the image in which she represents him coming to administer extreme unction is striking and picturesque ah no  in sacred vestnts may thou stand the hallowed taper the words printed in italics ought to be looked on as particularly beautiful trembling in thy hand present the cross before my lifted eye teach me at once and learn of me to die she adds that it will be some consolation to behold him once more though even in the agonies of death ah then thy oncelovd eloisa see it will be then no crime to gaze on me which last line i could never read without great emotion it is at once so pathetic and so artfully points back to the whole train and nature of their misfortunes the circumstances she wishes may attend the death of abelard are poetically imagined and are also agreeable to the notions of mystic devotion the death of st jerome is finely painted by domenichino with such attendant particulars v   0 in trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drowned bright clouds descend and angels watch thee round from opening skies may streaming glories shine and saints embrace thee with a love like mine may one kind grave unite each hapless name and graft my love immortal on thy fame this wish was fulfilled the body of abelard who died twenty years before eloisa was sent to eloisa who interred it in the monastery of the paraclete and it was accompanied with a very extraordinary form of absolution from the famous peter de clugny ego petrus cluniacensis abbas qui petrum abelardum in monachum cluniacensem recepi and corpus ejus furtim delatum heloissae abbatissae and monialibus paracleti concessi auctoritate omnipotentis dei and omnium sanctorum absolvo eum suo officio ab omnibus peccatis suis  eloisa herself says melanges t   p    vigneul marville solicited for this absolution and peter de clugny willingly granted it on what it could be founded i leave to our learned theologists to determine in certain ages opinions have prevailed for which no solid reason can be given when eloisa died in      she was interred by the side of her beloved husband i must not forget to mention for the sake of those who are fond of miracles that when she was put into the grave abelard stretched out his arms to receive her and closely embraced her  eloisa at the conclusion of the epistle to which we are now arrived is judiciously represented as gradually settling into a tranquillity of mind and seemingly reconciled to her fate she can bear to speak of their being buried together without violent emotions two lovers are introduced as visiting their celebrated tombs and the behavior of these strangers is finely imagined v     from the full quire when loud hosannas rise and swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice amid that scene if some relenting eye glance on the stone where our cold relics lie devotions self shall steal a thought from heaven one human tear shall drop  and be forgiven with this line in my opinion the poem should have ended for the eight additional ones concerning some poet that happily might arise to sing their misfortunes are languid and flat and diminish the pathos of the foregoing sentiments they might stand for the conclusion of almost any story  this epistle is on the whole one of the most highly finished and certainly the most interesting of the pieces of our author and together with the elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady is the only instance of the pathetic pope has given us i think one may venture to remark that the reputation of pope as a poet among posterity will be principally owing to his windsorforest his rape of the lock and his eloisa to abelard whilst the facts and characters alluded to and exposed in his later writings will be forgotten and unknown and their poignancy and propriety little relished for wit and satire are transitory and perishable but nature and passion are eternal  end of the first volume
