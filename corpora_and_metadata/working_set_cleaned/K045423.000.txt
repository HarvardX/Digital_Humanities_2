mentioned in the last part of this history that the chief reason which had drawn mr worthy to visit his friend just at the present time was that mr bragwell had a small estate to sell by auction mr worthy though he did not think he should be a bidder wished to be present as he had business to settle with one or two persons who were expected at the golden lion on that day and he had put off this visit till he had seen the sale adverised in the county paper  mr bragwell and mr worthy set out early on the monday morning on their way to the golden lion a small inn in a neighboring market town as they had time before them they had agreed to ride slowly that they might converse on some useful subject but here as usual they had two opinions about the same thing mr bragwells notion of an useful subject was something by which money was to be got and a good bargain struck mr worthy was no less a man of business than his friend his schemes were wise and his calculations just his reputation for integrity and good sense made him the common judge and umpire in his neighbors affairs while no one paid a more exact attention to every transaction of his own but the business of getting money was not with him the first much less was it the whole concern of the day every morning when he rose he remembered that he had a maker to worship as well as a family to maintain religion however never made him neglect business though it sometimes led him to postpone it he used to say no man had any reason to expect gods blessing through the day who did not ask it in the morning but he had not the less sense spirit and activity when he was among men abroad because he had first served god at home  as these two farmers rode along mr worthy took occasion from the fineness of the day and the beauty of the country through which they passed to turn the discourse to the goodness of god and our infinite obligations to him he knew that the transition from thanksgiving to prayer would be natural and easy and he therefore slid by degrees into that important subject and he observed that secret prayer was a duty of universal obligation which every man had it in his power to fulfill and which he seriously believed was the ground work of all religious practice and of all devout affections  mr bragwell felt conscious that he was very negligent and irregular in the performance of this duty he considered it as a mere ceremony or at least as a duty which might give way to the slightest temptation of drowsiness at night or of business in the morning as he knew he did not live in the conscientious performance of this practice he tried to ward off the subject knowing what a home way his friend had of putting things at last he said he certainly thought private prayer a good custom especially for people who have time and that those who were sick or old or out of business could not do better but that for his part he believed much of these sort of things was not expected from men in active life  mr worthy i should think mr bragwell that those who are most exposed to temptation stand most in need of prayer now there are few methinks who are more exposed to temptation than men in business for those must be in most danger at least from the world who have most to do with it and if this be true ought we not to prepare ourselves in the closet for the trials of the market the field and the shop   bragwell for my part i think example is the whole of religion and if the master of a family is orderly and regular and goes to church he does every thing which can be required of him and no one has a right to call him to account for any thing more   worthy give me leave to say mr bragwell that highly as i rate a good example still i must set a good principle above it i must keep god order indeed for the sake of others but i must keep a good conscience for my own sake to god i owe secret piety i must therefore pray to him in private  to my family i owe a christian example and for that among other reasons i must not fail to go to church   bragwell you are talking mr worthy as if i were an enemy to christianity sir i am no heathen sir i belong to the church i always drink prosperity to the church you yourself as strict as you are in never missing it twice a day are not a warmer friend to the church than i am   worthy that is to say you know its value as an institution but you do not seem to know that a man may be very irreligious under the best religious institutions and that even the most excellent of them are but means of being religious and are no more religion itself than brick and mortar are prayers and thanksgivings i shall never think however high their profession and even however regular their attendance that those men truly respect the church who bring home little of that religion which is taught in it into their own families or their own hearts excuse me mr bragwell   bragwell mr worhy i am persuaded that religion is quite a proper thing for the poor and i dont think that the multitude can ever be kept in order without it and i am a bit of a politician you know   worthy your opinion is very just as far as it goes but it does not go far enough since it does not go to the root of the evil for while you value yourself on the soundness of this principle as a politician i wish you to see the reason of it as a christian depend upon it if religion be good for the community at large it is equally good for every family and what is right for a family is equally right for each individual in it you have therefore yourself brought the most unanswerable argument why you ought to be religious by asking how we shall keep others in order without religion for believe me mr bragwell there is no particular clause to except you in the gospel no exceptions in favor of any one class of men the same restraints which are necessary for the people at large are equally necessary for men of every order high and low rich and poor bond and free learned and ignorant may i ask you mr bragwell what is your reason for going to church   bragwell sir i am shocked at your question how can i avoid doing a thing so customary and so creditable not go to church indeed what do you take me for mr worthy i am afraid you suspect me to be a papist or a heathen or of some religion or other that is not what it should be   worthy if a foreigner were to hear how violently one set of christians in this country often speak against another how earnest would he suppose us all to be in religious matters and how astonished to discover that many a man has perhaps little other proof to give of the sincerity of his own religion except the violence with which he hates the religion of another party it is not irreligion which such men hate but the religion of the man or the party whom they are set against well you have told me why you go to church now pray tell me why do you confess there on your bended knees every sunday that you have erred and strayed from gods ways that there is no health in you that you have done what you ought not to do and that you are a miserable sinner   bragwell because it is in the common prayer book to be sure a book which i have heard you yourself say was written by wise and good men   worthy but have you no other reason   bragwell no i cannot say i have   worthy when you repeat that excellent form of confession do you really feel that you are a miserable sinner   bragwell no i cannot say i do but that is no objection to my repeating it because it may suit the case of many who are so i suppose the good doctors who drew it up intended that part for wicked people only such as drunkards and thieves and murderers for i imagine they could not well contrive to make the same prayer quite suit an honest man and a rogue and so i suppose they thought it safer to make a good man repeat a prayer which suited a rogue than to make a rogue repeat a prayer which suited a good man and you know it is so customary for every body to repeat the general confession that it cannot hurt the credit of the most respectable persons though every one must know they have no particular concern in it   worthy depend upon it mr bragwell those good doctors you speak of were not quite of your opinion they really thought that what you call honest men were grievous sinners in a certain sense and stood in need of making that humble confession mr bragwell do you believe in the fall of adam   bragwell to be sure i do and a sad thing for adam it was why it is in the bible is it not it is one of the prettiest chapters in genesis dont you believe it mr worthy   worthy yes truly i do but i dont believe it merely because i read it in genesis i know indeed that i am bound to believe every part of the word of god but i have still an additional reason for believing in the fall of the first man   bragwell have you indeed now i cannot guess what that can be   worthy why my own observation of what is within myself teaches me to believe it it is not only the third chapter of genesis which convinces me of the truth of the fall but also the sinful inclinations which i find in my own heart this is one of those leading truths of christianity of which i can never doubt a moment first because it is abundantly expressed or implied in scripture and next because the consciousness of the evil nature i carry about with me confirms the doctrine beyond all doubt besides is it not said in scripture that by one man sin entered into the world and that all we like sheep have gone astray that by one mans disobedience many were made sinners and so again in twenty more places that i could tell you of   bragwell well i never thought of this but is not this a very melancholy sort of doctrine mr worthy   worthy it is melancholy indeed if we stop here but while we are deploring this sad truth let us take comfort from another that as in adam all die so in christ shall all be made alive   bragwell yes i remember i thought those very fine words when i heard them said over my poor fathers grave but as it was in the burial of the dead i did not think of taking it to myself for i was then young and hearty and in little danger of dying and i have been so busy ever since that i have hardly had time to think of it   worthy and yet the service pronounced at the burial of all who die is a solemn admonition to all who live it is there said as indeed the scripture says also i am the resurrection and the life whosoever believes in me shall never die but i will raise him up at the last day now do you think you believe in christ mr bragwell   bragwell to be sure i do why you are always fancying me an atheist   worthy in order to believe in christ we must believe first in our own guilt and our own unworthiness and when we do this we shall see the use of a savior   bragwell why all this is a new way of talking i cannot say i ever meddled with such subject before in my life but now what do you advise a man to do upon your plan of religion   worthy why all this leads me back to the ground from which we set out i mean the duty of prayer for if we believe that we have an evil nature within us and that we stand in need of gods grace to help us and a savior to redeem us we shall be led of course to pray for what we so much need   bragwell well but dont you think mr worthy that you good folks who make so much of prayer have lower notions than we of the wisdom of the almighty you think he wants to be informed of the things you tell him whereas i take for granted that he knows them already and that being so good as he is he will give me everything he fees fit to give me without my asking it   worthy god indeed who knows all things knows what we want before we ask him but still has he not said that with prayer and supplication we must make known our requests unto him prayer is the way in which god has said that his favor must be sought it is the channel through which he has declared it is his sovereign will and pleasure that his blessings should be conveyed to us what ascends up in prayer descends again to us in blessings it is like the rain which just now fell and which had been drawn up from the ground in apours to the clouds before it descended from them o the earth in that refreshing shower besides prayer has a good effect on our own minds it tends to excite a right disposition toward god in us but above all it is the way to get the good things we want ask says the scripture and ye shall receive   bragwell now that is the very thing which i was going to deny for the truth is men dont always get what they ask i believe if i could get a good crop for asking it i should pray oftener than i do   worthy sometimes mr worthy men ask and receive not because they ask amiss they ask worldly blessings perhaps when they should ask spiritual ones now the latter which are the good things i spoke of are always granted to those who pray to god for them though the former are not i have observed in the case of some worldly things i have sought for that the grant of my prayer would have caused the misery of my life   bragwell and yet you continue to pray on i suppose   worthy certainly but then i try to mend as to the object of my prayers i pray for gods blessing and favor which is better than riches   bragwell you seem very earnest on this subject   worthy to cut the matter short i ask then whether prayer is not positively commanded in the gospel when this is the case we can never dispute about the necessity or the duty of a thing as we may when there is no such command here however let me just add also that a mans prayers may be turned to no small use in the way of discovering to him whatever is amiss in his life   bragwell how so mr worthy   worthy why suppose now you were to try yourself by turning into the shape of a prayer every practice in which you allow yourself for instance let the prayer in the morning be a sort of preparation for the deeds of the day and the prayer at night a sort of observation on those deeds you mr bragwell i suspect are a little inclined to covetousness excuse me sir now suppose after you have been during a whole day a little too eager to get rich suppose i say you were to try how it would sound to beg of god at night on your knees to give you still more money though you have already so much that you know not what to do with it suppose you were to pray in the morning o lord give me more riches though those i have are in snare and temptation to me and ask him in the same solemn manner to bless all the  means you intend to make use of in the day to add to your substance   bragwell mr worthy i have no patience with you for thinking i could be so wicked   worthy hear me out mr bragwell you turned your good nephew tom broad out of doors you know you owned to me it was an act of injustice now suppose on the morning of your doing so you had begged of god in a solemn act of prayer to prosper the deed of cruelty and oppression which you intended to commit i see you are shocked at the thought of such a prayer well then would not prayer have kept you from committing that wicked action in short what a life must that be no act of which you dare beg god to prosper and bless if once you can bring yourself to believe that it is your bounden duty to pray for gods blessing on your days work you will certainly grow careful about passing such a day as you may safely ask his blessing upon the remark may be carried to sports diversions company a man who once takes up the serious use of prayer will soon find himself obliged to abstain from such diversions occupations and societies as he cannot reasonably desire that god will bless to him and thus he will see himself compelled to leave off either the practice or the prayer now mr bragwell i need not ask you which of the two he that is a real christian will give up   mr bragwell began to feel that he had not the best of the argument and was afraid he was making no great figure in the eyes of his friend luckily however he was relieved from the difficulty into which the necessity of making some answer must have brought him by finding they were come to the end of their little journey and he never beheld the bunch of grapes which decorated the sign of the golden lion with more real satisfaction  i refer my readers for the
