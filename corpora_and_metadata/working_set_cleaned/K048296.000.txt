strange that authors who so rarely find their prayers can move an audience to be kind still send with piteous tone and look forlorn the prologue forth to deprecate your scorn such doleful heralds

tries her soothing balm pitys a crime his losty soul disdains and his pride feasts upon the poets pains yet now no critic rancour need we fear for liberal candor holds her empire here candor who scorns for little faults to pry but looks on merits with a partial eye and sure a bard whose muse so often has found the happy power to kindle mirth around though in her sportive moods averse to trace
