printed by j mallett and sold by the miss wises and mr sturch booksellers in newport and mr robert deacon of westcowes       to those gentlemen and ladies who occasionally visit the island for health or pleasure and express their admiration of its beauties and more particularly to those who are its stated residents and honorably distinguished by their hospitality and benevolence this poem is most respectfully inscribed by the editor  the isle of wight a poem in three cantos canto i thou precious gem in natures bosom placed with all her bounty all her beauty graced thou model of her wondrous vast design where all her wisdom all her grace combine to make in miniature her greatness show the almighty architect confessed below complete epitome for ever stand the perfect master piece of wisdoms hand to strike the astonished eye to charm the soul another paradise so near the pole in natures arms embraced her store designed where all extremes successive fill the mind where all the north can shake with his rude arm where all the south can sooth can gently warm alternate threaten and alternate charm thou little world divided from the great where pleasure sports and plenty rules in state where nature in her richest robe is dressed transparent robe distinguished from the rest thy summer mantle over the mountains thrown that blue aetherial gauze in eden known adorns thy hills thy valleys and thy shore and though it seems to hide reveals thee more thy summers revel with serenest pride thy silver seas roll murmuring near thy side the smoothest seas thy peaceful shores now lave and halcyons slumber on thy sliding wave ceres and flora bless thy teeming vales and load with fragrance sweet the passing gales far off on oceans smiling face they play and thy rich treasures to the pole convey thy fragrant breath now lulls the enamored deep all natures passions on her surface sleep thy crystal firmament now shines serene around the silver throne of nights pale queen whose golden gems with living luster glow reflected from the liquid glass below a mimic heaven in that bright mirror lives that mocks the true yet all its splendour gives here bounteous nature to her purpose true bestows her beauty and her picture too her picture here she must with pride survey her smiling likeness in its best array lo white inverted rocks upgrown with green their waving verdure in the ocean seen the downward trees with gentle bendings move obedient to the gale that breath of love soft whispering to the trembling leaves above the magic picture charms the gazers eye that seems to mingle with the stars and sky the stars and sky their mimic luster lend and with the rocks and verdure seem to blend the stars and sky their mimic luster lend and with the rocks and verdure seem to blend where pleasing shadowy shapes serene and pure in darkness visible in light obscure with doubtful certainty inchant the sight like the dim neutral dusk that mingles day with night what inbred raptures in my bosom swell when on the enchanting scene i silent dwell abstracted from myself still more and more the vision i revere the scene adore where truth and fiction all their charms reveal and sense and fancy at their feast regale where bribed reason banquets on the cheat and judgment triumphs in the wise deceit gay fancy here her flattering medium proves like each fond fallacy in life she loves where often appearance mocks the sanguine view and false attractives please as well as true delighted nature over this island dwells and to the deep her joyful story tells the deep returns it to the azure space and earth and heaven and ocean here embrace here day and night in sweet succession vie here spring and autumn glide melodious by the earliest harbingers that lead the year sweet philomela tunes her note first here first here her tuneful note begins to swell and here she takes her mournful sweet farewell the primrose here and swallow first are seen and here the groves put on their earliest green here fragrant gales first fan the teeming groves here little birds begin their vernal loves here zephyrs wave at first the vigorous wing here handmaid nature decks the fullrobd spring the summer loiters here with lagging grace and late reluctant yields to autumn place the tardy autumn pausing long gives way and mourns the twilight keen the shrinking day the shattered gossomer the stripping wind and sighing leaves his russet robe behind now winter in his turn asserts his reign and frowns upon the long untroubled main with blustering breath he bids the billows roll and sends the stormy message to the pole awakes the winds and bids them sudden roar around the yelling rocks and hollow shore with dignity disturbs the scene lo then with noble terror shakes the souls of men now neptunes haughty surge insults the walls flies over the roof and in the midland falls above the rocks these fighting whirlpools tower the lofty rocks and fall a misty shower like smoke from hot bellonas bowels fly darken the earth and intercept the sky now night with her black robe invelops all now horror hides the loud beleaguered ball with grandeur here wild winter roars around here echoing hills and rocks repeat the sound in harmony made grateful to the ear that strikes with majesty and awes with fear with pride the bold inhabitants endure the storm magnificent themselves secure triumphant here they hug their blissful lot and all this hostile rage is soon forgot not so where indias sun severely shines on diamond quarries deep on golden mines to ripen mischief with his burning ray and bring these earthborn evils forth to day here toiling slaves their time their life employ for what themselves nor we can never enjoy oh madding mortals spare your mother spare nor wounded nature to her vitals tare in quest of gold you cleave the groaning ground whilst earths deep center trembles at the wound why dig so deep why frenzys thirst improve since all that wisdom wants overflows above here natures fever unabating glows the scorching year no intermission knows no friendly interval the wretch can find no gentle jubilee no cooling wind no near expected change no genial springs the tiger tears him or the scorpion stings thrice happy britain born in natures prime thou queen of nations happy in thy clime thy seasons moderate as thy laws appear thy constitution wholesome as the year well poised and pregnant in thy annual round with wisdom where no fierce extreme is found where british wisdom copies natures law and mingles mildness often with state and awe where strength and freedom in their prime prevail and wealth comes wafted on each freighted gale where commerce lifts her flag with mighty hand and waves it round the world with wide command the willing world thy matchless flag explores ten thousand vessels from ten thousand shores with hasty keels obey thy wide command stretch over thy seas and rush upon thy strand see seel with ships the laboring ocean heave a different nation crowns each different wave the tribute of the globe to britain sent that dreaded queen of all the continent what floating forests whitening to the eye their different streamers as they draw more nigh in various colors decked in different mode display their treasure king and loved abode from india east and west see see what shoals from europes regions and the distant poles with amorous haste how emulous they meet to pour their treasures at britannias feet when here they pause this precious spot behold they look with scorn upon their gems and gold medinas shore with raptures they survey and lose the labors of the lengthened way each danger now is joyfully forgot each toil oerpaid by this delicious spot medina the capital river in the i sland so called it rises in the south and winding in a beautiful serpentine direction discharges itself into cowes harbor which divides the same nearly into equal hundreds from thence the one is called east and the other west medina  this river is only navigable from cowes to newport hail nor my weak verse refuse thou subject worthy of a miltons muse his muse improved by such a theme would be his own rich eden might compare with thee oh long unsung oh argument divine and shall at length the glorious task be mine that task descend to my inferior hand least  not least zealous of the tuneful band i feel my fancy kindle in the view and raptured as she leads the theme pursue the astonished muse must stand at silent gaze scarce knowing where to choose or what to praise amidst a crowded galaxy so bright where every object yields supreme delight a group so grateful to the sight and soul oerwhelms the heart and must the mind control yon beauteous hill by artless art embraced where russet plainness wears the robe of taste that nobly over the widespread landscape reigns above the extended strand and watery plains invites the muse with sweet majestic mien to climb the summit and enjoy the scene words would but wrong the wonder and amaze that in an instant fixed me all to gaze in silent raptures i some moments stand charmed with each object that adorns the land fixed to the spot tie downs leading to freshwater and speechless with surprise at such a vast expanse of sea and skies of woods of valleys and of bluerobd hills the groupe with ecstasy my bosom fills each faculty but wonder i lay by transported in the twinkling of an eye by natures utmost boast expanded wide her utmost beauty and her utmost pride the gorgeous ships see glide promiscuous by that strike with harmony the ravished eye their form their fashions and their shining sides that glitter in the sun and gild the tides their flying streamers and their pregnant sails that court the eye and gather all the gales in scant perspective now at distance shine now sweeping nearer to the banks incline in all their outspread grandeur full confessed as if for some solemnity they dressed their beauteous fabrics in the watery glass saluting still this summit as they pass their streamers and their sails they glad display with pleasing triumph and with proud delay still traversing in labyrinths the deep whilst all their order and their courses keep opposing now they meet now lose now gain now some the harbor seek now some the main the tall first rates their towering splendors show and look superior on the crowd below harmonious to the guiding helm they sail whilst voices often and music crown the gale so when britannias matchless dames unite their shining charms on georges natal night like constellations gliding in the dance with mixed modes serene they now advance now stately turn with measured step around in mazes sweet obedient to the sound the coy profile see frugal now addressed now the full face now beauteous form confessed with various attitudes they graceful sway with various charms and bear the soul away my praise on truth not fictions wing would rise whilst gratitude my want of wit supplies respect not pride provokes my muse to soar as wrens like eagles may the sun explore end of the first canto canto ii needle rocks   now wafted slowly by the indented shore with panting heart the those celebrated rocks so much admired at the west end of the isle needles we explore nor feel the kind digressions on the way the beckoning welcome that invite our stay from banks from buildings and from smiling groves or gently rising hills that caeres loves no neighboring charms attract the impatient sight by distant wonders drawn and dread delight forestalling neptune at each sturdy stroke the wind and tide with passion we provoke accusing time and straining for yon rock from his long pausing pole we tear the lock such throbbing fervours filled our hearts the while to reach this wonder of medinas isle the breeze at length and neptune hears our prayer and quick recoiling shore our speed declare see backward now the norman the new forest opposite the island made by william the i duke of normandy in  0   which he did merely to promote his pleasure and was looked upon then as one of the most intolerable and inexcusable pieces of cruelty that not only he himself but every other prince did for be destroyed    parish churches with the houses and possessions of so many township to make them habitations for wild beasts  but such cruel and tyrannical acts the editor does not mean to comment on but only say that william rufes his son and successor to the crown as he was hunting at choringham in the new forest he struck a deer lightly with an arrow and stayed his horse to look after the deer holding his hands before his eyes because the sunbeams dazzled his sight another deer crossing the way sir walter tirrell a norman his kinsman shooting at it too carelessly or too steadily at the king shot him full on the breast and killed him the  d august   00 sir john hayward forest glide see hursts strong castle rooted in the tide and now the ocean opens to our eyes see ships like clouds from out the offing rise the needles now with dawning gleams appear like the gray glimpses when the morn is near that whiter grows as boreas mends the breeze their bluish mantle fading by degrees is vanished now the rocks are now expressed and beauty stands before us all undressed with tempting majesty serene yet coy that damps at once at once provokes our joy conceding gradual with a placid mien where grandeur mixed with gentleness is seen where both agree with wide extended arms to clasp the gazer to their mingled charms the verdent velvet robe is cast above as needless in the naked task of love see see how fancy on that bed is caught with all that iris in her webb has wrought where all the tints that in her loom delight on yonder bank salute the raptured sight the rainbows radiance and commingled ray in shining strata of refulgent clay seem emulous of that which reigns on high here earth contends with beauties of the sky the enchanting slope with sweet attraction draws the eager heart and yet it is ardour awes as conscious of some wondrous scene behind that with prodigious grandeur damp the mind by some prophetic energy impressed that from this specimen concludes the rest and lo the outguards detached rocks that have those appearances  fixed that boldly brave the storm indignant and the advancing wave in hostile wise with sharpened spears they stand amid the floods at natures great command in postures changing as we draw more near like watchful warriors old implanted there that face us various as we winding go and challenge still and still arrest the foe but see lots wife one of the rocks so called formerly but some years ago gave way to a tempest as particularly described by mr sturch in his view of the isle of wight to which this is submitted as no improper companion  for fame has called her so with stately stature and with robes that flow majestic lofty lke some sea born queen adjust her tresses in the mirror green her tresses there assume the noblest forms the rocks her toilet and her comb the storms her fashions are put on by natures hand and curls in characters unchanged stand now swallowed up with greatness fear and joy let taste and wonder all the soul employ lo natures hand has here enormous wrought beyond the grasp of sense the reach of thought here awe struck reason must in silence pause lay down her scepter and suspend her laws unable on her gradual steps to climb the dreadful summit of this vast sublime how all impressions of the mind are changed the heart distended and the head derangd the height above the wave fatigues the eye for the strained nerve can scarcely reach so high above the proudest pitch of roman style of pompeys theater or trajans pile this awful edifice commands the waves by nature built the boisterous billow braves the god of ocean here his palace keeps and sends his mandates over the distant deeps the voice in eddies through the cliff is tossed and all the sense in half the space is lost in half the space is mingled with the air by echos force annihilated there hark how the thunders of the exploding gun that often in loud prolific mazes stun the ear beget a thousand vollies as they run whilst over head the concave seems alive like bees in millions swarming from the hive the sea birds darken all the living space that look no larger than the insect race that wheel around disturbed with clamours call or fall transfixed increasing as they fall now whirling nearer to the impatient eye they dash upon the wave and dashing die shooting the birds under the cliffs of freshwater is a frequent diversion  it is described in the pamphlet before referred to with some humane reflections  the editor attempts not to interpose an opinion on the practice but the sight of the cliffs and the vast number of birds is truly one of natures curiosities  the billows bowing with profoundest sweep would pay their homage to the amazing steep with grandeur rolling as they lofty climb for every incident must be sublime now now through galileos orb we spy these startled millions in their ranks on high in stories raised with agitated breasts before the portals of their guarded nests tier above tier consulting in a fright as erst the roman capitol by night how sweetly through the tellescope they show their crimson heads erect and breasts of snow in motion much disturbed with troubled mind like roses ruffld by the invading wind till scared again no longer watch they keep but sore aloft or dive into the deep or anxious flutter flapping feebly spring from wave to wave upon the wounded wing again we gaze again the soul we fill here all her faculties are feasted still with true magnificence sublime and rare and see a thousand guests the banquet share a fleet of barks impatient pressing nigh to view these wonders and the needles eye till sated with delight through that they sail and give their canvass to the unwilling gale now round the islands rocky sides we row those towering rocks that like strong ramparts grow that firm against the gallic inroads stand these bulwarks raised by natures hostile hand that like the line of beauty waving rise in lofty labyrinths to meet the skies that awful frown with overlooking pride upon the subject beach and guarded tide with rustic odours decked and high hung bloom that all the rocks array the shores perfume where grandeur swells along the sounding length where fear with joy and beauty blends with strength extatic bliss now summer crowns the space like melted silver see the oceans face lo rapture triumphs through the glad expanse see glittering sun beams on the surface dance like natures courtiers on some festal day when calms consent and phoebus weds the sea the season now with transport charms the eye and nature shifts the scene as we sail by on every varying rock we fix the sight the rock behind affords some new delight thus in some space by genius made alive some gallery where art and nature strive where wonders breathe along the living wall and figures from the ceiling seem to fall detatchd by art the force of shade and light that menace from on high the amazed sight in rounded groupes successive still we view superior wonders and these wonders new from form to form with wonder we survey the magic labors of the massy way the swelling figures and the shining coast till in the vast variety we are lost now echo empress of the cavernd space returns our music with a rich increase our hearts beat time we quaff the enchanting gales we pity lewis and we scorn versailles the sleeping surface unperceived we plow for time and space have lost their measure now cowes castle   till steephills a beautiful villa of the honorable mr tollemache bending cliffs their pride display and point the paradise at underway the intermediate tract of land between steephill cliffs and the sea shore is so called by the inhabitants  the cliffs are a wonderful production of nature and wear the appearance of a regular wall the bold design and effect of indefatigable art they extend nearly four miles and the vale below is not only amazingly fertile but so various in its form and so interspersed with rocks of grotesque shape as the poet has described it that the wildly pleasing and ust are no where to be met with in mure happy combination  to give a complete idea of these perfections would require the united powers of claude salvator and poussin  the first should throw his delicate sunshine over the cultivated fields the scattered dots and hanging coppices the second should dash out the horror of the rugged cliffs steeps and ocean while the grand pencil of poussin should crown the whole with the majesty of the impending mountains  the editor cannot help adding that a walk by moonlight at which time the many waterfalls are heared in all their variety of sounds in this enchanting situation opens a scene of such delicate beauty repose and solemnity as exceeds all description  attention now begins once more to rise and sated raptures yield to new surprise now now an aggregate unseen before of new raised wonders mantle all the shore a miscellania fixed and firm as fate of all that is beautiful of all that is great where all that nature to her children gives where health with plenty and enjoyment lives where elegance ascends the enormous steep with verdant robe and shades the distant deep here nature triumphs in her guarded ground and fortifies the envied shores around in angles bastions and in platforms cast that ape the present and excel the past work above work like theaters they climb with myrtle crowned with wormwood and wild thyme in mingled climax dubious they advance that look like order now and now like chance the ambitious cliff the crystal vault invades refreshed by gushing springs and clear cascades that murmuring down the craggy falls we hear and feast the fancy through the astonished ear the impatient fancy throbs for new delight and now she banquets through the ravished sight the rivulets see rushing from on high that give such pleasure to the ear and eye that through the grottos rocks and gardens glide and the glad soul with sweet extremes divide extremes that with such grand confusion shine like chaos now and now a plan divine how nature varies through the concave wide and riots wanton with enormous pride behold a wall by natures potent hand aloft over all the extended outworks stand like sentinels the extended outworks show to watch the motion of the flood below in loose light troops the vagrant rocks appear on wild excursion scattered here and there whilst all around within the entrenched space see pleasure bloom and plenty mixed with grace from pendant plots see nodding caeres send the pregnant ears that with the breezes bend their pondrous growth amidst the rocks on high and with their tawny tinges charm the eye there golden plenty on her throne is seen and all the lawns pay homage to their queen in ributes arrayed by wisdoms hands above the prostrate laws of vulgar lands with majesty the wheaten groves appear that look like prodigies implanted there from forth the furrow rich the leveret see come hopping forward with exulting glee fearless of hounds a stranger to the cry in full security he feeds on high the pheasants here with happy freedom roam from brake to brake amidst their native home with peaceful leisure unalarmd they spring from tree to tree and wave the golden wing the lark the thrush in loves sweet concerts call their mates among the murmuring rills that fall from rock to rock whilst echo answers all can british taste the raptured scene forego where pisgahs springs and edens fountains flow where natures noblest growths the rocks adorn with oaks with herbage and sicilian corn where all the mavelous to mankind gives with meek simplicity and order lives where health upon the hills the heart regales and plenty wantons in the laughing vales where epic composition seems to climb like homers illiads to the last sublime where native grandeur reigns through every part and looks with pity down on laboring art what cultivated plans should here arise what stately columns glitter in the skies what rich rotundas on the rocks should shine by stanhope raised and stuarts james stuart esquire commonly called athaenian stuart hand divine mecaenas and vitruvius here should tell where taste should flourish and where worth should dwell when summers ardent suns intensely press to thoughtful coverts and to cool recess her grand campania britain here should keep here wisdom should awake and faction sleep ambition here from racking dreams should rest and envy quell the fury in her breast in purest worth the patriot here should pride and fling the foibles of the soul aside pure virtue here with nature should remain and science over the peaceful province reign the sons of genius here should hasty throng the sons of picture and the sons of song here stubbs and reynolds should enrich their store here wilson warm and barrett shine still more historic west should here inform the glade here ships and rocks for wright are ready made here gray that moral nightingale should sing and friendly goldsmith prune the traveled wing soft mason here might court the tragic queen in british strains and raise the attic scene nay akenside should here didactic glow the fairest attitudes of things to show armstrong to rules of health here sweet persuade dispense his learning and destroy his trade diseases here on art but seldom call unfeard an agueish spring or sickly fall but should the fiend in spite of natures claim dare to approach and shake the human frame gentlemen of eminent knowledge and distinction in the medical line in newport cowlams or jolliffes or young bassetts care would soon the temporary ill repair here sharp his native note should raptured raise in freedoms contest and in vectas praise his countrys charms should all his fancy fire should all his virtue all his verse inspire to truth attached to patriot truth still dear in action faithful and in word sincere his happy talents at this mark still aim on public worth to build his private fame thrice happy bard in fortunes arms caressed by virtue shielded and by beauty blessed thy finished bliss can feel no feigned alloy the chaste cleora crowns thy perfect joy and see the pledges of your rapture rise like tendril vines beneath indulgent skies whose genial dews call forth the branch to grow the bloom to brighten and the blossom blow whilst time in season shall the fruit display with ripening blush and your soft toil repay on yon tall cliff whose brows oerlook the deep true taste shall soon her polished mansion keep thither shall connoisseurs in crowds repair another tusculum shall flourish there there british tullys bacons shall arise at once be happy and at once be wise there awful nature civilized by art shall win at once the head and charm the heart there greece and rome shall deck the ample space with homers grandeur and with virgils grace the chizel and the pencil there shall strive to make the cieling and the walls alive the peopled canvass shall the sight surprise and the rough rocks in human shapes shall rise the beauteous savage shall with social air another athens on the hills appear that to the clouds her comely head shall raise and on her image in the ocean gaze the ocean at her feet shall silent sleep and boast the picture in the polished deep the sun unheeded in his prone decline we feast abstracted on the scene divine and turning often with pausing fond delay we bid a sweet farewell to underway whilst deep engraved reflection long shall find the groupe immense within the expanded mind impressed in images sublime and fair which mimic fancy often retraces there over hills over valleys we alternate go like basins filled with gems the valleys show with gardens rich replete with sylvan domes where health and pleasure keep their happy homes again we climb the rich inviting hill again the same glad scenes salute us still that still new tribute from our wonder claim another paradise and yet the same though still enriched with something grand and new some rock in prospect over the ocean blue some stately steeple in it is ivy vest by frolic time in different mantles dressed that like some gothic king by turrets crowned reigns over the farms and villages around through farms and villages we joyful ride where british ceres in her indian pride with ripening plenty loads the shelving field the reaper here can scarce his sickle wield encumbered by the blessings thick at hand of heavens indulgence and the fruitful land the farmer views the oppressive crops with pride and bids his garners and his heart grow wide there neptunes throne commonly called shanklin chine attracts the ambitious eye that bears upon it is breast the incumbent sky that all the greedy soul with transport fills the boundless ocean and the sky kissed hills by turns solicit the divided sight by turns amaze us and by turns delight with arduous steps impatient now we climb with panting hearts we view the scene sublime where pleasure meets with health where both combine to quaff the gale and view the amazing chine the monarch of the main from his high car beheld this proud phenomenon from far whose swelling cliffs their dubious heads advance where nature seems to steal the sketch from chance and art to mingle both with plastic hand so regularly wild these wonders stand in heterogeneous piles that strong impart the grand coincidence of chance and art the god of ocean saw this scene with pride and rushing hasty on a high spring tide the waves at once their monarchs voice obey the surge assaults the cliff the cliff gives way his lifted trident with one stroke divine cleaves the vast rock and forms the wondrous chine a dread abrupt deep rends the groaning hill with yawn terrific at great neptunes will a thousand stately forms their pride disclose and groves and grottos in an instant rose with copious caverns and with sounding rills that all the echoing space responsive fills the waves rush in the winds exulting roar the ocean triumphs on the altered shore then spoke the god who rules the alternate tide let all my vital virtues here preside my healing essence in each wave abound breathe in the air and brood upon the ground let here disease within my bosom find strength to the nerve and vigor to the mind let thousands here in thankful throngs resort with votive offerings to my sacred court here here high fix the tablet of their vows as at my other sacred ane at cowes for here my court shall all the main command my trident here and here my car shall stand my throne i will raise on you celestial down there wield my scepter and there fix my crown end of the second canto canto iii amid the monuments that mark this land behold on high the lofty carisbrook stand at distance with surprise and pleasure seen in gothic attributes and warlike mien a witness there of crimes that long has stood of british crimes confessed and danish blood the mark of savage guilt and civil rage a monument of wrath from age to age what bloody battles near thy base were fought how dear the day and conquered field were bought proud story paints thy sanguine deeds of yore thy precipice over whelmed with human gore thy little world was ravaged like the great here time has drawn the horrid scene of fate blind fortune here her various webb has wrought here savage caesars and rude pompeys fought such tragic woes were acted here of yore which grief regrets and time laments no more by dark oblivion in his list enrolled but modern mischiefs with a tear are told but let them pass let love reser the strain to peace to plenty and to georges reign look round see art and nature in their pride the neighboring newport and the forest wide the royal forest rich with rural dies beneath the castles foot see carisbrook rise delightful village mentioned often by fame that to the lofty fortress gives it is name that seems to slide adown the adjacent hill the trees the steeple and the houses fill with pleasing glad alternatives the sight that mingle moral gloom with natures light from fracturd battlements and broken walls where horrors curtain over the fancy falls but now the sun in all his glory dressed beats fiercely with his rays upon my breast to yon inviting arbours cool retreat i will turn and shield me from the oppressive heat and seated by marias carisbrooke river so called from the church above being dedicated to the virgin mary  the river which rises about two miles above the village and meanders through the meads on the northwest side of newport is remarkable for the number of mills upon it  there being seven of considerable consequence within a mile and a half the several ponds which are seen from the hill or break upon the eye in walking to the castle have a fine effect and if their borders were more under the culture of taste would form patches of beauty to rival the most delicate ornaments of piedmont gentle stream review my numbers and admire my theme here the gay woodbine hangs from every bough her lucid drops and jessmines pure as snow have lined the green alcove fit haunt for those who know the calm delights the muse bestows here peace and plenty dwell nor care nor fear nor bold intruding follies enter here hail ye refreshing shades my bosom feels your cheering power as from the fervid hills faint i retire my spirits flow again and genius pours new vigor through my strain oh see what pleasing landscapes shine from far in contrast to the rage of civil war a continent out spread to pleasures view for ever beautiful for ever new where nature triumphs in her genial toil who faster can produce than war can spoil how plenty there with pleasure joins the hand smiles on the sea and swells upon the land lo ashy down where angels often might play as erst at eden in their bright array appears at distance to the longing eye a paradise just fallen from the sky let down for innocence and joy to kiss a stage of pleasure and a scene of bliss exulting there on high it joyful reigns over waving valleys and over wooded plains there sweet variety the picture draws from natures hand that gives to art it is laws there art and nature in sweet league combine on earth producing images divine such specimens to sense with rapture tell how beauty rose ever human nature fell descending now the slopes that gently show where newport newport is the capital of the island and famous for it is prodigious market of wheat the plentiful production it affords of poultry butter etc and above all remarkable for the striking figures it exhibits of exquisite female neatness and enchanting beauty rises on the plain below newport in decent character displayed a wealthy dame in comely weeds arrayed serene and smiling at her happy state by health by plenty crowned content not great the capital confessed where ceres reigns with indian plenty over medinas plains where stretching from her weekly throne the hand she glads the vitals of britannias land where navigation loiters on the tide to gaze on natures charms from side to side that plows with double appetite the flood for private pleasure and for public good this other thames whose banks with plenty smile this thames in little and this narrow nile by natures hand enticed by beauty led along the windings of it is fruitful bed equal to nile and thames for fertile grace it gains in beauty what it wants in space the seaman ravished by the hills and plains pursues his pleasure and forgets his gains the helm let go he gazes all around he dreads no lurking rock or dangerous ground rich profit here and rapture hand in hand allure each other and the soul command the swelling bounty neptunes chariot rides on teeming billows and alternate tides lo whippinghamhill the muse must long command fair object of the variegated land what mingled beauties strike the ravished sight here contemplation feels supreme delight doats on the prospect that it is summit shows while stretched around
