letters from yorick to eliza  london printed for w johnston no    ludgate street mdcclxxiii  to the right honorable lord apsley lord high chancellor of england my lord the editor of the following letters is so far from having tasted your lordships bounty that he is and perhaps ever must remain a stranger to your person consequently no adulation is to be apprehended from him  he leaves it to the weak and oppressed the widow and orphan to proclaim your lordships virtues in your public capacity that which he would celebrate is of a private nature namely your filial affection which is so conspicuous that he flatters himself a volume of letters written by such a person as mr stern on which your noble father is placed in a light so truly amiable cannot fail of engaging your lordships gracious acceptance and protection  in this hope and upon this foundation he presumes to dedicate these papers to your lordship and to have the honor of subscribing himself  my lord your lordships most obedient and most humble servant the editor  preface the foul and infamous traffic between dishonest booksellers and profligate scribblers which has subsisted for more than a century has justly brought posthumous publications under suspicion in england france and more especially in holland ministers of state in every european court great generals royal mistresses authors of established reputation in a word all such as have had the misfortune to advance themselves to eminence have been obliged to leave behind them parcels of letters and other memoirs of the most secret and important transactions of their times in which every fact beyond the information of a newspaper or coffeehouse chat is so faithfully misrepresented every character delineated with such punctual deviation from the truth and causes and effects which have no possible relation are with such amazing effrontery obtruded upon the public that it is no wonder if men of sense who read for instruction as well as entertainment generally condemn them in the lump never or very rarely affording them the honor of a perusal  the publisher of these letters however has not the smallest apprehension that any part of this well grounded censure can fall to his share he deals not in surprising events to astonish the reader nor in characters one excepted which have figured on the great theater of the world he purposely waves all proofs which might be drawn concerning their authenticity from the character of the gentleman who had the perusal of the originals and with elizas permission faithfully copied them at bombay in the east indies from the testimony of many respectable families in this city who knew and loved eliza caressed and admired mr stern and were well acquainted with the tender friendship between them from many curianecdotes in the letters themselves any one of which were fully sufficient to authenticate them and submits his reputation to the taste and discernment of the commonest reader who must in one view perceive that these letters are genuine beyond any possibility of doubt  as the public is unquestionably entitled to every kind of information concerning the characters contained in these letters which consists with the duties of humanity and a good citizen that is a minute acquaintance with those of whom honorable mention is made or the publisher is furnished with authorities to vindicate from mr sternes censures which as a man of warm temper and lively imagination he was perhaps sometimes hurried into without due reflection he persuades himself that no party concerned will or can be offended with this publication especially if it is considered that without such information it would be cold and uninteresting that by publishing their merits he cannot be understood to intend them any injury and without it would himself fail in his duty to the public  eliza the lady to whom these letters are addressed is mrs elizabeth draper wife of daniel draper esquire counselor at bombay and at present chief of the english factory at surat a gentleman very highly respected in that quarter of the globe  she is by birth an east indian but the circumstance of being born in the country not proving sufficient to defend her delicate frame against the heats of that burning climate she came to england for the recovery of her health when by accident she became acquainted with mr stern he immediately discovered in her a mind so congenial with his own so enlightened so refined and so tender that their mutual attraction presently joined them in the closest union that purity could possibly admit of he loved her as his friend and prided in her as his pupil all her concerns became presently his her health her circumstances her reputation her children were his his fortune his time his country were at her disposal so far as the sacrifice of all or any of these might in his opinion contribute to her real happiness if it is asked whether the glowing heat of mr sternes affection never transported him to a flight beyond the limits of pure platonism the publisher will not take upon him absolutely to deny it but this he thinks so far from leaving any stain upon that gentlemans memory that it perhaps includes his fairest encomium since to cherish the seeds of piety and chastity in a heart which the passions are interested to corrupt must be allowed to be the noblest effort of a soul fraught and fortified with the justest sentiments of religion and virtue  mr and mrs james so frequently and honorably mentioned in these letters are the worthy heads of an opulent family in this city their character is too well established to need the aid of the publisher in securing the estimation they so well deserve and universally possess yet he cannot restrain one observation that to have been respected and beloved by mr stern and mrs draper is no inconsiderable testimony of their merit and such as it cannot be displeasing to them to see published to the world  miss light now mrs stratton is on all accounts a very amiable young lady  she was accidentally a passenger in the same ship with eliza and instantly engaged her friendship and esteem but being mentioned in one of mrs drapers letters to mr stern in somewhat of a comparative manner with herself his partiality for her as she modestly expressed it took the alarm and betrayed him into some expressions the coarseness of which cannot be excused mrs draper declares that this lady was entirely unknown to him and infinitely superior to his idea of her she has been lately married to george stratton esquire counselor at madrass  the manner in which mr sternes acquaintance with the celebrated lord bathurst the friend and companion of addison swift pope steel and all the finest wits of the last age commenced cannot fail to attract the attention of the curious reader here that great man is social and unreserved unshackled with that sedulity in supporting a feigned character which exposes most of his rank to the contempt of wise men and the ridicule of their valets de chamber here he appears the same as in his hours of festivity and happiness with swift and addison superior to forms and ceremonies and in his eightyfifth year abounding in wit vivacity and humanity methinks the pleasure of such a gentlemans acquaintance resembles that of conversing with superior beings but it is not fit to dwell longer on this pleasing topic least it should anticipate the readers pleasure in perusing the letter itself one remark however it suggests which may be useful to old men in general to wit that it appears by his lordships example the sour contracted spirit observable in old age is not specifically an effect of years although they are commonly pleaded in it is excuse old men would therefore do well to correct this odious quality in themselves or if that must not be to invent a better apology for it  it is very much to be lamented that elizas modesty was invincible to all the publishers endeavors to obtain her answers to these letters her wit penetration and judgment her happiness in the epistolary style so rapturously commended by mr stern could not fail to furnish a rich entertainment for the public the publisher could not help telling her that he wished to god she really was possessed of that vanity with which she was charged to which she replied that she was so far from acquitting herself of vanity that she suspected that to be the cause why she could not prevail on herself to submit her letters to the public eye for although mr stern was partial to every thing of here is she could not hope that the world would be so too with this answer he was obliged to be contented yet cannot reflect without deep concern that this elegant accomplishment so peculiarly adapted to the refined and delicate understandings of ladies should be yet so rare that we can boast of only one lady wortley montague among us and that eliza in particular could not be prevailed on to follow the example of that admired lady  the reader will remark that these letters have various signatures sometimes he signs stern sometimes yorick and to one or two he signs her bramin although it is pretty generally known who the bramins are yet least any body should be at a loss it may not be amiss to observe that the principal cast or tribe among the idolatrous indians are the bramins and out of the chief class of this cast come the priests so famous for their austerities and the shocking torments and frequently death they voluntarily expose themselves to on a religious account now as mr stern was a clergyman and eliza an indian by birth it was customary with her to call him her bramin which he accordingly in his pleasant moods uses as a signature  it remains only to take some little notice of the family marked with asterisks on whom mr stern has thought proper to shed the bitterest gall of his pen it is however evident even from some passages in the letters themselves that mrs draper could not be easily prevailed on to see this family in the same odious light in which they appeared to her perhaps over zealous friend he in the heat or i may say hurry of his affection might have accepted suspicious circumstances as real evidences of guilt or listened too unguardedly to the insinuations of their enemies be that as it may as the publisher is not furnished with sufficient authorities to exculpate them he chooses to drop the ungrateful subject heartily wishing that this family may not only be innocent of the shocking treachery with which they are charged but may be able to make their innocence appear clearly to the world otherwise that no person may be industrious enough to discover and make known their name  eliza will receive my books with this the summons came all hot from the heart i wish that could give them any title to be offered to yours the others came from the head i am more indifferent about their reception   i know not how it comes but i am half in love with you  i ought to be wholly so for i never valued or saw more good qualities to value or thought more of one of your sex than of you  so adieu  yours faithfully if not affeionately  lsn e  i cannot rest eliza though i shall call on you at half past twelve till i know how you do  may thy dear face smile as thou risest like the sun of this morning i was much grieved to hear of your alarming indisposition yesterday and disappointed too at not being let in  remember my dear that a friend has the same right as a physician the etiquettes of this town you will say say otherwise no matter delicacy and propriety do not always consist in observing their frigid doctrines  i am going out to breakfast but shall be at my lodgings by eleven when i hope to read a single line under thy own hand that thou art better and will be glad to see  thy bramin nine oclock i got thy letter last night eliza on my return from lord bathursts where i dined and where i was heard as i talked of thee for an hour without intermission with so much pleasure and attention that the good old lord toasted your health three several times and though he is now in his eightyfifth year says he hopes to live long enough to be introduced as a friend to my fair indian disciple and to see her eclipse all other nabobesses as much in wealth as she already does in exterior and what is far better in interior merit  i hope so too  this nobleman is an old friend of mine you know he was always the protector of men of wit and genius and had those of the last century addison steel pope swift prior etc etc always at his table   the manner in which his notice of me began was singular as it was polite he came up to me one day as i was at the princess of waless court  i want to know you mr sne but it is fit you should also know who it is that wishes this pleasure you have heard continued he of an old lord bathurst of whom your popes and swifts have sung and spoken so much i have lived my life with geniuss of that cast but have survived them and despairing ever to find their equals it is some years since i closed my accounts and shut up my books with thoughts of never opening them again but you have kindled a desire in me to open them once more before i die which i now do  so go home and dine with me  this nobleman i say is a prodigy for at eighty five he has all the wit and promptness of a man of thirty  a disposition to be pleased and a power to please others beyond whatever i knew added to which a man of learning courtesy and feeling   he heard me talk of thee eliza with uncommon satisfaction for there was only a third person and of sensibility with us  and a most sentimental afternoon till nine oclock have we passed but thou eliza was the star that conducted and enlightened the discourse and when i talked not of thee still did thou fill my mind and warm every thought i uttered for i am not ashamed to acknowledge i greatly miss thee  best of all good girls the sufferings i have sustained all night on account of thine eliza are beyond my power of words  assuredly does heaven give strength proportioned to the weight he lays upon us  thou have been bowed down my child with every burden that sorrow of heart and pain of body could inflict on a poor being  and still thou tell me that thou art beginning to get ease thy fever gone  thy sickness the pain in thy side vanishing also   may every evil so vanish that thwarts elizas happiness or but awakens her fears for a moment  fear nothing my dear hope every thing and the balm of this passion will shed it is influence on thy health and make thee enjoy a spring of youth and cheerfulness more than thou have hardly yet tasted   and so thou have fixed thy bramins portrait over thy writing desk and will consult it in all doubts and difficulties grateful good girl yorick smiles contentedly over all thou do his picture does not do justice to his own complacency   thy sweet little plan and distribution of thy time how worthy of thee  indeed eliza thou leavest one nothing to direct thee in thou leavest me nothing to require nothing to ask but a continuance of that conduct which won my esteem and has made me thy friend for ever  may the roses come quick back to thy check and the rubies to thy lips but trust my declaration eliza that thy husband if he is the good feeling man i wish him will press thee to him with more honest warmth and affection and kiss thy pale poor dejected face with more transport than he would be able to do in the best bloom of all thy beauty  and so he ought  i pity him  he must have strange feelings if he knows not the value of such a creature as thou art   i am glad miss light goes with you she may relieve you from many anxious moments  i am glad too that your shipmates are friendly beings  you could least dispense with what is contrary to thy own nature which is soft and gentle eliza it would civilize savages though pity were it thou should be tainted with the office   how can thou make apologies for thy last letter it is most delicious to me for the very reasons you excuse it   write to me my child only such let them speak the easy cheerfulness of a heart that opens itself any how and every how to a man you ought to esteem and trust   such eliza i write to thee and so i should ever live with thee most artlessly most affectionately if providence permitted thy residence in the same section of the globe for i am all that honor and inclination can make me  thy bramin  i write this eliza at mr jamess whilst he is dressing and the dear girl his wife is writing beside me to thee   i got your melancholy billet before we sat down to dinner it is melancholy indeed my dear to hear so piteous an account of thy sickness thou art encompassed with evils enough without that additional weight  i fear it will sink thy poor soul and body with it past recovering  heaven supply thee with fortitude we have talked of nothing but thee eliza and of thy sweet virtues and endearing conduct the whole afternoon   mrs james and the bramin have mixed their tears a hundred times in speaking of thy hardships thy goodness thy graces it is a subject that will never end betwixt us  oh she is good and friendly  the  by heaven are worthless i have heard enough to tremble at the articulation of the name  how could you eliza leave them or suffer them to leave you rather with impressions the least favorable i have told thee enough to plant disgust against their treachery to thee to the last hour of thy life  yet still thou toldst mrs james at last that thou believe they affectionately loved thee  her delicacy to my eliza and true regard to her ease of mind have saved thee from hearing more glaring proofs of their baseness  for gods sake write not to them nor foul thy fair characters with such polluted hearts  they love thee  what proof  is it their actions which say so or their zeal for those attachments which do thee honor and make thee happy or their tenderness for thy fame no but they weep and say tender things  adieu to all such for ever   mrs jamess honest heart revolts against the idea of even returning them one visit i honor her and honor thee for almost every act of thy life but this blind partiality to an unworthy being  forgive my zeal dear girl and allow me a right which arises only out of that fund of affection i have and shall preserve for thee to the hour of my death   reflect eliza what are my motives for perpetually advising thee think whether i can have any which proceed not from the cause i have mentioned  i think you a very deserving woman and that you want nothing but firmness and a better opinion of yourself to be the best female character i know   i wish i could inspire you with a share of that vanity your enemies lay to your charge though to me it has never been visible because i think in a well turned mind it will produce good effects   i probably shall never see you more yet flatter myself you will sometimes think of me with pleasure because you must be convinced i love you and so interest myself in your rectitude that i had rather hear of any evil befalling you than your want of reverence for yourself   i had not power to keep this remonstrance in my breast  it is now out  so adieu heaven watch over my eliza  thine yorick  to whom should eliza apply in her distress but to the friend that loves her why then my dear do you apologize for employing me  yorick would be offended and with reason if you ever sent commissions to another which he could execute  i have been with zumps  and first your pianoforte must be tuned from the brass middle string of your guitar which is c  i have got you a hammer too and a pair of pliars to twist your wire with and may every one of them my dear vibrate sweet comfort to thy hopes i have bought you ten handsome brass screws to hang your necessaries upon i purchased twelve but stole a couple from you to put up in my own cabin at coxwauld  i shall never hang or take my hat off one of them but i shall think of you  i have bought thee moreover a couple of iron screws which are more to be depended on than brass for the globe   i have wrote also to mr abraham walker pilot at deal to acquaint him that i had dispatched these in a packet directed to his care which i desired he would seek after the moment the deal machine arrives  i have moreover given directions to him what sort of an arm chair you would want and have directed to purchase the best that deal could afford and to take it with the parcel in the first boat that went off  would i could eliza thus supply all thy wants and all thy wishes it would be a state of happiness to me   the journal is as it should be all but it is contents   poor dear patient being i do more than pity you for i think i lose both firmness and philosophy as i figure to myself your distresses   do not think i spoke last night with too much asperity of  there was a cause and besides a good heart ought not to love a bad one and indeed cannot but adieu to the ungrateful subject   i have been this morning to see mrs james she loves thee tenderly and unfeignedly she is alarmed for thee she says thou lookedst most ill and melancholy on going away she pities thee  i shall visit her every sunday while i am in town   as this may be my last letter i earnestly bid thee farewell may the god of kindness be kind to thee and approve himself thy protector now thou art defenseless and for thy daily comfort bear in thy mind this truth that whatever measure of sorrow and distress is thy portion it will be repaid to thee in a full measure of happiness by the being thou have wisely chosen for thy eternal friend  farewell farewell eliza while i live count upon me as the most disinterested and warm of earthly friends  yorick  my dearest eliza i began a new journal this morning you shall see it for if i live not till your return to england i will leave it you as a legacy it is a sorrowful page but i will write cheerful ones and could i write letters to thee they should be cheerful ones too but few i fear will reach thee  however depend upon receiving something of the kindly every post till thou wavest thy hand and bidst me write no more  tell me how you are and what sort of fortitude heaven inspires thee with how are your accommodations my dear  is all right  scribble away any thing and every thing to me depend upon seeing me at deal with the jamess should you be detained there by contrary winds indeed eliza i should with pleasure fly to you could i be the means of rendering you any service or doing you any kindness   gracious and merciful god consider the anguish of a poor girl strengthen and preserve her in all the shocks her frame must be exposed to she is now without protector but thee save her from all the accidents of a dangerous element and give her comfort at the last   my prayer eliza i hope is heard for the sky seems to smile upon me as i look up to it   i am just returned from our dear mrs jamess where i have been talking of thee these three hours  she has got your picture and likes it but mariot and some other judges agree that mine is the better and expressive of a sweeter character but what is that to the original yet i acknowledge here is a picture for the world and mine only calculated to please a very sincere friend or sentimental philosopher   in the one you are dressed in smiles and with all the advantages of silks pearls and ermine in the other simple as a vestal appearing the good girl nature made you which to me conveys an idea of more unaffected sweetness than mrs drpr habited for conquest in a birth day suit with her countenance animated and dimples visible   if i remember right eliza you endeavored to collect every charm of your person into your face with more than common care the day you sat for mrs james your color too brightened and your eyes shone with more than their usual brilliancy   i then requested you to come simple and unadorned when you sat for me knowing as i see with unprejuducd eyes that you could receive no addition from the silkworms aid or jewellers polish   let me now tell you a truth which i believe i uttered before  when i first saw you i beheld you as an object of compassion and a very plain woman   the mode of your dress the fashionable disfigured you  but nothing now could render you such but the being sollicitous to make yourself admired as a handsome one   you are not handsome eliza  nor is yours a face that will please the tenth part of your beholders   but you are something more for i scruple not to tell you i never saw so intelligent so animated so good a countenance nor ever was there nor will there be that man of sense tenderness and feeling in your company three hours that was not or will not be your admirer and friend in consequence of it i e if you assume or assumed no character foreign to your own but appeared the artless being nature designed you for  a something in your voice and eyes you possess in a degree more persuasive than any woman i ever saw read or heard of  but it is that bewitching sort of nameless excellence that men of nice sensibility alone can be touched with   was your husband in england i would freely give him  00l if money could purchase the acquisition to let you only sit by me two hours in the day while i wrote my sentimental journey  i am sure the work would sell so much the better for it that i should be reimbursd the sum more than seven times told   i would not give ninepence for the picture of you that the newnhams have got executed it is the resemblance of a concerted made up coquette  your eyes and the shape of your face the latter the most perfect oval i ever saw which are perfections that must strike the most indifferent judge because they are equal to any of gods works in a similar way and finer than any i beheld in all my travels are manifestly inspired by the affected leer of the one and strange appearance of the other owing to the attitude of the head which is a proof of the artists or your friends false taste   the s verify the character i once gave of teazing and sticking like pitch or bird lime   sent a card that they would wait on mrs  on friday  she sent back she was engaged  then to meet at ranelagh tonight she answered she did not go   she says if she allows the least footing she never shall get rid of the acquaintance which she is resolved to drop at once   she knows them she knows they are not her friends or yours and the first use they would make of being with her would be to sacrifice you to her if they could a second time   let her not then let her not my dear be a greater friend to thee than thou art to thyself she begs i will reiterate my request to you that you will not write to them  twill give her and thy bramin too inexpressible pain  be assured all this is not without reason on her side i have my reasons too the first of which is that i should grieve to excess if eliza wanted that fortitude her yorick has built so high upon   i said i would never more mention  the name to thee and had i not received it as a kind of charge from a dear woman that loves you i should not have broke my word   i will write again tomorrow to thee thou best and most endearing of girls a peaceful night to thee my spirit will be with thee through every watch of it  adieu  my dear eliza oh i grieve for your cabin and fresh painting will be enough to destroy every nerve about thee  nothing so pernicious as white lead  take care of yourself dear girl and sleep not in it too soon twill be enough to give you a stroke of an epilepsy   i hope you will have left the ship and that my letters may meet and greet you as you get out of your post chaise at deal  when you have got them all put them my dear into some order  the first eight or nine are numbered but i wrote the rest without that direction to thee  but thou will find them out by the day or hour which i hope i have generally prefixed to them when they are got together in chronological order sew them together under a cover  i trust they will be a perpetual refuge to thee from time to time and that thou will when weary of fools and uninteresting discourse retire and converse an hour with them and me   i have not had power or the heart to aim at enlivening one of them with a single stroke of wit or humor but they contain something better and what you will feel more suited to your situation  a long detail of much advice truth and knowledge   i hope too you will perceive loose touches of an honest heart in every one of them which speak more than the most studied periods and will give thee more ground of trust and reliance upon yorick than all that labored eloquence could supply  lean then thy whole weight eliza upon them and upon me  may poverty distress anguish and shame be my portion if ever i give thee reason to repent the knowledge of me   with this asseveration made in the presence of a just god i pray to him that so it may speed with me as i deal heartily and honorably with thee  i would not mislead thee eliza i would not injure thee in the opinion of a single individual for the richest crown the proudest monarch wears   remember that while i have life and power whatever is mine you may style and think yours though sorry should i be if ever my friendship was put to the test thus for your own delicacys sake   money and counters are of equal use in my opinion they both serve to set up with i hope you will answer in this letter but if thou art debarred by the elements which hurry thee away i will write one for thee and knowing it is such an one as thou would have written i will regard it as my elizas   honor and happiness and health and comforts of every kind sail along with thee thou most worthy of girls i will live for thee and my lydia be rich for ye dear children of my heart gain wisdom gain fame and happiness to share them with thee and her in my old age   once for all adieu preserve thy life steadily pursue the ends we proposed and let nothing rob thee of those powers heaven has given thee for thy well being   what can i add more in the agitation of mind i am in and within sive minutes of the last postmans bell but recommend thee to heaven and recommend myself to heaven with thee in the same fervent ejaculation  that we may be happy and meet again if not in this world in the next   adieu i am thine affectionately eliza and everlastingly  yorick   my dear eliza i think you could act no otherwise than you did with your young soldier there was no shutting the door against him either in politeness or humanity   thou tell me he seems susceptible of tender impressions and that before miss let has sailed a fortnight he will be in love with her   now i think it a thousand times more likely that he attaches himself to thee eliza because thou art a thousand times more amiable   five months with eliza and in the same room and an amorous son of mars besides it no can be masser  the sun if he could avoid it would not shine upon a dunghill but his rays are so pure eliza and celestial i never heard they were polluted by it  just such will thine be my dearest child in this and every such situation as you will be exposed to till thou art fixed for life   but thy discretion thy wisdom thy honor the spirit of thy yorick and thy own spirit which is equal to it will be thy ablest counselors   surely by this time something is doing toward thy accommodation  but why may not clean washing and rubing do instead of painting your cabin as it is to be hung  paint is so pernicious both to your nerves and lungs and will keep you so much longer too out of possession of your apartment where i hope you will pass some of your happiest hours   i fear the best of your shipmates are only genteel by comparison with the contrasted crew with which thou must behold them  so was you know who from the same fallacy that was put upon the judgment when  but i will not mortify you  if they are decent and distant it is enough and as much as is to be expected if any of them are more i rejoice   thou will want every aid and it is thy due to have them   be cautious only my dear of intimacies good hearts are open and fall naturally into them  heaven inspire thine with fortitude in this and every other deadly trial  best of gods works farewell love me i beseech thee and remember for ever i am my eliza and ever will be in the most comprehensive sense  thy friend  yorick  ps probably you will have an opportunity of writing to me by some dutch or french ship or from the cape de verd islands twill reach me some how     i wish to god eliza it was possible to postpone the voyage to india for another year for i am firmly persuaded within my own breast that thy husband could never limit thee with regard to time   i fear that mr b has exaggerated matters  i like not his countenance it is absolutely killing thee  should evil befall thee what will he not have to answer for  i know not the being that will be deserving of so much pity or that i shall hate more he will be an outcast alien in which case i will be a father to thy children my good girl therefore take no thought about them  but eliza if thou art so very ill still put off all thoughts of returning to india this year  write to your husband  tell him the truth of your case  if he is the generous humane man you describe him to be he cannot but applaud your conduct  i am credibly informed that his repugnance to your living in england arises only from the dread which has entered his brain that thou may run him in debt beyond thy appointments and that he must discharge them   that such a creature should be sacrificed for the paultry consideration a few hundreds is too too hard oh my child that i could with propriety indemnify him for every charge even to the last mite that thou have been of to him with joy would i give him my whole subsistence nay sequester my livings and trust to the treasures heaven has furnished my head with for a future subsistence   you owe much i allow to your husband you owe something to appearances and the opinions of the world but trust me my dear you owe much likewise to yourself  return therefore from deal if you continue ill i will prescribe for you gratis you are not the first woman by many i have done so for with success   i will send for my wife and daughter and they shall carry you in pursuit of health to montpelier the wells of bancers the spaw or whither thou will thou shall direct them and make parties of pleasure in what corner of the world fancy points out to you   we shall fish upon the banks of arno and lose ourselves in the sweet labyrinths of it is valleys and then thou should warble to us as i have once or twice heard thee i am lost i am lost but we would find thee again my eliza   of a similar nature to this was your physicians prescription ease gentle exercise the pure southern air of france or milder naples with the society of friendly gentle beings   sensible man he certainly entered into your feelings he knew the fallacy of medicine to a creature whose illness has arisen from the affliction of her mind  time only my dear i fear you must trust to and have your reliance on may it give you the health so enthuastic a votary to the charming goddess deserves   i honor you fliza for keeping secret some things which if explained had been a panegyric on yourself  there is a dignity in venerable affliction which will not allow it to appeal to the world for pity or redress  well have you supported that character my amiable philosophic friend and indeed i begin to think you have as many virtues as my uncle tobys widow   i dont mean to insinuate hussy that my opinion is no better founded than his was of mrs wadman nor do i believe it possible for any trim to convince me it is equally fallacious i am sure while i have my reason it is not   talking of widows  pray eliza if ever you are such do not think of giving yourself to some wealthy nabob because i design to marry you myself  my wife cannot live long  she has sold all the provinces in france already and i know not the woman i should like so well for her substitute as yourself  it is true i am ninety five in constitution and you but twentyfive rather too great a disparity this but what i want in youth i will make up in wit and good humor  not swift so loved his stella scarron his maintenon or waller his sacharissa as i will love and sing thee my wife elect  all those names eminent as they were shall give place to thine eliza  tell me in answer to this that you approve and honor the proposal and that you would like the spectators mistress have more joy in putting on an old mans slipper than in associating with the gay the voluptuous and the young  adieu my simplicia   yours tristram  my dear eliza i have been within the verge of the gates of death i was ill the last time i wrote to you and apprehensive of what would be the consequence  my fears were but too well founded for in ten minutes after i dispatched my letter this poor finespun frame of yoricks gave way and i broke a vessel in my breast and could not stop the loss of blood till four this morning  i have filled all thy india handkerchiefs with it it came i think from the heart  i fell a sleep through weakness at six and awoke with the bosom of my shirt steeped in tears   i dreamed i was sitting under the canopy of indolence and that thou came into the room with a shaul in thy hand and told me my spirit had flown to thee to the downs with tidings of my fate and that you was come to administer what consolation filial affection could bestow and to receive my parting breath and blessings with that you folded the shaul about my waist and kneeling supplicated my attention  i awoke but in what a fra oh my god but thou wt remember my tears and put them all into thy bottle  dear girl i see thee thou art for ever present to my fancy embracing my feeble knees and raising thy fine eyes to bid me be of comfort   and when i talk to lydia the words of esau as uttered by thee perpetually ring in my ears  bless me even also my father   blessings attend thee thou child of my heart  my bleeding is quite stopped and i feel the principle of life strong within me  so be not alarmed eliza i know i shall do well   i have eat my breakfast with hunger and i write to thee with a pleasure arising from that prophetic impression in my imagination  that all will terminate to our hearts content  comfort thyself eternally with this persuasion that the best of beings as thou sweetly have expressed it could not by a combination of accidents produce such a chain of events merely to be the source of misery to the leading person engaged in them   the observation was very applicable very good and very elegantly expressed  i wish my memory did justice to the wording of it   who taught you the art of writing so sweetly eliza you absolutely have exalted it to a science  when i am in want of ready cash and ill health will permit my genius to exert itself i shall print your letters as finished essays by an unfortunate indian lady the style is new and would almost be a sufficient recommendation for their selling well without merit but their sense natural ease and spirit is not to be equaled i believe in this section of the globe nor i will answer for it by any of your country women in yours   i have showed your letter to mrs b and to half the literati in town you shall not be angry with me for it because i meant to do you honor by it   you cannot imagine how many admirers your epistolary productions have gained you that never viewed your external merits   i only wonder where thou could acquire thy graces thy goodness thy accomplishments so connected so educated nature has surely studied to make thee her peculiar care for thou art and not in my eyes alone the best and fairest of all her works  and so this is the last letter thou art to receive from me because the earl of chatham i read in the papers is got to the downs and the wind i find is fair  if so blessed woman take my last last farewell cherish the remembrance of me think how i esteem nay how affectionately i love thee and what a price i set upon thee adieu adieu and with my adieu let me give thee one short rule of conduct that thou have heard from my lips in a thousand forms but i concenter it in one word   reverence thyself   adieu once more eliza may no anguish of heart plant a wrinkle upon thy face till i behold it again may no doubt or misgivings disturb the serenity of thy mind or awaken a painful thought about thy children for they are yoricks and yorick is thy friend for ever   adieu adieu adieu  ps remember that hope shortens all journies by sweetning them so sing my little stanza on the subject with the devotion of an hymn every morning thou arisest and thou will eat thy breakfast with more comfort for it  blessings rest and hygeia go with thee may thou soon return in peace and affluence to illumine my night i am and shall be the last to deplore thy loss and will be the first to congratulate and hail thy return    fare thee well  finis
