a review of the london dispensatory  wherein are considered the inconsistencies of some medicines and the real merit of others  addressed to the college of physicians  london printed for j cook at shakespeares head in paternoster row       price one shilling and sixpence   are mills now in use by which all these things bezoar excepted are ground if this method is not thought certain let them be pounded mixed with water and the finer parts poured off and dried for use let this be done till all is fine enough this is a much quicker and easier way than the other  axungiae porcinae sevique ovilli curatio  the purification or trying of hogs lard and mutton sewet  the first is the province of an old woman deers sewet may be obtained of keepers as cheap and good ready tried  axungiae viperinae curatio  the purification of vipers fat  this is a necessary prescription the virtues are so eminent  mellis despumatio  clarifying of honey  very neat and pretty  scillae coctio lege scillarum coctio  the baking of squills  it is intended by this process to lessen its acrimony they are not prescribed thus in the theriaca andromachi  scillae exsiccatio lege scillarum  the drying of squills  very great  rhubarbari and nucis moschatae torrefactio  the roasting of rhubarb and nutmeg  neither of these sometimes can be powdered alone without drying ridiculous  spongiae ustio  the burning of sponge  let the sponge be placed in a covered earthen vessel in a hot oven till it is become friable not till it is black as then it loses a great part of its virtue  cornu cervi calcinatio  the calcination of hartshorn  the horn or bones left after distilling the spirit will answer for this as well as any  pulparum extractio lege expressio  the extraction or expression of pulps  this is a little necessary  styracis colatio  the straining of storax  not very necessary  opium colatum lege opij colatio  the straining of opium assafetida etc  in my opinion there is not a great occasion for it  millepedarum praeparatio  preparation of millepedes  the best method in use  conservae conserves  half of these conserves would be enough as i imagine they are never given for their virtues but merely as a basis for medicines more efficacious  condita preserves  these belong to the confectioner where they may be had  succi juices  succi scorbutici  the scorbutic juices  not fit for a dispensatory prescription or to keep in the shop  rob baccarum sambuci  rob of elderberries  very little used and seldom kept  elaterium  elaterium  should be kept though little used  extracta et resinae extracts and resins  extractum rad enulae campanae  extract of elecampane roots  this is the worst extract among the whole the rest in general are good one extract of bark and guaiacum is enough  extractum glycyrrhizae  extract of liquorice  this is far preferable to the common juice of the shops when well made and free from dirt  extractum jalap  extract of jalap  i know of no advantage this has over the powder  extractum catharticum  the cathartic extract  this is a drastic purge is generally given to great advantage joined with an opiate  gummi and resina aloes  gum and resin of aloes  this is a pretty preparation to separate the gum and rosin of the aloes  olea per expressionem expressed oils  oleum amygdalinum  oil of almonds  almonds whether bitter or sweet yield the same oil and mustardseeds yield an oil the very same  ol lini  oil of linseed  to be obtained by pressure without heat  olea per distillationem distilled oils or essential oils  we could very well spare half without any detriment the oleum origani and oleum buxi are the same in point of virtue and strength  oleum lateritium  oil of bricks  nonsense  oleum picis barbadensis  oil of barbados tar  this is very little used  oleum terebinthinae  oil of turpentine  i should prefer to this the  oleum terebinthinae aethereum  the ethereal oil of turpentine  balsamum of terebinthiae  balsam of turpentine  this is used by some surgeons as a digestive  oleum copaiva compositum  compound oil of balsam of copaiba  we do not want it  sales et salina salts and saline preparations  nitrum purificatum  purified nitre  the indissoluble part is left in the filter the addition of a little nitrous acid makes the crystals larger and finer the liquor left after crystallization is a kind of epsom salt dissolved hence was originally made magnesia with the addition of an alkali but is now made thus  magnesia alba  white magnesia  dissolve a quantity of epsom salts in a large portion of water filter  dissolve in another portion of water about the same quantity of pearl ashes filter  mix these two solutions together and the magnesia will be precipitated in the form of a white powder let this be washed with fresh parcels of water twice a day till the water is become insipid then dry the powder on a chalkstone for use this is the only laxative absorbent we have  alumen ustum  burnt alum  vitriolum calcinatum  calcined vitriol  the alum and the vitriol are by this process deprived of a quantity of water they contained and thus rendered proportionably stronger the fire should not be too fierce or too long continued especially in the alum lest part of the acid be dissipated also  sal absinthij and tartari  salt of wormwood and tartar  all fixed alkaline salts are alike whether they are made from wormwood tartar or pearl ashes hence one salt under the common name of sal alkalinus fixus would answer all our purposes  sal alkalinus fixus  fixed alkaline salt  take pearl ashes dissolve them in a sufficient quantity of water then filter and evaporate  lixivium tartari  ley of tartar  there can be no difference whether the salt attracts the water from the air or whether the water is added extemporaneously  tartarum solubile  soluble tartar  this is only an union of an acid with an alkaline is a tedious process and may be as well made thus  take three parts of crystals of tartar and one part of fixed alkaline salt mix in a powder and a proper name would be  sal neutralis  the neutral salt  lixivium saponarium  soap ley  this may be had at any time of any strength of the makers of soft soap  sapo amygdalinus  almond soap  this is a tedious preparation and when done is by no means preferable to the venice or castile soap  causticum commune fortius  common stronger caustic  the lime is ordered to be kept in a vessel close corked to abate its acrimony the intention is destroyed by the corking it is for many reasons unfit for a shop prescription and caustics of any strength may be made extemporaneously and for a caustic to rub wounds with the causticum lunare or the lapis infernalis with care to prevent its liquefying is far preferable  causticum commune mitius  common milder caustic  beneath all criticism  acetum distillatum vel spiritus aceti  distilled vinegar or spirit of vinegar  the vinegar by this process loses its oil great part of the first running is not acid the latter is  sal diureticus  diuretic salt  this is nothing but a combination of a fixed alkali with a vegetable acid the process is tedious and the salt is seldom found properly neutralised an extemporaneous prescription of the same would answer full as well  spiritus vitrioli tenuis and fortis  the weak and strong spirit of vitriol  these spirits are not peculiar to vitriol they are the acids of the sulphur of vitriol which is by no means different from the common brimstone now that sulphur is the best which yields the larger proportion of oil in the easiest manner does the vitriolic do this no then i would change the names to  spiritus sulphuris tenuis and fortis  the weak and strong spirit of vitriol  the process is too well known to the chemists at this time to give a prescription in this place  colcothar vitrioli  colcothar of vitriol  by the change of the above this process is lost but it is no more than a calx deprived of its acid which may be done by urging the vitriolum calcinatum with a very fierce fire till it becomes of a deep purplish red color  spiritus nitri glauberi  glaubers spirit of nitre  the oil of vitriol being the stronger forces over the acid of the nitre and unites with the alkali into a kind of vitriolated tartar or nitre which may be purified by solution filtration and crystallization  spiritus salis marini glauberi  glaubers spirit of sea salt  the oil of vitriol acts in the same manner by the acid of the sea salt as by the nitrous acid and unites with the alkaline basis into a neutral salt  aqua fortis  aqua fortis  this is nothing more than spirit of nitre with a small proportion of the vitriolic acid about one tenth and may be thus made extemporaneously  aqua fortis composita  compound aqua fortis  a combination of the three different mineral acids in unequal proportions may be as well made extemporaneously by the addition of a few drops of spirit of sea salt one ounce of spiritus sulphuris vel vitrioli fortis and nine ounces of spirit of nitre  sal vitrioli  salt of vitriol  this is only purified white vitriol and being only used externally a clear white vitriol will do as well  tartarum vitriolatum  vitriolated tartar  nitrum vitriolatum  vitriolated nitre  these are die same thing under different names and the residuum left after the distillation of glaubers spirit of salt is a vitriolated tartar the solution and filtration will purify it if the residuum is wanting at any time the tartarum solubile or the sal neutralis may be used and is the same in every virtue  sal catharticus glauberi  glaubers cathartic salt  there is but little difference between this and the above in both the acid is the same the alkali of one is the basis of nitre and the alkali of the other is the basis of sea salt which are little different the virtues are nearly similar so similar that in my opinion they might be used indiscriminately  spiritus salis marini coagulatus  spirit of sea salt coagulated  lege  sal marinus neutralis  sea salt neutralized  spiritus vitrioli dulcis  dulcified spirit of vitriol  the spirit of wine is a kind of attenuated oil and has the power of dulcifying acid spirits the spirit with a portion of the acid is thrown over a little volatilized the same may be said of  spiritus nitri dulcis  dulcified spirit of nitre  spiritus sulphuris per campanam  spirit of sulphur by the bell  this is nothing more or less than spirit of vitriol so is a useless form  spiritus sal and oleum succini  spirit salt and oil of amber  the purification of the salt deprives it of a great part of its virtue  spiritus sal and oleum cornu cervi  spirit salt and oil of hartshorn  the college have ordered the horns only but the bones of the heart are as good and the bones of the ox etc are as good as these hence it is that the spirit has been sold so cheap already and might be afforded much cheaper still  the correction of the spirit by repeated rectification is very necessary  spiritus sal and oleum fuliginis  spirit salt and oil of soot  these are very analogous to the above and need not a distinct place in the pharmacopoeia as the spirit salt and oil may be obtained from hearts horns and bones much readier  sal volatilis salis ammoniaci  volatile salt of sal ammoniac  the medical qualities of this are not different from those of salt of hartshorn the ingredients should be well dried before they are mixed  spiritus salis ammoniaci  spirit of sal ammoniac  the london dispensatory was collected by those who never in my opinion made a medicine in their lives  they have rejected the spirit of sal ammoniac with quicklime but the volatile tincture of bark they cannot make with this spirit that they have ordered hence the necessity of the other spirit  spiritus salis ammoniaci dulcis  dulcified spirit of sal ammoniac  the necessity of this medicine i cannot see it may be made with spirit of wine and the volatile salt extemporaneously  spiritus volatilis foetidus  foetid volatile spirit  this may be made with spirit and the foetid tincture  spiritus volatilis aromaticus  aromatic volatile spirit  take pimento or jamaica pepper two ounces volatile salt of sal ammoniac one pound essence of lemons one ounce water four pints distill off what is good  if the other be preferred there is no need of distillation  resinosa et sulphurea resinous and sulphurous preparations  flores benzoini  flowers of benjamin  the method of subliming with a paper cone is preferable to the use of a retort  flores sulphuris  flowers of sulphur  the sulphur is here purified and not altered  flores sulphuris loti  washed flowers of sulphur  this is a very necessary preparation  balsamum sulphuris simplex  the simple balsam of sulphur  this is a very coarse and inelegant medicine  sulphur praecipitatum  precipitated sulphur  this is a very bad prescription for the acid of vitriol forms with the calcareous earth a salt of the kind called selenites which is precipitated with the sulphur and cannot be washed off by repeated ablutions for it is indissoluble in water this would not happen if the hepar sulphuris was dissolved in water but here the acid would form with the alkaline salt a tartarum vitriolatum which being soluble in water the sulphur would be precipitated alone but even then it is not superior to the flores sulphuris loti  aqua sulphurata  sulphurated water  this is nothing but water acidulated with the acid of sulphur  metallica metallic preparations  chalybis rubigo praeparata  the rust of steel prepared  the steel in this process is not so far demetallized as by the action of a strong fire which reduces it to a perfect calx by entirely consuming the phlogiston  chalybs cum sulphur praeparatus  steel prepared with sulphur  the mars sulphuratus is a much better prescription it is on the whole only steel deprived of its phlogiston  flores martiales  martial flowers  sal ammoniac is a semivolatile salt and has the property of volatilizing many other bodies iron is not volatile but is rendered so by the sal ammoniac its acid being destroyed  lixivium martis  the ley of iron  the residuum is iron united with an acid which it nearly saturates if exposed to the air it attracts the humidity which dissolves it  sal martis  salt of steel  this is nothing more than green vitriol or copperas the only difference there is or can be is the purity  causticum lunare  lunar caustic  this is the concentrated acid of nitre saturated with silver  saccharum saturni  sugar of lead  is a solution of lead in the vegetable acid therefore a neutral salt of lead with a predominancy of alkali  lapis medicamentosus  medicinal stone  this is nothing more than a mixture there happens not any change except possibly the lytharge is a little corroded by the vinegar  stannum pulveratum  powdered tin  the tin is here deprived of its phlogiston  argenti vivi purificatio  the purification of quicksilver  this process is as good as any for mercury is more volatile than any other metal so will fly off first if carefully performed it needs no washing  aurum musivum  mosaic gold  this seems to be only tin colored by the sulphur and has no advantage superior to powdered tin  aethiops mineralis  aethiops mineral  if the sulphur be dried well and warmed before the fire and the mortar warmed the union will be performed the sooner  cinnabaris factitia  artificial cinnabar  the union of the mercury and sulphur are more intimate in this than in the above their virtues are similar  mercurius corrosivus sublimatus vel albus  corrosive mercury sublimate or white corrosive mercury  this is mercury combined with the acid of sea salt the acid of vitriol decompounds the sea salt and the nitre whose acids unite to the mercury the acid of sea salt which has the greatest affinity to the mercury sublimes united to it the acid of nitre escapes the residuum is a calx of iron a glaubers salt formed by the acid of vitriol and the basis of the sea salt and a tartarum vitriolatum from the union of the same acid with the basis of the nitre this is not an elegant process for the nitre seems of no use and a more easy way of combining them is this  take of the white mass in making the mercurius emeticus flavus grind it with an equal weight of sea salt then sublime here the acids change their bases the mercury will unite with the acid of sea salt and we shall have a glaubers salt left behind from the combination of the acid of vitriol with the alkaline basis of the sea salt  mercurius dulcis sublimatus  dulcified mercury sublimate  the sublimate is by this process deprived of much of its acid consequently less powerful  mercurius calcinatus  calcined mercury  the mercury is here deprived of its phlogiston without the assistance of an acid hence the great advantage it has over the other mercurials  mercurius praecipitatus albus  white precipitate of mercury  this medicine is a kind of calomel in the former the acid is dulcified by the alkaline salt in the latter it is dissipated by the sublimations  mercurius corrosivus ruber  the mercurial red corrosive  this succeeds as well with the pure acid of nitre as with the aqua fortis this preparation is a concentrated acid of nitre mixed with a small proportion of the acid of sea salt and saturated with mercury  mercurius corallinus  corralline mercury  the red corrosive undergoes very little change by this process  mercurius emeticus flavus  the yellow mercurial emetic  this is the acid of vitriol saturated with mercury and though at first acid is by the ablutions rendered perfectly neutral  sulphur antimonij praecipitatum  precipitated sulphur of antimony  this sulphur may be obtained much easier thus boil equal parts of crude antimony in powder and a fixed alkaline salt filter the solution in which drop spirit of sea salt and the sulphur will precipitate  crocus antimonij  crocus of antimony  in this process the sulphur is thrown off but the quantity of nitre is not sufficient to demetallize and calcine the regulus  crocus antimonij lotus  washed crocus of antimony  the acid of vitriol forms with the alkaline basis of the nitre a tartarum vitriolatum which adheres and is united to the crocus antimonij in this process it is washed off  tartarum emeticum  emetic tartar  this is a combination of the reguline part of antimony with a vegetable acid  calx antimonij  calx of antimony  here the nitre is sufficient to destroy not only the sulphur but also the phlogiston of the regulus  causticum antimoniale  the antimonial caustic  the purest acid of sea salt will not act on antimony when applied to it in its ordinary form but the regulus may be dissolved in it in its concentrated state and while raised in vapor the remains in the retort are the sulphur of the antimony united with the mercury of the corrosive sublimate which being sublimed together make  cinnabaris antimonij  cinnabar of antimony  this consists of the same principles and is in every respect the same with the factitious cinnabar above described  aquae stillatitiae simplices simple distilled waters  aqua alexeteria simplex  simple alexeterial water  the ingredients are few and well chosen this is a very pretty simple water  aqua seminum anethi  water of dillseed  this is disagreeable and seldom kept  aqua corticum aurantiorum simplex  the simple distilled water of orangepeel  this contains a considerable degree of the aromatic qualities of the orangepeel  aqua castorei  water of castor  this is a very improper drug for the still the dearness of it rendering the sophistication of it common and in this disguise is not perceptible so soon we having a tincture this might be very well spared  aqua cinnamoni simplex  simple cinnamon water  cinnamon imparts considerable virtue to the simple water but then it is liable to grow sourish and part with its oil a decoction of cinnamon will answer all the purposes better than this  aqua faeniculi  fennel water  if the sweet fennelseeds contain more fragrancy the others have more aromatic warmth and pungency  aqua menthae piperitidis simplex  simple peppermint water  this is the very best simple water of the shops  aqua menthae vulgaris simplex  simple spearmint water  the simple alexiterial water will answer for this  aqua piperis jamaicensis  water of jamaica pepper  vastly inferior though ordered on the same plan as the simple peppermint water  aqua pulegij simplex  simple penneroyal water  a very useful simple water  aqua rosarum damascenarum  damask rose water  experience has sufficiently testified that the damask roses have no excellence above the white they may be used indiscriminately  aquae stillatitiae spirituosae et spiritus spirituous distilled waters and spirits  aqua alexeteria spirituosa  spirituous alexeterial water  i dont think there is any occasion for a spirituous and simple water from such plants as these it may however stand  aqua alexeteria spirituosa cum aceto  spirituous alexeterial water with vinegar  the difference of the angelica leaves in this and the above water is of little consequence there needs not two distillations but take of the above distilled water eight parts of vinegar one part mix  aqua seminum anisi composita  compound aniseed water  this water is very disagreeable  aqua corticum aurantiorum spirituosa  the spirituous water of orangepeel  this water is preferable to the simple  aqua seminum cardamomi  water of cardamomseeds  the greater part of the virtue of the cardamomseeds is not elevated by distillation with spirit  aqua seminum carui  water of carrawayseeds  this water is not equal in strength to a tincture drawn with rectified spirit  aqua cinnamomi spirituosa  spirituous cinnamon water  not equal at least not superior to the tincture of cinnamon  aqua juniperi composita  compound juniper water  this is very well prescribed  aqua menthae piperitidis spirituosa  the spirituous water of peppermint  the simple water contains all the virtues of the peppermint in the same dose with this the aromatic warmth is sufficient and needs not the assistance of a spirituous vehicle which renders it too hot for the stomach  aqua menthae vulgaris spirituosa  spirituous spearmint water  this is preferable to the simple water but not superior to the alexeterial  aqua nucis moschatae  nutmeg water  the quantity of nutmegs is too small to give any thing but a smell to this water it is however inoffensive in not being nauseous  aqua pulegij spirituosa  spirituous pennyroyal water  this water is not equal in elegance to the simple water of the same plant  aqua raphani composita  compound water of horse radish  in this water there are more nutmegs than in the nutmeg water  spiritus lavendulae simplex  simple spirit of lavender  this is as well made with the essential oil and rectified spirit as also  spiritus rorismarini  spirit of rosemary  spiritus lavendulae compositus  compound spirit of lavender  this is a tincture why both the spirit of lavender and of rosemary are put in i cannot conceive the spices might be increased to four times their present quantity to advantage  decocta et insusa decoctions and infusions  decoctum album  white decoction  this name is nothing determinate decoction of burnt hartshorn is a more proper name the quantity of gum arabic is too small and the addition of about a dram of cinnamon wanting  decoctum commune pro clystere  common decoction for glysters  thin gruel is full as good for most intentions  decoctum pectorale  pectoral decoction  if a neat decoction is required only one ounce of figs should be used the quantity of ingredients is too great for the decoction if thus made it is thick and inelegant  aqua hordeata  barley water  it is said that some money was given for this prescription and therefore set down in this verbose manner  fotus communis  common fomentation  the college are in some prescriptions luxuriant as in the aqua raphani composita and in the decoctum pectorale etc and in others remarkably sparing in the quantity of the ingredients as in the aqua nucis moschatae spiritus lavendulae compositus etc and in this medicine before us the ingredients might certainly be used to more advantage in a much larger quantity if used so at all and this without burthening the menstrua with the quantity of the ingredients  jus viperinum  viper broth  this has no advantage over chicken broth alone it is in fact a great deal owing to such medicines as these that physic has fallen into great disrepute  mucilago seminum cydoniorum  mucilage of quinceseeds  why have not mucilage of gum arabic and gum tragacanth been prescribed also  serum aluminosum  alum whey  this deserves more notice than it has  serum scorbuticum  scorbutic whey  this is a very ridiculous whey  infusum amarum simplex  the simple bitter infusion  this is a very pretty transparent infusion  infusum amarum purgans  the purging bitter infusion  there is no occasion for two bitter infusions the infusion of sena may be added or given occasionally  infusum senae commune  common infusion of sena  the crystals of tartar hardly dissolve the cardamomseeds render all aqueous menstrua turbid the infusion might with harm be altered thus  senaleaves two ounces carraway  seeds bruised two drams pour on them boiling water to strain off a quart if the ingredients were boiled in the water it would be better and the name altered to decoctum senae  infusum senae limoniatum  infusion of sena with lemon  if the above infusion of sena be prescribed or made this form will be unnecessary as the lemon juice may be added occasionally  aqua calcis simplex  simple lime water  rain water answers best  aqua calcis minus composita  the less compound lime water  aqua calcis magis composita  the more compound lime water  one would think the college by these prescriptions thought that lime water contained as much virtue as the bishop of cloyne supposed lay in tar water  tinctura rosarum  tincture of roses  lege infusum rosarum  acetum scilliticum  vinegar of squills  the spirit should be added before it has thrown down its foeces if not fresh foeces will be thrown down on the addition  vina wines  vinum aloeticum alkalinum  alkaline aloetic wine  this menstruum is too much burdened also the articles are well chosen for the general intention  vinum amarum  bitter wine  this is every way inferior to the spirituous tincture  vinum antimoniale  antimonial wine  the washing of the crocus is immaterial this is the same if made with the glass of antimony  vinum chalybeatum  chalybeate wine  this wine is much better made with heat than without  vinum croceum  saffron wine  a spirituous tincture is better than a vinous and keeps better  vinum ipecacoanhae  ipecacoanha wine  the addition of a stomachic medicine is i think of no use in an emetic wine  vinum viperinum  viper wine  it is of little use or consequence  tinctura rhabarbari vinosa  tincture of rhubarb in wine  this may pass very well  tinctura sacra  sacred tincture  this should be made with good old mountain the name should be vinum aloes vel aloeticum  tinctura thebaica  thebaic tincture  wine is not a proper menstruum for opium  tincturae spirituosae srirituous tinctures  tinctura amara  the bitter tincture  this is intended for keeping is an excellent medicine for the uses designed as a stomachic  tinctura antimonij  tincture of antimony  this is nothing more than a tincture of hepar sulphuris  tinctura aromatica  aromatic tincture  this is a very warm and serviceable aromatic  tinctura cantharidum  tincture of cantharides  this tincture loses its virtue by keeping if not properly secured  tinctura cardamomi  tincture of cardamoms  this is preferable to the distilled water and may supply its place regard being had to the quantities  tinctura castorei  tincture of castor  the best tincture is made with rectified spirit this extracts all the fine parts of the castor and leaves the coarse ungrateful parts of it behind  tinctura cinnamomi  tincture of cinnamon  this is preferable to the aqua cinnamomi spirituosa as it is stronger of the cinnamon  tinctura corticis peruviani simplex  the simple tincture of the peruvian bark  proof spirit dissolves both the gummy and resinous parts of the bark hence this is strong of the virtues of the drug  tinctura corticis peruviani volatilis  volatile tincture of the peruvian bark  those who have endeavored to make this tincture with the college spirit of sal ammoniac have been foiled the pungency of the spirit with lime is by the bark corrected and united they form a medicine of great virtue  tinctura foetida  the foetid tincture  the assafoetida should be rubbed and divided by sand before it is put to the spirit as directed in the tinctura sacra  tinctura fuliginis  tincture of soot  if the assafoetida was double in quantity it would not be amiss  tinctura guaiacina volatilis  volatile tincture of gum guaiacum  this is a good medicine  tinctura jalapii  tincture of jalap  the menstruum is too much loaded it would be full as strong from six ounces  tinctura japonica  tincture of japan earth  here also the menstruum is loaded it would answer better made with the earth and tincture of cinnamon already made  tinctura florum martialium  tincture of martial flowers  this is an elegant chalybeate tincture  tinctura martis in spiritu salis  tincture of iron in spirit of salt  the spirit of salt does not dissolve so much of the iron as the vitriolic acid but it has this advantage it mixes uniformly with rectified spirit  tinctura melampodij  tincture of black hellebore  by much the best preparation of black hellebore  tinctura myrrhae  tincture of myrrh  the myrrh should be powdered and mixed with sand to keep it divided  tinctura rhabarbari spirituosa  tincture of rhubarb in spirit  there is no occasion for this every purpose being answered by the vinous tincture  tinctura saturnina  the saturnine tincture  this is a strong styptic and dangerous preparation of lead its use has been often followed by terrible symptoms when even given in small quantities  tinctura senae  tincture of sena  this is a very useful tincture there are more raisins than necessary used  tinctura serpentariae  tincture of snakeroot  a very good and useful tincture  tinctura stomachica  stomachic tincture  a very pleasant tincture of some warmth  tinctura styptica  the styptic tincture  the addition of a little oak bark or any vegetable astringent makes this tincture of a fine black color  tinctura valerianae simplex  the simple tincture of valerian  tinctura valerianae volatilis  the volatile tincture of valerian  neither of these medicines require any commendations or remarks  tinctura veratri  tincture of white hellebore  this is not wanting except in bedlam and there i believe seldom we have antimonials  balsamum guaiacinum  balsam of guaiacum  this contains a large proportion of the gum  balsamum traumaticum  vulnerary balsam  this is very well prescribed  elixir aloes  elixir of aloes  there is too much saffron for the quantity of menstruum  elixir paregoricum  paregoric elixir  the quantity of benjamin is too small to make it a pectoral medicine otherwise than as an opiate by allaying the irritation it is on the whole an excellent medicine the oil of aniseeds is excessively nauseous and would be better omitted  elixir vitrioli acidum  acid elixir of vitriol  elixir vitrioli dulce  dulcified elixir of vitriol  neither of these require remarks  elixir myrrhae compositum  compound elixir of myrrh  a tincture made with savine in tincture of myrrh would do better alone the tincture of castor might be added occasionally  mixturae mixtures  julepum e camphora  the camphorated julep  this is strongly impregnated with the virtues of the camphor  julepum e creta  the chalk julep  julepum e moscho  the musk julep  may be still continued  emulsio communis  common emulsion  there is here not enough gum arabic  lac ammoniaci  milk of gum ammoniac  lege solutio ammoniaci  spiritus vinosus camphoratus  camphorated spirits of wine  proper to be kept in the shops  syrupi syrups  syrupus ex allio  syrup of garlic  a very nauseous preparation for a syrup  syrupus ex althaea  syrup of marshmallows  the marshmallows are not dear but the syrup is extremely similar to the pectoral syrup and is not any way better  syrupus e corticibus aurantiorum  syrup of orangepeel  a very grateful syrup but if cold water was poured on the peel the syrup would be still more grateful  syrupus balsamicus  syrup of balsam  if the syrup was made with the addition of tincture of the balsam according to the edinburgh form it would be less trouble  syrupus caryophyllorum rubrorum  syrup of clove julyflowers  the scarcenese of these flowers renders this syrup liable to sophistication it is not wanting  syrupus croci  syrup of saffron  we have simple syrup and saffron wine  syrupus cydoniorum  syrup of quinces  a very pretty syrup of an agreeable flavor and slight astringency  syrupus e succo limonum mororum etc  syrup of lemon juice mulberries etc  very agreeable  syrupus e meconio  diacodion  observe the cautions  syrupus papaveris erratici  syrup of wild poppies  while we have diacodion this is not wanting except by some curious pickpockets to color simple waters with and sell them for fever juleps which is a practice very common  syrupus pectoralis  pectoral syrup  this is much the same in virtue as the syrup of marshmallows  syrupus rosarum solutivus  solutive syrup of roses  needs no amendment the sugar need not be double refined  syrupus scilliticus  syrup of squills  if honey should disagree we have the vinegar of squills and simple syrup there is no occasion to keep this  syrupus simplex  the simple syrup  the most useful syrup in the whole  syrupus e spina cervina  syrup of buckthorn  extremely nauseous is only fit for glysters a coarse sugar will do full as well  syrupus violarum  syrup of violets  a very pretty syrup for children  syrupus zinziberis  syrup of ginger  a very good addition  confectio alkermes  confection of kermes  a light subastringent little used  mella et oxymellita honeys and oxymells  mel aegyptiacum  egyptian honey  this is a very inelegant preparation of little use and less virtue  only fit for the physicians horses heels and for them provided i suppose  mel elatines  honey of fluellin  of little use and virtue  mel helleboratum  honey of hellebore  seldom ventured on seldom to be met with good  mel rosaceum  honey of roses  may be kept  mel solutivum  solutive honey  the cumminseeds are extremely offensive but it being principally for clysters it may pass though substances more proper might be added extemporaneously at the discretion of the prescriber  oxymel ex allio

prescription  pulvis sternutatorius  sneezing powder  alias snuff  pulvis e succino compositus  compound powder of amber  this receives no virtue from the amber if the quantity of the gum olibanum was

colocynthide simpliciores  the more simple pills of coloquintida  pillulae ex colocynthide cum aloes  pills of coloquintida with aloes  why these are made two preparations no satisfactory reason can

assafoetida might be increased to one ounce in quantity  pillulae mercuriales  mercurial pills  turpentine is not necessary to unite the mercury a little honey or balsam of sulphur will do as well

linseed oil  oleum sambucinum  oil of elder  oleum viride  green oil  however these may be prized from the virtues of the ingredients i much question if any good can be produced that the wormwood etc should give any appears inconsistent and the green oil is especially ridiculous  emplastra plasters  emplastrum ex ammoniaco cum mercurio  the ammoniacum plaster with mercury  this is a very
