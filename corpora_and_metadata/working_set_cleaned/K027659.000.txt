passed on this sermon by your unanimous request to have it sent to the press which i have done without sending any apology along with it for ts unfitness to appear in public  exuses of this kind being generally so well known both as to substance and form that it is altogether unnecessary to copy them  i will therefore only beg your favorable acceptance of it and to believe that though my chief view in complying with your desire was the hopes of doing good by contributing something to the interests of religion and morality yet it is no small pleasure which i receive at the same time from the opportunity it gives me of declaring how great an honor and esteem i have for so many gentlemen of worth and character i am  your most humble and most obedient servant l stern  hebrews xiii     for we trust we have a good conscience  trust  trust we have a good conscience  surely you will say if there is any thing in this life which a man may depend upon and to the knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence it must be this very thing  whether he has a good conscience or no  if a man thinks at all he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of this account  he must be privy to his own thoughts and desires  he must remember his past pursuits and know certainly the true springs and motives which in general have governed the actions of his life  in other matters we may be deceived by false appearances and as the wise man complains hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the earth and with labor do we find the things that are before us  but here the mind has all the evidence and facts within herself  is conscious of the web she has wove  knows its texture and fineness and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which virtue or vice has planned before her  now  as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has within itself of this and the judgment either of approbation or censure which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives  it is plain you will say from the very terms of the proposition whenever this inward testimony goes against a man and he stands selfaccused  that he must necessarily be a guilty man and on the contrary when the report is favorable on his side and his heart condemns him not  that it is not a matter of trust as the apostle intimates but a matter of certainty and fact that the conscience is good and that the man must be good also  at first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case and i make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon the mind of man that did no such thing ever happen as that the conscience of a man by long habits of sin might as the scripture assures us it may insensibly become hard and like some tenderer parts of his body by much stress and continual hard usage lose by degrees that nice sense and perception with which god and nature endowed it  did this never happen  or was it certain that selflove could never hang the least bias upon the judgment  or that the little interests below could rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions and encompass him about with clouds and thick darkness  could no such thing as favor and affection enter this sacred court  did wit disdain to take a bribe in it or was ashamed to show its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment  or lastly were we assured that interest stood always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearing  and that passion never got into the judgment seat and pronounced sentence in the stead of reason which is supposed always to preside and determine upon the case  was this truly so as the objection must suppose no doubt then the religious and moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteemed it and the guilt or innocence of every mans life could be known in general by no better measure than the degrees of his own approbation or censure  i own in one case whenever a mans conscience does accuse him as it seldom errs on that side that he is guilty and unless in melancholy and hypochondriac cases we may safely pronounce upon that there is always sufficient grounds for the accusation  but the converse of the proposition will not hold true  namely that wherever there is guilt the conscience must accuse and if it does not that a man is therefore innocent  this is not fact  so that the common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administering to himself  that he thanks god his mind does not misgive him and that consequently he has a good conscience because he has a quiet one  as current as the inference is and as infallible as the rule appears at first sight yet when you look nearer to it and try the truth of this rule upon plain facts you find it liable to so much error from a false application of it  the principle on which it goes so often perverted  the whole force of it lost and sometimes so vilely cast away that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life which confirm this account  a man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principles exceptionable in his conduct to the world shall live shameless  in the open commission of a sin which no reason or pretense can justify  a sin by which contrary to all the workings of humanity within he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guilt  rob her of her best dowry  and not only cover her own head with dishonor but involve a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sake surely  you will think conscience must lead such a man a troublesome life  he can have no rest night or day from its reproaches  alas conscience had something else to do all this time than break in upon him as elijah reproached the god baal this domestic god was either talking or pursuing or was in a journey or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke perhaps he was gone out in company with honor to fight a duel  to pay off some debt at play  or dirty annuity the bargain of his lust  perhaps conscience all this time was engaged at home talking aloud against petty larceny and executing vengeance upon such puny crimes as his fortune and rank in life secured him against all temptation of committing  so that he lives as merrily  sleeps as soundly in his bed  and at the last meets death with as much unconcernedness  perhaps much more so than a much better man  another is sordid unmerciful  a straithearted selfish wretch incapable either of private friendships or public spirit  take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their distress and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh or a prayer  shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasions no  thank god there is no occasion i pay every man his own  i have no fornication to answer to my conscience no faithless vows or promises to make up i have debauched no mans wife or child  thank god i am not as other men adulterers unjust or even as this libertine who stands before me  a third is crafty and designing in his nature  view his whole life  it is nothing else but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges basely to defeat the true intent of all laws plain dealing and the safe enjoyment of our several properties  you will see such a one working out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and needy man  shall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth  or the unsuspecting temper of his friend who would have trusted him with his life when old age comes on and repentance calls him to look back upon this black account and state it over again with his conscience  conscience looks into the statutes at large  finds perhaps no express law broken by what he has done  perceives no penalty or forfeiture incurred  sees no scourge waving over his head  or prison opening its gate upon him  what is there to affright his conscience  conscience has got safely entrenched behind the letter of the law sits there invulnerable fortified with cases and reports so strongly on all sides  that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold  another shall want even this refuge  shall break through all this ceremony of slow chicane scorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purpose  see the barefaced villain how he cheats lies perjures robs murders  horrid but indeed much better was not to be expected in this case  the poor man was in the dark  his priest had got the keeping of his conscience  and all he had let him know of it was that he must believe in the pope  go to mass  cross himself  tell his beads  be a good catholic and that this in all conscience was enough to carry him to heaven what  if he perjures  why  he had a mental reservation in it but if he is so wicked and abandoned a wretch as you represent him  if he robs or murders will not conscience on every such act receive a wound itself  ay  but the man has carried it to confession the wound digests there and will do well enough  and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution  o popery what have thou to answer for  when not content with the too many natural and fatal ways through which the heart is every day thus treacherous to itself above all things  thou have wilfully set open this wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller  too apt god knows to go astray of himself  and confidently speak peace to his soul when there is no peace  of this the common instances which i have drawn out of life are too notorious to require much evidence if any man doubts the reality of them or thinks it impossible for man to be such a bubble to himself  i must refer him a moment to his reflections and shall then venture to trust the appeal with his own heart let him consider in how different a degree of detestation numbers of wicked actions stand there though equally bad and vicious in their own natures  he will soon find that such of them as strong inclination or custom have prompted him to commit are generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties which a soft and flattering hand can give them and that the others to which he feels no propensity appear at once naked and deformed surrounded with all the true circumstances of folly and dishonor  when david surprised saul sleeping in the cave and cut off the skirt of his robe  we read his heart smote him for what he had done  but in the matter of uriah where a faithful and gallant servant whom he ought to have loved and honored fell to make way for his lust where conscience had so much greater reason to take the alarm  his heart smote him not  a whole year had almost passed from the first commission of that crime  to the time nathan was sent to reprove him and we read not once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified during all that time for what he had done  thus conscience this once able monitor  placed on high as a judge within us  and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one too  by an unhappy train of causes and impediments  takes often such imperfect cognizance of what passes  does its office so negligently  sometimes so corruptly that it is not to be trusted alone and therefore we find there is a necessity an absolute necessity of joining another principle with it to aid if not govern its determinations  so that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be misled in namely in what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man  an useful citizen  a faithful subject to your king  or a good servant to your god  call in religion and morality  look  what is written in the law of god  how read thou  consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truth  what say they  let conscience determine the matter upon these reports  and then if thy heart condemn thee not  which is the case the apostle supposes  the rule will be infallible  thou will have confidence toward god  that is have just grounds to believe the judgment thou have past upon thyself is the judgment of god and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced hereafter upon thee by that being before whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions  blessed is the man indeed then as the author of the book of ecclesiasticus expresses it who is not pricked with the multitude of his sins  blessed is the man whose heart has not condemned him and who is not fallen from his hope in the lord whether he be rich continues he or whether he be poor  if he have a good heart a heart thus guided and informed  he shall at all times rejoice in a cheerful countenance  his mind shall tell him more than seven watchmen that sit above upon a tower on high  in the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand casuists and give the state he lives in a better security for his behavior than all the clauses and restrictions put together which the wisdom of the legislature is forced to multiply  forced i say as things stand human laws being not a matter of original choice but of pure necessity brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law unto themselves wisely intending by the many provisions made that in all such corrupt or misguided cases where principle and the checks of conscience will not make us upright  to supply their force and by the terrors of jails and halters oblige us to it  to have the fear of god before our eyes and in our mutual dealings with each other to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrong  the first of these will comprehend the duties of religion the second those of morality which are so inseparably connected together that you cannot divide these two tables even in imagination though the attempt is often made in practice without breaking and mutually destroying them both  i said the attempt is often made  and so it is  there being nothing more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion  and indeed has so much of honesty as to pretend to none who would yet take it as the bitterest affront should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral character  or imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite  when there is some appearance that it is so  though one is not willing even to suspect the appearance of so great a virtue as moral honesty  yet were we to look into the grounds of it in the present case i am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a man the honor of his motive  let him declaim as pompously as he can on the subject it will be found at last to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest his pride his ease or some such little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great stress  give me leave to illustrate this by an example  i know the banker i deal with or the physician i usually call in to be neither of them men of much religion i hear them make a jest of it every day and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn and contempt as to put the matter past doubt well  notwithstanding this i put my fortune into the hands of the one  and what is dearer still to me i trust my life to the honest skill of the other  now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence  why  in the first place i believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power i put into their hands to my disadvantage i consider that honesty serves the purposes of this life  i know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their characters  that they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more  but put it otherwise namely that interest lay for once on the other side  that a case should happen wherein the one without stain to his reputation could secret my fortune and leave me naked in the world  or that the other could send me out of it and enjoy an estate by my death without dishonor to himself or his art  in this case what hold have i of either of them  religion the strongest of all motives is out of the question  interest the next most powerful motive in this world is strongly against me  i have nothing left to cast into the scale to balance this temptation  i must lay at the mercy of honor  or some such capricious principle  strait security for two of my best and most valuable blessings  my property and my life  as therefore we can have no dependence upon morality without religion  so on the other hand there is nothing better to be expected from religion without morality nor can any man be supposed to discharge his duties to god whatever fair appearances he may hang out that he does so if he does not pay as conscientious a regard to the duties which he owes his fellow creature  this is a point capable in itself of strict demonstration  nevertheless it is no rarity to see a man whose real moral merit stands very low who yet entertains the highest notion of himself in the light of a devout and religious man he shall not only be covetous revengeful implacable  but even wanting in points of common honesty  yet because he talks loud against the infidelity of the age  is zealous for some points of religion  goes twice a day to church  attends the sacraments  and amuses himself with a few instrumental duties of religion  shall cheat his conscience into a judgment that for this he is a religious man and has discharged faithfully his duty to god and you will find that such a man through force of this delusion generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affectation of piety though perhaps ten times more moral honesty than himself  this is likewise a sore evil under the sun and i believe there is no one mistaken principle which for its time has wrought more serious mischiefs for a general proof of this  examine the history of the romish church  see what scenes of cruelty murders rapines bloodshed have all been sanctified by a religion not strictly governed by morality  in how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this misguided sainterrant spared neither age or merit or sex or condition  and as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity  he showed none  mercilessly trampled upon both heard neither the cries of the unfortunate nor pitied their distresses  if the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficient  consider at this instant how the votaries of that religion are every day thinking to do service and honor to god by actions which are a dishonor and scandal to themselves  to be convinced of this go with me for a moment into the prisons of the inquisition  behold religion with mercy and justice chained down under her feet  there sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal proppd up with racks and instruments of torment  hark  what a piteous groan  see the melancholy wretch who uttered it just brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mocktrial and endure the utmost pains that a studied system of religious cruelty has been able to invent behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors his body so wasted with sorrow and long confinement you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers  observe the last movement of that horrid engine  what convulsions it has thrown him into  consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretched  what exquisite torture he endures by it  it is all nature can bear  good god see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips willing to take its leave  but cruelly not suffered to depart behold the unhappy wretch led back to his cell  dragged out of it again to meet the flames  and the insults in his last agonies which this principle  this principle that there can be religion without morality has prepared for him  the surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion  is to trace down the consequences such a notion has produced and compare them with the spirit of christianity  it is the short and decisive rule which our savior has left for these and such like cases  and is worth a thousand arguments  by their fruits says he ye shall know them  thus religion and morality like fast friends and natural allies can never be set at variance without the mutual ruin and dishonor of them both  and whoever goes about this unfriendly office is no wellwisher to either  and whatever he pretends he deceives his own heart and i fear his morality as well as his religion will be vain  i will add no farther to the length of this discourse than by two or three short and independent rules deducible from what has been said    st whenever a man talks loudly against religion always suspect that it is not his reason but his passions which have got the better of his creed  a bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome neighbors and where they separate depend upon it it is for no other cause but quietness sake    dly when a man thus represented tells you in any particular instance that such a thing goes against his conscience  always believe he means exactly the same thing as when he tells you such a thing goes against his stomach  a present want of appetite being generally the true se of both  in a word  trust the man in nothing  who has not a conscience in every thing  and in your own case remember this plain distinction a mistake in which has ruined thousands  that your conscience is not a law  no  god and reason made the law and has placed conscience within you to determine  not like an asiatic cadi according to the ebbs and flows of his own passions  but like a british judge in this land of liberty who makes no new law  but faithfully declares that glorious law which he finds already written
