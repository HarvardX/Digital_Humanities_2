songs sung by mr edwin of covent garden theater since his first appearance in london and many duets that mr edwin has a part in with an humourous account of mrs siddonss first reception in dublin and a portrait of mr edwin finely executed the second edition with considerable additions  the sportive muse is my physician to cure the folly and the madness of pride of envy and ambition of spleen and melancholy sadness soon as i touch the jocund lyre that instant driven from their seat the demons of the mind retire and go and persecute the great crazy tales london published by william holland no  0 oxfordstreet near bernersstreet removed from no    drury lane       account of mrs siddonss first reception in dublin when this whimsical account first appeared in dublin the ladys friends were outrageous against the author the humourist kept himself snug while a number of literary irishmen in london and dublin were claiming the praise due to him which indeed they have continued to do to this hour though the pleasant fugitive is now well known to be the offspring of the facetious  on saturday mrs siddons about whom all the world has been talking exposed her beautiful adamantine soft and lovely person for the first time at the theater royal smockalley in the bewitching melting and alltearful character of isabella from the repeated panegyrics in the impartial london newspapers we were taught to expect the sight of an heavenly angel but how were we supernaturally surprised into the most awful  at beholding a mortal goddess  the house was crowded with hundreds more than it could hold with thousands of admiring spectators that went away without a sight this extraordinary phenomenon of tragic excellence this star of melpomene this comet of the stage this sun of the firmament of the muses this moon of blank verse this queen and princess of tears this donnellan of the poisoned bowl this empress rusty fusty of the pistol and dagger this chao of shakespeare this world of weeping clouds this juno of commanding aspect this terpsichore of the curtain and scenes this proserpine of fire and earthquake this katterfelto of wonders exceeded expectation went beyond belief and soared above all the powers of description she was nature itself  she was the most exquisite work of art she was the very daisy primrose tuberose sweetbriar surzeblossom gilliflower wallflower cauliflower auricula and rosemary in short she was the bouquet of parnassus  where expectation was raised so high it was thought she would be injured by her appearance  but it was the audience who were injured several fainted even before the curtain drew up  but when she came to the scene of parting with her weddingring ah what a sight was there the very sidiers in the orchestra albeit unused to melting mood blubbered like hungry children crying for their bread and butter and when the bell rang for music between the acts the tears ran from the bassoon players eyes in such plentiful showers that they choked the finger stops and making a spout of the instrument poured in such a torrent on the first fidlers book that not seeing the overture was in two sharps the leader of the band actually played in one flat  but the sobs and sighs of the groaning audience and the noise of the corks drawn from the smellingbottles prevented the mistake between the flats and the sharps being discovered  one hundred and nine ladies fainted fortysix went into fits and ninetyfive had strong hysterics the world will scarcely credit  when they are told that fourteen children five old women a onehanded sailor and six common council men were actually drowned in the inundation of tears that flowed from the galleries lattices and boxes to increase the briny pond in the pit the water was three feet deep and the people that were obliged to stand upon the benches were in that position up to their ankles in tears  an act of parliament against her playing any more will certainly pass for she has infected all the volunteers and they sit reading the fatal marriage crying and roaring the whole morning at the expectation of seeing this giants causeway this salmon leap of wonders at night an address has been presented to the good earl of charlemont by the principal volunteers and backed by doctor quin and the faculty of dublin praying him to stay at home the evening of her appearance else they are convinced she will tear his infirm frame in pieces with her terrific screams when she is dragged from the corpse of biron and they will lose the greatest general that ever headed an army nature must assuredly in one of her bountiful moments in one of her charitable and humane leisure hours in one of her smiling days in one of her happy weeping months and in one of her allsorrowing gladsome years made this human lump of clayey perfection  oh happy hibernia blessed ierne sanctified land of saints what a hearse load what a coffin full what a churchyard tree of the brightest excellence of excellencies now stands on the turf of thy fruitful earth  from cork from kilarney from galway from ballinasloe from eyrecourt from the east from the west from the north from the south from island bridge from lazorshill from the banks of the canal to the new road at the back of drumcondra shall millions come to smockalley to see this astonishing woman  the streets round the theater shall be crowded and the very gabbards that carry coals to island bridge shall stop at the blindquay and land their unpolished watermen to spend thirteenpence for a seat in the upper gallery when isabella is performed  o thou universal genius what pity it is that thy talents are so confined to tragedy alone no age  nay the roman theater the stage at constantinople  nero himself never performed the scene of madness of grief of joy of woe of distress of sorrow and of pity so well as mrs siddons  may the curses of an insulted nation pursue the gentlemen of the college the gentlemen of the bar and the peers and peeresses whose wisdom and discernment have been so highly extolled that hissed her on the second night true it is mr garrick never could make any thing of her and pronounced her below mediocrity  true it is the london audience once did not like her but what of that rise up bright goddess of the sock and buskin and soar to unknown regions of immortal praise for  envy will merit as
