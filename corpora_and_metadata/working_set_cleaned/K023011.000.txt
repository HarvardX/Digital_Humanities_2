a collection of letters never before printed written by alexander pope esquire and other ingenious gentlemen to the late aaron hill esquire  london printed for w owen at homers head near temple bar fleet street price   s mdccli  letters from several ingenious gentlemen to the late aaron hill esquire letter i from mr pope to aaron hill esquire dear sir the little thing which you take so kindly is but a very small part of what i owe you and whatever my studies or to use a properer word idleness are capable of producing ought to be returned you in mere gratitude for the pleasure i have received from your own writings in which give me leave to say your good will to me in particular is as distinguishable as the obligation you lay on the public in general i am very happy in the envy and silly attacks of such people as have awakened the generosity of so powerful a defender nor am i ashamed of those weaknesses of mine which they have exposed in print the greatest of which was my thinking too heartily of them to whom i wrote my letters with so much unguarded friendliness and freedom since you have found a way to turn those weaknesses into virtue by your partial regard of them the eye of candor like the sun makes all the beauties which it sees it gives color and brightness to the meanest objects purely by looking on them i agree with you that there is a pleasure in seeing the nature and temper of men in the plainest undress but few men are of consequence enough to deserve or reward that curiosity i shall indeed and so will all mankind be highly pleased to see the great czar of muscovy in this light drawn by himself like an ancient master in rough strokes without heightening or shadowing what a satisfaction to behold that perfect likeness without art affectation or even the gloss of coloring with a noble neglect of all that finishing and smoothing which any other hand would have been obliged to bestow on so principal a figure i write this to a man whose judgment i am certain of and therefore am as certain you will give the world this great depositum just as you have received it there will be no danger of your dressing this mars too finely whose armor is not gold but adamant and whose style in all probability is much more strong than it is polished i congratulate you that this great treasure is fallen into your hands and i congratulate all europe that it is to be delivered to them through the hands of one who will think it sacrilege to touch upon much less to alter any great lines of such an original  i can make you no better return for your great compliment upon me which it would be arrogance in me to show to any other and dangerous even to remember myself but by telling you that it is honor enough to reward all my studies to find my character and reputation is part of the care of that person to whom the fame and glory of peter alexiowitz was committed  sir  i am forced to make use of another hand than my own in this letter having received a wound cross all the veins of my right hand by which the tendons of two fingers are separated however it was a fine paid for my life which has been very narrowly saved and which may now continue me some years longer  dear sir your most faithful affectionate and obliged servant a pope  letter ii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire jan      0  sir i was unwilling to answer your too obliging letter which puts much too great a stress upon my opinion till i had read your play with the attention it deserves i mean not once but several times over in a word to comply with my judgment will cost you no trouble except to your modesty which is to act it as soon as possible nothing but trifles have i to object and which were such as did not once stop me at the first reading the spirit design and characters carrying me on without stop check or even intermission you certainly are master of the art of the stage in the manner of forming and conducting the design which i think impossible to be mended of that great part and of the other the raising the passions i will say nothing to you who know them so much better than myself i would only point out a few particularities in thought or expression as material as excepting to a button on your coat or a loose hair two or three lines i have with great timorousness written on one of your blank leaves in black lead half afraid to be legible and not without some hope that before you see them they may be vanished so may perhaps my objections every one of them shall i see you soon to tell you these nothings whenever i shall see you i hope to find we can employ the time better than i in telling or you in hearing them or must i return you the play now your orders will be obeyed as soon as you give them  i really rejoice at your ladys recovery i would have her and you think the air of richmond is particularly good to reestablish her pray let miss hill know i am ready to believe all the good things her own father can see in her i can safely trust both his judgments and his affections i am truly  sir your obliged and sincerely affectionate servant a pope  letter iii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire feb      0  dear sir i made a strong essay to have told you in person how very kindly i took your two last letters the only hours i had in my power from a necessary care that brought me back immediately i would have imposed on you it will please you to know the poor woman is rather better though it may be but like the improvement of a light on the end of a dying taper which brightens a little before it expires  your hint about my title of false taste you will see is made use of in the second edition your opinion also of my giving some public dissent or protest against the silly malicious misconstruction of the town i agree to but i think no one step should be taken in it but in concert with the duke whom they injure it will be a pleasure felt by you to tell you his grace has written to me the strongest assurance imaginable of the rectitude of his opinion and of his resentment of that report which to him is an impertinence to me a villainy  i am afraid of tiring you and what is your best security i have not time to do it i will only just tell you that many circumstances you have heard as resemblances to the picture of timon are utterly inventions of liars the number of servants never was an hundred the paintings not of venio or la guerre but bellucci and zaman no such buffet manner of reception at the study terras etc all which and many more they have not scrupled to forge to gain some credit to the application and which is worse belyed testimonies of noblemen and of my particular friends to condemn me in a word the malice is as great as the dullness of my calumniators the one i forgive the other i pity and i despise both adieu the first day i am near you i will find you out and show you something you will like my best good wishes are yours and miss uranias  your affectionate servant a pope  letter iv from mr pope to aaron hill esquire sir parsons green feb       since i am fully satisfied we are each of us sincerely and affectionately servants to the other i desire we may be no further misled by the warmth of writing on this subject if you think i have shown too much weakness or if i think you have shown too much warmth let us forgive one anothers temper i told you i thought my letter a filly one but the more i thought so the more in sending it i showed my trust in your good disposition toward me i am sorry you took it to have an air of neglect or superiority because i know in my heart i had not the least thought of being any way superior to mr hill and far from the least design to show neglect to a gentleman who was showing me civility i meant in return to show him a better thing sincerity which i am sorry should be so ill expressed as to seem rudeness i meant but to complain as frankly as you that all complaints on both sides might be out and at a period for ever i meant by this to have laid a surer foundation for your opinion of me for the future that it might no more be shaken by mistakes or whispers  i am sure sir you have a higher opinion of my poetry than i myself but i am so desirous you should have a just one of me every way that i wish you understood both my temper in general and my justice to you in particular better than i find my letter represented them i wish it the more since you tell me how ill a picture my enemies take upon em to give of the mind of a man they are utter strangers to however you will observe that much spleen and emotion are a little inconsistent with neglect and an opinion of superiority toward them god knows i never felt any emotions but what bad writers raise in all men those gentle ones of laughter or pity that i was so open concerned and serious with respect to you only is sure a proof of regard not neglect for in truth nothing ever vexed me till i saw your epigram against dr s and me come out in their papers and this indeed did vex me to see one swan among the geese  that the letters a h were applied to you in the papers i did not know for i seldom read them i heard it only from mr savage as from yourself and seat my assurances to the contrary but i dont see how the annotator on the d could have rectified that mistake publicly without particularizing your name in a book where i thought it too good to be inserted no doubt he has applied that passage in the d to you by the story he tells but his mention of bombast only in some of your juvenile pieces i think was meant to show that passage hinted only at that allegorical muddiness and not at any worse sort of dirt with which some other writers were charged i hate to say what will not be believed yet when i told you many asked me to whom that oblique praise was meant i did not tell you i answered it was you has it escaped your observation that the name is a syllable too long or if you will have it a christian name is there any other in the whole book is there no author of two syllables whom it will better fit not only as getting out of the allegorical muddiness but as having been dipped in the dirt of partywriting and recovering from it betimes i know such a man who would take it for a compliment and so would his patrons too  but i ask you not to believe this except you are vastly inclined to it i will come closer to the point would you have the note left out it shall would you have it expressly said you were not meant it shall if i have any influence on the editors  i believe the note was meant only as a gentle rebuke and friendlily i understood very well the caveat on your part to be the same and complained you see of nothing but two or three lines reflecting on my behavior and temper to other writers because i knew they were not true and you could not know they were  you cannot in your cool judgment think it fair to fix a mans character on a point of which you do not give one instance name but the man or men to whom i have unjustly omitted approbation or encouragement and i will be ready to do them justice i think i have publicly praised all the best writers of my time except yourself and such as i have had no fair opportunity to praise as to the great and popular i have praised but few and those at the times when they were least popular many of those writers have done nothing else but flattered the great and popular or been worse employed by em in partystuff i do indeed think it no great pride in me to speak about them with some air of superiority and this sir must be the cause and no other that made me address that declaration of my temper toward them to you who had accused me of the contrary not i assure you from the least imagination of any resemblance between you and them either in merit or circumstances  i named mr dennis because you distinguish him from the rest so do i but moreover he was uppermost in my thoughts from having endeavored  before your admonition to promote his affair with lord wilmington lord lansdown lord blandford and mr pulteney etc who promised me to favor it but it would be unjust to measure my good will by the effects of it on the great many of whom are the last men in the world who will pay tributes of this sort from their own ungiving nature and many of whom laugh at me when i seriously petition for mr dennis after this i must not name the many whom i have fruitlesly solicited i hope yet to be more successful but sir you seem too iniquitous in your conceptions of me when you fansy i called such things services i called em but humane offices services i said i would render him if i could i would ask a place for life for him and i have but that is not in my power if it was it would be a service and i wish it  i mentioned the possibility of mr ds abusing me for forgiving him because he actually did in print lately represent my poor undesigning subscriptions to him to be the effect of fear and desire to stop his critiques upon me i wish mr hill would for once think so heartily of me as to believe me sincere in one declaration that i desire no man to belie his own judgment in my favor therefore though i acknowledge your generous offer to give examples of imperfections rather out of your own works than mine in your intended book i consent with all my heart to your confining them to mine for two reasons the one that i fear your sensibility that way is greater than my own by observing you seem too concerned at that hint given by the notes on the d of a little fault in the works of your youth only the other is a better namely that i intend to amend by your remarks and correct the faults you find if they are such as i expect from mr hills cool judgment  i am very sensible that my poetical talent is all that may i say not will make me remembered but it is my morality only that must make me beloved or happy and if it be any deviation from greatness of mind to prefer friendships to fame or the honest enjoyments of life to noisy praises i fairly confess that meanness therefore it is sir that i much more resent any attempt against my moral character which i know to be unjust than any to lessen my poetical one which for all i know may be very just  pray then sir excuse my weak letter as i do your warm one i end as i begun you guessed right that i was sick when i wrote it yours are very well written but i have neither health nor time to make mine so i have writ a whole book of retractations of my writings which would greatly improve your criticisms on my errors but of my life and manners i do not yet repent one jott especially when i find in my heart i continue to be without the least acrimony even as little as i desire you should bear to myself sincerely sir  yours affectionately a pope if i did not acknowledge as i ought both the fathers agreeable present and the daughters pretty one which you sent me i very ill expressed myself if miss urania hill has not my   to edition of the odyssey i beg your leave to send it her you had sooner heard from me but i saw yours here but three days ago i return home tomorrow    letter v from mr pope to aaron hill esquire feb         sir ever since i returned home i have been in almost roaring pain with a violent rheumatism in my shoulder so that all i am able to do is to return you thanks for yours the satisfaction it gave me is proportioned to the regard i have for you i will not praise your poem further than to say the generosity of its sentiments must charm every man its other merit you know well you will pardon the few doubts i start in the interlinings they are such as you can efface as easily as they may deserve i wish to tell my lord peterborough who has so long honored me with so particular and familiar an acquaintance the honor done him  i am very desirous to leave out that note if you like so the two lords and one gentleman who really took and printed that edition i can i doubt not bring easily to it  the chief objection i have to what you say of myself in this poem is that the praise is too strong i may well compound for the rest  suffer me to send the young lady the odyssey full of faults as i know it to be before she grows old enough to know how mean a present it is i am with great truth  sir your most humble obedient servant a pope  letter vi from mr pope to aaron hill esquire march        sir i am extremely pleased with the favor you have done me in sending me your poem and the more as it gives me the opportunity of assuring you i never did or meant you the least injury in which i should have fully satisfied you long since had you asked me the question i remember mr lintot showed me a piece of yours of which he said you desired my opinion i was just then in a great hurry going a journey out of town upon business for a few days and therefore told him i would call for it in a day or two to read carefully however i cast my eye on some parts of it which i liked and told him so this was all to the best of my memory that passed between us and you may imagine it was some surprise to me when i saw your preface a very short time after i think it incumbent on any wellmeaning man to acquit himself of an illgrounded suspicion in another who perhaps means equally well and is only too credulous i am sincerely so far from resenting this mistake that i am more displeased at your thinking it necessary to treat me so much in a style of compliment as you do in your letter i will say nothing of the poem you favor me with for fear of being in the wrong but i am sure the person who is capable of writing it can need no man to judge it i am with all respect  sir your most obedient humble servant a pope i received yours but four days since it being directed to chiswick where i have not lived this twelvemonth    letter vii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire twickenham march         dear sir i am not more happy nor feel a greater ease in comparison of my former pain in the recovery from my rheumatism than in that from your displeasure be assured no little offenders ever shall be distinguished more by me your dedication pleases me almost equally with the poem our hearts beat just together in regard to men of power and quality but a series of infirmities for my whole life has been but one long disease has hindered me from following your advices i this day have writ to lord peterborough a letter with your poem the familiarity in which we have lived some years makes it not unusual in either him or me to tell each other any thing that pleases us otherwise you might think it arrogant in me to pretend to put so good a thing into his hands in which i have no merit your mention of our friend mr mallet i thank you for and should be glad he would give me an opportunity of thanking you in person who am with sincerity  sir your obliged and faithful servant a pope  letter viii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire twickenham april        dear sir it is a serious pleasure to me to find you concerned that i should do your good sense and discernment the justice it deserves it is impossible for me not to think just what you would have me on this head the whole spirit and meaning of your poem shows all little thoughts to be strangers to your soul i happen to know many particulars relating to the earl of peterboroughs conduct and just glory in that scene you draw so well but no man ought i think to attempt what you hint at or can pretend to do him more honor than what you yourself here have done except himself i have long pressed him to put together many papers lying by him to that end on this late occasion he told me you had formerly endeavored the same and it comes into my mind that on many of those papers i have seen an endorsement a h which i fansy might be those you overlooked my lord spoke of you with great regard and told me how narrowly you both missed of going together on an adventurous expedition on an expedition to the west indies  the real reason i carried him your poem was that i imagined you would never send it him of all mankind and that i was truly pleased with it  i am troubled to reflect how unequal a correspondent i am to you partly through want of health for i have since had a fever partly through want of spirits and want of solitude for the last thing we poets care to own is the other want that of abilities  but i am sensibly pleased with your letter not only with that which seemed to prompt it but with the things said in it and i thank you for both  believe me desirous to see you when and where you shall determine though i wish it were here you will see a place seeming more fit for me than it is looking poetical yet too much in the world romantic and not retired however i can lock up all avenues to it sometimes and i know no better reason for doing so or for shutting out the world than to enjoy such an one as yourself  i am sir with esteem and sincerity  your most obedient faithful servant a pope  letter ix from mr pope to aaron hill esquire august  0      dear sir the very moment i receive yours i dispatch this to tell you with sincerity both my guests and my own concern to have no hopes of seeing you as well as what is unfeignedly a yet greater concern our sorrow at what you express to be the occasion of it he wishes now for power for no other reason than to be able to elevate merit above that fortune it commonly finds from power and i can truly add for my own part who never tasted power that i never felt any uneasiness in a low fortune but that which it causes when i find it cannot prove the regard and love i bear to true worth in any afflictive circumstance  excuse my pretending to say a word on that subject all i meant to say but the overflowings of my heart vented thus much was to beg you to think too favorably of us both to imagine we should not be unhappy as much as dissatisfied if we did not read once or twice more your tragedy after what you tell us of your having altered it on our suggestions we have a conscientious fear that you may have complied too implicitly with those marks rather of our scrupulous sincerity than of any certain judgment and have quenched sometimes a flame we admire though we may fear or sometimes heightened what may be natural though we might think it low pray ease us by favoring us with a second view of it  and whenever you send me that essay you may be assured of my sincere answer though upon that head i could rather wish it were given you personally i hope a little time will bring us together know me most affectionately dear sir  yours a pope  letter x from mr pope to aaron hill esquire sept        i could not persuade myself to write to you since your great loss till i hoped you had received some alleviation to it from the only hand which can give any that of time not to have mentioned it however fashionable it may be i think unnatural and in some sense inhuman and i fear the contrary custom is too much an excuse in reality for that indifference we too usually have for the concern of another in truth that was not my case i know the reason of one man is of little effect toward the resignation of another and when i compared the forces of yours and mine i doubted not which had the advantage even though in your own concern it is hard that in these tender afflictions the greatness of the mind and the goodness are opposite to each other and that while reason and the consideration upon what conditions we receive all the goods of this life operate toward our quiet even the best of our passions which are the same things with the softest of our virtues refuse us that comfort but i will say no more on this melancholy subject the whole intent of this letter is to tell you how much i wish you capable of consolation and how much i wish to know when you find yourself so i would hope you begin to seek it to amuse your mind with those studies of which tully says adversis perfugium and solatium praebent and to transcribe if i may so express it your own softnesses and generous passions into the hearts of others who more want them i do not flatter you in saying i think your tragedy will do this effectually to which i had occasion the other day to do justice to mr wilks or whatever else you choose to divert your own passion with and to raise that of your readers  i wish the change of place or the views of nature in the country made a part of your scheme  you once thought of richmond  i wish you were there or nearer i have thrice missed of you in town the only times i have been there my last month was passed at my lord cobhams and in a journey through oxfordshire i wish you as susceptible at this time of these pleasures as i am i have been truly concerned for you and for your daughter who i believe is a true part of you i will trouble you no farther but with the assurance that i am not unmindfully  sir your most sincere humble servant a pope  letter xi from mr pope to aaron hill esquire sept        dear sir i have been and yet am totally confined by my mothers relapse if that can be called so which is rather a constant and regular decay she is now on her last bed in all probability from whence she has not risen in some weeks yet in no direct pain but a perpetual languor i suffer for her for myself and for you in the reflection of what you have felt at the side of a sick bed which i now feel and of what i probably soon shall suffer which you now suffer in the loss of ones best friend i have wished ever since i saw your letter to ask you since you find your own house a scene of sorrows to pass some days in mine which i begin to think i shall soon have the same melancholy reason to shun in the mean time i make a sort of amusement of this melancholy situation itself and try to derive a comfort in imagining i give some to her i am seldom prompted to poetry in these circumstances yet i will send you a few lines i sent to other day from her bedside to a particular friend indeed i want spirits and matter to send you any thing else or on any other subject these too are spiritless and incorrect  while every joy successful youth is thine be no unpleasing melancholy mine me long ah long may these soft cares engage to rock the cradle of reposing age with lenient arts prolong a parents breath make languor smile and smooth the bed of death me when the cares my better years have shown anothers age shall hasten on my own shall some kind hand like bs or thine lead gently down and favor the decline in wants in sickness shall a friend be nigh explore my thought and watch my asking eye whether that blessing be denied or given thus far is right the rest belongs to heaven excuse this in a man who is weak and wounded but not by his enemies but for his friends i wish you the continuance of all that is yet dear to you in life and am truly  yours a pope  letter xii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire twickenham sept         sir the hurry i was in to send to you made it a message instead of a letter which i ask your excuse for by this if now you have thoughts of the country pray think no further than my own house i am wholly at your service the weather is yet inviting i could wish if miss hill under a fathers authority might venture she saw me before i am quite decayed i mean all of me that is yet half flourishing my garden you will very much oblige me and give countenance to my judgment in letting your tragedy pass through my hands to any persons to whom you care i should show it believe me with great truth and a real concern for what must so much afflict a good mind  sir your affectionate obedient servant a pope  letter xiii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire sept         dear sir i return you the enclosed the day after i received it lest it should retard your finishing the copy now the year draws toward winter and though i am in a great hurry which allows me to say little only to tell you in my lords name and my own that we think you show even more friendship and confidence in us than we have hitherto been justly entitled to from any use our opinion could be of to a judgment so good as your own we are fully satisfied and it is but at a word or two that i can carp with the utmost and most extended severity of a friend it will be with infinitely greater promptitude and pleasure that i shall speak everywhere my real approbation and esteem of the performance in which i shall do no more than discharge my conscience i wish sincerely i could as well serve you in promoting its success as i can testify it deserves all success you will i am sure be so candid and so reasonable as to conclude i would not decline writing your epilogue on any but a just reason and indeed to me an invariable maxim which i have held these twenty years every poetical friend i have has had my word i never would and my leave to take the same refusals i made him ill if ever i wrote one for another and this very winter mr thomson and mr mallet excuse me whose tragedies either are to appear this season or the next i fansy the latter as i have seen or heard of no more but a first act yet of each  i have lately had an address of another kind from a man of letters which gives me more embarrass and in the conduct whereof i could wish i had your advice though i hardly know how to ask it i hope soon to see the critical work you promised me in which i hope to have some further occasion of proving to you the real deference i have to your sentiments and esteem for your person i am dear sir  your faithful and affectionate obliged servant a pope  letter xiv from mr pope to aaron hill esquire oct        dear sir it was my hope you had thoughts of passing a few days hereabouts that made me impertinent enough to wish you would make use of this place which is as much at your service as its master it is otherwise too great a trouble to you no less than too great a distinction shown to me to have you come purposely much less to give the young lady the fatigue of an afternoons visit to what so little merits it my wish was that you could have taken a bed here as long as you could allow yourself to be in the country and have done me the pleasure to see the person you now love best in the world with you either as giving you to me or receiving you from me on the day that you came or that you went be assured i always am with truth  dear sir your most obliged affectionate faithful servant a pope if miss hill does not dine with us i shall think all the rites of hospitality violated    letter xv from mr pope to aaron hill esquire monday night oct        dear sir i see the season will not allow me the pleasure of seeing you nor of showing my faded garden this year to miss urania i assure you i would willingly make a trip to london on purpose to see you and her but my constitution of late has been faster in decline than the year i have been as ill as when i writ you that peevish image of my soul a letter some time since which had the good effect of making us know one another  this is the first day i have been able to see lady s who showed me a very polite letter of yours that put her out of countenance the truth is she makes no pretension to judge of poetry but the tragedy will be shown as i told you to one or rather i think to both will be better i wish you was not so soon to bring it on by what mr savage tells me of mr booth and mrs porter i think it will be a loss both to the play and to them if they do not make one another shine i hope in a week to wait on you in london and tell you with what plain truth i am dear sir  yours a pope my book i have no manner of thought of publishing it is of so various a nature that i know not under what denomination yet to rank the many parts of it and shall write just as i live without knowing the end of my works or days the whole will proceed as my life proceeds and probably die as i die    letter xvi from mr pope to aaron hill esquire thursday oct         dear sir there is an ill fate hangs upon me in relation to the pleasure i have often from the very first time i saw you at dr youngs proposed in our acquaintance i really stayed that night in town upon bowrys notice which he left in writing that you should be at home all wednesday and had dedicated three hours to you or more properly to myself with you i asked particularly for miss urania but thought myself though old enough not familiar enough to ask to see her i desire your first notice if you come this way or rather i wish you would take up your lodging with me in the mean time pray send the tragedy of athelwold for so i would call it under cover to the countess of suffolk before monday at her lodgings in st jamess i promised it her again and if you think it of any consequence that the k should see it in manuscript i think nothing more easy in truth all this is doing it no credit it is only doing some to those who may commend it i could not imagine in what parts it needed addition sure every incident is well prepared but no man can see so far into his own work as the author if a good one so little if a bad or indifferent one  i am with truth  sir your very obliged and faithful servant a pope  letter xvii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire chiswick nov        sir i troubled you with a hasty scrawl at lord tyrconnels in which i mentioned gillivers desire to be the publisher of your tragedy since he requests my letter to recommend him i find mr savage has raised his hope by saying you had kept yourself unengagd in expectation that i would plead for him and that you wondered i did not sooner if this be not one of those things in which mr s speaks upon imagination i am more obliged to you than ever i intended for i assure you i had no thought of imposing nay not even of proposing a bookseller for fear your great complacency toward me should lead you more than your own inclination to another bookseller but if you have no such byafs this man i really think honest and capable in his business i hope in a few days to meet you in town and am sincerely yours and the young ladys  a pope i just now receive your very kind letter but can answer it no otherwise than by going about what you propose i will write first and then see every body i can in town on tuesday etc    letter xviii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire nov         dear sir i shall have the pleasure sick or well to be at the first representation of your play tomorrow with lord burlington and lord bathurst and one or two more another noble lord who understands you best must be contented to read the two last acts in his study but sir will wyndham with mr gay and some others will be there also in another place in his stead  i write this that i may not take up a minute of your time in calling on me tomorrow but if you will send to the office tonight for places for four people we will order a man or two to go to keep em for us lord burlington comes on purpose to town i am with great truth  yours a pope i have yet heard no account from court    letter xix from mr pope to aaron hill esquire sat morn nov         dear sir i cannot leave london without thanking you for the pleasure you gave me last night by which i see you can as well make actors as plays yet i own i receive more pleasure from reading than seeing your athelwold i thought the best part of the audience very attentive and was told several ladies were moved to tears it is pity mrs cibbers voice and person were not a little higher she speaks extremely justly and seems to be mistress of her part i could not come soon enough for the prologue but the epilogue is a very humorous one i am ashamed to trouble you but being gone out of town and fearing the mistakes of servants i beg a box may be had for monday the third night if there be any empty for mrs blount a particular friend of mine i yesterday saw lady suffolk and found though their majestys had not had time to read yet they were possessed with a good opinion of the play and she would not part with the copy expecting it would be called for every day i must once more acknowledge the very obliging manner in which you favored the bookseller as well as the particular generosity to him i can add no more but an assurance of the sincerity with which i am  dear sir your most obliged and affectionate servant a pope i am hastened away on hearing my mother is not well as soon as i return i hope we may pass more time together    letter xx from mr pope to aaron hill esquire twickenham dec         dear sir i thank you for your tragedy which i have now read over a sixth time and of which i not only preserve but increase my esteem you have been kind to this age in not telling the next in your preface the ill taste of the town of which the reception you describe it to have given of your play worse indeed than i had heard or could have imagined is a more flagrant instance than any of those trifles mentioned in my epistle which yet i hear the sore vanity of our pretenders to taste flinches at extremely  the title you mention had been a properer to that epistle  i have heard no criticisms about it nor do i listen after em nos haec novimus esse nihil i mean i think the verses to be so but as you are a man of tender sentiments of honor i know it will grieve you to hear another undeservedly charged with a crime his heart is free from for if there be truth in the world i declare to you i never imagined the least application of what i said of timon could be made to the d of chs than whom there is scarce a more blameless worthy and generous beneficent character among all our nobility and if i have not lost my senses the town has lost em by what i heard so late as but two days ago of the uproar on this head i am certain if you calmly read every particular of that description you will find almost all of em point blank the reverse of that persons villa it is an awkward thing for a man to print in defense of his own work against a chimaera you know not who or what you fight against the objections start up in a new shape like the armies and phantoms of magicians and no weapon can cut a mist or a shadow yet it would have been a pleasure to me to have found some friend saying a word in my justification against a most malicious falsehood i speak of such as have known by their own experience these twenty years that i always took up their defense when any stream of calumny ran upon em if it gives the duke one moments uneasiness i should think myself ill paid if the whole earth admired the poetry and believe me would rather never have written a verse in my life than that any one of em should trouble a truly good man it was once my case before but happily reconciled and among generous minds nothing so endears friends as the having offended one another  i lament the malice of the age that studies to see its own likeness in every thing i lament the dullness of it that cannot see an excellence the first is my unhappiness the second yours i look upon the fate of your piece like that of a great treasure which is buried as soon as brought to light but it is sure to be dug up the next age and enrich posterity  i have been very sensible on these two occasions to feel them as i have done at a time when i daily feared the loss of what is and ought to be dearer to me than any reputation but that of a friend or than any thing of my own except my morals the loss of a most tender parent  she is alive and that is all i have perceived my heart in this and you may believe me sincerely  dear sir your faithful and really affectionate servant a pope  letter xxi from mr pope to aaron hill esquire twickenham nov         dear sir i writ to you a very hasty letter being warmed in the cause of an old acquaintance in which i was sure you would concur i mean john dennis whose circumstances were described to me in the most moving manner i went next day with the lord to whom you directed your letter and play which at my return home i received but yesterday i thank you for your agreeable present to my grotto for your more agreeable letter and your most excellent translation of voltaire to whom you have preserved all the beauty he had and added the nerves he wanted this short acknowledgment is all i can make just now i am just taken up by mr thomson in the perusal of a new poem he has brought me i wish you were with us the first day i see london i will wait on you on many accounts but on none more than my being affectionately and with true esteem dear sir  yours a pope i desire miss urania will know me for her servant    letter xxii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire twickenham may         sir your very kind letter came hither in my absence which occasioned my delay till now in acknowledging it your partiality to me both as a poet and as a man is great the former i deserve not but the latter i will never forfeit it would be wronging your modesty to say much of the verses you enclose but it would be wronging sense and poetry not to say they are fine ones and such as i could not forget having once seen them  i have almost forgot what i told you of the patent but at the time i told it i could not well be mistaken having just then had the account from mr davenant the envoy indeed i fansy it was only of his ancestors patent that he spoke unless sir william davenant bought up killigrews i know no way of coming to the knowledge of this affair mr davenant being now abroad and i know not where but if you would have me write about it i will learn his direction  i am at all times glad to hear of you on any occasion i would willingly wait on you in the park if i knew your times i have called twice or thrice there in vain without being heard i guessed you were in the country my sincere good wishes attend you and your agreeable family as far as i have seen of it i cannot but wish well to i am  dear sir your most affectionate and faithful servant a pope  letter xxiii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire june        sir i sent you as honest an answer as i could to the letter you favored me with and am sorry you imagine any civil reproach or latent meaning where i meant to express myself with the utmost openness i would assure you if you please by my oath as well as my word that i am in no degree displeased at any freedom you can take with me in a private letter or with my writings in public i again insist that you alter or soften no one criticism of yours in my favor nor deprive yourself of the liberty nor the world of the profit of your freest remarks on my errors  in what i said i gave you a true picture of my own heart as far as i know it myself it is true i have shown a scorn of some writers but it proceeded from an experience that they were bad men or bad friends or vile hirelings in which case their being authors did not make them to me either more respectable or more formidable as for any other pique my mind is not so susceptible of it as you have seemed on each occasion too much inclined i think to believe what may have sometimes seemed a neglect of others was rather a laziness to cultivate or contract new friends when i was satisfied with those i had or when i apprehended their demands were too high for me to answer  i thank you for the confidence you show you have in me in telling me what you judge amiss in my nature if it be as you too partially say my only fault i might soon be a perfect character for i would endeavor to correct this fault in myself and entreat you to correct all those in my writings i see by the specimen you generously gave me in your late letter you are able to do it and i would rather owe and own i owe that correction to your friendship than to my own industry  for the last paragraph of yours i shall be extremely ready to convey what you promise to send me to my lord b i am in hopes very speedily to see him myself and will in that case be the bearer if not i shall send it by the first safe hand to him i am truly glad of any occasion of proving myself with all the respect that is consistent with sincerity  sir your most obliged and affectionate servant a pope  letter xxiv from mr pope to aaron hill esquire june        sir the favor of yours of may the   th had not been unacknowledged so long but it reached me not till my return from a journey which had carried me from scene to scene where gods might wander with delight i am sorry yours was attended with any thoughts less pleasing either from the conduct toward you of the world in general or of any one else in particular as to the subject matter of the letter i found what i have often done in receiving letters from those i most esteemed and most wished to be esteemed by a great pleasure in reading it and a great inability to answer it i can only say you oblige me in seeming so well to know me again as one extremely willing that the free exercise of criticism should extend over my own writings as well as those of others whenever the public may receive the least benefit from it as i question not they will a great deal when exerted by you i am sensible of the honor you do me in proposing to send me your work before it appears if you do i must insist that no use in my favor be made of that distinction by the alteration or softening of any censure of yours on any line of mine  what you have observed in your letter i think just only i would acquit myself in one point i could not have the least pique to mr th in what is cited in the treatise of the bathos from the play which i never supposed to be his he gave it as shakespeares and i take it to be of that age and indeed the collection of those and many more of the thoughts censured there was not made by me but dr arbuthnot  i have had two or three occasions to lament that you seem to know me much better as a poet than as a man you can hardly conceive how little either pique or contempt i bear to any creature unless for immoral or dirty actions any mortal is at full liberty unanswered to write and print of me as a poet to praise me one year and blame me another only i desire him to spare my character as an honest man over which he can have no private much less any public right without some personal knowledge of my heart or the motives of my conduct nor is it a sufficient excuse to allege he was so or so informed which was the case with those men  i am sincere in all i say to you and have no vanity in saying it you really overvalue me greatly in my poetical capacity and i am sure your work would do me infinitely too much honor even if it blamed me oftener than it commended for the first you will do with lenity the last with excess but i could be glad to part with some share of any good mans admiration for some of his affection and his belief that i am not wholly undeserving to be thought what i am to you  sir a most faithful affectionate servant a pope  letter xxv from mr pope to aaron hill esquire july         sir i need not assure you in many words that i join my suffrage entirely with lord bs in general after a fourth reading your tragedy of caesar i think no characters were ever more nobly sustained than those of caesar and brutus in particular you excel throughout in the greatness of sentiment and i add that i never met with more striking sentences or lively short reprizes there is almost everywhere such a dignity in the scenes that instead of pointing out any one scene i can scarce point out any that wants it in any degree except you would a little raise that of the plebeians in the last act that dignity is admirably reconciled with softness in the scenes between caesar and calpurnia and all those between caesar and brutus are a noble strife between greatness and humanity the management of the whole is as artful as it is noble whatever particular remarks we have made further will be rather the subject of conversation than a letter of which we shall both be glad of an opportunity either here at twickenham or in town as shall best suit your convenience pray sir let this confirm you in the opinion you kindly and indeed justly entertain of the wish i feel and ever felt notwithstanding mistakes to be and to be thought  sincerely your obliged affectionate and faithful servant a pope  letter xxvi from mr pope to aaron hill esquire twickenham aug         sir i am forced to say but little to you though my spirit has been warmed by the kind and let me add the just manner in which you took our last letter my lord who has not only resolved to make himself my guest but an inhabitant of this place during all his stay in this kingdom is at this time fixed to this place too closely by a fever which has confined him to his bed and chamber some days i am but just now satisfied that he is out of danger and i am as sure as that he lives that he will be glad to see you here and i think it certain if you can get those affairs over which you mention as soon as i wish you at ease that you may find him here this fortnight that i shall take a warm part in bringing you together my own heart knows and let me tell you when you know that heart as well as i hope fortune will not long hinder you from doing though many unlucky strokes of her influence have been too strong upon us both who must else have naturally united as we mutually love and hate the same things i believe trust and pray we shall perfectly understand one another believe me till then upon my bare assurance very faithfully without superfluous words in one word  dear sir yours a pope  letter xxvii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire sept         sir i have now little to say of your tragedy which i return with my thanks for your indulgence to my opinion which i see so absolutely deferred to that i wish i had crossed less frequently i cannot find another thing i think a fault in you  but my lord thinks three things may yet be reconsiderd brutus on sight of the warrant signed for his death takes at once the resolution of murdering caesar as none of his father quere whether in the scene that follows between him and caesar all tenderness on the side of brutus and all beyond the point of honor that friendship exacted should not rather be avoided than heightened  another quere is whether it would not beget more indignation in the audience against cassius and more compassion for caesar to show that cassius suspected brutus to be caesars son and therefore exacted from brutus the oath of sparing neither father relation etc  the third thing is whether the efforts made by caesar to prevent the civil war not only by the equal offer he made while the matter was under debate in the senate and which the consuls lentulus and marcellus refused to report to the senate but by the message he sent to pompey when he was at brundusium to desire a meeting to settle the matter and avoid the civil war  vid caes comm de bell civili lib   the mention of these somewhere in the play might help to remove the prepossession against caesar  after our little cavils for so we will rather call minute and verbal points of criticism we owe you the justice to extol highly what we highly approve and you need not desire us to speak as we think it is what we have in different ways done all our lives where it was to our prejudice and cannot but do here where it is to our honor i only wish you a stage actors and an audience worthy of you and it  i have often wished to live to see the day when prologues and epilogues should be no more i wish a great genius would break through the silly useless formality but at least i would have one try to leave the audience full of the effects of a good tragedy without an epilogue let me add another hint concerning the apparatus and circumstantials of your play since i have nothing left more to wish in the play itself that you would entitle it barely the tragedy of caesar and give no intimation of his being a patriot for i fear instead of preparing the audience it might revolt them and put all the little critics upon carping previously at the very design and character which would appear by degrees and with the proper preparations in the piece on the stage another thing was a thought of my lords that it should be printed before acting a day or two for the sentiments are so thicksown and the sense so deep sometimes that they require more attention and thought than the hearer may be apt to give on the first representation i am not positive either as to his or my thought but submit them to your consideration  i have nothing to add but to lament our unhappiness that we cannot see you personally to confirm what these letters tell you of our real opinion of your work esteem of its author and wishes for your success in this and every thing i am  sir your most faithful and obliged servant a pope  letter xxviii from mr pope to aaron hill esquire nov        dear sir this is quite a letter of business and therefore excuse it i will not mix in it a word of affection which i have not a moments time to express and will not prejudice the sacred idea of friendship  it is near a month ago that i tried to see mr thomson to know the time of his tragedy he was not within my reach and therefore at last i wrote to him and also to mr m to let them both know the deference you paid them and the heroic i will not call it less disinterestedness you expressed in regard to them i have not yet been able to hear where they are or any way to have an answer further than i have learned it will be impossible for either of them to bring on their plays early a friend of theirs telling me they are in no forwardness till the middle or end of the winter therefore you may have room i wish from my soul you may get yours first as well acted as it deserves a better that may eclipse it or even worthily follow it i hardly expect to see  but upon this notice i believe you may safely advance it the sooner the better  my lord b is yet with me more properly i yet belong to him body as well as mind for my mind is everywhere his i would to god you had any opportunity of seeing us before we part my house should be yours as much of it as is not his i believe i shall soon go with him on a little journey before he quits england you will forgive the abrupt conclusion of this yet it may tell you all the longest and bestwritten letter could tell you that i am very sincerely  sir your much obliged and really affectionate servant a pope  letter xxix from mr pope to aaron hill esquire dec        dear sir i have been confirmed by mr thomson as to the retardment of his play of which he has written but two acts i have since seen mr m who has finished his but is very willing yours should be first brought on in january as you propose or after his in february whichsoever may be most agreeable to you he farther offers any assistance he can give you in case of your own absence as to treating with mr f with whom he thinks you cannot be too careful or explicit or attending the rehearsals for you which he promises to undertake with all diligence if you are not provided with another friend in that case he has heard of some impertinence which may be apprehended from one persons refusal or unwillingness to act and believes he can employ some proper influence to bring him to a right behavior these with any other services in which you may please to employ him he bids me assure you it will be a high satisfaction to him to engage in  i must express on my own part a real regret to be so little useful to you i can do no more than join with lord b in paying due praises to so meritorious a work our suffrage is an airy tribute from whence no solid good redounds to you and i find myself still more inclined to the man than the author if i could be any way instrumental to the happiness or ease of so generous an one i could almost wish myself a minister to patronize such a genius and i could almost wish my lord one again for no other reason even though his country wants such an one as well as his friends  i have never once been able to see mr thomson in person when i do and it shall be soon he shall know how much he is obliged to you for that plan of an alteration of his tragedy which is too good for me with any honesty to put upon him as my own believe me sir with great truth and the warmest disposition to do you justice before men and angels  yours faithfully a pope  letter xxx from mr pope to aaron hill esquire london feb          dear sir i have felt an uneasiness of mind occasioned by a conscious sense how unequally i have expressed my anger and contempt at the treatment of your caesar by the man of the stage ever since i last wrote to you and a hundred interruptions from day to day for i have lived in the world and a busy and idle world both it is have ever since hindered me from enjoying one hour of collected thought yet i am the less concerned since by my delay i can now tell you i have last night seen mr mallets play the fifth act of which i had not before read through those interruptions i have mentioned it succeeded hitherto at least for yesterday was the first day as well as i could expect but so vilely acted in the womens parts and the mens except two that i wonder it could succeed mr thomson after many shameful tricks from the manager is determined to act his play at the other theater where the advantage lies as to the women and the success of his will depend upon them i heartily wish you would follow his example that we might not be deprived of caesar i have yet seen but three acts of mr thomsons but i am told and believe by what i have seen that it excels in the pathetic the dignity of sentiment and grandeur of character will still be caesars as in his history so in your poetry superior to any  the person to whom you intended so great a compliment as to address that piece to his name is very sensible of your delicate manner of thinking he bids me assure you his own knowledge of your intention is sufficient pleasure to him and desires you would not think of doing him either favor or justice till the world knows better how to do itself the former in doing you the latter he is still detained here by the perverseness of his affairs and wishes as i most heartily do also that fortune did not treat you so much alike the stage is as ungrateful to you as his country to him you are both sure of posterity and may say in the mean time with scipio ingrata patria ne ossa quidem habeas believe me most truly  sir your affectionate angry servant a pope  letter xxxi from mr pope to aaron hill esquire jan       0   sir i am obliged to you for your compliment and can truly say i never gave you just cause of complaint you once mistook on a booksellers idle report and publicly expressed your mistake yet you mistook a second time that two initial letters only were meant of you though every letter in the alphabet was put in the same manner and in truth except some few those letters were set at random to occasion what they did occasion the suspicion of bad and jealous writers of which number i could never reckon mr hill and most of whose names i did not know  upon this mistake you were too ready to attack me in a paper of very pretty verses in some public journal  i should imagine the dunciad meant you a real compliment and so it has been thought by many who have asked to whom that passage made that oblique panegyric as to the notes i am weary of telling a great truth which is that i am not author of em though i love truth so well as fairly to tell you sir i think even that note a commendation and should think myself not ill used to have the same words said of me therefore believe me i never was other than friendly to you in my own mind  have i not much more reason to complain of the caveat where give me leave sir to tell you with the same love of truth and with the frankness it inspired which i hope you will see through this whole letter i am falsely abused in being represented  sneakingly to approve and want the worth to cherish or befriend men of merit it is indeed sir a very great error i am sorry the author of that reflection knew me no better and happened to be unknown to those who could have better informed him for i have the charity to think he was misled only by his ignorance of me and the benevolence to forgive the worst thing that ever in my opinion was said of me on that supposition  i do faithfully assure you i never was angry at any criticism made on my poetry by whomsoever if i could do mr dennis any humane office i would though i were sure he would abuse me personally tomorrow therefore it is no great merit in me to find at my heart i am your servant i am very sorry you ever was of another opinion  i see by many marks you distinguished me from my cotemporary writers had we known one another you had distinguished me from others as a man and no ill or illnatured one i only wish you knew as well as i do how much i prefer qualities of the heart to those of the head i vow to god i never thought any great matters of my poetical capacity i only thought it a little better comparatively than that of some very mean writers who are too proud  but i do know certainly my moral life is superior to that of most of the wits of these days this is a silly letter but it will show you my mind honestly and i hope convince you i can be and am  sir your very affectionate and humble servant a pope  as there had formerly been some little misunderstanding between mr pope and mr hill it is thought necessary to insert in this place two or three of mr hills letters that the reader might be fully apprised of the reason each thought he had to take it ill of the other and in mr hills works which are going to be printed by subscription it is humbly conceived there will be many letters not only writ to mr pope but also to persons of the highest rank that will be both instructive and entertaining to the curious reader  letter xxxii from mr hill to mr pope jan       0  sir your answer regarding no part of mine but the conclusion you must pardon my compliment to the close of yours in return if i agree with you that your letter is weaker than one would have expected  you assure me that i did not know you so well as i might had i happened to be known to others who could have instructed my ignorance and i begin to find indeed that i was less acquainted with you than i imagined but your last letter has enlightened me and i can never be in danger of mistaking you for the future  your enemies have often told me that your spleen was at least as distinguishable as your genius and it will be kinder i think to believe them than impute to rudeness or ill manners the return you were pleased to make for the civility with which i addressed you  i will therefore suppose you to have been peevish or in pain while you were writing me this letter and upon that supposition shall endeavor to undeceive you  if i did not love you as a good man while i esteem you as a good writer i should read you without reflection and it were doing too much honor to your friends and too little to my own discernment to go to them for a character of your mind which i was able enough to extract from your writings  but to imitate your love of truth with the frankness you have taught me i wish the great qualities of your heart were as strong in you as the good ones you would then have been above that emotion and bitterness wherewith you remember things which want weight to deserve your anguish  since you were not the writer of the notes to the dunciad it would be impertinent to trouble you with the complaint i intended  i will only observe that the author was in the right to believe me capable of a second repentance but i hope i was incapable of that second sin which should have been previous to his supposition  if the initial letters a h were not meant to stand for my name yet they were everywhere read so as you might have seen in mists journal and other public papers and i had shown mr pope an example how reasonable i thought it to clear a mistake publicly which had been publicly propagated  one note among so many would have done me this justice and the generosity of such a proceeding could have left no room for that offensive sneakingly which though perhaps too harsh a word was the properest a man could choose who was satirizing an approbation that he had never observed warm enough to declare itself to the world but in defense of the great or the popular  again if the author of the notes knew that a h related not to me what reason had he to allude to that character as mine by observing that i had published pieces bordering upon bombast  a circumstance so independent on any other purpose of the note that i should forget to whom i am writing if i thought it wanted explanation  as to your oblique panegyric i am not under so blind an attachment to the goddess i was devoted to in the dunciad but that i knew it was a commendation though a dirtier one than i wished for who am neither fond of some of the company in which i was listed  the noble reward for which i was to become a diver  the allegoric muddiness in which i was to try my skill  nor the institutor of the games you were so kind to allow me a share in  since however you could see so clearly that i ought to be satisfied with the praise and forgive the dirt it was mixed with i am sorry it seemed not as reasonable that you should pardon me for returning your compliment with more and opener praise mixed with less of that dirtiness which we have both the good taste to complain of  the caveat sir was mine  it would have been ridiculous to suppose you ignorant of it i cannot think you need be told that it meant you no harm  and it had scorned to appear under the borrowed name it carries but that the whimsical turn of the preface would have made my own a contradiction  i promise you however that for the future i will publish nothing without my name that concerns you or your writings i have now almost finished an essay on propriety and impropriety in design thought and expression illustrated by examples in both kinds from the writings of mr pope and to convince you how much more pleasure it gives me to distinguish your lights than your shades  and that i am as willing as i ought to be to see and acknowledge my faults i am ready with all my heart to let it run thus if it would otherwise create the least pain in you  an essay on propriety and impropriety etc illustrated by examples of the first from the writings of mr pope and of the last from those of the author  i am sorry to hear you say you never thought any great matters of your poetry  it is in my opinion the characteristic you are to hope your distinction from to be honest is the duty of every plain man nor since the soul of poetry is sentiment can a great poet want morality but your honesty you possess in common with a million who will never be remembered whereas your poetry is a peculiar that will make it impossible you should be forgotten  if you had not been in the spleen when you wrote me this letter i persuade myself you would not immediately after censuring the pride of writers have asserted that you certainly know your moral life above that of most of the wits of these days at any other time you would have remembered that humility is a moral virtue it was a bold declaration and the certainty with which you know it stands in need of a better acquaintance than you seem to have had with the tribe since you tell me in the same letter that many of their names were unknown to you  neither would it appear to your own reason at a cooler juncture overconsistent with the morality you are so sure of to scatter the letters of the whole alphabet annexed at random to characters of a light and ridiculous cast confusedly with intent to provoke jealous writers into resentment that you might take occasion from that resentment to expose and depreciate their characters  the services you tell me you would do mr dennis even though he should abuse you in return will i hope give him some title to expect an exertion of your recommendatory influence in his behalf a man so popular as you might secure him a great subscription this would merit to be called a service and the more the world should find you abused in the works you had recommended so much the more glorious proof would they see that your morals were in truth as superior as you represent them to those of your cotemporaries though you will pardon me the pride of wondering a little how this declaration came to be made to me whose condition not standing in need of such services it was not i think so necessary you should have taken the trouble to talk of them  upon the whole sir i find i am so sincerely your friend that it is not in your own power to make me your enemy else that unnecessary air of neglect and superiority which is so remarkable in the turn of your letter would have nettled me to the quick and i must triumph in my turn at the strength of my own heart who can after it still find and profess myself most affectionately and sincerely  your humble servant a hill  letter xxxiii from mr hill to mr pope feb  0        sir i am obliged to you for your letter from parsons green and come heartily into the proposal it begins with a mutual resolution to forget in each other the appearance of every thing that has been distasteful to either agrees i am sure with the affection i feel for you at my heart where it is founded on a natural strength both of reason and inclination  the caveat began originally with the vision i added not till after it was finished those lines among which are the unlucky ones that displeased you i was scarful lest without something of that kind by way of introduction the reader might think himself pushed too abruptly into the allegory but i confess it was unreasonable in me to cover your praise which i delighted in under the veil of an allegory and explain my censure too openly in which i could take no pleasure  the truth is i loved you so well and thought of you so often that it was not easy for me in any humor to write verse and not dwell upon you  have you never been jealous of a favorite mistress  have you never under a pique at her supposed neglect said what she could no more deserve than you could think she did upon cooler reflection  and have you not found after all that you was never the less her lover  your offer is very kind to prevail on the editor of the dunciad to leave out the note or declare that i was not meant in it but i am satisfied  it is over  and deserves no more of your application  i agree with you it is morality makes us beloved i know it from the effect of your writings where i but admire the harmony and the elegance while i love the generosity and the candor of the sentiments i prefer too as you do friendships and the honest enjoyments of life to fame and noisy praises but i am glad you are happier than you wish to be who enjoy both benefits together  yet if there was nothing desirable in fame there could be nothing detestable in slander and your honest uneasiness at being thought worse than you are would in that case be in danger of passing for a weakness  i know however that you consider praise in a nobler light than vanity  there is in fame the promulgation of a good mans example which his natural life being too short to extend so far as he wishes that defect is supplied by the second life he receives from his memory  i have seen and been ashamed of that low turn which mr dennis gave to your goodnature  where a mans passions are too strong for his virtues his suspicion will be too hard for his prudence he has often been weak enough to treat you in a manner that moves too much indignation against himself not to leave it unnecessary for you also to punish him  neither of us would choose him for a friend but none of the frailties of his temper any more than the heavy formalities of his style can prevent your acknowledging there is often weight in his arguments and matter that deserves encouragement to be met with in his writings  i will soon sir convince you that my sensibility is not so tender as you suppose it to be i am so far from an inclination to defend some pieces which i was too much a boy when i published that i embrace all occasions of exposing em myself to the contempt they have merited  i am already too much obliged not to blush at your mention of the odyssey with a view of sending it to my daughter and she is too inquifitive a lover of what gives her instruction with delight to have been satisfied without finding in her closet whatever she had heard you had published  as a proof how determined i am to throw nothing upon the world that may give you cause of complaint i will send you in manuscript the essay on propriety as soon as it is finished i do the same now by a smaller piece i am about to publish because you will find yourself concerned in some part of it  i am sir with great truth  your most humble and most obedient servant a hill  letter xxxiv from mr hill to mr pope june         sir the pleasure i was sure to receive with your letter brought an unexpected chagrin in its company from a vein of civil reproach that runs through it which i can better discern than account for since i must not suspect without wronging my ideas of your equity that you could be displeased at the freedom i took in my sentiments if i believed they had given you the smallest offense i would rather commit my essay in its present rough state to the flames than transcribe it either for yourself or the public  indeed it was with a kind of foreboding reluctance that i censured any passage of yours and to confess the truth frankly i had only one reason for doing it after i had convinced myself thoroughly that propriety in some of the lights i was considering it under had been universally neglected in poetry i foresaw it would be impossible to establish the belief of a fact so unlikely without citing the strongest examples  to do this from the works of our dead authors only carried the face of a meanness i could not tell how to submit to  to draw formal citations from any pieces that had appeared of my own though full enough god knows of absurdities to have furnished more proofs than i wanted would have looked too assuming and silly  to borrow such instances out of other less faulty cotemporaries not however reputed among the sparkling great luminaries of wit would have induced a mistaken conclusion that in the works of more masterly writers there were no such examples to be met with  and now  is there a good judge in england except one who will not see and acknowledge the necessity that threw me unavoidably upon your writings  however i am glad at my heart it was dr at who made that collection you mention for i am almost unwilling to be found in the right when i disapprove what your name has been stamped on yet your own honest argument that it is not enough to excuse a reporter of falsehoods that he was told and believed what he published must defend me against its advancer for neither is it a sufficient excuse that a writer whose name in the front of a book has given weight to the censures it propagates was not author of some of those censures since whatever a man sets his hand to he ought first to examine the truth of  i am charmed while i hear you disclaim that propensity to pique and contempt which to speak with the soul of a friend seems to me the only spot on your character  we are all of us in some lights or other the dupes of our natural frailties and when mr pope with the warmth that becomes a great mind tells me how far he is from despising defects in mens genius  never feeling any contempt but for the dirt of their actions i am sure he says nothing but what he firmly believes to be true and yet there are pieces well known to be his many passages whereof no man less apprisd than himself of his hearts secret views and intentions can read without being strongly convinced of a scorn that regards genius only though if he loves you but half so sincerely as i do you have no sooner disavowd the design than he concludes the imputation was groundless  in the mean time it is pity that a thinker so humane and benevolent should indulge an ambiguity in the turn of his expression that scatters gall which his heart never licensed since i believe it a general truth that men of the openest and honestest natures sooner catch fire at contempt than oppression  and as to any dirtiness in actions which take birth from effect of such influence we may conclude from those irresistible little sallies of fury whereby even among undesigning and innocent infants we see brother precipitated into outrage against brother immediately upon any cold provocation of scorn that there is nothing immoral in what may be done or declared too offensively under impressions so violent so involuntary and natural  after all this grave face of apology i am an absolute stranger to the grounds upon which those men you refer to proceeded  nay i am so for the most part even to the measures by which they provoked you all the reason indeed that i have for giving you any of my thoughts on the subject is derived from your own starting into it a little digressively immediately after hinting some occasions you had to lament that i knew you less justly as a man than a poet  i will appeal to impartial posterity whether i do not know you much better in both lights than ten thousand of those pretending esteemers of whose affection you think yourself surer it will never be in my will nor my power to transmit such a picture as yours without its best and most beautiful likeness i shall leave to duller dutch painters in criticism their unenvied delight to draw monsters and know very well for my own part that i should but disgrace the desired reputation of my pencil if i missed the resemblance too widely in a piece which must expect to be compared with originals of the same by many different masters  though i acquit you of any further allusion to me than by that retrospect glance en passant i have affectionately caught the occasion of pointing out to one of the least intentionally guilty among men a seeming tartness of spirit in himself which he will easily find when he looks for and which whenever he does find and guard against by submitting his wit to his philosophy he will become the most unnatural good man in the world for he will leave himself not a fault to be blamed for  as to myself who was born to mix sin with repentance i plead guilty to all such indictments as you in that place present to my memory  i was always too perceptibly quick in my apprehension of contempts or indignities  a temper which would have been as unpardonable as i confess it to be weak and selfmortifying but that the fault though of too swelling a nature leaves no voids for admission of malice  it is an offensive indeed but reconcilable imbecility of mind shakespeare felt and understood it very finely  it carries anger as the flint does fire  which being struck throws out a hasty spark  and then grows cold again     yet i will endeavor to redress this wrong bent in my temper and make way for the rectification you are so good as to show me my want of  and thus in the commerce of friendship as in traffic less generous there is offered a mutual exchange of advantages  something always to give and to gain and this makes both sides more rich and more satisfied  what a loss then have unsocial and vain dispositions which by a sullen seclusion from these rights of reproof and plaindealing cut off all the kind use of correction  human nature let it be as susceptible of grace as it can never yet wanted pride enough to make mortifications of this kind a requisite far from hating our friends for a little faithful though unwelcome asperity let us think him of all men unhappiest who has never been blessed with an enemy  and now let me ask you with a transition very fashionably abrupt and uncritical  how is your good and great friend lord b to be reached  you will scarce think i mean  to be emulated ours is an age that exposes such an oldfashioned politician as he is to any fear sooner than that of a rival i have a packet to send him a little too large for the post it is a manuscript piece which i purpose to dedicate to him when published but it would be prudence and decency as affairs stand at present to wait his permission after reading it not that there is any thing nice or exceptionable in the subject and i am sure i have no need to add though i speak of a dedication that mine has no views like a modern one if you will be so kind as to think how it may reach my lords hands i shall in a few days send it open to yours begging you first to peruse and then give it a seal and a forwarding if you will have the goodness to authorize such a trouble please to do it under a direction like your last to  sir your most humble and affectionate servant a hill  letter xxxv from mr hill to mr pope june         sir it is time to relieve you from subjects and lengths like my last yet you will hardly suspect such a blindness in my bad understanding as to think i distinguish not the true cast of some colors which you need not have held quite so near me  notwithstanding all which if i had not more cause to distrust it on your side than my own i should flatter myself we were born to be lovers we are so often and so unaccountably mistaking one another into reserves and resentments yet i am sorry whenever this happens because the most lost time in mens lives is that which they waste in expostulation they who are friends find it selfish and diffident  and between enemies it is inflaming and fruitless  indeed there would be no end of such  what must i call em  eclaircissements is an affected french word and i am heartily sorry i want it  in plain truth and english i always did and i still do most affectionately esteem you both as man and as poet and if nowandthen for a start i have been put out of humor with either i would fain have you think it was no less your own fault than mine at least i am sure i believed so and if whenever you supposed me to have acted inconsistently with myself on that principle you had only been so kind as to have declared why you thought so i would openly and immediately either have demonstrated the mistake to be yours or confessed and abhorred my own error  i will always stand bound to give if not a rational yet a moral account of my actions not alone as they regard mr pope but men in the remotest situation below him and whoever let him be accused either by misapprehension or calumny would decline such a test of his conduct in life is so far from being worthy your friendship that he is a stranger to both spirit and honesty  here then let us rest this debate and either resolve to let fall an unconfiding and cold correspondence or much rather agree if you please to understand one another better for the future  as to my own part i never will  i never did  disoblige you unprovoked and if how unkindly soever impelled i write or do any thing unbecoming the occasion  think of me as i would of your enemies  in the mean time let even the little trouble you have so kindly allowed me to give you in the enclosed be received as some proof that i know and respect at my heart your double claim both in morals and genius for you know me i am sure much less justly if you can imagine me capable of corresponding with an air of good will where i wanted a personal attachment or of begging as i now very earnestly do upon any inducement but the high sense i have of your skill your frank and friendly inspection of the tragedy it would charm me to have the benefit of your hand or your hints before it appears on the theater  as to my essay on propriety you have obligingly convinced me i may lay it before you without pain indeed if i had made it unfit for your eye the world would have been still less likely to see it i shall punctually obey your command neither to omit nor to soften in the transcript it is an injunction i may safely comply with since if i have any thing to value myself upon in this tract it is from the proofs you will find it abound in that some of your most retired and most delicate touches have been chiefly the search and the subject of  sir your truly affectionate and most humble servant a hill  letter xxxvi from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire april        sir having seen a letter you wrote to my friend mr mallet on saturday last though i cannot boast the honor and happiness of your acquaintance and ought with the utmost deference and veneration to approach so supreme a genius yet my full heart is not to be repressed by formalities and you must allow me the pleasure of pouring forth my best acknowledgments  i will not affect a moderate joy at your approbation your praise it pleases it delights it ravishes me forgive me for the lowness of the truth when i vow i would rather have it than the acclamations of thousands it is so sincere so delicate so distinguishing so glowing and what peculiarly marks and endears it so beautifully generous  that great mind and transcendent humanity that appear in the testimony you have been pleased to give my first attempt would have utterly confounded me if i had not been prepared for such an entertainment by your wellknown character which the voice of fame and your own masterly writings loudly proclaim  it would both be disingenuous and rudely unjust in me after what you have observed to dissemble my satisfaction at several passages in the poem this let me say that your reflections have entered into the very soul of my purpose and even to myself cast a light over the whole  how rare how happy is it to find a judge whose discerning goodness overlooks the faults of what is well meant at the same time that his fine enthusiastic taste improves the beauties  to you alone it belongs to write so inimitably and to read so indulgently  if i wrote all that my admiration of your perfections and my gratitude dictate i should never have done but left i tire you i will for the present rather put a violence on myself only let me cherish one hope further  of being some time or other admitted into the most instructive and entertaining company in the world i am with the greatest devotion  sir your most obliged and most faithful humble servant james thomson  letter xxxvii from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire april         sir i received yours with a soul awakened all to joy gratitude and ambition there is such a noble excellence of mind so much uncommon goodness and generosity of heart in every thing you say as at once charms and astonishes me  as you think imagine and write with a diviner warmth superior to the rest of mankind so the very praises you bestow bear the stamp of eminence and reflect stronger on yourself  while i meditate your encouraging lines for a while i forget the selfishness degeneracy and cruelty of men and seem to be associated with better and more exalted beings  the social love of which you are so bright an example though it be the distinguishing ornament of humanity yet there are some illnatured enough to degrade it into a modification of selflove according to them its original  those gentlemen i am afraid mingle their tempers too much with their speculations  selflove is indeed indispensably necessary for the wellbeing of every individual but carries not along with it an idea of moral beauty and perfection whereas social love is of quite another nature the just and free exercise of which in a particular manner renders one amiable and divine the accomplished man i admire the honest man i trust but it is only the trulygenerous man i entirely love humanity is the very smile and consummation of virtue it is the image of that fair perfection in the supreme being which while he was infinitely happy in himself moved him to create a world of beings to make them so  the excellent ones of the earth in the exercise of social love feel it as much to be an original impulse as the low world that blind affection they bear themselves nor are they in the least conscious of that forced cold reasoning by which it is deduced from so mean an original  how many deathless heroes patriots and martyrs have been so gloriously concerned for the good of mankind and so strongly actuated by social love as frequently to act in direct contradiction to that of self  a great many more arguments might be adduced to prove that social love is a nobler independent principle by itself were not the secret sense that every good man has of the matter instead of a thousand  your writings while they glow with innumerable instances of strong thinking and sublime imagination are peculiarly marked with this beautiful benevolence of mind and it is that which at this time has awakened in me these reflections  i am ravished with the hope you give me of your nearer acquaintance and that it should ever prove unprofitable is as impossible as that it should not be in the highest degree delightful to  sir your most obliged and most faithful humble servant james thomson  letter xxxviii from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire april         sir when i reflect how truly happy i was yesterday in your company it is impossible for me to restrain my sense of it from breaking out into this acknowledgment  there is in your conversation such a beauty truth force and elegance of thought and expression such animated fine sense and chastisd fancy so much dignity and condescension sublimity and sweetness in a word such a variety of entertainment and instruction as is beyond all admiration  your smiles have all the encouraging power of humanity in them what one says is received with great taste and indulgence and to listen to you gives one a secret and more ravishing pleasure than to be author of the best things in other company  there is downright inspiration in your society it enlarges and exalts all the powers of the soul chases every low thought throws the passions into the most agreeable agitations and gives the heart the most affecting sentiments  it is moral harmony  it gives me an additional pleasure to reflect how justly pleased too mr savage was  nothing is to me a stronger instance of the unimprovable nature of that unhappy creature of whom you speak so compassionately notwithstanding of the barbarous provocation he has given you than his remaining bleak and withered under the influences of your conversation  a certain sign of a field that the lord has cursed  there is none that renders human nature more amiable than you and at the same time none that renders the greatest part of it more contemptible and to descend from your company and mingle with the herd of mankind is like nebuchadnezzars descending from a throne to graze with the beasts of the field  now i feast on reflection  and am like a poor man that has brought as much from a rich entertainment with him as must sustain him for many days afterward  what charms and amuses me in a particular manner is the account you gave us of that little seraph the young urania her elegant turn of mind her innocence and goodness in the choice of her subjects her fancy judgment and ambition above her years and the beautiful struggle of the last it is unfair to call it vanity occasioned by the rude stupidity of the schoolboy are most agreeably surprising  what you obligingly observed of good companys being ariostos fountain of thirst is remarkably true of yours  i shall long impatiently for the farther refreshment of it and am with the most entire regard  dear sir your most obliged and most faithful humble servant james thomson  letter xxxix from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire oldmans coffeehouse may         dear sir i hope that your uncommon goodness will forgive me what i scarcely can forgive myself my not having hitherto answered the last encouraging letter and copy of verses you honored me with  the approbation which out of the fullness of a beneficent heart you are pleased to give me i am fond and ambitious of next to that of heaven it is my best reward for what i have done and a noble incitement to go on when you approve my whole soul is awaked and charmed  pleasing is your praise but severe is your satire it is particularly marked with exalted sentiment and generous contempt there is a force in it that strikes through the heart and a majesty not to be expressed in a word it is the unaffected resentment of a great mind  it is impossible for me in the compass of this letter to say how much i admire every particular line yet it is as impossible for me to restrain myself from dwelling on some  smile at your vanished hope  convinced too late  that greatness dwells not always with the great i feel the first line too sensibly and the last finely insinuates the absurdity of vulgar and hereditary greatness  your sinking of the lords unlasting name in the depth of time is pleasingly and nobly just sir john falstaff sunk not with greater alacrity in a literal sense than they and all their fopperies do in a metaphorical  i never read any thing more glorious than the four following lines  patrons are natures nobles not the states  and wits a title no broad seal creates  kings from whose bounty wealths chief currents flow  are poor in power when they would souls bestow they are the most divine triumph of merit and virtue that was ever writ the best way of displaying all their beauties is to read them a thousand and a thousand times over  your description of the courthaunting winkobserving bard is so natural that if i am not mistaken it may be found a picture of some living originals  the last paragraph is very strongly and delicately wrought off but so favorable to me as obliges me to suppress all sentiments save such as flow from gratitude with which my heart is as full as yours is with goodness and perfection  you have given me fame and what have i to return you but the acknowledgment of a grateful soul  how powerfully was i charmed with the four acts of elfrid you were so condescendingly good as to read us there is in them such a rich assemblage of all the excellencies of the best poetry as is not anywhere to be found i never met before with such a force and dignity of passion my heart trembles yet when i reflect but i will not cramp my admiration into the small space this letter allows  mr mallet is now gone into the country where he justly expects to be vastly entertained and instructed by your correspondence i have been somewhat melancholy since his departure touched with these pensive emotions parting with such a friend gives  bounteous creator of the tender heart is there no world where friends shall never part be that our future lot and of such bliss grant us an earnest ere we die in this i go on saturday next to reside at mr wattss academy in little towerstreet in quality of tutor to a young gentleman there  since you have been pleased to raise me in some measure to the new life of your favor let me never fall from it but frequently be allowed the honor of subscribing myself dear sir  your most obliged and most devoted humble servant james thomson  letter xl from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire june        sir mr bowman and i are at longs coffee house in queens square westminster and if it be consistent with your convenience would be glad to attend the honor and happiness of your company as you shall be pleased to direct mr mallet left with me what they call a spanish cheese which he begs you to accept of at last i have been with the speaker this morning but would rather give you an account of my reception by word of mouth we beg pardon for this freedom which the delightful prospect of your company irresistibly tempts us to i am sir with the deepest respect  your most obliged and most devoted humble servant james thomson  letter xli from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire june        dear sir encouraged by that most divine of all virtues your charming goodness i frequently you see take the liberty to address you  on saturday last i wrote to you from a coffeehouse in westminster but had the misfortune to hear you were gone out only half an hour before the letter was sent  flattering myself then with some hopes of your company i did not mention a copy of verses i received on friday last from mr mallet to be prefixed to the second edition of winter and which i send you enclosed that you should read them was his particular desire in the following terms  offer my verses to mr hills perusal and tell him that i will not determine their fate till i first learn his opinion of them for i know him too nobly sincere to indulge my vanity at the expense of your credit say likewise that i will shortly venture to make use of that permission he so generously granted me of writing to him as often as my fear of becoming troublesome will let me  all that i shall observe concerning them to such a finished judge as you are is that their only glorious fault if they have any is an excess of that beautiful benevolence of mind which among a thousand other things make you and him so greatly amiable  i hinted to you in my last that on saturday morning i was with sir spencer compton a certain gentleman without my desire spoke to him concerning me his answer was that i had never come near him then the gentleman put the question if he desired that i should wait on him he returned he did on this the gentleman gave me an introductory letter to him he received me in what they commonly call a civil manner asked me some commonplace questions and made me a present of twenty guineas i am very ready to own that the present was larger than my performance deserved and shall ascribe it to his generosity or any other cause rather than the merit of the address  as the case now is one of your infinite delicacy will be the best judge whether it will be proper to print these two inimitable copies of verses i have from you and mr mallet without such little alterations as shall clear sir spencer of that best satire i ever read i shall say no more on that head for if there be any reasons for such alterations you will of necessity at one glance see them in the strongest and finest light only this let me add should you find that the case required some small alterations and yet not indulge me with them i shall reckon what my patron gave me a fatal present  it is a thought too shocking to be born  to lose the applause of the great genius of the age my charter of fame for  i will not name it  but you are too good to plague me so severely  i expect this favor from mr mallet next post  when you honor me with an answer for which i shall be anxious please to direct for me at mr wattss academy in little towerstreet i am dear sir with the most hearty respect  your most devoted and most humble servant james thomson  letter xlii from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire london june         dear sir i have been for some days last past in the country else the enclosed sheets to which you yourself have given the greatest sanction and value should have waited on you ere now  it was your approbation that gave me formerly an equally just and noble satisfaction and the continuance of it is my inviolable ambition  since i put you to the trouble of altering your verses i ought to give you an account why mr mallets were not altered likewise  the truth is he promised me to alter them as i wrote to you but in a following letter told me that after several attempts he found it absolutely out of his power and rather than lose them i resolved to print them as they at first were to this resolution your last favorable letter in a great measure raised me and who that has a soul in him could forbear to follow the advice you give me in those generous lines heedless of fortune then look down on state balanced within by reasons conscious weight divinely proud of independent will prince of your passions live their sovereign still   i wish that the declaration from my heart with regard to you in the preface may not be disagreeable these sentiments i could not suppress and they are but a faint expression of the full esteem and admiration i shall ever bear you  may i hope that one of the enclosed copies of my poem can be acceptable to a lady of mrs hills fine taste and the young darling of the muses urania who in such a tender age has encountered with all the horrors of so rough a description  shall i languish out a whole summer in the same city with you and not once be reinspird with your company such a happiness would much brighten my description of that season from which to fill out this letter i venture to transcribe the following lines often in this season too the horse provoked while his big sinews full of spirits swell trembling with vigor in the heat of blood springs the high fence and over the field effusd darts on the gloomy flood with steady eye and heart estranged to fear his nervous chest the seat of strength bears down thopposing stream luxuriant and arrect quenchless his thirst he takes the river at redoubled draughts and with wide nostrils snorting skims the wave   in your last you were pleased to threaten me as you term it with a long letter i beg you would be as exact in the execution of your threatenings as you always are in the performance of your promises which shall be submitted to with the most cheerful resignation by him who is dear sir with the utmost devotion  your most obliged and most obedient humble servant james thomson  letter xliii from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire london june         sir i had the enclosed for you from mr mallet this day which emboldens me to give you the present trouble  he is so good as to promise me another copy of verses next post which gives me a very great pleasure but my satisfaction is far from being complete so long as i am uncertain of the like favor from you perhaps my forwardness if not vanity presumes too much on your goodness but your already wondrous generosity in this regard has raised in me an expectation and ambition you ought in all poetical justice to satisfy if you knew the gladness it would inspire into my heart you would certainly steal a kind hour from your more important affairs to smile upon my i will not scruple to say reasonable fondness  but by being importunate i shall offer an injury to your everready humanity  all that i shall further add is that on monday next the poem will be printed off i am sir with the utmost gratitude and regard  your most devoted humble servant james thomson p s the press if you please shall wait your leisure    letter xliv from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire london oct  0      dear sir mr savage was so kind as to show me a letter you lately favored him with by which i had the true pleasure of learning your safe arrival at berwick intended tour and halt at inverness  it is with a mixture of joy pride and confusion i read the favorable mention you were pleased to make of me what unusual good fortune has thus entitled me to your kind regard it is nothing sure but your own generous goodness which with your other many matchless perfections shall ever be my love and wonder while truth and harmony are the objects of these passions  every muse every virtue here languishes for your return to me your absence would be much severer if my partial sympathy in the happiness of my native country did not alleviate the misfortune i congratulate her on the presence of such a kind inspirer and candid observer there you may chance to find in that neglected corner of the world depressed merit uninformd beauty and good sense clothed in the rags of language  nothing has appeared in print here since your departure unless it be some mushroomish pamphlets beings of a summers night whose only merit is the violent propension with which they tend into oblivion memory abhors them and their essence is to die i beg mr popes pardon some of whose letters to mr cromwell were surreptitiously printed by curll and yet though writ careless and uncorrected full of wit and gaiety  we have got o rare a rostrum and an orator since you left us an orator whose pretended great design is to restore primitive christianity and his hopeful candidates are all the beaus and pretty powdered fellows about town  you were a week or two ago traduced by the praises of one of our journalists who can no more understand the beauties of your writings than you write to his understanding  a new torrent of italian farces is lately poured in upon us the advertisement which just now lies before me and begins thus  by his majestys command at the kings theater in the haymarket tomorrow being friday the   st of october will be acted by the company of italian comedians newly arrived a comedy called the enchanted island of arcadia or arlequin king of the forests etc is such a maze of incredible impertinence and promises so much folly that it is to be presumed the house will be very full and that too with persons of the first quality  may you soon return to town resume the plaindealer and if we are not devoted to destruction restore the great dramatic taste by that tragedy part of which i had the honor and sublime pleasure of hearing read by the finest reader as well as the finest author in england  if your business will allow me one line please to direct for me at the academy in little towerstreet i am  dear sir your most obliged faithful humble servant james thomson  letter xlv from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire oldmans coffeehouse monday morn mar         dear sir the news of your safe arrival in town gave me a joy i have not felt since the receipt of your most agreeable letter from the north of scotland but while i have not the honor of seeing you westminster is at a more gloomy distance than skorurrans snowy top  mr mallet and i wish with the fondest impatience the happiness of your company which if we may hope this afternoon well wait upon you as you shall please to appoint by a short line with the bearer i will not make any apology for this freedom to one of your unbounded goodness i am with the most inviolable regard  dear sir your devoted humble servant james thomson  letter xlvi from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire tuesday dec         dear sir i have been almost entirely in the country since i had the honor of yours and of the enclosed papers you were so good as to send me the two or three days since my return to town have been rather hurried than employed in soliciting for the benefit of old dennis your wellknown and formerlyexperiencd goodness will i hope forgive me for having been so selfish as to keep your papers so long though i would have had some objections to your undertaking the translation of zaire now that it is so affectingly done i should be very ungrateful for the great pleasure it has given me to think of them any more in reading of zara i forget what it was that i objected to zaire you have heightened it with mere imagination but such a chastisd one as accords perfectly well with the nobler fervency of the heart the sentiments and reflections too rise in the translation and glow stronger as well as the touches of the poetical pencil allow me to say that in these respects i deeply feel the difference betwixt mr voltaire and mr hill the more generous warmth of your heart more animates the scene raises the dear tumult in the breast and moves me much more i observed nothing that i wished altered but a word here and there which are mere trifles and not worth regard one however i will take the liberty to mention it is in a speech of the first scene which marks the civility and gallantry of france  where men adore their wives  the two last words i would change into  the fair  i imagine you smiling at my important criticism and ready to reply  that though the present french are not famous for adoring their wives yet those in the good old unrefind days of st lewis might if they do not now adore their wives they perhaps do better they make them easy  i shall long to renew the pleasure your play has given me at its representation what attention i can contribute to the promoting of that will greatly be its own reward mr dodington is expected in a few days from ireland he i dare say will warmly favor it from a double cause  both the love of the fine arts and his own pleasure had you but players equal to those voltaire had i would not doubt in this instance the taste of our countrymen  almighty nature is everywhere the same  soon i propose to fix in town for the winter during which time i hope to pass several happy evenings in your company mr pope earnestly wishes the same believe me to be most affectionately and sincerely  dear sir yours etc j thomson  letter xlvii from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire aug         dear sir upon my return to town from mr dodingtons seat in dorsetshire where i had for some time been i found your letter about a month after its date had it been sent me in the country i could not have neglected till now acknowledging the pleasure it and the packet of prompters you sent along with it gave me though very happy in the company where i then was yet cannot i help sincerely regretting the loss of that entertainment to which you was so good as to give me an invitation with the greatest pleasure would i have beheld and with the greatest zeal would i have countenanced to the utmost of my little power the revival of action which seems on all our theaters to be now both dead and rotten a friend of mine who was there did not by what he told me soften my loss  i was very much enlightened and warmed by the prompters upon action they present no less a strong and beautiful idea of what actors ought to be than a mortifying one of what they are as the stage is a powerful school of humane polite morality so nothing can contribute more to barbarize the age than the present condition of ours there human nature is represented in as awkward false and monstrous a manner as the human form was in ancient gothic sculpture and painting if that were all it might be laughed at and contemned but since it tends at the same time to confound the head and corrupt the heart since crowds grow stupid or barbarous as they gaze who can consider it in that view without feeling an honest indignation and what crowns the misfortune is that there is no hope of its ever being otherwise the root of the evil lies too deep to be plucked up was there ever an equal absurdity heard of among a civilized people that such an important public diversion the school which forms the manners of the age should be made the property of private persons who did they happen in the first instance by an infinite chance to be judges of the matter yet may transfer that property to the most profligate tasteless and ignorant of mankind but this alas is only one of the pillars of that vast temple of corruption under which this generation more than any other that ever boasted freedom worships the dirty lowminded insatiable idol of selfinterest even to this idol is every public work which we have the soul to attempt made an immediate sacrifice  you see how much your prompters have inflamed me and the melancholy conclusion i draw from all is that i never hope to see gentlemen of equal genius taste judgment and generosity of heart to the author of these prompters at the head of our theaters i may however very well live to see all poetry reduced to magazinemiscellanies all plays to mummery entertainments and in short all learning absorbed into the sink of hireling scurrilous newspapers pardon this supposition in a letter to one who while he i ves will never suffer it wholly to take place in the mean time go on to stem the torrent of barbarism i wish you could find an assistant though never so weak a one in  dear sir your most affectionate humble servant james thomson  letter xlviii from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire may         dear sir it is far from being the want of a due sense of the honor your two last letters did me that has prevented my thanking you for them before now the truth is they plunged me so deep into your debt that i was dispirited through mere despair of clearing it but now i am rather willing to declare myself an irrecoverable bankrupt than any longer neglect to acknowledge the refined pleasure which your generous approbation of my late performance gives me  i call it generous that epithet having a peculiar relation to whatever you do besides i cannot help being afraid that it must in a great measure proceed from so humane a cause in the mean time however that be i will avow that i am justly proud of charmed with and most agreeably rewarded by your good opinion of my poem allow me here by the bye to remark that though poets have been long used to this trulyspiritual and almost only emolument arising from their works yet i doubt much if booksellers have any manner of relish for it i think therefore notwithstanding that the ghosts of many authors walk unrevenged of annulling the bargain i made with mine who would else be a considerable loser by the paper printing and publication of liberty as i shall in this case be possessed of the entire property of it again i propose in a year or two hence to give a new edition of it and beg that you would ere then enrich me with some criticisms which i hope i shall have the grace to relish as well as praises  your observation with regard to political corruption like natural when come to a crisis producing more exalted scenes of animation is fine and pleases by the future prospect it opens but it awakens at the same time a sentiment no less mortifying should we find our lot cast in the times of putrefaction should we find ourselves devoted in an antiheroic manner for the good of posterity i wish heartily that i could refute what you likewise observe with regard to the cause of this corruption certainly the kind exchanger of the superabundance for the sweets and elegancies of life is itself corrupted and its gifts abused from the want of taste for whence is it save the want of taste that the continual tides of riches poured in upon this nation by commerce have been lost again in a gulf of ungraceful inelegant inglorious luxury but whence you will say this want of taste whence this sordid turn to cautious timeserving moneymaking sneaking prudence instead of regardless unfettered virtue to private jobs instead of public works to profitable instead of fine arts to gain instead of glory in a word to the whole venal system of modern administration and to those gross perishing luxuries that reconcile at once avarice and profusion centering all in self and even in the meanest the material part of self this disquisition i am afraid would very near lead me back again to your observation it must be owned however that the better genius of this nation has often nobly exerted itself and will struggle hard before it expire with regard to arts and learning one may venture to say that they might yet stand their ground were they but merely protected in lieu of all patrons that have been are or will be in england i wish we had one good act of parliament for securing to authors the property of their own works and that the stage were put upon the footing of common sense and humanity and can it be that those who impress paper with what constitutes the best and everlasting riches of all civilized nations and of all ages should have less property in the paper so enriched than those who deal in the rags which make that paper can it be that the great the delightful school of manners should be abandoned to common sale and become the property of any one who can purchase it to be perhaps the school of folly and corruption  a simony this in virtue which if not so wicked yet is as pernicious as that in religion what would athenians have said to this what laughter what contempt what indignation would it have raised among them  now that i mention the stage i must still insist upon my copy of that only humane new entertainment i have seen upon it of late i know not what gothic devil possessed the maid at my lodgings but my few books must not be so robbed of the honor of boasting zara among them from its author having been tantalizd lately by seeing you at a distance i wish you would be so good as to make me amends some evening and let me know of it a few days before mr pope was the other day inquiting kindly after you i should be glad we could at the same time engage him poor mr savage would be happy to pass an evening with you his heart burns toward you with the eternal fire of gratitude but how to find him requires more intelligence than is allotted to mortals life is too short to lose years without the conversation of those one most loves and esteems one of which number you must ever be to dear sir  your most affectionate humble servant james thomson p s please to direct to me in kewlane richmond surrey and order your letter to be put into the general post    letter xlix from mr thomson to aaron hill esquire friday morning dear sir i am sorry that my present hurry cannot allow me time to answer your kind and excellent letter in the manner it deserves the freedom of your criticism i love and am more proud of your approbation than it becomes me to say in one the taste of fame is not more delicious than that of friendship in the other  you in the last paragraph of your letter prescribe me a glorious task to perform which would demand the same elegant and powerful pen that prescribed it only to attempt it is my ambition  please to accept of the second part of my poem and believe me to be with the most affectionate esteem dear sir  your most obedient humble servant james thomson  letter l from mr booth to aaron hill esquire charlesstreet mar       0 sir it is plain that affairs of much greater consequence have prevented your inquiry about york stock i find now how much better you have employed your spare hours  you have been attempting to make mankind what they ought to be the advice you have lately given to such who deserve the names of poet and patron is a sufficient proof of that public spirit which ever did and ever will appear in all your actions  give me leave to thank you for the vast delight i received in the perusal of that daring flight from the warm indignation of your mind  what an everlasting reproach have you justly thrown upon those great ones whom fortune has placed high above their fellow creatures and in some sense even above their superiors  a panegyric would be a vain attempt the poem itself can best speak its praise  i confess i could not possibly resist the natural impulse of expressing my transport upon this great occasion  you force me to write to you though writing by no means agrees with my distemper  your time is precious  think no man living has a warmer regard for the uncommon qualities that are peculiar to mr hill than  sir your most obliged and most humble servant b booth  letter li from mr booth to aaron hill esquire monday nov        sir i have with infinite pleasure finished the reading of your tragedy i dont wonder mr pope should say upon the perusal of it that no play had ever more warmed him i wish we had a set of actors capable of doing it the justice it deserves  you were pleased to tell me that you had thoughts of my wife for elfrid i was apprehensive not having read it that the part might require great force and be too powerful for her voice but i find it is neither long nor violent and as our company stands i think she might undertake it  when i told her you had been pleased to name her for it she blamed me for not letting her know it that she might have thanked you for your good opinion of her she now desires me to tell you she is highly obliged to you and if you still continue in that opinion she will do you all the justice that lies in her power  next time your affairs bring you into covent garden i should be proud to kiss your hands i am  sir your most faithful and most obedient servant b booth  letter lii from mr booth to aaron hill esquire sunday morning sir i had answered yours last night but it came to my hands as i was dressing about half an hour before the play began  i confess i am under some difficulty how to account for the failure of so good a play but notwithstanding its present reception i am positively and absolutely of opinion that after it has slept some time it will appear again upon the stage with a much better grace and continue in the stock in the first form of tragedy for ever my reasons for this are as follow  if you please to remember i hinted to you that as the town has been lately led and managed there was a kind of necessity to form and prepare a strong body to support even its real merit in the first run of it and i have often thought the best tragedy not supported by this necessary scandalous artifice would naturally sink in five or six days at most the fate of k h has sufficiently confirmed that opinion  however though there is a good deal in what is abovementioned i take the main cause of its failure to proceed from what follows  i find by some few persons who are highly pleased with that noble simplicity and decency that runs quite through the play that the multitude in general look on it not as a new play but as a play altered from shakespeare the many beauties you have improved from him and some noted speeches you have made use of with no very material alterations which was certainly well judged have possessed the gross imaginations of the audience that most of the fine passages of your own are his too the two speeches of justice and mercy at the council table and harrys reflection when he first hears of the treason are universally mistaken for shakespeare this i have found from some whose education understanding and acquaintance with shakespeare i imagined might have taught em better and yet their knowing his manner of writing so well perhaps might the sooner lead em into the mistake  add to this that some understrappers of parnassus and the partisans of the other house have improved this notion of its being a play of shakespeares not very much altered now sir allowing what i have observed above to be certainly the game played upon k h i can no longer wonder that his success is little more than what a good revived play commonly meets with  far be it from me to profane k h with odious comparisons but give me leave to observe to you that cr once brought the double gallant upon the stage which was made up of hints stolen from a play of burnabys and another of centlivres both heartily damned the first night many years before as soon as the goodnatured town found him out they resented his calling it a new play and hounded it in the most outrageous manner two years after we revived it it met with most extravagant success and it has continued in the stock ever since and never fails of a great audience  the kind impostor though taken i mean the hints only from a translation of a spanish play acted about thirty years ago was damned at its first appearance only because it was called a new play but was revived some time after and met with universal approbation like the former and is generally acted twice every year  king lear and timon of athens met with the same fate from the same reasons at their first appearance but have both proved excellent stockplays upon their being revived  thus if it can be artfully insinuated to the town that the managers or an author would pass an altered play upon em for a new one that alone would make em outrageous after three or four days and give the multitude an opportunity which they never let slip of exerting their proper qualities audiences are never guided by reason but always by prepossession  i believe when you fairly consider what i have said to you the present disappointment will give you less surprise i assure you the play was more applauded the second night than the first because it was infinitely better acted as to my own part the concern i was under for the success of it the first night threw me into the utmost confusion i should be extremely pleased if you would give yourself the trouble of seeing it acted tomorrow night come but behind the scenes and we will place you in some corner where you shall be invisible to the audience dear sir let me prevail upon you to come i like your preface there is a very decent scorn and a mettled contempt of the town in it you have hindered me from going to church this morning and i have tired your patience to be revenged of you i am sir with the utmost regard and sincerity  your most faithful and most obedient servant b booth richard the third had the same fate with the other altered plays    letter liii from mr booth to aaron hill esquire charlesstr june         sir were i not well assured that mr hill is the bestnaturd gentleman living i should not expect a favorable answer to the request i now make to him in behalf of mr vr  i know you have sufficient reason not to be pleased with the taste of the town which is as it always was and as it ever will be  mr betterton observed to me many years ago that don carlos succeeded much better than either venice preserved or the orphan and was infinitely more applauded and followed for many years  we know what reception paradise lost met with in the authors lifetime  in short rome and athens were full as partial or rather heedless in observing the merit of living authors as london  in the former city fannius had more hearers than horace  in the latter city euripides so justly admired by all posterity could not stand the ridicule of aristophanes but chose to die in voluntary banishment to avoid the flouts of the people and we may conclude that sophocles himself escaped the burlesque of that buffoon comic for such he was notwithstanding his merit in other respects only because he was a man of quality and fortune  so that upon the whole i may venture to affirm that posterity only will do justice to mr hill who was ever above the low artifice of forming cabals to support his reputation  mr addison was so sensible of this truth that he took whole years to bespeak and court friends in order to secure the success of cato  and is it not thus with preferments in general both civil and ecclesiastical do not the meritorious fail while the industrious leveehaunter runs away with the prize  i take the liberty of saying thus much to you upon this subject because i have been told you are determined to write no more for the stage i confess i would a little soften that resolution if i could in regard to mr vr and hope to prevail upon you to touch up his tragedy and make it fit for the stage and when i assure you that your assistance in this affair may be a means to make him easy and happy in his circumstances i flatter myself that your generous disposition will need no other motive to engage you in so good an office  i am dear sir with much respect and sincerity  your most obedient humble servant b booth  letter live from mr booth to aaron hill esquire charlesstr dec         sir i am every way obliged to you and shall ever acknowledge your favors  as to the affairs of the playhouse half a dozen such farces as the devil in the winecellar and one pantomime would restore drury lane  but where shall we find them i long to talk with you on this subject and upon another of much greater consequence to me i mean my health i have not forgot the drops you brought me but i durst not take them at that time because i dreaded the colic which has now left me  you are sensible sir to what little purpose it is to talk of jaundices overheated blood obstructions etc unless it be with the unhappy who have felt those distempers  till i was sick myself i had as confused a notion of the disorders occasioned by a fever as the deaf have of sounds or the blind of colors  i know mr vr fancies i could act i pleased but he is mistaken  at least he thinks i could speak a prologue but he is mistaken in that too  i have often told him i am not able  and that i am so unhappy at this time is a double affliction to me because mr hill seems to wish i would do it in so engaging a manner that all excuses but that of incapacity would be unpardonable  i had answered yours sooner had i not been prevented from writing by this open warm weather which is too apt to discompose me a hard frost agrees best with me  i have a thousand things to say to you you will pardon me if i flatter myself with the hopes of seeing you shortly i am sir with utmost respect and sincerity  your most obliged and most humble servant b booth p s i could be lavish in the praises of your tragedy  if it meet not with deserved success we must hereafter regale our audiences as the ghost in the libertine does don john and his companions with the liquor they most delight in    letter lv from mr wilks to aaron hill esquire feb       0 sir from the observations you have been pleased to make of the conduct sentiments and diction of eurydice permit me to say that without exception i think you the best judge of dramatic performance in all its branches i have ever known it were to be wished that every spectator had your penetration and could so justly distinguish the different passions and the manner of working em  no actor then could hope for a favorable reception but from his endeavors upon all occasions to copy nature but alas the taste in general is so depraved that there is little or no applause to be gained in tragedy but at the expense of lungs i am therefore the less concerned that by the course of years i have reason to think myself so near my exit i should be proud however of an opportunity to tell you how much i am  sir your admirer and obliged humble servant r wilks  letter lvi from mr wilks to aaron hill esquire bowstr sept         sir i have read your play with vast pleasure and mr cibber highly approves of it but if athelwold be the part you design for me i have too much reason to fear that it is next to impossible at my time of day to do it common justice and if i decline it from a thorough conviction of my own insufficiency which is truly the case i am sure i may depend upon your justice and goodnature to excuse me  i should be very sorry after some little success in my business to run the hazard of falling under your censure by a very weak performance of so capital a part which requires not only more youth and vigor than i am master of but all the requisites that are necessary to form a complete actor  if you will be pleased to let me know in what manner you design to cast it i will order the parts to be writ out immediately that it may be ready for acting about the time you mention i am  sir your most obliged and most obedient humble servant r wilks  letter lvii from mr wilks to aaron hill esquire bowstr oct  0      sir if i said any thing about the part of athelwold that amounted to a promise it was from the strong desire which i had to appear in a play so highly and so deservedly recommended but to my greater mortification i find that the affair of tragedy at least for any continuance is over with me i may perhaps rub through my parts in comedy but daily experience teaches me that it is absolutely out of my power to support the weight of such a character as athelwold during the run of a new play that i am persuaded must make its way in spite of prejudice  if anybody should make me the compliment of asking why i did not appear in the part of athelwold i shall deal frankly with him as i have done with you and tell him the true reason and my sentiments of the play will be better justified by the manner in which i speak of it every where  you are so obliging to ask me in case the play were to come on without me who else will be capable of supporting the character of athelwold  mr mills with your instructions i am sure will do it well and he must be a wretched actor indeed who is not qualified to enter into the beauties of the most difficult part by the assistance which you are able to give him and whoever has the pleasure of conversing with mr hill will be fully convinced of this truth i am  sir your most obliged and obedient humble servant r wilks p s i am far from having changed my opinion as to the merits of the play and i heartily wish it were as much in my power as it is in my inclination to act conformably to your sentiments in every thing    letter lviii from dr blinman to aaron hill esquire may         sir i should be glad of the honor of renewing our acquaintance having a very great esteem for you i brought you once a gold the medal abovementioned was a compliment from the czarina confort of the great peter alexiowitz by his own order to aaron hill esquire for a poem called the northern star which he wrote in justice to that truly great monarch about the year      and which had reached his eye and regard by means of some foreign translation medal from the late great empress of russia so if you please to appoint any place and direct to doctor blinman at mr williamss over against whites chocolatehouse st jamess i shall be ready to meet you who am with all respect  your most obedient humble servant j blinman  finis
