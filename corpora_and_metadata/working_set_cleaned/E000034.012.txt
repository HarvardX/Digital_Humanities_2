editor undertook this publication he had good reasons for believing that he was in possession of all the important correspondence and writings of franklin which had servived him but as the work progressed he has realized more fully than ever before that the task of the danaïdes was scarcely more difficult or discouraging than that of making a complete collection of the correspondence and writings of a man who stood in so many different and important relations to his contemporaries as franklin did the harvest instead of diminishing with the lapse of time seems to increase by cultivation over two hundred documents upon which the stamp of franklins genius had been impressed and which are entitled to a place in any collection of his works have been placed in the editors hands since the publication of the first two volumes the larger number of these unfortunately reached him after the documents of corresponding date had gone to press it thus became necessary to provide for them in a supplement which will be found at the end of this volume for the opportunity of enriching his work with these papers he desires to recognize his special obligations to mr b f stevens who kindly placed the whole of his important collection of frankliniana at the editors disposal to mr s g w benjamin iv to whom he is indebted for most of the letters from franklin to strahan that appear in this work and which constitute a very important contribution to our knowledge of franklin as a man of business he has also to confess his great obligations to mr worthington c ford of the state department washington of whose precise and extensive acquaintance with the resources of the government archives he has been permitted freely to avail himself and to his brother mr paul l ford and their father whose collections of autographs and other memorials of our early history no student of our early annals can afford to neglect the editor is unwilling to take final leave of a work which has been to him almost a daily joy for several years without again acknowledging his special obligations to the hon thomas f bayard secretary of state and of his predecessor the hon f t

correspondence and miscellaneous writings     benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia john ingenhousz mdxv to john ingenhousz philadelphia    october      —— you have always been kind enough to interest yourself in what relates to my health i ought therefore to acquaint you with what appears to me something curious respecting it you may remember the cutaneous malady i formerly complained of and for which you and dr pringle favored me with prescriptions and advice it vexed me near fourteen years and was at the beginning of this year as bad as ever covering almost my whole body except my face and hands when a fit of the gout came on without very much pain but a swelling in both feet which at last appeared also in both knees and then in my hands as these swellings increased and extended the other malady diminished and at length disappeared entirely those swellings have some time   since begun to fall and are now almost gone perhaps the cutaneous disease may return or perhaps it is worn out i may hereafter let you know what happens i am on the whole much weaker than when it began to leave me but possibly that may be the effect of age for i am now near eightythree the age of commencing decrepitude i grieve at the wars europe is engaged in and wish they were ended for i fear even the victors will be losers i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin p s—our public affairs are drawing towards a settlement i have served out the three years term of my presidentship limited by the constitution and being determined to engage no more in public business i hope if health permits to be a better correspondent we have no philosophical news here at present except that a boat moved by a steamengine rows itself against tide in our river and it is apprehended the construction may be so simplified and improved as to become generally useful  benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia m le veillard mdxvi to m le veillard  philadelphia    october      my dear friend— i have lately received your two kind letters of june   th and august  th i do   not find that i ever received those you mention of the   th september i have been much afflicted the last summer with a longcontinued fit of the gout which i am not quite clear of though much better my other malady is not augmented i have lately made great progress in the work you so urgently demand and have come as far as my fiftieth year being now free from public business as my term in the presidentship is expired and resolving to engage in no other public employment i expect to have it finished in about two months if illness or some unforeseen interruption does not prevent i do not therefore send a part at this time thinking it better to retain the whole till i can view it all together and make the proper corrections i am much concerned to hear the broils in your country but hope they will lead to its advantage when this fermentation is over and the troubling parts subsided the wine will be fine and good and cheer the hearts of those who drink of it our affairs mend daily and are getting into good order very fast never was any measure so thoroughly discussed as our proposed new constitution many objections were made to it in the public papers and answers to these objections much party heat there was and some violent personal abuse i kept out of the dispute and wrote only one little paper on the occasion which i enclose you seem to me to be too apprehensive about our presidents being perpetual neither he nor we have any such intention what danger there may be of such an event   we are all aware of and shall take care effectually to prevent it the choice is from four years to four years the appointments will be small thus we may change our president if we dont like his conduct and he will have less inducement to struggle for a new election as to the two chambers i am of your opinion that one alone would be better but my dear friend nothing in human affairs and schemes is perfect and perhaps that is the case of our opinions it must have been a terrible tempest that devastated such an extent of country i have sometimes thought that it might be well to establish an office of insurance for farms against the damage that may occur to them from storms blight insects etc a small sum paid by a number would repair such losses and prevent much poverty and distress our adventurous merchants are hitherto successful in the east india trade perhaps it would be better for us if we used none of the commodities of those countries but since we do use them it is an advantage that we have them cheaper than when they came through britain as to the other merchandise she formerly supplied us with our demand is daily diminishing our people are more and more sensible of the mischievous consequences of drinking rum the leaders of several religious sects have warned their people against it and the consumption has this last year been less by one third this will affect her islands and the restraints she has laid on our trade have contributed to raise a spirit of industry in families who now manufacture more   than ever for themselves that must lessen greatly the importation embrace for me bien tendrement your good dame and children with sincere esteem and hearty attachment i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin p s—the wine is arrived but it was not well secured or bottled one of the casks had leaked a great deal and the case we have opened had two thirds of the bottles empty or broken temple is in the country he has received your letters but does not know of this opportunity benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia benjamin vaughan mdxvii to benjamin vaughan philadelphia    october      —— having now finished my term in the presidentship and resolving to engage no more in public affairs i hope to be a better correspondent for the little time i have to live i am recovering from a longcontinued gout and am diligently employed in writing the history of my life to the doing of which the persuasions contained in your letter of january         have not a little contributed i am now in the year      just before i was sent to england to shorten the work as well as for other reasons i omit all facts and transactions that may not have a tendency to benefit the young reader by showing him   from my example and my success in emerging from poverty and acquiring some degree of wealth power and reputation the advantages of certain modes of conduct which i observed and of avoiding the errors which were prejudicial to me if a writer can judge properly of his own work i fancy on reading over what is already done that the book will be found entertaining interesting and useful more so than i expected when i began it if my present state of health continues i hope to finish it this winter when done you shall have a manuscript copy of it that i may obtain from your judgment and friendship such remarks as may contribute to its improvement the violence of our party debates about the new constitution seems much abated indeed almost extinct and we are getting fast into good order i kept out of those disputes pretty well having wrote only one little piece which i send you enclosed i regret the immense quantity of misery brought upon mankind by this turkish war and i am afraid the king of sweden may burn his fingers by attacking russia when will princes learn arithmetic enough to calculate if they want pieces of one anothers territory how much cheaper it would be to buy them than to make war for them even though they were to give a hundred years purchase but if glory cannot be valued and therefore the wars for it cannot be subject to arithmetical calculation so as to show their advantage or disadvantage at least wars for trade which have gain for their object may be proper subjects for such computation and a   trading nation as well as a single trader ought to calculate the probabilities of profit and loss before engaging in any considerable adventure this however nations seldom do and we have had frequent instances of their spending more money in wars for acquiring or securing branches of commerce than a hundred years profit or the full enjoyment of them can compensate remember me affectionately to good dr price and to the honest heretic dr priestley i do not call him honest by way of distinction for i think all the heretics i have known have been virtuous men they have the virtue of fortitude or they would not venture to own their heresy and they cannot afford to be deficient in any of the other virtues as that would give advantage to their enemies and they have not like orthodox sinners such a number of friends to excuse or justify them do not however mistake me it is not to my good friends heresy that i impute his honesty on the contrary it is his honesty that has brought upon him the character of heretic i am ever my dear friend yours sincerely b franklin benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia m le roy mdxviii to m le roy philadelphia    october      my dear friend— your kind letter of the  th of may after some delay by the way is come safe to  0 hand with the memoirs and elegant prints of your projected hospital which i shall dispose of as you direct it may in time to come be useful here i received also the volume of academy memoirs and thank you for your care in sending them i am now in possession of the repose i have so long wished for having finished the third year of my presidentship the term limited by our constitution and resolving to engage no more in public business my employment of that repose can however be but short as i am near eightythree we have no philosophical news here at present except that a large boat rowed by the force of steam is now exercised upon our river stems the current and seems to promise being useful when the machinery can be more simplified and the expense reduced i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia don diego gardoqui mdxix to don diego gardoqui minister from the court of spain philadelphia    october      sir— messrs henry pawling and greenberry dawson one of whom will have the honor of presenting this to the hand of your excellency are projecting a voyage from the ohio settlement with the produce of that country to be sold at new orleans i know not how far the laws existing there    admit of such commerce but if it is allowable i would then beg leave to request that your excellency would be so good as to give them your counsels with a line of protection as they are here esteemed persons of honest principles who have good characters i am persuaded they will not forfeit them and show themselves unworthy of your excellencys favor by any contraband or illegal practices with great and sincere esteem and respect i am sir your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin  0 november      philadelphia elam mdxx to mr elam philadelphia  0 november      sir— i received your note of the  th instant and being now as you observe retired to a private station i hope to enjoy the repose appertaining to it i cannot think therefore of calling as you propose you and your accusers before me to discuss differences which i have no authority to judge of or to determine i can only give you my friendly advice which is to behave peaceably and respectfully to the religious society you profess to be connected with especially in their public assemblies in which case i am persuaded you may quietly enjoy that liberty of a freeholder and citizen which you desire without receiving from them the smallest interruption    by giving me no further trouble with your quarrels you will oblige your wellwisher b franklin william t franklin    novre      philadelphia m le veillard mdxxi wm t franklin to m le veillard  philadelphie    novre      la

francis childs philadelphia    november      sir— when you were here in april last you promised me the payment of one hundred dollars in june following which has not been sent to me and therefore i have now drawn upon you for the same and having present occasion for money i depend on your honoring my draft i am sir your humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia elizabeth partridge mdxxiii to mrs partridge  philadelphia    november      my dear child— i received your kind letter of the   th inst enclosing one for mr philip vanhorn physician in philadelphia which you desire me to deliver and to solicit the forgiveness of his daughter    i immediately made enquiry for him as to be instrumental in so charitable a work and in concurrence with you would have given me great pleasure but i am assured by our oldest inhabitants who have had most acquaintance and best opportunities of knowing their fellowcitizens particularly some of our physicians that no physician or other person of that name has ever been a resident here so that there must have been some mistake in the information that has been given you if indeed the whole story is not an imposition you kindly enquire after my health i have not of late much reason to boast of it people that will live a long life and drink to the bottom of the cup must expect to meet with some of the dregs however when i consider how many more terrible maladies the human body is liable to i think myself well off that i have only three incurable ones the gout the stone and old age and those notwithstanding i enjoy many comfortable intervals in which i forget all my ills and amuse myself in reading or writing or in conversation with friends joking laughing and telling merry stories as when you first knew me a young man about fifty my children and grandchildren the baches are all well and pleased with your remembrance of them they are my family living in my house and we have lately the addition of a little goodnatured girl whom i begin to love as well as the rest you tell me our poor friend ben kent is gone i hope to the regions of the blessed or at mutilated    to some place where souls are prepared for those mutilated gions i found my hope on this that though not so orthodox as you and i he was an honest man and had his virtues if he had any hypocrisy it was of that inverted kind with which a man is not so bad mutilated seems to be and with regard to future bliss i cannot help imagining that multitudes of the zealously orthodox of different sects who at the last day may flock together in hopes of seeing mutilated damned will be disappointed and obliged to rest content with their own salvation you have no occasion to apologise for your former letter it was as all yours are very well written that which it enclosed for your cousin came too late he being sailed by one of the accidents which war occasions all my books containing copies of my letters were lost there were eight volumes of them and i have been able to recover only two those are of later date than the transaction you mention and therefore can contain nothing relating to it if the letter you want a copy of was one in which i aimed at consoling my brothers friends by a comparison drawn from a party of pleasure intended into the country where we were all to meet though the chair of one being soonest ready he set out before the rest i say if this was the letter i fancy you may possibly find it in boston as i remember dr biles once wrote me that many copies had been taken of it i too should have been glad to have seen that again among others i had written to him and you but you inform me they mutilated by the mice poor little    innocent creatures i am sorry they had no better food but since they like my letters here is another treat for them adieu ma chere enfant and believe me mutilated your affectionate uncle b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia jane mecom mdxxiv to mrs jane mecom philadelphia    november      my dear sister— i received your kind letter of the   th instant the two former ones you mention i had answered though it seems the answer had not reached you if it has finally miscarried i will look for the letters and answer them again i am sorry you should suffer so much uneasiness with tears and apprehensions about my health there are in life real evils enough and it is folly to afflict ourselves with imaginary ones and it is time enough when the real ones arrive i see by the papers that tomorrow is your thanksgiving day the flour will arrive too late for your plumpuddings for i find it went from hence but a few days since i hope however it will be with you before the winter shuts up your harbor i never see any boston newspapers you mention there being often something in them to do me honor i am obliged to them on the other hand some of our papers here are endeavoring to disgrace me i take no notice my friends defend me i have long    been accustomed to receive more blame as well as more praise than i have deserved it is the lot of every public man and i leave one account to balance the other as you observe there was no swearing in the story of the poker when i told it the late new dresser of it was probably the same or perhaps akin to him who in relating a dispute that happened between queen anne and the archbishop of canterbury concerning a vacant mitre which the queen was for bestowing on a person the archbishop thought unworthy made both the queen and the archbishop swear three or four thumping oaths in every sentence of the discussion and the archbishop at last gained his point one present at this tale being surprised said but did the queen and the archbishop swear so at one another oh no no says the relator that is only my way of telling the story this family is all well at present and join in love to you and yours with your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia charles thomson mdxxv to charles thomson secretary of congress philadelphia    november      dear old friend— enclosed i send a letter to the president of congress for the time being which if you find nothing improper in it or that in regard to me you could wish changed or amended i would  0 request you to present i rely much on your friendly counsel as you must be better acquainted with persons and circumstances than i am and i suppose there will be time enough before the new congress is formed to make any alterations you may advise though if presented at all it should be to the old one in the copy of my letter to mr barclay you may observe that mention is made of some considerable articles which i have not charged in my accounts with congress but on which i should expect from their equity some consideration that you may have some information what those articles are i enclose also a sketch of my services to the united states wherein you will find mention of the extra services i performed that do not appertain to the office of plenipotentiary viz as judge of admiralty as consul before the arrival of mr barclay as banker in examining and accepting the multitude of bills of exchange and as secretary for several years none being sent to me though other ministers were allowed such assistance i must own i did hope that as it is customary in europe to make some liberal provision for ministers when they return home from foreign service the congress would at least have been kind enough to have shown their approbation of my conduct by a grant of a small tract of land in their western country which might have been of use and some honor to my posterity and i cannot but still think they will do something of the kind for me whenever they shall be pleased to take my services into consideration as i    see by their minutes that they have allowed mr lee handsomely for his services in england before his appointment to france in which services i and mr bollan coöperated with him and have had no such allowance and since his return he has been very properly rewarded with a good place as well as my friend mr jay though these are trifling compensations in comparison with what was granted by the king to m gérard on his return from america but how different is what has happened to me on my return from england in      the congress bestowed on me the office of postmastergeneral for which i was very thankful it was indeed an office i had some kind of right to as having previously greatly enlarged the revenue of the post by the regulations i had contrived and established while i possessed it under the crown when i was sent to france i left it in the hands of my soninlaw who was to act as my deputy but soon after my departure it was taken from me and given to mr hazard when the english ministry formerly thought fit to deprive me of the office they left me however the privilege of receiving and sending my letters free of postage which is the usage when a postmaster is not displaced for misconduct in the office but in america i have ever since had the postage demanded of me which since my return from france has amounted to above fifty pounds much of it occasioned by my having acted as minister there when i took my grandson william temple franklin with me to france i proposed after giving him    the french language to educate him in the study and practice of the law but by the repeated expectations given me of a secretary and constant disappointments i was induced and indeed obliged to retain him with me to assist in the secretarys office which disappointments continued till my return by which time so many years of the opportunity of his studying the law were lost and his habits of life become so different that it appeared no longer advisable and i then considering him as brought up in the diplomatic line and well qualified by his knowledge in that branch for the employ of a secretary at least in which opinion i was not alone for three of my colleagues without the smallest solicitation from me chose him secretary of the negotiation for treaties which they had been empowered to do took the liberty of recommending him to the congress for their protection this was the only favor i ever asked of them and the only answer i received was a resolution superseding him and appointing colonel humphreys in his place a gentleman who though he might have indeed a good deal of military merit certainly had none in the diplomatic line and had neither the french language nor the experience nor the address proper to qualify him for such an employment this is all to yourself only as a private friend for i have not nor ever shall make any public complaint and even if i could have foreseen such unkind treatment from congress their refusing me thanks would not in the least have abated my zeal for the cause and ardor in support of it i know    something of the nature of such changeable assemblies and how little successors know of the services that have been rendered to the corps before their admission or feel themselves obliged by such services and what effect in obliterating a sense of them during the absence of the servant in a distant country the artful and reiterated malevolent insinuations of one or two envious and malicious persons may have on the minds of members even of the most equitable candid and honorable dispositions and therefore i will pass these reflections into oblivion my good friend excuse if you can the trouble of this letter and if the reproach thrown on republics that they are apt to be ungrateful should ever unfortunately be verified with respect to your services remember that you have a right to unbosom yourself in communicating your griefs to your ancient friend and most obedient humble servant b franklin sketch of the services of b franklin to the united states of america in england he combated the stamp act and his writings in the papers against it with his examination in parliament were thought to have contributed much to its repeal he opposed the duty act and though he could not prevent its passing he obtained of mr townshend an omission of several articles particularly salt in the subsequent difference he wrote and published    many papers refuting the claim of parliament to tax the colonies he opposed all oppressive acts he had two secret negotiations with the ministers for their repeal of which he has written a narrative in this he offered payment for the destroyed tea at his own risk in case they were repealed he was joined with messrs bollan and lee in all the applications to government for that purpose printed several pamphlets at his own considerable expense against the then measures of government whereby he rendered himself obnoxious was disgraced before the privy council deprived of a place in the postoffice of £ 00 sterling a year and obliged to resign his agencies viz of pennsylvania £ 00 of massachusetts  00 of new jersey  00 of georgia  00  £  00 in the whole £  00 sterling per annum orders were sent to the kings governors not to sign any warrants on the treasury for orders of his salaries and though he was not actually dismissed by the colonies that employed him yet thinking the known malice of the court against him rendered him less likely than others to manage their affairs to their advantage he judged it to be his duty to withdraw from their service and leave it open for less exceptionable persons which saved them the necessity of removing him    returning to america he encouraged the revolution was appointed chairman of the committee of safety where he projected the chevaux de frise for securing philadelphia then the residence of congress was sent by congress to headquarters near boston with messrs harrison and lynch in      to settle some affairs with the northern governments and general washington in the spring of      was sent to canada with messrs chase and carroll passing the lakes while they were not yet free from ice in canada was with his colleagues instrumental in redressing sundry grievances and thereby reconciling the people more to our cause he there advanced to general arnold and other servants of congress then in extreme necessity £    in gold out of his own pocket on the credit of congress which was of great service at that juncture in procuring provisions for our army being at the time he was ordered on this service upwards of seventy years of age he suffered in his health by the hardships of this journey lodging in the woods etc in so inclement a season but being recovered the congress in the same year ordered him to france before his departure he put all the money he could raise between three and four thousand pounds into their hands which demonstrating his confidence encouraged others to lend their money in support of the cause he made no bargain for appointments but was promised by a vote the net salary of £ 000 sterling    per annum his expenses paid and to be assisted by a secretary who was to have £ 000 per annum to include all contingencies when the pennsylvania assembly sent him to england in      on the same salary they allowed him one years advance for his passage and in consideration of the prejudice to his private affairs that must be occasioned by his sudden departure and absence he has had no such allowance from congress was badly accommodated in a miserable vessel improper for those northern seas and which actually foundered in her return was badly fed so that on his arrival he had scarce strength to stand his services to the states as commissioner and afterwards as minister plenipotentiary are known to congress as may appear in his correspondence his extra services may not be so well known and therefore may be here mentioned no secretary ever arriving the business was in part before and entirely when the other commissioners left him executed by himself with the help of his grandson who at first was only allowed clothes board and lodging and afterwards a salary never exceeding £ 00 a year except while he served as secretary to the commissioners for peace by which difference in salary continued many years the congress saved if they accept it £ 00 sterling a year he served as consul entirely several years till the arrival of mr barclay and even after as that gentleman was obliged to be much and long absent in holland flanders and england during which    absence what business of the kind occurred still came to mr franklin he served though without any special commission for the purpose as a judge of admiralty for the congress having sent him a quantity of blank commissions for privateers he granted them to cruisers fitted out in the ports of france some of them manned by old smugglers who knew every creek on the coast of england and running all round the island distressed the british coasting trade exceedingly and raised their general insurance one of those privateers alone the black prince took in the course of a year seventyfive sail all the papers taken in each prize brought in were in virtue of an order of council sent up to mr franklin who was to examine them judge of the legality of the capture and write to the admiralty of the port that he found the prize good and that the sale might be permitted these papers which are very voluminous he has to produce he served also as merchant to make purchases and direct the shipping of stores to a very great value for which he has charged no commission but the part of his service which was the most fatiguing and confining was that of receiving and accepting after a due and necessary examination the bills of exchange drawn by congress for interest money to the amount of two millions and a half of livres annually multitudes of the bills very small each of which the smallest gave as much trouble in examining as the largest and this careful examination was found absolutely necessary from the    constant frauds attempted by presenting seconds and thirds for payment after the firsts have been discharged as these bills were arriving more or less by every ship and every post they required constant attendance mr franklin could make no journey for exercise as had been annually his custom and the confinement brought on a malady that is likely to afflict him while he lives in short though he has always been an active man he never went through so much business during eight years in any part of his life as during those of his residence in france which however he did not decline till he saw peace happily made and found himself in the eightieth year of his age when if ever a man has some right to expect repose benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia mdxxvi to the president of congress philadelphia    november      sir— when i had the honor of being the minister of the united states at the court of france mr barclay arriving there brought me the following resolution of congress resolved that a commissioner be appointed by congress with full power and authority to liquidate and finally to settle the accounts of all the servants of the united states who have been intrusted with the expenditure of public money in europe and to commence and prosecute such suits causes and    actions as may be necessary for the purpose or for the recovery of any property of the said united states in the hands of any person or persons whatsoever that the said commissioner be authorized to appoint one or more clerks with such allowance as he may think reasonable that the said commissioner and clerks respectively take an oath before some person duly authorized to administer an oath faithfully to execute the trust reposed in them respectively congress proceeded to the election of a commissioner and ballots being taken mr thomas barclay was elected in pursuance of this resolution and as soon as mr barclay was at leisure from more pressing business i rendered to him all my accounts which he examined and stated methodically by this statement he found a balance due to me on the  th of may      of      livres    sols   derniers which i accordingly received of the congress banker the difference between my statement and his being only seven sols which by mistake i had overcharged about three pence halfpenny sterling at my request however the accounts were left open for the consideration of congress and not finally settled there being some articles on which i desired their judgment and having some equitable demands as i thought them for extra services which he had not conceived himself empowered to allow and therefore i did not put them in my account he transmitted the accounts to congress and had advice of their being received on my  0 arrival at philadelphia one of the first things i did was to despatch my grandson william t franklin to new york to obtain a final settlement of those accounts he having long acted as my secretary and being well acquainted with the transactions was able to give an explanation of the articles that might seem to require explaining if any such there were he returned without effecting the settlement being told that it could not be made till the arrival of some documents expected from france what those documents were i have not been informed nor can i readily conceive as all the vouchers existing there had been examined by mr barclay and i having been immediately after my arrival engaged in the public business of this state waited in expectation of hearing from congress in case any part of my accounts had been objected to it is now more than three years that those accounts have been before that honorable body and to this day no notice of any such objection has been communicated to me but reports have for some time past been circulated here and propagated in the newspapers that i am greatly indebted to the united states for large sums that had been put into my hands and that i avoid a settlement this together with the little time one of my age may expect to live makes it necessary for me to request earnestly which i hereby do that the congress would be pleased without further delay to examine those accounts and if they find therein any article or articles which they do not understand or approve that they would cause me to be acquainted with the    same that i may have an opportunity of offering such explanations or reasons in support of them as may be in my power and then that the accounts may be finally closed i hope the congress will soon be able to attend to this business for the satisfaction of the public as well as in condescension to my request in the meantime if there be no impropriety in it i would desire that this letter together with another  relating to the same subject the copy of which is hereto annexed may be put upon their minutes with every sentiment of respect and duty to congress i am sir etc b franklin  benjamin

franklin benjamin franklin  0 december      philadelphia abbé morellet mdxxviii to the abbé morellet philadelphia  0 december      dear friend— the suspension of the pacquet boats has deranged our correspondence it is long    very long since i have been favored with a line from auteuil and m de chaumont informed me lately that a number of letters which i had sent to new york to go by the pacquet to france had been lying there many months after no pacquet arriving by which they might be sent pray let me know whether you ever received my remarks on the english reasons for refusing to deliver up the posts on our frontiers sent now near a year since in return for your excellent guichets and nouvelles cométalogie with which i have most agreeably entertained many of my friends i am however not without resource in this dearth of news from that academy for i often read over and over again and always with fresh pleasure your and abbé de la roches pleasing and instructive letter of july      and the friendly affectionate griffonage as she is pleased to call it of that good dame  whom we all love and whose memory i shall love and honor as long as i have any existence and i sometimes dream of being in france and visiting my friends there when those of auteuil are never forgotten i send you herewith as a small curiosity some songs and music of american composition the first production of the kind that has appeared here i fancy some of the music may suit your taste as it is simple and pathetic the poetry of one of the songs pleases me particularly it is the vth i wish you or mr cabenis would translate it so that it may be sung to the same notes    the gentleman who will have the honor of delivering you this line is mr gouverneur morris formerly a member of congress and one of the convention that composed the federal constitution he is much esteemed here by those that know him and being a friend of mine i beg leave to recommend him to your civilities and to m marmontels to whom please to present my respects i hope the late troubles in france are nearly over t is a country that i dearly love and in whose prosperity i feel myself deeply interested having now finished my three years service as president and not likely to engage in any future public business i begin to feel myself a freeman and to enjoy the little leisure that the remnant of life may afford me some of this leisure i am however employing in writing my own history which calling past transactions to remembrance makes it seem a little like living ones life over again i am ever my dear friend with great and sincere esteem yours most affectionately b franklin catherine louisa shipley    december      benjamin franklin mdxxix from miss catherine louisa shipley bolton street    december      my dear friend— it is a great while since i wrote to you and still longer since i heard from you but i have now a particular pleasure in writing to one who had long known and loved the dear parent    i have lost  you will probably before you receive this have heard of my fathers death his illness was short and terminated in apoplexy he was seldom in his perfect senses for the last four days but such constant calmness and composure could only have attended the deathbed of a truly good man how unlike the ideas i had formed to myself of death which till now i had only seen at a distance and heard of with terror the nearer his last moment approached the more his ideas seemed elevated and but for those whom living he had loved with tenderness and dying he still felt interested for he showed no regret at leaving this world i believe his many virtues have called down a blessing on his family for we have all been supported under this severe affliction beyond what i could have imagined and though sorrow will for a time get the better of every other sensation i feel now that the strongest impression left by his death is the desire of imitating his virtues in an humbler sphere of life my dear mothers health i hope will not have suffered materially and she has every consolation to be derived from the reflection that for fortyfive years it was the study of her life to make the best of husbands happy he in return has shown that his attention to her ease and comfort did not end with his life he was happily preserved to us so long as to be able to leave all his family in good circumstances i fancy my mother bessy and i shall live at twyford but at present no place is settled    may i flatter myself that you still feel some affection for the family of your good old friend and let me have the happiness of hearing it from yourself i shall request dr price to send this letter my mother brother and sisters beg to be all most kindly remembered believe me dear sir your faithful and obliged catherine louisa shipley richard price december      hackney benjamin franklin mdxxx from richard price hackney december      my dear friend— i have been desired by miss kitty shipley to convey to you the enclosed letter and i cannot at present find any way of conveying it except by the packet it will inform you of the death of one of your warmest friends and the best of bishops ever since the american war i have been honored with much of his attention and friendship and i cannot but mourn the loss which his family his friends and the world have sustained his family are in a state of deep concern but at the same time inquisitive about you and anxious to receive some information about you you can be nowhere more beloved or respected i have heard with pain that you have been suffering under the gout and stone two sad maladies but alas it is impossible that our bodily frame as it wears out and approaches to its dissolution should    not subject us to sufferings happy are those who in such circumstances can look back on a life distinguished by such services as yours have been there is i trust beyond the grave a world where we shall all meet and rise to greater happiness than any we have enjoyed here will you be so good as to deliver my compliments to dr rush you have i know too much to do and too many letters to answer and therefore i can only wish that dr rush would give me an account of you he has frequently favored me with letters and they generally gratify me highly by informing me of the state of affairs in the united states his last letter was dated in may and i answered it in june by mr bishop a gentleman from connecticut who was returning from his travels through france and germany i rejoice to find that the federal constitution has been adopted by the states this confirms me in the hope that a state of things is commencing there more favorable to human rights than any that has yet been known in this world one of the circumstances in which i am most disposed to rejoice is the separation which has taken place there of religion from civil policy and the free scope given to discussion and improvement by abolishing the interposition of civil power in matters of speculation and extending equal protection to all religious sects as far as they avoid injuring one another i received some time ago a letter from dr white will you should he happen to come in your way deliver to him my respectful and grateful acknowledgments    i have thought it needless to trouble him with an answer to his letter he probably soon found that it was not possible to assist mr workman the person he recommended in the manner he proposed our kings insanity has brought us in this country into a state that threatens us with much confusion the prince of wales is likely to bring with him into power the coalition party the king may recover and this party may be soon routed again a relapse may produce another rout or the prince after being invested with power may be too tenacious of it and thus the worst evils may arise the coalition party however will hardly do us more mischief than the late ministry seems to me to have done by connecting us in such a manner with prussia hesse and holland as to subject us to the danger of being involved soon in another continental war but i have gone beyond the bounds i intended in this letter accept my ardent wishes that the remainder of your life may be as happy as possible in hopes of not being forgotten by you i am ever most affectionately yours richard price mdxxxi a thought concerning the sugar islands should it be agreed and become a part of the law of nations that the cultivators of the earth are not to be molested or interrupted in their peaceable and useful  0 employment the inhabitants of the sugar islands would come under the protection of such a regulation which would be a great advantage to the nations who at present hold those islands since the cost of sugar to the consumer in those nations consists not only in the price he pays for it by the pound but in the accummulated charge of all the taxes he pays in every war to fit out fleets and maintain troops for the defence of the islands that raise the sugar and the ships that bring it home but the expenses of treasure is not all a celebrated philosophical writer remarks that when he considered the wars made in africa for prisoners to raise sugar in america the number slain in those wars the numbers that being crowded in ships perish in the transportation and the numbers that die under the severities of slavery he could scarce look on a morsel of sugar without conceiving it spotted with human blood if he had considered also the blood of one another which the white natives shed in fighting for those islands he would have imagined his sugar not as spotted only but as thoroughly dyed red on these accounts i am persuaded that the subjects of the emperor of germany and the empress of russia who have no sugar islands consume sugar cheaper at vienna and moscow with all the charge of transporting it after its arrival in europe than the citizens of london and paris and i sincerely believe that if france and england were to decide by throwing dice which should have the whole of the sugar islands the loser in the throw would be the    gainer the future expense of defending them would be saved the sugars would be bought cheaper by all europe if the inhabitants might make it without interruption and who ever imported the sugar the same revenue might be raised by duties at the customhouse of the nation that consumed it and on the whole i conceive it would be better for the nations now possessing sugar colonies to give up their claim to them let them govern themselves and put them under the protection of all the powers of europe as neutral countries open to the commerce of all the profit of the present monopolies being by no means equivalent to the expense of maintaining them mdxxxii reflections on the augmentation of wages which will be occasioned in europe by the american revolution  the independence and prosperity of the united states of america will raise the price of wages in europe an advantage of which i believe no one has yet spoken the low rate of wages is one of the greatest defects    in the political associations of europe or rather of the old world if the term wages be taken in its widest signification it will be found that almost all the citizens of a large state receive and pay wages i shall confine my remarks however to one description of wages the only one with which government should intermeddle or which requires its care i mean the wages of the lowest class those men without property without capital who live solely by the labor of their hands this is always the most numerous class in a state and consequently that cannot be pronounced happy in which from the lowness and insufficiency of wages the laboring class procure so scanty a subsistence that barely able to provide for their own necessities they have not the means of marrying and rearing a family and are reduced to beggary whenever employment fails them or age and sickness oblige them to give up work further the wages under consideration ought not to be estimated by their amount in money but by the quantity of provisions clothing and other commodities which the laborer can procure for the money which he receives unhappily in all the political states of the old world a numerous class of citizens have nothing to live upon but their wages and these are inadequate to their support this is the real cause of the misery of so many day laborers who work in the fields or in manufactories in towns of pauperism an evil which is spreading every day more and more because governments attempt to check it by feeble    remedies only of depravity of morals and of almost every crime the policy of tyranny and of commerce has overlooked and disguised these truths the horrible maxim that the people must be poor in order that they may remain in subjection is still held by many persons of hard hearts and perverted understanding with whom it were useless to contend others again think that the people should be poor from a regard of the supposed interests of commerce they believe that to increase the rate of wages would raise the price of the productions of the soil and especially of industry which are sold to foreign nations and thus that exportation and the profits arising from it would be diminished but this motive is at once cruel and ill founded it is cruel for whatever may be the advantages of foreign commerce if in order to possess them half the nation must languish in misery we cannot without crime endeavor to obtain them and it becomes the duty of a government to relinquish them to desire to keep down the rate of wages with the view of favoring the exportation of merchandise is to seek to render the citizens of a state miserable in order that foreigners may purchase its productions at a cheaper rate it is at the most attempting to enrich a few merchants by impoverishing the body of the nation it is taking the part of the stronger in that contest already so unequal between the man who can pay wages and him who is under the necessity of receiving them it is in one word to forget that the object of every political society ought to be the happiness of the largest number    this motive is moreover ill founded for in order to secure to a nation a profitable export for the products of its agriculture and manufactures it is not necessary that the rate of wages should be reduced so extremely low as we find it in almost all the countries of europe it is not the wages of the workman but the price of the merchandise that should be lowered in order that this merchandise may be sold to foreign nations but men have always neglected to make this distinction the wages of the laborer are the price of his days work the price of merchandise is the sum it costs to gather the produce of the soil or prepare any product of industry the price of this production may be very moderate while the laborer may receive good wages—that is the means of procuring a comfortable subsistence the labor necessary to gather or prepare the article to be sold may be cheap and the wages of the workman good although the workmen of manchester and norwich and those of amiens and abbeville are employed in the same kind of labor the former receive considerably higher wages than the latter and yet the woollen fabrics of manchester and norwich of the same quality are not so dear as those of amiens and abbeville it would occupy too much time fully to develop this principle i will only observe here that it results in a great measure from the fact that the price of labor in the arts and even in agriculture is wonderfully diminished by the perfection of the machinery employed in them by the intelligence and activity of the workmen and by the judicious division of    labor now these methods of reducing the price of manufactured articles have nothing to do with the low wages of the workman in a large manufactory where animals are employed instead of men and machinery instead of animal power and where that judicious division of labor is made which doubles nay increases tenfold both power and time the article can be manufactured and sold at a much lower rate than in those establishments which do not enjoy the same advantages and yet the workmen in the former may receive twice as much as in the latter it is undoubtedly an advantage for a manufactory to obtain workmen at a moderate price and excessively high wages are an obstacle to the foundation of large manufacturing establishments this high price of wages as i shall presently explain is one reason for the opinion which is entertained that it will be many years before the manufactures of the united states of america can rival those of europe but we must not conclude from this that manufactures cannot prosper unless the wages of the workmen are reduced as low as we find them in europe and moreover the insufficiency of wages occasions the decline of a manufactory as its prosperity is promoted by a high rate of wages high wages attract the most skilful and most industrious workmen thus the article is better made it sells better and in this way the employer makes a greater profit than he could do by diminishing the pay of the workmen a good workman spoils fewer tools wastes less material and works faster than one    of inferior skill and thus the profits of the manufacturer are increased still more the perfection of machinery in all the arts is owing in a great degree to the workmen there is no important manufacture in which they have not invented some useful process which saves time and materials or improves the workmanship if common articles of manufacture the only ones worthy to interest the statesman if woollen cotton and even silk stuffs articles made of iron steel copper skins leather and various other things are generally of better quality at the same price in england than in other countries it is because workmen are there better paid the low rate of wages then is not the real cause of the advantages of commerce between one nation and another but it is one of the greatest evils of political communities let us now inquire what is the situation of the united states in this respect the condition of the day laborer in these states is infinitely better than in the wealthiest countries in the old world and particularly england where however wages are higher than in any other part of europe in the state of new york the lowest class of workmen and those employed in the most ordinary kinds of labor usually gain three shillings and sixpence currency equal to two shillings sterling a day shipcarpenters ten shillings and sixpence currency with a pint of rum equal in all to five shillings and sixpence sterling housecarpenters and bricklayers eight shillings currency equal to four shillings and sixpence sterling    journeymen tailors five shillings currency equal to about two shillings and ten pence sterling these prices much higher than those of london are quite as high in other parts of the united states as in new york i have taken them from adam smiths wealth of nations  an intelligent observer who travelled through a part of the united states in    0 gives us a still more favorable idea of the price that is paid there for work at farmington says he i saw them weaving a kind of camblet and also a blue and white striped woollen cloth for womens clothing these fabrics are all sold at three shillings and sixpence per ell  in the currency of the country equal to about fortyfive sous tournois the sons and the grandsons of the master of the house were working at the business one workman can easily make five ells of this cloth a day and as the original material costs but a shilling he can earn ten or twelve shillings by his days labor    but this fact is so well known that it is superfluous to attempt to prove it by further examples the causes of the high price of labor in our american states must then continue to operate more and more powerfully since agriculture and population advance there with such rapidity that labor of every description is increased in proportion nor is this all the high rate of wages paid them in money proves that they are even better than one would suppose them at first view and in order to estimate them correctly an important circumstance should be known in every part of north america the necessities of life are cheaper than in england scarcity is unknown there in the least productive seasons the harvest is always sufficient for the supply of the inhabitants and they are only obliged to diminish the exportation of their produce now the price of labor in money being higher there than in england and provisions cheaper the actual wages that is the amount of necessary articles which the day laborer can buy is so much the greater it remains for me to show how the high rate of wages in america will increase their rate in europe two distinct causes will unite in producing this effect the first is the greater quantity of labor that europe will have to perform in consequence of the existence of another great nation in the commercial world and of its continual increase and the second the emigration of european workmen or the mere possibility of their emigrating in order to go to america where labor is better paid it is certain that the amount of labor in the various    branches of agriculture manufactures commerce and navigation must be augmented in europe by the addition of several millions of men to the commercial world now the amount of manual labor being increased labor will be somewhat better paid and the rate of daily wages received by the workmen will be raised by this concurrence of circumstances for example if the additional supply of one hundred thousand pieces of cloth twenty thousand casks of wine and ten thousand casks of brandy is to be furnished to the americans not only will the persons necessarily employed in the production or manufacture of these commodities receive higher wages but the price of all other kinds of labor will be augmented the rate of wages in europe will be raised by yet another circumstance with which it is important to be acquainted i have already said that the value of wages ought not to be estimated solely by the amount of money nor even by the quantity of subsistence which the workman receives per day but also by the number of days in which he is employed for it is by such a calculation alone that we can find out what he has for each day is it not evident that he who should be paid at the rate of forty pence a day and should fail of obtaining work half the year would really have but twenty pence to subsist upon and that he would be less advantageously situated than the man who receiving but thirty pence could yet be supplied with work every day thus the americans occasioning in europe an increased demand and necessity for labor would also necessarily  0 cause there an augmentation of wages even supposing the price of the days work to remain at the same rate perhaps it will be objected to what i have said that this new nation will contain within itself as many laboring people as it can employ and that thus adding nothing to the quantity of work to be performed in europe it will be no advantage to the men who perform this work but i reply that it is impossible but that the united states of america in their present condition and much more when their population and wealth shall be doubled nay quadrupled should employ the labor of europeans one way or another it is impossible because in this respect the americans are not differently situated from other nations who all have need of each other the fertility of the american soil the abundance and variety of its productions the activity and industry of its inhabitants and the unrestricted commerce which will sooner or later be established in europe in consequence of the american independence secure the relations of america with other countries because she will furnish to other nations such of her productions as they may require and as each country possesses some productions peculiar to itself the demand and advantage will be reciprocal the second cause which i have said must cooperate in producing an augmentation of wages in europe is emigration or the mere possibility of emigrating to america where labor is better paid it is easy to conceive that when this difference is generally known it will draw to the united states    many men who having no means of subsistence but their labor will flock to the place where this labor is best recompensed since the last peace the irish have been continually emigrating to america the reason of this is that in ireland wages are much less than in england and that the lower classes are consequently great sufferers germany has also furnished new citizens to the united states and all these laborers must by leaving europe have raised the price of work for those who remain this salutary effect will be produced even without emigration and will result from the mere possibility of emigrating at least in those states of europe whose inhabitants are not compelled to leave their own country by excessive taxation bad laws and the intolerance of government in order to raise the rate of wages it is enough that higher wages can be obtained in any place to which the workman who depends upon them can remove it has been wisely remarked in the discussions which have arisen upon the corntrade that the simple liberty of exporting grain would keep up and even raise its price without the actual exportation of a single bushel the case is the same with wages as european workmen can so easily remove to america to procure higher wages they will oblige those who purchase their labor to pay them more for it hence it follows that these two causes of the rise of wages actual emigration and the mere possibility of emigrating will concur to produce the same effect each acting at first in an inconsiderable degree there will be some emigration then wages will be    raised and the laborer finding his gains increase will no longer have a sufficiently powerful motive to emigrate but the rise of wages will not be equally felt by the different nations of europe it will be more or less considerable in proportion to the greater or less facilities for emigration which each affords england whose manners language and religion are the same with those of america must naturally enjoy this advantage in a higher degree than any other european state we may assert that she already owes much to america for her relations with that country the market which she has found there for her merchandise and which has raised the wages of the day laborers employed in her agriculture and manufactures are among the principal causes of her wealth and of the political influence we find her exerting but to say nothing of other advantages which may ultimately accrue from the rise of wages this augmentation has already produced one most valuable result in england it has ameliorated the condition of that class of men who live by the labor of their hands alone—that is the most numerous portion of society this class elsewhere reduced to the most scanty subsistence are much better off in england they there obtain by their labor the necessaries of life in greater abundance than in many other parts of europe and there can be no doubt that this springs from the influence of american commerce on the rate of wages i know it may be said that notwithstanding the    increase of labor and of subsistence in europe and notwithstanding the emigration which may take place the same causes which we have mentioned and which have reduced wages so low will continue to operate because they are inherent in the constitutions of european states whose defects will not be remedied by the liberty and prosperity of america perhaps it may be said also that the number of proprietors and capitalists a number very small compared with that of the men who having no landed property nor capital are compelled to live upon wages will remain the same because the causes which accumulate landed property and capital in their hands will not change and consequently that they will reduce or rather keep wages very low finally it may be said that the tyranny of the feudal laws the mode of taxation the excessive increase of the public revenue and the laws of commerce will always produce the same effect of diminishing wages and that should europe derive any real advantage in this respect from american independence it would not be permanent to these suggestions many things may be said in reply i will observe in the first place that if the governments of europe endeavor to counteract the salutary effects which the independence of america would naturally produce in respect to them it is not the less interesting to endeavor to ascertain what these effects would be better days may come when the true principles of the happiness of nations being better understood there will be some sovereign sufficiently enlightened and just to put them in    operation the causes which tend continually to accumulate and concentrate landed property and wealth in a few hands may be diminished the remains of the feudal system may be abolished or at least rendered less oppressive the mode of taxation may be changed and its excess moderated and lastly bad commercial regulations may be amended the tendency of all these improvements will be to enable the working classes to profit by the favorable change which the american revolution must naturally produce but admitting that all the causes which have just been mentioned should concur to keep the wages which the day laborer receives for his work in europe at a low rate they could however only weaken the influence exerted by the prosperity of america and not wholly destroy it if every thing else remained in the same state there would still be a greater consumption and consequently more labor to be performed now this consumption and labor continually increasing in the same ratio with the increase of population and wealth in the new world an augmentation of wages in europe will be the necessary result for the counteracting causes will not operate more powerfully than they now do     mdxxxiii observations on war by the original law of nations war and extirpation were the punishment of injury humanizing by degrees it admitted slavery instead of death a farther step was the exchange of prisoners instead of slavery another to respect more the property of    private persons under conquest and be content with acquired dominion why should not this law of nations go on improving ages have intervened between its several steps but as knowledge of late increases rapidly why should not those steps be quickened why should it not be agreed to as the future law of nations that in any war hereafter the following description of men should be undisturbed have the protection of both sides and be permitted to follow their employments in security viz   cultivators of the earth because they labor for the subsistence of mankind   fishermen for the same reason   merchants and traders in unarmed ships who accommodate different nations by communicating and exchanging the necessaries and conveniences of life   artists and mechanics inhabiting and working in open towns it is hardly necessary to add that the hospitals of enemies should be unmolested—they ought to be assisted it is for the interest of humanity in general that the occasions of war and the inducements to it should be diminished if rapine be abolished one of the encouragements to war is taken away and peace therefore more likely to continue and be lasting the practice of robbing merchants on the high seas—a remnant of the ancient piracy—though it may be accidentally beneficial to particular persons is far from being profitable to all engaged in it or to the nation that authorizes it in the beginning of a war some rich ships are surprised and taken this    encourages the first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels and many others to do the same but the enemy at the same time become more careful arm their merchantships better and render them not so easy to be taken they go also more under the protection of convoys thus while the privateers to take them are multiplied the vessels subject to be taken and the chances of profit are diminished so that many cruises are made wherein the expenses overgo the gains and as is the case in other lotteries though particulars have got prizes the mass of adventurers are losers the whole expense of fitting out all the privateers during a war being much greater than the whole amount of goods taken then there is the national loss of all the labor of so many men during the time they have been employed in robbing who besides spend what they get in riot drunkenness and debauchery lose their habits of industry are rarely fit for any sober business after a peace and serve only to increase the number of highwaymen and housebreakers even the undertakers who have been fortunate are by sudden wealth led into expensive living the habit of which continues when the means of supporting it cease and finally ruins them a just punishment for their having wantonly and unfeelingly ruined many honest innocent traders and their families whose substance was employed in serving the common interest of mankind    mdxxxiv the claims of the american loyalists an apologue lion king of a certain forest had among his subjects a body of faithful dogs in principle and affection strongly attached to his person and government and through whose assistance he had extended his dominions and had become the terror of his enemies lion however influenced by evil councellors took an aversion to the dogs condemned them unheard and ordered his tigers leopards and panthers to attack and destroy them the dogs petitioned humbly but their petitions were rejected haughtily and they were forced to defend themselves which they did with bravery a few among them of a mongrel race derived from a mixture with wolves and foxes corrupted by royal promises of great rewards deserted the honest dogs and joined their enemies the dogs were finally victorious a treaty of peace was made in which lion acknowledged them to be free and disclaimed all future authority over them the mongrels not being permitted to return among them claimed of the royalists the reward that had been promised a council of the beasts was held to consider their demand the wolves and the foxes agreed unanimously that the demand was just that royal promises ought to be    kept and that every loyal subject should contribute freely to enable his majesty to fulfil them the horse alone with a boldness and freedom that became the nobleness of his nature delivered a contrary opinion the king said he has been misled by bad ministers to war unjustly upon his faithful subjects royal promises when made to encourage us to act for the public good should indeed be honorably acquitted but if to encourage us to betray and destroy each other they are wicked and void from the beginning the advisers of such promises and those who murdered in consequence of them instead of being recompensed should be severely punished consider how greatly our common strength is already diminished by the loss of the dogs if you enable the king to reward these fratricides you will establish a precedent that may justify a future tyrant in making like promises and every example of such an unnatural brute rewarded will give them additional weight horses and bulls as well as dogs may thus be divided against their own kind and civil wars produced at pleasure till we are so weakened that neither liberty nor safety is any longer to be found in the forest and nothing remains but abject submission to the will of a despot who may devour us as he pleases the council had sense enough to resolve—that the demand be rejected  0 mdxxxv analysis

february      philadelphia alexander small mdxxxviii to alexander small philadelphia    february      dear friend— i have just received your kind letter of november   th and am much obliged by your friendly attention in sending me the receipt which on occasion i may make trial of but the stone i have being a large one as i find by the weight it falls with when i turn in bed i have no hope of its being dissoluble by any medicine and having been for some time past pretty free from pain i am afraid of tampering i congratulate you on the escape you had by avoiding the one you mention that was as big as a kidney bean had it been retained it might soon have become too large to pass and proved the cause of much pain at times as mine had been to me having served my time of three years as president i have now renounced all public business and enjoy the otium cum dignitate my friends indulge me with their frequent visits which i have now leisure    to receive and enjoy the philosophical society and the society for political inquiries meet at my house which i have enlarged by additional building that affords me a large room for those meetings another over it for my library now very considerable and over all some lodging rooms i have seven promising grandchildren by my daughter who play with and amuse me and she is a kind attentive nurse to me when i am at any time indisposed so that i pass my time as agreeably as at my age a man may well expect and have little to wish for except a more easy exit than my malady seems to threaten the deafness you complain of gives me concern as if great it must diminish considerably your pleasure in conversation if moderate you may remedy it easily and readily by putting your thumb and fingers behind your ear pressing it outwards and enlarging it as it were with the hollow of your hand by an exact experiment i found that i could hear the tick of a watch at fortyfive feet distance by this means which was barely audible at twenty feet without it the experiment was made at midnight when the house was still i am glad you have sent those directions respecting ventilation to the edinburgh society i hope you have added an account of the experience you had of it at minorca if they do not print your paper send it to me and it shall be in the third volume which we are about to publish of our transactions mrs hewson joins with us in best wishes for your health and happiness her eldest son has gone    through his studies at our college and taken his degree the youngest is still there and will be graduated this summer my grandson presents his respects and i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin p s—you never mention the receipt of any letters from me i wish to know if they come to hand particularly my last enclosing the apologue  you mention some of my old friends being dead but not their names benjamin franklin   march      philadelphia catherine greene mdxxxix to mrs catherine greene philadelphia   march      dear friend— having now done with public affairs which have hitherto taken up so much of my time i shall endeavor to enjoy during the small remainder of life that is left to me some of the pleasures of conversing with my old friends by writing since their distance prevents my hope of seeing them again i received one of the bags of sweet corn you were so good as to send me a long time since but the other never came to hand even the letter mentioning it though dated december  0      has been above a year on its way for i received it but about two weeks since from baltimore in maryland    the corn i did receive was excellent and gave me great pleasure accept my hearty thanks i am as you suppose in the abovementioned old letter much pleased to hear that my young friend ray is smart in the farming way and makes such substantial fences i think agriculture the most honorable of all employments being the most independent the farmer has no need of popular favor nor the favor of the great the success of his crops depending only on the blessing of god upon his honest industry i congratulate your good spouse that he as well as myself is now free from public cares and that he can bend his whole attention to his farming which will afford him both profit and pleasure a business which nobody knows better how to manage with advantage i am too old to follow printing again myself but loving the business i have brought up my grandson benjamin to it and have built and furnished a printinghouse for him which he now manages under my eye i have great pleasure in the rest of my grandchildren who are now in number eight and all promising the youngest only six months old but shows signs of great good nature my friends here are numerous and i enjoy as much of their conversation as i can reasonably wish and i have as much health and cheerfulness as can well be expected at my age now eightythree hitherto this long life has been tolerably happy so that if i were allowed to live it over again i should make no objection only wishing for leave to do what authors do in a second edition of their works correct some of my errata    among the felicities of my life i reckon your friendship which i shall remember with pleasure as long as that life lasts being ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin vaughan   march      london benjamin franklin mdxl from b vaughan london   march      my dearest sir— i am most peculiarly gratified by the contents of your last favor to me i am convinced that your life must be the most useful work the world ever saw as such i hope you will live to write it and i to read it if any letter of mine had a share in inducing you to go through it i hope it will be excepted from the request i have made you to burn my idle correspondence in that letter i shall have a real pride be it written in whatever style it may i hope that you will incorporate your art of virtue in your life that the world may read both works together i have presumed to communicate to your friends your design as expressed in your letter and those who know you as i do are just as anxious as i am to see the account you are to give of yourself among this number stands the bishop of st asaphs family who good man is no more he dined with me last winter and in every thing announced a decline of mental and bodily faculties though when i dined with and visited him afterwards  0 he a little rallied but matters had gone too far for his friends ever to hope a return of his usual state they say he died worth money upwards of £ 0000 which goes chiefly to the disposal of mrs shipley the dean inclined to contest a codicil which he wrote but did not sign but dr price tells me this will all be terminated by an amiable suit in chancery you ordered only ten of the senators remembrancers and i sent twelve my bill will be confined to this and you will thank sic me by lodging the money with my brother john whose receipt will be your discharge i have the plates in my possession having had them left in pawn for other small sums advanced to mrs stewart who is a very troublesome and abusive and i fear not very creditable woman we can have but one opinion about war or heresy i think the king of prussias works highly important to the world with respect to the first of these subjects i mean his posthumous works especially the first and fifth volumes the king of sweden unless he can bring the states now convened into good humor can only stir in proportion as he is subsidized and subsidies are not so common as they were when european states were richer thus there are some evils which check themselves the turks fell off at the end of the campaign from the usual retreat of many of their troops at that period i shall soon return my thanks to the rumsean society for their civilty to me mr rumsey is an    ingenious man with his thoughts bent to one object and i have little doubt of his accomplishing several considerable schemes if he has health and support being consulted about an encyclopedia i recommended the only complete one much regarded here it may be too expensive for your friend who i since find is mrs hewson but i should presume may be disposed of if not approved without loss your acquaintance here go on pretty much as usual as to home politics the king before his illness became popular from dislike to his sons m pitt from dislike to his opponents has regained popularity and mr fox has a sort of regard paid to him from dislike to mr sheridan this is not a promising state of things to us administration being now upon their guard will take care never to let the regency to slip out of their hands again these late struggles have unhappily shown however how little any of these people are capable of grand political ideas or plans they understand faction and even that often but ill but seem to know nothing of the new systems of general politics i wish your country may set them proper examples believe me ever my dear sir yours most affectionately gratefully and respectfully b vaughan benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia catherine louisa shipley mdxli to miss catherine louisa shipley philadelphia    april      it is only a few days since the kind letter of my dear young friend dated december   th came to    my hands i had before in the public papers met with the afflicting news that letter contained that excellent man has then left us his departure is a loss not to his family and friends only but to his nation and to the world for he was intent on doing good had wisdom to devise the means and talents to promote them his sermon before the society for propagating the gospel and his speech intended to have been spoken  are proofs of his ability as well as his humanity had his counsels in those pieces been attended to by the ministers how much bloodshed might have been prevented and how much expense and disgrace to the nation avoided your reflections on the constant calmness and composure attending his death are very sensible such instances seem to show that the good sometimes enjoy in dying a foretaste of the happy state they are about to enter according to the course of years i should have quitted this world long before him i shall however not be long in following i am now in my eightyfourth year and the last year has considerably enfeebled me so that i hardly expect to remain another you will then my dear friend consider this as probably the last line to be received from me and as a taking leave present my best and most sincere respects to your good mother and love to the rest of the family to whom i wish all happiness and believe me to be while i do live yours most affectionately b franklin    benjamin franklin    may      philadelphia charles carroll mdxlii to charles carroll  philadelphia    may      dear friend— i am glad to see by the papers that our grand machine has at length begun to work i pray god to bless and guide its operations if any form of government is capable of making a nation happy ours i think bids fair now for producing that effect but after all much depends upon the people who are to be governed we have been guarding against an evil that old states are most liable to excess of power in the rulers but our present danger seems to be defect of obedience in the subjects there is hope however from the enlightened state of this age and country we may guard effectually against that evil as well as the rest my grandson william temple franklin will have the honor of presenting this line he accompanied me to france and remained with me during my mission i beg leave to recommend him to your notice and that you would believe me my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    may      philadelphia richard price mdxliii to richard price philadelphia    may      my very dear friend— i received your kind letter enclosing one from miss kitty shipley    informing me of the good bishops decease which afflicted me greatly my friends drop off one after another when my age and infirmities prevent my making new ones and if i still retained the necessary activity and ability i hardly see among the existing generation where i could make them of equal goodness so that the longer i live i must expect to be the more wretched as we draw nearer the conclusion of life nature furnishes us with more helps to wean us from it among which one of the most powerful is the loss of such dear friends i send you with this the two volumes of our transactions as i forget whether you had the first before if you had you will please to give this to the french ambassador requesting his conveyance of it to the good duke de la rochefoucauld my best wishes attend you being ever with sincere and great esteem my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin mdxliv observations relative to the intentions of the original founders of the academy in philadelphia june      as the english school in the academy has been and still continues to be a subject of dispute and    discussion among the trustees since the restitution of the charter and it has been proposed that we should have some regard to the original intention of the founders in establishing that school i beg leave for your information to lay before you what i know of that matter originally and what i find on the minutes relating to it by which it will appear how far the design of that school has been adhered to or neglected having acquired some little reputation among my fellowcitizens by projecting the public library in      and obtaining the subscriptions by which it was established and by proposing and promoting with success sundry other schemes of utility in      i was encouraged to hazard another project that of a public education for our youth as in the scheme of the library i had provided only for english books so in this new scheme my ideas went no further than to procure the means of a good english education a number of my friends to whom i communicated the proposal concurred with me in these ideas but mr allen mr francis mr peters and some other persons of wealth and learning whose subscriptions and countenance we should need being of opinion that it ought to include the learned languages i submitted my judgment to theirs retaining however a strong prepossession in favor of my first plan and resolving to preserve as much of it as i could and to nourish the english school by every means in my power before i went about to procure subscriptions i thought it proper to prepare the minds of the people    by a pamphlet which i wrote and printed and distributed with my newspapers gratis the title was proposals relating to the education of youth in pennsylvania i happen to have preserved one of them and by reading a few passages it will appear how much the english learning was insisted upon in it and i had good reasons to know that this was a prevailing part of the motives for subscribing with most of the original benefactors  i met with but    few refusals in soliciting the subscriptions and the sum was the more considerable as i had put the contribution on this footing that it was not to be    immediate and the whole paid at once but in parts a fifth annually during five years to put the machine in motion twentyfour of the principal    subscribers agreed to take upon themselves the trust and a set of constitutions for their government and for the regulation of the schools were  0 drawn up by mr francis and myself which were signed by us all and printed that the public might know what was to be expected i wrote also a    paper entitled idea of an english school which was printed and afterwards annexed to mr peters sermon preached at the opening of the academy this paper was said to be for the consideration of the trustees and the expectation of the public that the idea might in a great measure be carried into execution contributed to render the subscriptions more liberal as well as more general i mention my concern in these transactions to show the opportunity i had of being well informed in the points i am relating these constitutions are upon record in your minutes    and although the latin and greek are by them to be taught the original idea of a complete english education was not forgotten as will appear by the following extracts page   the english tongue is to be taught grammatically and as a language page   in reciting the qualification of the person to be appointed rector it is said that great regard is to be had to his polite speaking writing and understanding the english tongue the rector was to have two hundred pounds a year for which he was to be obliged to teach twenty boys without any assistance and twentyfive more for every usher provided for him the latin and greek languages and at the same time instruct them in history geography chronology logic rhetoric and the english tongue the rector was also on all occasions consistent with his duty in the latin school to assist the english master in improving the youth under his care page   the trustees shall with all convenient speed contract with any person that offers whom they shall judge most capable of teaching the english tongue grammatically and as a language history geography chronology logic and oratory which person shall be styled the english master the english master was to have one hundred pounds a year for which he was to teach without any assistance forty scholars the english tongue grammatically and at the same time instruct them in history geography chronology logic and oratory    and sixty scholars more for every usher provided for him it is to be observed in this place that here are two distinct courses in the same study that is of the same branches of science viz history geography chronology logic and oratory to be carried on at the same time but not by the same tutor or master the english master is to teach his scholars all those branches of science and also the english tongue grammatically as a language the latin master is to teach the same sciences to his boys besides the greek and latin he was also to assist the english master occasionally without which and his general care in the government of the schools the giving him double salary seems not well accounted for but here are plainly two distinct schools or courses of education provided for the latin master was not to teach the english scholars logic rhetoric etc that was the duty of the english master but he was to teach those sciences to the latin scholars we shall see hereafter how easily this original plan was defeated and departed from when the constitution was first drawn blanks were left for the salaries and for the number of boys the latin master was to teach the first instance of partiality in favor of the latin part of the institution was in giving the title of rector to the latin master and no title to the english one but the most striking instance was when we met to sign and the blanks were first to be filled up the votes of a majority carried it to twice as much salary to the latin master as to the english and yet require twice    as much duty from the english master as from the latin viz £ 00 to the latin master to twenty boys £ 00 to the english master to teach forty however the trustees who voted these salaries being themselves by far the greatest subscribers though not the most numerous it was thought they had a kind of right to predominate in money matters and those who had wished an equal regard might have been shown to both schools submitted though not without regret and at times some little complaining which with their not being able in nine months to find a proper person for english master who would undertake the office for so low a salary induced the trustees at length viz in july    0 to offer £ 0 more another instance of the partiality above mentioned was in the march preceding when £ 00 sterling was voted to buy latin and greek books maps drafts and instruments for the use of the academy and nothing for the english books the great part of the subscribers who had the english education chiefly in view were however soothed into a submission to these partialities chiefly by the expectation given them by the constitution viz that the trustees would make it their pleasure and in some degree their business to visit the academy often to encourage and countenance the youth look on the students as in some measure their own children treat them with familiarity and affection and when they have behaved well gone through their studies and are to enter the world the trustees shall zealously unite and make all the    interest that can be made to promote and establish them whether in business offices marriages or any other thing for their advantage preferable to all other persons whatsoever even of equal merit these splendid promises dazzled the eyes of the public the trustees were most of them the principal gentlemen of the province children taught in other schools had no reason to expect such powerful patronage the subscribers had placed such entire confidence in them as to leave themselves no power of changing them if their conduct of the plan should be disapproved and so in hopes of the best all these partialities were submitted to near a year passed before a proper person was found to take charge of the english school at length mr dove who had been many years master of a school in england and had come hither with an apparatus for giving lectures in experimental philosophy was prevailed with by me after his lectures were finished to accept that employment for the salary offered though he thought it too scanty he had a good voice read perfectly well with proper accent and just pronunciation and his method of communicating habits of the same kind to his pupils was this when he gave a lesson to one of them he always first read it to him aloud with all the different modulations of voice that the subject and sense required these the scholars in study and repeating the lesson naturally endeavored to imitate and it was really surprising to see how soon they caught his manner which convinced me and others who frequently attended his school that though bad    tones and manners in reading are when once acquired rarely with difficulty if ever cured yet when none have been already formed good ones are as easily learned as bad in a few weeks after opening his school the trustees were invited to hear the scholars read and recite the parents and relations of the boys also attended the performers were surprisingly good and of course were admired and applauded and the english school thereby acquired such reputation that the number of mr doves scholars soon amounted to upwards of ninety which number did not diminish as long as he continued master viz upwards of two years but he finding the salary insufficient and having set up a school for girls in his own house to supply the deficiency and quitting the boys school somewhat before the hour to attend the girls the trustees disapproved of his so doing and he quitted their employment continued his girls school and opened one for boys on his own account the trustees provided another english master but though a good man yet not possessing the talents of an english schoolmaster in the same perfection with mr dove the school diminished daily and soon was found to have but about forty scholars left the performances of the boys in reading and speaking were no longer so brilliant the trustees of course had not the same pleasure in hearing them and the monthly visitations which had so long afforded a delightful entertainment to large audiences became less and less attended and at length discontinued and the english school has never since recovered its original reputation    thus by our injudiciously starving the english part of our scheme of education we only saved fifty pounds a year which was required as an additional salary to an acknowledged excellent english master which would have equalled his encouragement to that of the latin master i say by saving the £ 0 we lost fifty scholars which would have been £ 00 a year and defeated besides one great end of the institution in the meantime our favors were showered upon the latin part the number of teachers was increased and their salaries from time to time augmented till if i mistake not they amounted in the whole to more than £ 00 a year though the scholars hardly ever exceeded sixty so that each scholar cost the funds £ 0 per annum while he paid but £  which was a loss of £  every one of them the monthly visitations of the schools by the trustees having been long neglected the omission was complained of by the parents as a breach of original promise whereupon the trustees july         made it a law that they should meet on the second tuesday in every month at the academy to visit the schools examine the scholars hear their public exercises etc this good law however like many others was not long observed for i find by a minute of december         that the examination of the schools by the trustees had been long neglected and it was agreed that it should thereafter be done on the first monday in every month and yet notwithstanding this new rule the neglect returned so that we are informed by another minute    of january      that for five months past there had not been one meeting of the trustees in the course of fourteen years several of the original trustees who had been disposed to favor the english school deceased and others not so favorable were chosen to supply their places however it appears by the minutes that the remainder had sometimes weight enough to recall the attention of their colleagues to that school and obtain acknowledgments of the unjust neglect it had been treated with of this the following extracts from the minutes are authentic proofs viz minute book vol i february        the state of the english school was taken into consideration and it was observed that mr kinnersleys time was entirely taken up in teaching little boys the elements of the english language this is what it dwindled into a school similar to those kept by old women who teach children their letters and that speaking and rehearsing in public were totally disused to the great prejudice of the other scholars and students and contrary to the original design of the trustees in the forming of that school and as this was a matter of great importance it was particularly recommended to be fully considered by the trustees at their next meeting at their next meeting it was not considered but this minute contains full proof of the fact that the english education had been neglected and it contains an acknowledgment that the conduct of the english school was contrary to the original design of the trustees in forming it in the same book of minutes we find the following    of april         the state of the english school was again taken into consideration and it was the opinion of the trustees that the original design should be prosecuted of teaching the scholars of that and the other schools the elegance of the english language and giving them a proper pronunciation and that the old method of hearing them read and repeat in public should be again used and a committee was appointed to confer with mr kinnersley how this might best be done as well as what assistance would be necessary to give mr kinnersley to enable him to attend this necessary service which was indeed the proper business of his professorship in this minute we have another acknowledgment of what was the original design of the english school but here are some words thrown in to countenance an innovation which had been for some time practised the words are and the other schools originally by the constitutions the rector was to teach the latin scholars their english the words of the constitution are the rector shall be obliged without the assistance of any usher to teach twenty scholars the latin and greek languages and the english tongue to enable him to do this we have seen that some of his qualifications indispensably required were his polite speaking writing and understanding the english tongue having these he was enjoined on all occasions consistent with his other duties to assist the english master in improving the boys under his care but there is not a word obliging the english master to teach the latin boys english  0 however the latin masters either unable to do it or unwilling to take the trouble had got him up among them and employed so much of his time that this minute owns he could not without further assistance attend the necessary service of his own school which as the minute expressly says was indeed the proper business of his professorship notwithstanding this good resolution of the trustees it seems the execution of it was neglected and the public not being satisfied they were again haunted by the friends of the children with the old complaint that the original constitutions were not complied with in regard to the english school their situation was unpleasant on the one hand there were still remaining some of the first trustees who were friends to the scheme of english education and these would now and then be remarking that it was neglected and would be moving for a reformation the constitutions at the same time staring the trustees in the face gave weight to these remarks on the other hand the latinists were combined to decry the english school as useless it was without example they said as indeed they still say that a school for teaching the vulgar tongue and the sciences in that tongue was ever joined with a college and that the latin masters were fully competent to teach the english i will not say that the latinists looked on every expense upon the english school as so far disabling the trustees from augmenting their salaries and therefore regarding it with an evil eye but when i find the minutes constantly filled with their applications    for higher wages i cannot but see their great regard for money matters and suspect a little their using their interest and influence to prevail with the trustees not to encourage that school and indeed the following minute is so different in spirit and sentiment from all that last recited that one cannot avoid concluding that some extraordinary pains must have been taken with the trustees between the two meetings of april   th and june   th to produce a resolution so very different which here follows in this minute viz june         some of the parents of the children in the academy having complained that their children were not taught to speak and read in public and having requested that this useful part of education might be more attended to mr kinnersley was called in and desired to give an account of what was done in this branch of his duty and he declared that this was well taught not only in the english school which was more immediately under his care but in the philosophy classes regularly every monday afternoon and as often at other times as his other business would permit and it not appearing to the trustees that any more could at present be done without partiality and great inconvenience and that this was all that was ever proposed to be done they did not incline to make any alteration or to lay any further burthen on mr kinnersley note here that the english school had not for some years preceding been visited by the trustees if it had they would have known the state of it without making this inquiry of the master they might have judged whether the children more immediately    under his care were in truth well taught without taking his word for it as it appears they did but it seems he had a merit which when he pleaded it effectually excused him he spent his time when out of the english school in instructing the philosophy classes who were of the latin part of the institution therefore they did not think proper to lay any further burthen upon him it is a little difficult to conceive how these trustees could bring themselves to declare that no more could be done in the english school than was then done and that it was all that was ever proposed to be done when their preceding minute declares that the original design was teaching scholars the elegance of the english language and giving them a proper pronunciation and that hearing them read and repeat in public was the old method and should be again used and certainly the method that had been used might be again used if the trustees had thought fit to order mr kinnersley to attend his own school and not spend his time in the philosophy classes where his duty did not require his attendance what the apprehended partiality was which the minute mentions does not appear and cannot now be easily imagined and the great inconvenience of obliging him to attend his own school could only be by depriving the latinists of his assistance to which they had no right the trustees may possibly have supposed that by this resolution they had precluded all future attempts to trouble them with respect to their conduct of the english school the parents indeed despairing of    any reformation withdrew their children and placed them in private schools of which several now appeared in the city professing to teach what had been promised to be taught in the academy and they have since flourished and increased by the scholars the academy might have had if it had performed its engagements but the public was not satisfied and we find five years after the english school appearing again after five years silence haunting the trustees like an evil conscience and reminding them of their failure in duty for of their meetings jan    and         we find these minutes jan         it having been remarked that the schools suffer in the public esteem by the discontinuance of public speaking a special meeting is to be called on tuesday next to consider the state of the english school and to regulate such matters as may be necessary jan   th a special meeting it is agreed to give mr jon easton and mr thomas hall at the rate of twentyfive pounds per annum each for assisting mr kinnersley in the english school and taking care of the same when he shall be employed in teaching the students in the philosophy classes and grammar school the art of public speaking a committee mr peters mr coxe and mr duché with the masters was appointed to fix rules and times for employing the youth in public speaking mr easton and mr hall are to be paid out of a fund to be raised by some public performance for the benefit of the college it appears from these minutes   that the reputation of the academy had suffered in the public    esteem by the trustees neglect of that school   that mr kinnersley whose sole business it was to attend it had been called from his duty and employed in the philosophy classes and latin grammar school teaching the scholars there the art of public speaking which the latinists used to boast they could teach themselves   that the neglect for so many years of the english scholars by this subtraction of their master was now acknowledged and proposed to be remedied for the future by engaging two persons mr hall and mr easton at twentyfive pounds per annum to take care of those scholars while mr kinnersley was employed among the latinists care was however taken by the trustees not to be at any expense for this assistance to mr kinnersley for hall and easton were only to be paid out of the uncertain fund of money to be raised by some public performance for the benefit of the college a committee was however now appointed to fix rules and times for employing the youth in public speaking whether any thing was done in consequence of these minutes does not appear no report of the committee respecting their doings being to be found on the records and the probability is that they did as heretofore nothing to the purpose for the english school continued to decline and the first subsequent mention we find made of it is in the minute of march         when the design began to be entertained of abolishing it altogether whereby the latinists would get rid of an eyesore and the trustees of what occasioned them such frequent    trouble the minute is this the state of the english school is to be taken into consideration at next meeting and whether it be proper to continue it on its present footing or not this consideration was however not taken at the next meeting at least nothing was concluded so as to be minuted nor do we find any further mention of the english school till the   th of july when the following minute was entered—viz a special meeting is appointed to be held on monday next and notice to be given that the design of this meeting is to consider whether the english school is to be longer continued this special meeting was accordingly held on the   d of july      of which date is the following minute and resolution viz the trustees at this meeting as well as several former ones having taken into their serious consideration the state of the english school are unanimously of opinion that as the said school is far from defraying the expense at which they now support it and not thinking that they ought to lay out any great part of the funds intrusted to them on this branch of education which can so easily be procured at other schools in this city have resolved that from and after the   th of october next mr kinnersleys present salary do cease and that from that time the said school if he shall be inclined to keep it shall be on the following footing viz that he shall have the free use of the room where he now teaches and also the whole tuitionmoney arising from the boys that may be taught by him and that he continue professor of english and    oratory and as such have the house he lives in rent free in consideration of his giving two afternoons in the week as heretofore for the instruction of the students belonging to the college in public speaking agreeable to such rules as are or shall be made for that purpose by the trustees and faculty it is further ordered by this regulation that the boys belonging to his school shall be still considered as part of the youth belonging to the college and under the same general government of the trustees and faculty and such of his scholars as may attend the mathematical or any other master having a salary from the college for any part of their time shall pay proportionably into the fund of the trustees to be accounted for by mr kinnersley and deducted out of the twenty pounds per quarter now paid by the english scholars the trustees hope this regulation may be agreeable to mr kinnersley as it proceeds entirely from the reasons set forth above and not from any abatement of that esteem which they have always retained for him during the whole course of his services in college upon this and some of the preceding minutes may be observed   that the english school having been long neglected the scholars were so diminished in number as to be far from defraying the expense in supporting it   that the instruction they received there instead of a complete english education which had been promised to the subscribers by the original constitutions were only such as might easily be procured at other schools in this city   that this unprofitableness of the english school    owing to neglect of duty in the trustees was now offered as a reason for demolishing it altogether for it was easy to see that after depriving the master of his salary he could not long afford to continue it   that if the insufficiency of the tuition money in the english school to pay the expense and the ease with which the scholars might obtain equal instruction in other schools were good reasons for depriving the master of his salary and destroying that school they were equally good for dismissing the latin masters and sending their scholars to other schools since it is notorious that the tuition money of the latin school did not pay much above a fourth part of the salaries of the masters for such reasons the trustees might equally well have got rid of all the scholars and all the masters and remained in full possession of all the college property without any future expense   that by their refusing any longer to support instead of reforming as they ought to have done the english school they shamefully broke through and set at nought the original constitutions for the due execution of which the faith of the original trustees had been solemnly pledged to the public and diverted the revenues proceeding from much of the first subscriptions to other purposes than those which had been promised had the assembly when disposed to disfranchize the trustees set their foot upon this ground their proceeding to declare the forfeiture would have been more justifiable and it may be hoped care will now be taken not to give any future assembly the same handle    it seems however that this unrighteous resolve did not pass the trustees without a qualm in some of them for at the next meeting a reconsideration was moved and we find the following minute under the date of august        the minute of last meeting relative to the english school was read and after mature deliberation and reconsidering the same it was voted to stand as it is provided it should not be found any way repugnant to the first charter granted to the academy a copy of which was ordered to be procured out of the rolls office one might have thought it natural for the trustees to have consulted this charter before they took the resolution and not only the first charter but the original constitutions but as it seems they had lost the instrument containing the charter and though it had been printed not one of them was furnished with a copy to which he might refer it is no wonder that they had forgot the constitutions made twenty years before to which they do not seem to have in the least adverted probably however the trustees found when they came to examine original papers that they could not easily get entirely rid of the english school and so concluded to continue it for i find in a law for premiums minuted under the date of january       0 that the english and mathematical school is directed to be examined the third tuesday in july and a premium book of the value of one dollar was to be given to him that reads best and understands best the english grammar etc this is very well but to keep up the old partiality in favor of the latin    school the premium to its boys was to be of the value of two dollars in the premiums for best speaking they were indeed put upon an equality after reading this law for premiums i looked forward to the third tuesday in july with some pleasing expectation of their effect on the examination required for that day but i met with only this further record of the inattention of the trustees to their new resolutions and even laws when they contained any thing favorable to the english school the minute is only this july august september october no business done on the  0th of november however i find there was an examination of the latin school and premiums with pompous inscriptions afterwards adjudged to latin scholars but i find no mention of any to the english or that they were even examined perhaps there might have been none to examine or the school discontinued for it appears by a minute of july   st following that the provost was desired to advertise for a master able to teach english grammatically which it seems was all the english master was now required to teach the other branches originally promised being dropped entirely in october      mr kinnersley resigned his professorship when dr peters and others were appointed to consider on what footing the english school shall be put for the future that a new master may be thought of and mr willing to take care of the school for the present at fifty pounds per annum it is observable here that there is no mention of putting it on its original footing and the salary is  00 shrunk amazingly but this resignation of mr kinnersley gave occasion to one testimony of the utility of the english professor to the institution notwithstanding all the partiality neglect slights discouragements and injustice that school had suffered we find it in the minutes of a special meeting on the  d of february      present dr peters mr chew mr lawrence mr willing mr trettel and mr inglis and expressed in these strong terms the college suffers greatly since mr kinnersley left it for want of a person to teach public speaking so that the present classes have not those opportunities of learning to declaim and speak which have been of so much use to their predecessors and have contributed greatly to raise the credit of the institution here is another confession that the latinists were unequal to the task of teaching english eloquence though on occasion the contrary is still asserted i flatter myself gentlemen that it appears by this time pretty clearly from our own minutes that the original plan of the english school has been departed from that the subscribers to it have been disappointed and deceived and the faith in the trustees not kept with them that the public have been frequently dissatisfied with the conduct of the trustees and complained of it and by the niggardly treatment of good masters they have been driven out of the school and the scholars have followed while a great loss of revenue has been suffered by the academy so that the numerous schools now in the city owe their rise to our mismanagement and that  0  we might as well have had the best part of the tuitionmoney paid into our treasury that now goes into private pockets that there has been a constant disposition to depress the english school in favor of the latin and that every means to procure a more equitable treatment has been rendered ineffectual so that no more hope remains while they continue to have any connection it is therefore that wishing as much good to the latinists as their system can honestly procure for them we now demand a separation and without desiring to injure them but claiming an equitable partition of our joint stock we wish to execute the plan they have so long defeated and afford the public the means of a complete english education i am the only one of the original trustees now living and i am just stepping into the grave myself i am afraid that some part of the blame incurred by the trustees may be laid on me for having too easily submitted to the deviations from the constitution and not opposing them with sufficient zeal and earnestness though indeed my absence in foreign countries at different times for near thirty years tended much to weaken my influence to make what amends are yet in my power i seize this opportunity the last i may possibly have of bearing testimony against those deviations i seem here to be surrounded by the ghosts of my dear departed friends beckoning and urging me to use the only tongue now left us in demanding that justice to our grandchildren that to our children has been denied and i hope they will not be sent away discontented  0  the origin of latin and greek schools among the different nations of europe is known to have been this that until between three and four hundred years past there were no books in any other language all the knowledge then contained in books viz the theology the jurisprudence the physic the artmilitary the politics the mathematics and mechanics the natural and moral philosophy the logic and rhetoric the chemistry the pharmacy the architecture and every other branch of science being in those languages it was of course necessary to learn them as the gates through which men must pass to get at that knowledge the books then existing were manuscript and these consequently so dear that only the few wealthy inclined to learning could afford to purchase them the common people were not even at the pains of learning to read because after taking that pains they would have nothing to read that they could understand without learning the ancients languages nor then without money to purchase the manuscripts and so few were the learned readers sixty years after the invention of printing that it appears by letters still extant between the printers in      that they could not throughout europe find purchasers for more than three hundred copies of any ancient authors but printing beginning now to make books cheap the readers increased so much as to make it worth while to write and print books in the vulgar tongues at first these were chiefly books of devotion and little histories gradually several branches of science began to appear in the  0  common languages and at this day the whole body of science consisting not only of translations from all the valuable ancients but of all the new modern discoveries is to be met with in those languages so that learning the ancient for the purpose of acquiring knowledge is become absolutely unnecessary but there is in mankind an unaccountable prejudice in favor of ancient customs and habitudes which inclines to a continuance of them after the circumstances which formerly made them useful cease to exist a multitude of instances might be given but it may suffice to mention one hats were once thought a useful part of dress they kept the head warm and screened it from the violent impression of the suns rays and from the rain snow hail etc though by the way this was not the more ancient opinion or practice for among all the remains of antiquity the bustos statues bassorelievos medals etc which are infinite there is no representation of a human figure with a cap or hat on nor any covering for the head unless it be the head of a soldier who has a helmet but that is evidently not a part of dress for health but as a protection from the strokes of a weapon at what time hats were first introduced we know not but in the last century they were universally worn throughout europe gradually however as the wearing of wigs and hair nicely dressed prevailed the putting on of hats was disused by genteel people lest the curious arrangements of the curls and powdering should be disordered and umbrellas began to supply their place yet still our considering  0  the hat as a part of dress continues so far to prevail that a man of fashion is not thought dressed without having one or something like one about him which he carries under his arm so that there are a multitude of the politer people in all the courts and capital cities of europe who have never nor their fathers before worn a hat otherwise than as a chapeau bras though the utility of such a mode of wearing it is by no means apparent and it is attended not only with some expense but with a degree of constant trouble the still prevailing custom of having schools for teaching generally our children in these days the latin and greek languages i consider therefore in no other light than as the chapeau bras of modern literature thus the time spent in that study might it seems be much better employed in the education for such a country as ours and this was indeed the opinion of most of the original trustees benjamin franklin   june      philadelphia benjamin vaughan mdxlv to benjamin vaughan philadelphia   june      my dearest friend— i received your kind letter of march  th and wish i may be able to complete what you so earnestly desire the memoirs of my life but of late i am so interrupted by extreme pain which obliges me to have recourse to opium that between the effects of both i have but little  0  time in which i can write any thing my grandson however is copying what is done which will be sent to you for your opinion by the next vessel and not merely for your opinion but for your advice for i find it a difficult task to speak decently and properly of ones own conduct and i feel the want of a judicious friend to encourage me in scratching out i have condoled sincerely with the bishop of st asaphs family he was an excellent man losing our friends thus one by one is the tax we pay for long living and it is indeed a heavy one i have not seen the king of prussias posthumous works what you mention makes me desirous to have them please to mention it to your brother william and that i request him to add them to the books i have desired him to buy for me our new government is now in train and seems to promise well but events are in the hand of god i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin mdxlvi hints for consideration respecting the orphan schoolhouse in philadelphia charitable institutions however originally well intended and well executed at first for many years are subject to be in course of time corrupted mismanaged their funds misapplied or perverted to private purposes would it not be well to guard against  0  these by prudent regulations respecting the choice of managers and establishing the power of inspecting their conduct in some permanent body as the monthly or quarterly meeting would it not be more respectable for the institution if the appearance of making a profit of the labor of orphans were avoided and the dependence for funds to be wholly on charitable contributions if this should be concluded then it may be proper to open an account with each orphan on admission the orphans to have credit for any subsistence brought in with them and for the profit made of it and of their labor and made debtors for their maintenance and education and at their discharge on coming of age to be paid the balance if any in their favor or remain debtors for the balance if against them which they may be exhorted to pay if ever able but not to be compelled such as receive a balance may be exhorted to give back a part in charity to the institution that has taken such kind care of them or at least to remember it favorably if hereafter god should bless them with ability either in benefaction while living or a legacy on decease the orphans when discharged to receive besides decent clothing and some money a certificate of their good behavior if such it has been as a recommendation and the managers of the institution should still consider them as their children so far as to counsel them in their affairs encourage and promote them in their business watch over and kindly admonish them when in danger of misconduct  0  mdxlvii contemplated restraint upon emigration there are i understand some apprehensions that your ministers may procure a law to restrain the emigration of manufacturers but i think that weak and wicked as they are and tyrannical as they are disposed to be they will hardly venture upon an act that shall make a prison of england to confine men for no other crime but that of being useful and industrious and to discourage the learning of useful mechanic arts by declaring that as soon as a man is master of his business he shall lose his liberty and become a prisoner for life while they suffer their idle and extravagant gentry to travel and reside abroad at their pleasure spending the incomes of their estates racked from the laborious honest tenants in foreign follies and among french and italian whores and fiddlers such a law would be too glaringly unjust to be borne with i wish you success in what you may resolve to undertake and you will find me ever your assured friend and humble servant b franklin mdxlviii wail of a protected manufacturer messrs— i am a manufacturer and was a petitioner for the act to encourage and protect the manufacturers of this state i was very happy when  0  the act was obtained and i immediately added to the price of my manufactures as much as it would bear so as to be a little cheaper than the same articleimported and paying the duty by this addition i hoped to grow richer but as every other manufacturer whose wares are under the protection of that act has done the same i begin to doubt whether considering the whole years expenses of my family with all these separate additions which i pay to other manufacturers i am at all a gainer and i confess i cannot but wish that except the protecting duty on my own manufacture all duties of the kind were taken off and abolished this however i must submit to the better judgment of our legislators yours etc q mdxlix on sending felons to america  sir— we may all remember the time when our mother country as a mark of her parental tenderness emptied her gaols into our habitations for the better peopling as she expressed it of the colonies it is certain that no due returns have yet been made for these valuable consignments we are therefore much in her debt on that account and as she is of late clamorous for the payment of all we owe her and some of our debts are of a kind not so easily discharged i am for doing however what is in  0  our power it will show our goodwill as to the rest the felons she planted among us have produced such an amazing increase that we are now enabled to make ample remittance in the same commodity and since the wheelbarrow law is not found effectually to reform them and many of our vessels are idle through her restraints on our trade why should we not employ those vessels in transporting the felons to britain i was led into this thought by perusing the copy of a petition to parliament which fell lately by accident into my hands it has no date but i conjecture from some circumstances that it must have been about the year      or      it seems if presented it had no effect since the act passed i imagine it may not be unacceptable to your readers and therefore transcribe it for your paper viz benjamin franklin to the honorable the knights citizens and burgesses of great britain in parliament assembled the petition of b f agent for the province of pennsylvania most humbly showeth that the transporting of felons from england to the plantations in america is and hath long been a great grievance to the said plantations in general that the said felons being landed in america not only continue their evil practices to the annoyance of his majestys good subjects there but contribute greatly to corrupt the morals of the servants and poorer people among whom they are mixed that many of the said felons escape from the   0 servitude to which they were destined into other colonies where their condition is not known and wandering at large from one populous town to another commit many burglaries robberies and murders to the great terror of the people and occasioning heavy charges for apprehending and securing such felons and bringing them to justice that your petitioner humbly conceives the easing one part of the british dominions of their felons by burthening another part with the same felons cannot increase the common happiness of his majestys subjects and that therefore the trouble and expense of transporting them is upon the whole altogether useless that your petitioner nevertheless observes with extreme concern in the votes of friday last that leave is given to bring in a bill for extending to scotland the act made in the fourth year of the reign of king george the first whereby the aforesaid grievances are as he understands to be greatly increased by allowing scotland also to transport its felons to america your petitioner therefore humbly prays in behalf of pennsylvania and the other plantations in america that the house would take the premises into consideration and in their great wisdom and goodness repeal all acts and clauses of acts for transporting of felons or if this may not at present be done that they would at least reject the proposed bill for extending the said acts to scotland or if it be thought fit to allow of such extension that then the said extension may be carried further and the     plantations be also by an equitable clause in the same bill permitted to transport their felons to scotland and your petitioner as in duty bound shall pray etc the petition i am informed was not received by the house and the act passed on second thoughts i am of opinion that besides employing our own vessels as above proposed every english ship arriving in our ports with goods for sale should be obliged to give bond before she is permitted to trade engaging that she will carry back to britain at least one felon for every fifty tons of her burthen thus we shall not only discharge sooner our debts but furnish our old friends with the means of better peopling and with more expedition their promising new colony of botany bay i am yours etc a z mdl the retort courteous john oxly pawnbroker of bethnal green was indicted for assaulting jonathan boldsworth on the highway putting him in fear and taking

prosecutor for the debt on his note of hand he was found guilty death—old bailey sessions paper      i chose the above extract from the proceedings of the old bailey in the trial of criminals as a motto or text on which to amplify in my ensuing discourse but on second thoughts having given it forth i shall after the example of some other preachers quit it for the present and leave my readers if i should happen to have any the task of discovering what relation there may possibly be between my text and my sermon during some years past the british newspapers have been filled with reflections on the inhabitants of america for not paying their old debts to english merchants and from these papers the same reflections have been translated into foreign prints and circulated throughout europe whereby the american character respecting honor probity and justice in commercial transactions is made to suffer in the opinion of strangers which may be attended with pernicious consequences at length we are told that the british court has taken up the complaint and seriously offered it as a reason for refusing to evacuate the frontier posts according to treaty this gives a kind of authority to the charge and makes it now more necessary to examine     the matter thoroughly to inquire impartially into the conduct of both nations take blame to ourselves where we have merited it and where it may be fairly done mitigate the severity of the censures that are so liberally bestowed upon us we may begin by observing that before the war our mercantile character was good in proof of this and a stronger proof can hardly be desired the votes of the house of commons in       have recorded a petition signed by the body of the merchants of london trading to north america in which they expressly set forth not only that the trade was profitable to the kingdom but that the remittances and payments were as punctually and faithfully made as in any other branch of commerce whatever these gentlemen were certainly competent judges and as to that point could have no interest in deceiving the government the making of these punctual remittances was however a difficulty britain acting on the selfish and perhaps mistaken principle of receiving nothing from abroad that could be produced at home would take no articles of our produce that interfered with any of her own and what did not interfere she loaded with heavy duties we had no mines of gold or silver we were therefore obliged to run the world over in search of something that would be received in england we sent our provisions and lumber to the west indies where exchange was made for sugars cotton etc to remit we brought molasses from thence distilled it into rum with which we traded in africa and remitted the gold     dust to england we employed ourselves in the fisheries and sent the fish we caught together with quantities of wheat flour and rice to spain and portugal from whence the amount was remitted to england in cash or bills of exchange great quantities of our rice too went to holland hamburg etc and the value of that was also sent to britain add to this that contenting ourselves with paper all the hard money we could possibly pick up among the foreign west india islands was continually sent off to britain not a ship going thither from america without some chests of those precious metals imagine this great machine of mutually advantageous commerce going roundly on in full train our ports all busy receiving and selling british manufactures and equipping ships for the circuitous trade that was finally to procure the necessary remittances the seas covered with those ships and with several hundred sail of our fishermen all working for britain and then let us consider what effect the conduct of britain in      and      and the following years must naturally have on the future ability of our merchants to make the payments in question we will not here enter into the motives of that conduct they are well enough known and not to her honor the first step was shutting up the port of boston by an act of parliament the next to prohibit by another the new england fishery an army and a fleet were sent to enforce these acts here was a stop put at once to all the mercantile operations of one of the greatest trading cities of     america the fishing vessels all laid up and the usual remittances by way of spain portugal and the straits rendered impossible yet the cry was now begun against us these new england people do not pay their debts the ships of the fleet employed themselves in cruising separately all along the coast the marine gentry are seldom so well contented with their pay as not to like a little plunder they stopped and seized under slight pretences the american vessels they met with belonging to whatever colony this checked the commerce of them all ships loaded with cargoes destined either directly or indirectly to make remittance in england were not spared if the differences between the two countries had been then accommodated these unauthorized plunderers would have been called to account and many of their exploits must have been found piracy but what cured all this set their minds at ease made short work and gave full scope to their piratical disposition was another act of parliament forbidding any inquisition into those past facts declaring them all lawful and all american property to be forfeited whether on sea or land and authorizing the kings british subjects to take seize sink burn or destroy whatever they could find of it the property suddenly and by surprise taken from our merchants by the operation of this act is incomputable and yet the cry did not diminish these americans dont pay their debts had the several states of america on the publication of this act seized all british property in their     power whether consisting of lands in their country ships in their harbors or debts in the hands of their merchants by way of retaliation it is probable a great part of the world would have deemed such conduct justifiable they it seems thought otherwise and it was done only in one or two states and that under particular circumstances of provocation and not having thus abolished all demands the cry subsists that the americans should pay their debts general gage being with his army before the declaration of open war in peaceable possession of boston shut its gates and placed guards all around to prevent its communication with the country the inhabitants were on the point of starving the general though they were evidently at his mercy fearing that while they had any arms in their hands frantic desperation might possibly do him some mischief proposed to them a capitulation in which he stipulated that if they would deliver up their arms they might leave the town with their family and goods in faith of this agreement they delivered their arms but when they began to pack up for their departure they were informed that by the word goods the general understood only household goods that is their beds chairs and tables not merchant goods those he was informed they were indebted for to the merchants of england and he must secure them for the creditors they were accordingly all seized to an immense value what had been paid for not excepted it is to be supposed though we have never heard of it that this very honorable general when he returned home made a just distribution of     those goods or their value among the said creditors but the cry nevertheless continued these boston people do not pay their debts the army having thus ruined boston proceeded to different parts of the continent they got possession of all the capital trading towns the troops gorged themselves with plunder they stopped all the trade of philadelphia for near a year of rhode island longer of new york near eight years of charleston in south carolina and savannah in georgia i forget how long this continued interruption of their commerce ruined many merchants the army also burnt to the ground the fine towns of falmouth and charlestown near boston new london fairfield norwalk esopus norfolk the chief trading town in virginia besides innumerable tenements and private farmhouses this wanton destruction of property operated doubly to the disabling of our merchants who were importers from britain in making their payments by the immoderate loss they sustained themselves and also the loss suffered by their country debtors who had bought of them the british goods and who were now rendered unable to pay the debts to britain of course remained undischarged and the clamor continued these knavish americans will not pay us many of the british debts particularly in virginia and the carolinas arose from the sales made of negroes in those provinces by the british guinea merchants these with all before in the country were employed when the war came on in raising tobacco and rice for remittance in payment of british     debts an order arrives from england advised by one of their most celebrated moralists dr johnson in his taxation no tyranny to excite these slaves to rise cut the throats of their purchasers and resort to the british army where they should be rewarded with freedom this was done and the planters were thus deprived of near thirty thousand of their working people yet the demand for those sold and unpaid still exists and the cry continues against the virginians and carolinians that they do not pay their debts virginia suffered great loss in this kind of property by another ingenious and humane british invention having the smallpox in their army while in that country they inoculated some of the negroes they took as prisoners belonging to a number of plantations and then let them escape or sent them covered with the pock to mix with and spread the distemper among the others of their color as well as among the white country people which occasioned a great mortality of both and certainly did not contribute to the enabling debtors in making payment the war too having put a stop to the exportation of tobacco there was a great accumulation of several years produce in all the public inspecting warehouses and private stores of the planters arnold phillips and cornwallis with british troops then entered and overran the country burnt all the inspecting and other stores of tobacco to the amount of some hundred shiploads all of which might on the return of peace if it had not been thus wantonly destroyed have been remitted to british creditors     but these d—d virginians why dont they pay their debts paper money was in those times our universal currency but it being the instrument with which we combated our enemies they resolved to deprive us of its use by depreciating it and the most effectual means they could contrive was to counterfeit it the artists they employed performed so well that immense quantities of these counterfeits which issued from the british government in new york were circulated among the inhabitants of all the states before the fraud was detected this operated considerably in depreciating the whole mass first by the vast additional quantity and next by the uncertainty in distinguishing the true from the false and the depreciation was a loss to all and the ruin of many it is true our enemies gained a vast deal of our property by the operation but it did not go into the hands of our particular creditors so their demands still subsisted and we were still abused for not paying our debts by the seventh article of the treaty of peace it was solemnly stipulated that the kings troops in evacuating their posts in the united states should not carry away with them any negroes in direct violation of this article general carleton in evacuating new york carried off all the negroes that were with his army to the amount of several hundreds it is not doubted that he must have had secret orders to justify him in this transaction but the reason given out was that as they had quitted their masters and joined the kings troops on the faith of proclamations   0 promising them their liberty the national honor forbade returning them into slavery the national honor was it seemed pledged to both parts of a contradiction and its wisdom since it could not do it with both chose to keep faith rather with its old black than its new white friends a circumstance demonstrating clear as daylight that in making a present peace they meditated a future war and hoped that though the promised manumission of slaves had not been effectual in the last in the next it might be more successful and that had the negroes been forsaken no aid could be hereafter expected from those of the color in a future invasion the treaty however with us was thus broken almost as soon as made and this by the people who charge us with breaking it by not paying perhaps for some of the very negroes carried off in defiance of it why should england observe treaties when these americans do not pay their debts unreasonable however as this clamor appears in general i do not pretend by exposing it to justify those debtors who are still able to pay and refuse it on pretence of injuries suffered by the war public injuries can never discharge private obligations contracts between merchant and merchant should be sacredly observed where the ability remains whatever may be the madness of ministers it is therefore to be hoped the fourth article of the treaty of peace which stipulates that no legal obstruction shall be given to the payment of debts contracted before the war will be punctually carried into execution and that every law in every state which impedes it may     be immediately repealed those laws were indeed made with honest intentions that the halfruined debtor not being too suddenly pressed by some might have time to arrange and recover his affairs so as to do justice to all his creditors but since the intention in making those acts has been misapprehended and the acts wilfully misconstrued into a design of defrauding them and now made a matter of reproach to us i think it will be right to repeal them all individual americans may be ruined but the country will save by the operation since these unthinking merciless creditors must be contented with all that is to be had instead of all that may be due to them and the accounts will be settled by insolvency when all have paid that can pay i think the remaining british creditors who suffered by the inability of their ruined debtors have some right to call upon their own government which by its bad projects has ruined those debtors for a compensation a sum given by parliament for this purpose would be more properly disposed than in rewarding pretended loyalists who fomented the war and the heavier the sum the more tendency it might have to discourage such destructive projects hereafter among the merchants of britain trading formerly to america there are to my knowledge many considerate and generous men who never joined in this clamor and who on the return of peace though by the treaty entitled to an immediate suit for their debts were kindly disposed to give their debtors reasonable time for restoring their circumstances     so as to be able to make payment conveniently these deserve the most grateful acknowledgments and indeed it was in their favor and perhaps for their sakes in favor of all other british creditors that the law of pennsylvania though since much exclaimed against was made restraining the recovery of old debts during a certain time for this restraint was general respecting domestic as well as british debts it being thought unfair in cases where there was not sufficient for all that the inhabitants taking advantage of their nearer situation should swallow the whole excluding foreign creditors from any share and in cases where the favorable part of the foreign creditors were disposed to give time with the views abovementioned if others less humane and considerate were allowed to bring immediate suits and ruin the debtor those views would be defeated when this law expired in september      a new one was made continuing for some time longer the restraint with respect to domestic debts but expressly taking it away where the debt was due from citizens of the state to any of the subjects of great britain  which shows     clearly the disposition of the assembly and that the fair intentions above ascribed to them in making the former act are not merely the imagination of the writer indeed the clamor has been much augmented by numbers joining it who really had no claim on our country every debtor in britain engaged in whatever trade when he had no better excuse to give for delay of payment accused the want of returns from america and the indignation thus excited against us now appeared so general among the english that one would imagine their nation which is so exact in expecting punctual payment from all the rest of the world must be at home the model of justice the very pattern of punctuality yet if one were disposed to recriminate it would not be difficult to find sufficient matter in several parts of their conduct but this i forbear the two separate nations are now at peace and there can be no use in mutual provocations to fresh enmity if i have shown clearly that the present inability of many american merchants to discharge their debts contracted before the war is not so much their fault as the fault of the crediting nation who by making an unjust war on them obstructing their commerce plundering and devastating their country were the cause of that inability i have answered the purpose of writing this paper how far the refusal of the british court to execute the treaty in delivering up the frontier posts may on account of that deficiency of payment be justifiable is cheerfully submitted to the worlds impartial judgment     benjamin franklin

return them hither i am very much pleased to hear that you have had no misunderstanding with his father indeed if there had been any such i should have concluded it was your fault for i think our family were always subject to being a little miffy by the way is our relationship in nantucket quite worn out i have met with none from thence of late years who were disposed to be acquainted with me except captain timothy folger they are wonderfully shy but i admire their honest plainness of speech about a year ago i invited two of them to dine with me their answer was that they would if they could not do better i suppose they did better for i never saw them afterwards and so had no opportunity of showing my miff if i had one i shall make the addition you desire to my superscriptions

correspondence took place between mr rd wells and dr franklin on the subject of a suitable inscription for the same rd wells presents his best respects to dr franklin and takes the liberty of suggesting something of the substance of what he believes would give general satisfaction as it is well known to the present inhabitants of this city how much they are indebted to dr franklin for the first idea as well as execution of the plan of a public library rd wells is very certain it would be the general wish to perpetuate a grateful remembrance of it phila august   th      reply dr franklin presents his respects to mr wells he did not intend any mention of himself in the proposed inscription and even wrote it at first without the words cheerfully at the instance of one of their members but in compliance with mr wells idea has added them though he still thinks it would be better without them he cannot however but be pleased with every mark of the kind regard of his     fellowcitizens towards him it is his own being concerned in promoting such testimonies that he thinks improper and as that drawn by mr wells may be understood as proceeding from him he wishes it may be so considered saturday pm august         be it remembered in honour of the philadelphian youth then chiefly artificers that in mdccxxxii they cheerfully at the instance of one of their number

philadelphia   september      dear friend— i have had notice of sundry books sent out by you but none of them are come to hand except the dictionnaire dagriculture by labbé rogier my grandson also complains of not receiving a package or case sent by you to him he knows not by what conveyance nor where to enquire for it it is long since i have had the pleasure of hearing     from you the last letter i have received being dated the   st of february but when i have no new letter from you i console myself by reading over some of the old ones as i have lately done those of the  st april    and the  0th of oct and   th nov    every time i read what you write i receive fresh pleasure i have already answered those lastmentioned letters and now have before me that of the   st of february only i am sorry my friend morris failed in the attention he ought to have shown you but i hope you will excuse it when you consider that an american transported from the tranquil villages of his country and set down in the tourbillon of such a great city as paris must necessarily be for some days half out of his senses i hope you have perfectly recovered of your fall at madam helvetius and that you now enjoy perfect health as to mine i can give you no good account i have a long time been afflicted with almost constant and grievous pain to combat which i have been obliged to have recourse to opium which indeed has afforded me some ease from time to time but then it has taken away my appetite and so impeded my digestion that i am become totally emaciated and little remains of me but a skeleton covered with a skin in this situation i have not been able to continue my memoirs and now i suppose i shall never finish them benjamin has made a copy of what is done for you which shall be sent by the first safe opportunity i make no remarks to you concerning your public affairs being too remote to form just opinions concerning them indeed i wonder     that you who are at the same distance from us make so very few mistakes in your judgment of our affairs at present we think them in a good way the congress are employed in amending some of their faults supposed to be in our constitution and it is expected that in a few weeks the machine will be in orderly motion the piece of m target which you mention as having sent me is not come to hand i am sorry to hear of the scarcity which has afflicted your country we have had here a most plentiful harvest of all the productions of the earth without exception and i suppose some supplies will be sent you from hence though the term during which the importation was admitted was too short considering the distance my family join in every affectionate sentiment respecting you and yours with your sincere friend b franklin mdlv an account of the supremest court of judicature in pennsylvania viz the court of the press  power of this court it may receive and promulgate accusations of all kinds against all persons and characters among the citizens of the state and even against all inferior courts and may judge sentence and condemn to   0 infamy not only private individuals but public bodies etc with or without inquiry or hearing at the courts discretion in whose favor and for whose emolument this court is established in favor of about one citizen in five hundred who by education or practice in scribbling has acquired a tolerable style as to grammar and construction so as to bear printing or who is possessed of a press and a few types this five hundredth part of the citizens have the privilege of accusing and abusing the other four hundred and ninetynine parts at their pleasure or they may hire out their pens and press to others for that purpose practice of the court it is not governed by any of the rules of common courts of law the accused is allowed no grand jury to judge of the truth of the accusation before it is publicly made nor is the name of the accuser made known to him nor has he an opportunity of confronting the witnesses against him for they are kept in the dark as in the spanish court of inquisition nor is there any petty jury of his peers sworn to try the truth of the charges the proceedings are also sometimes so rapid that an honest good citizen may find himself suddenly and unexpectedly accused and in the same morning judged and condemned and sentence pronounced against him that he is a rogue and a villain yet if an officer of this court receives     the slightest check for misconduct in this his office he claims immediately the rights of a free citizen by the constitution and demands to know his accuser to confront the witnesses and to have a fair trial by a jury of his peers the foundation of its authority it is said to be founded on an article in the state constitution which establishes the liberty of the press a liberty which every pennsylvanian will fight and die for though few of us i believe have distinct ideas of its nature and extent it seems indeed somewhat like the liberty of the press that felons have by the common law of england before conviction that is to be pressed to death or hanged if by the liberty of the press were understood merely the liberty of discussing the propriety of public measures and political opinions let us have as much of it as you please but if it means the liberty of affronting calumniating and defaming one another i for my part own myself willing to part with my share of it whenever our legislators shall please so to alter the law and shall cheerfully consent to exchange my liberty of abusing others for the privilege of not being abused myself by whom this court is commissioned or constituted it is not by any commission from the supreme executive council who might previously judge of the abilities integrity knowledge etc of the persons     to be appointed to this great trust of deciding upon the characters and good fame of the citizens for this court is above that council and may accuse judge and condemn it at pleasure nor is it hereditary as in the court of dernier resort in the peerage of england but any man who can procure pen ink and paper with a press a few types and a huge pair of blacking balls may commissionate himself and his court is immediately established in the plenary possession and exercise of its rights for if you make the least complaint of the judges conduct he daubs his blacking balls in your face whenever he meets you and besides tearing your private character to flitters marks you out for the odium of the public as an enemy to the liberty of the press of the natural support of these courts their support is founded in the depravity of such minds as have not been mended by religion nor improved by good education   there is a lust in man no charm can tame   of loudly publishing his neighbors shame hence   on eagles wings immortal scandals fly   while virtuous actions are but born and die   drydbn   whoever feels pain in hearing a good character of his neighbor will feel a pleasure in the reverse and of those who despairing to rise into distinction     by their virtues are happy if others can be depressed to a level with themselves there are a number sufficient in every great town to maintain one of these courts by their subscriptions a shrewd observer once said that in walking the streets in a slippery morning one might see where the goodnatured people lived by the ashes thrown on the ice before their doors probably he would have formed a different conjecture of the temper of those whom he might find engaged in such a subscription of the checks proper to be established against the abuse of power in these courts hitherto there are none but since so much has been written and published on the federal constitution and the necessity of checks in all other parts of good government has been so clearly and learnedly explained i find myself so far enlightened as to suspect some check may be proper in this part also but i have been at a loss to imagine any that may not be construed an infringement of the sacred liberty of the press at length however i think i have found one that instead of diminishing general liberty shall augment it which is by restoring to the people a species of liberty of which they have been deprived by our laws i mean the liberty of the cudgel in the rude state of society prior to the existence of laws if one man gave another ill language the affronted person would return it by a box on the ear and if repeated by a good drubbing and this without offending against any law but now the right     of making such returns is denied and they are punished as breaches of the peace while the right of abusing seems to remain in full force the laws made against it being rendered ineffectual by the liberty of the press my proposal then is to leave the liberty of the press untouched to be exercised in its full extent force and vigor but to permit the liberty of the cudgel to go with it par passu thus my fellowcitizens if an impudent writer attacks your reputation dearer to you perhaps than your life and puts his name to the charge you may go to him as openly and break his head if he conceals himself behind the printer and you can nevertheless discover who he is you may in like manner waylay him in the night attack him behind and give him a good drubbing thus far goes my project as to private resentment and retribution but if the public should ever happen to be affronted as it ought to be with the conduct of such writers i would not advise proceeding immediately to these extremities but that we should in moderation content ourselves with tarring and feathering and tossing them in a blanket if however it should be thought that this proposal of mine may disturb the public peace i would then humbly recommend to our legislators to take up the consideration of both liberties that of the press and that of the cudgel and by an explicit law mark their extent and limits and at the same time that they secure the person of a citizen from assaults they would likewise provide for the security of his reputation     benjamin franklin george washington mdlvi to george washington the business relative to free blacks shall be transacted by a committee of twentyfour persons annually elected by ballot at the meeting of this society  in the month called april and in order to perform the different services with expedition regularity and energy this committee shall resolve itself into the following subcommittees viz i a committee of inspection who shall superintend the morals general conduct and ordinary situation of the free negroes and afford them advice and instruction protection from wrongs and other friendly offices ii a committee of guardians who shall place out children and young people with suitable persons that they may during a moderate term of apprenticeship or servitude learn some trade or other business of subsistence the committee may effect this partly by a persuasive influence on parents and the persons concerned and partly by coöperating with the laws which are or may be enacted for this and similar purposes in forming contracts on these occasions the committee shall secure to the society as far as may be practicable the right of guardianship over the persons so bound iii a committee of education who shall superintend the school instruction of the children and youth of the free blacks they may either influence     them to attend regularly the schools already established in this city or form others with this view they shall in either case provide that the pupils may receive such learning as is necessary for their future situation in life and especially a deep impression of the most important and generally acknowledged moral and religious principles they shall also procure and preserve a regular record of the marriages births and manumissions of all free blacks iv a committee of employ who shall endeavor to procure constant employment for those free negroes who are able to work as the want of this would occasion poverty idleness and many vicious habits this committee will by sedulous inquiry be enabled to find common labor for a great number they will also provide that such as indicate proper talents may learn various trades which may be done by prevailing upon them to bind themselves for such a term of years as shall compensate their masters for the expense and trouble of instruction and maintenance the committee may attempt the institution of some useful and simple manufactures which require but little skill and also may assist in commencing business such as appear to be qualified for it whenever the committee of inspection shall find persons of any particular description requiring attention they shall immediately direct them to the committee of whose care they are the proper objects in matters of a mixed nature the committees shall confer and if necessary act in concert affairs     of great importance shall be referred to the whole committee the expense incurred by the prosecution of this plan shall be defrayed by a fund to be formed by donations or subscriptions for these particular purposes and to be kept separate from the other funds of this society the committee shall make a report of their proceedings and of the state of their stock to the society at their quarterly meetings in the months called april and october benjamin franklin    september      philadelphia george washington mdlvii to george washington philadelphia    september      dear sir— my malady renders my sitting up to write rather painful to me but i cannot let my soninlaw mr bache part for new york without congratulating you by him on the recovery of your health so precious to us all and on the growing strength of our new government under your administration for my own personal ease i should have died two years ago but though those years have been spent in excruciating pain i am pleased that i have lived them since they have brought me to see our present situation i am now finishing my eightyfourth year and probably with it my career in this life but in whatever state of existence i am placed hereafter if i retain any memory of what has     passed here i shall with it retain the esteem respect and affection with which i have long been my dear friend yours most sincerely b franklin mdlviii to the french minister of foreign affairs philadelphia    september      sir— though i have not the vanity to suppose that i have any influence with your excellency yet i cannot at the request of mr le roy de chaumont jr refuse him this testimony of my regard he has resided in this country near four years during which time he has constantly conducted himself with so much probity and discretion as to gain the esteem of all ranks and by his living in the house of m de marbois consul of france at this port who has occasionally employed him in the duties of that office he has thereby acquired a knowledge of that business sufficient to enable him to execute it should it please your excellency to appoint him in the room of m de marbois who as i understand is likely to be otherwise provided for by mr de chaumonts knowledge of the business the language of the country and the high esteem in which he is held here i am confident that his appointment would be both useful to his sovereign and agreeable to the government and citizens of this state i hope your excellency will excuse the liberty i have taken and believe me with great respect sir your excellency etc     george washington    september      new york benjamin franklin mdlix from george washington new york    september      dear sir— the affectionate congratulations on the recovery of my health and the warm expressions of personal friendship which were contained in your letter of the   th instant claim my gratitude and the consideration that it is written when you were afflicted with a painful malady greatly increases my obligation for it would to god my dear sir that i could congratulate you upon the removal of that excruciating pain under which you labor and that your existence might close with as much ease to yourself as its continuance has been beneficial to our country and useful to mankind or if the united wishes of a free people joined with the earnest prayers of every friend to science and humanity could relieve the body from pain or infirmities that you could claim an exemption on this score but this cannot be and you have within yourself the only resource to which we can confidently apply for relief a philosophic mind if to be venerated for benevolence if to be admired for talents if to be esteemed for patriotism if to be beloved for philanthropy can gratify the human mind you must have the pleasing consolation to know that you have not lived in vain and i flatter myself that it will not be ranked among the least grateful occurrences of your life to be assured that so long as i retain my memory you will   0 be recollected with respect veneration and affection by your sincere friend george washington benjamin franklin

i find a review of dr kippis life of cook containing the following remark viz the protection afforded to this discoverer by the court of france redounds     highly to mr turgots honor while the narrowsouled americans did all they could to obstruct him i think the writer of this remark will find it difficult to produce a single instance well authenticated of any such endeavor used by the americans but i happen to have it in my power to produce a strong contrary instance which i send you enclosed and doubt not of your doing so much justice to the americans as to make this refutation of the calumny equally public with the calumny itself by inserting it also in your magazine it is a true copy of the circularletter sent by dr franklin to all the commanders of the american cruisers then in the european seas which was so well known to and so well taken by the government in england that when cooks voyage was printed the admiralty sent to that gentleman an elegant copy of it with a very polite letter from lord howe expressing that the present was made with his majestys approbation the royal society also on the same occasion presented him with one of the gold medals struck by them of that illustrious navigator accompanied by a letter from sir joseph banks their president expressing likewise that it was sent with the approbation of his majesty these i have seen and i wonder much that the writer who gives so particular an account of the distribution of those gold medals should be unacquainted with this circumstance i am etc an american     benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia m de chaumont mdlxii to m de chaumont philadelphia    october      dear friend— i was too much indisposed yesterday to write in answer to your affecting letter but i have considered the case very attentively and will now give you the result in the first place what you demand of me is impracticable the sum i have to draw upon in france being but little more than half of what you require and upon that small sum though my late extraordinary expenses in building have much straitened me in furnishing my ordinary expenses i dare not draw under the present circumstances of affairs in that country lest through the lowness of the funds i should lose perhaps half my property in selling out to pay the bills or in case of public bankruptcy which i find is apprehended by many as a possible case my bills should be returned under a protest which besides damages would extremely embarrass me by the last accounts i received i suffered a loss of    per cent in the sale of my funds to produce money for the payment of a bill for  0000 livres which i sold towards the end of the last year and we now learn from the public prints that the new proposed loan of  0000000 does not fill and that mr necker is discouraged and in bad health which together has occasioned the funds to fall much lower in the next place it seems to me that in your present circumstances excuse my freedom in presuming to give you my advice it would be more advisable for     you to remain here a few months longer in order to finish your affair with the congress they meet again in the beginning of january and there is no doubt but the officers through whose hands such affairs must pass will be present and your accounts having been already examined and passed i am of your opinion that they will probably be some of the first paid money i think will not be wanting as it is thought that the immense importation of goods lately made into this port must produce at least one fourth of the import expected from the whole of the united states if you should be absent at the next meeting of congress it may occasion a still further delay of payment for want of somebody present to solicit the business which would be a further prejudice to the creditors if you should conclude to stay i would write a letter to your father which he might show to them expressing that your stay was by my counsel with the reason and that as soon as the congress should meet i would support your application for immediate payment with my strongest interest this delay of two or three months i should think cannot make much difference in your fathers affairs the present disorders of that country being considered or if you apprehend as you have mentioned that the creditors may suspect your having an intention of assuming to your own use the property of your father you may to prevent such suspicions offer the creditors to deliver up to them or to any person they shall please to appoint all the papers ascertaining your imperfect     benjamin franklin   november      philadelphia robert morris mdlxiii to hon r morris esq philadelphia   november      dear sir— i should be glad if it might suit you to spare half an hour some day this week to settle between us the loss that accrued on the sale of my funds in france for the payment of the bills i furnished you with the sooner the better as i find myself growing weaker daily and less fit for business i am your affectionate friend and humble servant b franklin p s—i enclose the two last letters received from messrs grand  co together with their account from which you may at your leisure make the computation by the letters you will perceive the care that was taken to choose the most favorable time for the sale of those funds as i reckon it there is  0¼ per cent loss on   000 livres of the   000 sold on the   d of march and   per cent loss on the  0000 sold april the  th benjamin franklin   november      philadelphia james logan mdlxiv to james logan esq philadelphia   november      dear sir— apprehending there is some danger of my slipping through your fingers if the business we are engaged in is longer delayed i feel uneasy till the vacant trusteeships are filled up and the deed recorded i wish therefore it may be agreeable     to you that we have a meeting soon for those purposes with great esteem and respect i am sir your most obedient humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   november      philadelphia benjamin vaughan mdlxv to benjamin vaughan philadelphia   november      my dearest friend— i received your kind letter of august  th i thank you much for your intimations of the virtues of hemlock but i have tried so many things with so little effect that i am quite discouraged and have no longer any faith in remedies for the stone the palliating system is what i am now fixed in opium gives me ease when i am attacked by pain and by the use of it i still make life at least tolerable not being able however to bear sitting to write i now make use of the hand of one of my grandsons dictating to him from my bed i wish indeed i had tried this method sooner for so i think i might by this time have finished my memoirs in which i have made no progress for these six months past i have now taken the resolution to endeavor completing them in this way of dictating to an amanuensis what is already done i now send you with an earnest request that you and my good friend dr price would be so good as to take the trouble of reading it critically examining it and giving me your candid opinion whether i had best     publish or suppress it and if the first then what parts had better be expunged or altered i shall rely upon your opinions for i am now grown so old and feeble in mind as well as body that i cannot place any confidence in my own judgment in the meantime i desire and expect that you will not suffer any copy of it or of any part of it to be taken for any purpose whatever you present me with a pleasing idea of the happiness i might have enjoyed in a certain great house and in the conversation of its excellent owner and his well chosen guests if i could have spent some more time in england that is now become impossible my best wishes however attend him and his amiable son in whose promising virtues and abilities i am persuaded the father will find much satisfaction the revolution in france is truly surprising i sincerely wish it may end in establishing a good constitution for that country the mischiefs and troubles it suffers in the operation however give me great concern you request advice from me respecting your conduct and writings and desire me to tell you their faults as to your conduct i know nothing that looks like a fault except your declining to act in any public station although you are certainly qualified to do much public good in many you must have had it in your power to occupy in respect to your writings your language seems to me to be good and pure and your sentiments generally just but your style or composition wants perspicuity and this     i think owing principally to a neglect of method what i would therefore recommend to you is that before you sit down to write on any subject you would spend some days in considering it putting down at the same time in short hints every thought which occurs to you as proper to make a part of your intended piece when you have thus obtained a collection of thoughts examine them carefully with this view to find which of them is properest to be presented first to the mind of the reader that he being possessed of that may the more easily understand it and be better disposed to receive what you intend for the second and thus i would have you put a figure before each thought to mark its future place in your composition for so every preceding proposition preparing the mind for that which is to follow and the reader often anticipating it he proceeds with ease and pleasure and approbation as seeming continually to meet with his own thought in this mode you have a better chance for a perfect production because the mind attending first to the sentiments alone next to the method alone each part is likely to be better performed and i think too in less time you see i give my counsel rather bluntly without attempting to soften my manner of finding fault by any apology which would give some people great offence but in the present situation of affairs between us when i am soliciting the advantage of your criticisms on a work of mine it is perhaps my interest that you should be a little offended in order to produce a greater degree of wholesome severity     i think with you that if my memoirs are to be published an edition of them should be printed in england for that country as well as here for this and i shall gladly leave it to your friendly management we have now had one session of congress under our new constitution which was conducted with i think a greater degree of temper prudence and unanimity than could well have been expected and our future prospects seem very favorable the harvests of the last summer have been uncommonly plentiful and good yet the produce bears a high price from the great foreign demand at the same time immense quantities of foreign goods are crowded upon us so as to overstock the market and supply us with what we want at very low prices a spirit of industry and frugality is also very generally prevailing which being the most promising sign of future national felicity gives me infinite satisfaction remember me most respectfully and affectionately to your good mother sisters and brother and also to my dear dr price and believe me my dearest friend yours most sincerely b franklin p s—i have not received the philosophical transactions for the two or three last years they are usually laid by for me at the societys house with my name upon them and remain there till called for i shall be much obliged to you if you can conveniently take them up and send them to me your mention of plagiarism puts me in mind of a charge of the same kind which i lately saw in the british repository concerning the chapter of     abraham and the stranger perhaps this is the attack your letter hints at in which you defended me the truth is as i think you observe that i never published that chapter and never claimed more credit from it than what related to the style and the addition of the concluding threatening and promise the publishing of it by lord kames without my consent deprived me of a good deal of amusement which i used to take in reading it by heart out of my bible and obtaining the remarks of the scripturians upon it which were sometimes very diverting not but that it is in itself on account of the importance of its moral well worth being made known to all mankind when i wrote that in the form you now have it i wrote also another  the hint of which was also taken from an ancient jewish tradition but not having the same success with it as the other i laid it aside and have not seen it for thirty years past till within these few days a lady of my acquaintance furnished me with a copy which she had preserved i think however it is not a bad one and send it to you enclosed benjamin franklin   november      philadelphia john wright mdlxvi to john wright london philadelphia   november      dear friend— i received your kind letter of july the   st which gave me great pleasure as it informed me of the welfare both of yourself and your good lady to whom please to present my respects   0 i thank you for the epistle of your yearly meeting and for the card a specimen of printing which was enclosed we have now had one session of congress which was conducted under our new constitution and with as much general satisfaction as could reasonably be expected i wish the struggle in france may end as happily for that nation we are now in the full enjoyment of our new government for eleven of the states and it is generally thought that north carolina is about to join it rhode island will probably take longer time for consideration we have had a most plentiful year for the fruits of the earth and our people seem to be recovering fast from the extravagance and idle habits which the war had introduced and to engage seriously in the country habits of temperance frugality and industry which give the most pleasing prospect of future national felicity your merchants however are i think imprudent in crowding in upon us such quantities of goods for sale here which are not written for by ours and are beyond the faculties of this country to consume in any reasonable time this surplus of goods is therefore to raise present money sent to the vendues or auctionhouses of which we have six or seven in and near this city where they are sold frequently for less than prime cost to the great loss of the indiscreet adventurers our newspapers are doubtless to be seen at your coffeehouses near the exchange in their advertisements you may observe the constancy and quantity of this kind of sales as well as the quantity of goods imported by     our regular traders i see in your english newspapers frequent mention of our being out of credit with you to us it appears that we have abundantly too much and that your exporting merchants are rather out of their senses i wish success to your endeavors for obtaining an abolition of the slave trade the epistle from your yearly meeting for the year      was not the first sowing of the good seed you mention for i find by an old pamphlet in my possession that george keith near a hundred years since wrote a paper against the practice said to be given forth by the appointment of the meeting held by him at philip james house in the city of philadelphia about the year      wherein a strict charge was given to friends that they should set their negroes at liberty after some reasonable time of service etc etc and about the year      or      i myself printed a book for ralph sandyford another of your friends in this city against keeping negroes in slavery two editions of which he distributed gratis and about the year      i printed another book on the same subject for benjamin lay who also professed being one of your friends and he distributed the books chiefly among them by these instances it appears that the seed was indeed sown in the good ground of your profession though much earlier than the time you mention and its springing up to effect at last though so late is some confirmation of lord bacons observation that a good notion never dies and it may encourage us in making such though hopeless of their taking immediate effect     i doubt whether i shall be able to finish my memoirs and if i finish them whether they will be proper for publication you seem to have too high an opinion of them and to expect too much from them i think you are right in preferring a mixed form of government for your country under its present circumstances and if it were possible for you to reduce the enormous salaries and emoluments of great officers which are at bottom the source of all your violent factions that form might be conducted more quietly and happily but i am afraid that none of your factions when they get uppermost will ever have virtue enough to reduce those salaries and emoluments but will rather choose to enjoy them i enclose a bill for twentyfive pounds for which when received please to credit my account and out of it pay mr benjamin vaughan of jeffries square and mr william vaughan his brother of mincing lane such accounts against me as they shall present to you for that purpose i am my dear friend yours very affectionately b franklin daschkoff   november      st petersburgh benjamin franklin mdlxvii from the princess of daschkoff  st petersburgh   november      dear sir— having always supposed and even cherished the idea that you were a member of the     imperial academy of sciences which is at st petersburgh under my direction i was greatly surprised when reviewing the list of its members some days ago i did not find your name in the number i hastened therefore to acquire this honor for the academy and you were received among its members with an unanimous applause and joy i beg you sir to accept of this title and to believe that i look upon it as an honor acquired by our academy i shall order the patent to be despatched to you as soon as possible in the meantime be assured that it is with the greatest pleasure that i profit of the present occasion to give you token of my regard and veneration for your eminent character and i shall always recollect with pride the advantage i had to be personally noticed by you with a sincere consideration i am dear sir your most obedient servant princess of daschkoff benjamin franklin   november      philadelphia samuel moore mdlxviii to samuel moore philadelphia   november      dear sir— i received your favor of july   th but had no opportunity of showing any civility to the bearer whom you mention as coming under the auspices of william franklin as he did not show himself to me i am obliged by your kind inquiries after my health which is still tolerably good the stone     excepted my constitution being such as if it were not for that malady might have held out yet some years longer i hope the fire of liberty which you mention as spreading itself over europe will act upon the inestimable rights of man as common fire does upon gold purify without destroying them so that a lover of liberty may find a country in any part of christendom i see with pleasure in the public prints that our society  is still kept up and flourishes i was an early member for when mr shipley sent me a list of the subscribers they were but seventy and though i had no expectation then of going to england and acting with them i sent a contribution of twenty guineas in consideration of which the society were afterwards pleased to consider me a member i wish to the exertions of your manufacturers who are generally excellent and to the spirit and enterprise of your merchants who are famed for fair and honorable dealing all the success they merit in promoting the prosperity of your country i am glad our friend small enjoys so much health and his faculties so perfectly as i perceive he does by his letters i know not whether he is yet returned from his visit to scotland and therefore give you the trouble of the enclosed my best wishes attend you being ever dear sir your most obedient servant b franklin     benjamin franklin   november      philadelphia alexander small mdlxix to alexander small philadelphia   november      dear sir— i received your several favors of april   d may  th and june  d together with the manuscript concerning ventilation which will be inserted in our next volume i have long been of your opinion that your legal provision for the poor is a very great evil operating as it does to the encouragement of idleness we have followed your example and begin now to see our error and i hope shall reform it i find by your letters that every man has patience enough to bear calmly and coolly the injuries done to other people you have perfectly forgiven the royalists and you seem to wonder that we should still retain any resentment against them for their joining with the savages to burn our houses and murder and scalp our friends our wives and our children i forget who it was that said we are commanded to forgive our enemies but we are nowhere commanded to forgive our friends certain it is however that atrocious injuries done to us by our friends are naturally more deeply resented than the same done by enemies they have left us to live under the government of their king in england and nova scotia we do not miss them nor wish their return nor do we envy them their present happiness the accounts you give me of the great prospects you have respecting your manufactures agriculture and commerce are pleasing to me for i still love     england and wish it prosperity you tell me that the government of france is abundantly punished for its treachery to england in assisting us you might also have remarked that the government of england had been punished for its treachery to france in assisting the corsicans and in seizing her ships in time of full peace without any previous declaration of war i believe governments are pretty near equal in honesty and cannot with much propriety praise their own in preference to that of their neighbors you do me too much honor in naming me with timoleon i am like him only in retiring from my public labors which indeed my stone and other infirmities of age have made indispensably necessary i hope you are by this time returned from your visit to your native country and that the journey has given a firmer consistence to your health mr penns property in this country which you inquire about is still immensely great and i understand he has received ample compensation in england for the part he lost i think you have made a happy choice of rural amusements the protection of the bees and the destruction of the hop insect i wish success to your experiments and shall be glad to hear the result your theory of insects appears the most ingenious and plausible of any that have hitherto been proposed by philosophers our new constitiution is now established with eleven states and the accession of a twelfth is soon expected we have had one session of congress     under it which was conducted with remarkable prudence and a good deal of unanimity our late harvests were plentiful and our produce still fetches a good price through an abundant foreign demand and the flourishing state of our commerce i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin   november      philadelphia mdlxx an address to the public from the pennsylvania society for promoting the abolition of slavery and the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage philadelphia   november      it is with peculiar satisfaction we assure the friends of humanity that in prosecuting the design of our association our endeavors have proved successful far beyond our most sanguine expectations encouraged by this success and by the daily progress of that luminous and benign spirit of liberty which is diffusing itself throughout the world and humbly hoping for the continuance of the divine blessing on our labors we have ventured to make an important addition to our original plan and do therefore earnestly solicit the support and assistance of all who can feel the tender emotions of sympathy and compassion or relish the exalted pleasure of beneficence slavery is such an atrocious debasement of human nature that its very extirpation if not performed     with solicitous care may sometimes open a source of serious evils the unhappy man who has long been treated as a brute animal too frequently sinks beneath the common standard of the human species the galling chains that bind his body do also fetter his intellectual faculties and impair the social affections of his heart accustomed to move like a mere machine by the will of a master reflection is suspended he has not the power of choice and reason and conscience have but little influence over his conduct because he is chiefly governed by the passion of fear he is poor and friendless perhaps worn out by extreme labor age and disease under such circumstances freedom may often prove a misfortune to himself and prejudicial to society attention to emancipated black people it is therefore to be hoped will become a branch of our national policy but as far as we contribute to promote this emancipation so far that attention is evidently a serious duty incumbent on us and which we mean to discharge to the best of our judgment and abilities to instruct to advise to qualify those who have been restored to freedom for the exercise and enjoyment of civil liberty to promote in them habits of industry to furnish them with employments suited to their age sex talents and other circumstances and to procure their children an education calculated for their future situation in life these are the great outlines of the annexed plan which we have adopted and which we conceive will essentially promote the     public good and the happiness of these our hitherto too much neglected fellowcreatures a plan so extensive cannot be carried into execution without considerable pecuniary resources beyond the present ordinary funds of the society we hope much from the generosity of enlightened and benevolent freemen and will gratefully receive any donations or subscriptions for this purpose which may be made to our treasurer james starr or to james pemberton chairman of our committee of correspondence signed by order of the society b franklin president benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia m le veillard mdlxxi to m le veillard philadelphia    november      dear friend— this must be but a short letter for i have mislaid your last and must postpone answering them till i have found them but to make you some amends i send you what is done of the memoirs under this express condition however that you do not suffer any copy to be taken of them or of any part of them on any account whatever and that you will with our excellent friend the duke de la rochefoucauld read them over carefully examine them critically and send me your friendly candid opinion of the parts you would advise me to correct or expunge this in case you should be of opinion   0 that they are generally proper to be published and if you judge otherwise that you would send me that opinion as soon as possible and prevent my taking further trouble in endeavoring to finish them i send you also the paper you desire respecting our payment of old english debts the troubles you have had in paris have afflicted me a great deal i hope by this time they are over and every thing settled as it should be to the advantage both of the king and the nation my love to good mme le veillard and your children in which secy benjamin joins and believe me as ever your affectionate friend b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia m le roy mdlxxii to m le roy philadelphia    november      it is now more than a year since i have heard from my dear friend le roy what can be the reason are you still living or have the mob of paris mistaken the head of a monopolizer of knowledge for a monopolizer of corn and paraded it about the streets upon a pole great part of the news we have had from paris for near a year past has been very afflicting i sincerely wish and pray it may all end well and happy both for the king and the nation the voice of philosophy i apprehend can hardly be heard among those tumults if any thing material in that way had     occurred i am persuaded you would have acquainted me with it however pray let me hear from you a little oftener for though the distance is great and the means of conveying letters not very regular a years silence between friends must needs give uneasiness our new constitution is now established and has an appearance that promises permanency but in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes my health continues much as it has been for some time except that i grow thinner and weaker so that i cannot expect to hold out much longer my respects to your good brother and to our friends of the academy which always has my best wishes for its prosperity and glory adieu my dear friend and believe me ever yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia m de chaumont mdlxxiii to m de chaumont philadelphia    november      my good and dear old friend— your very valuable son came to this town lately with the full intentions of taking his passage for france in obedience to the commands of his much respected father and mother and supposing that his presence there would be useful to the affairs of the family but on his communicating his purpose to me and acquainting me at the same time with the present situation     of his demand upon congress where your accounts against them have been examined and approved and the payment only delayed till by the operation of our new constitution the congress shall be furnished with money to discharge them i could not help thinking it would be more advisable for him to postpone his voyage two or three months when he might hope to see his business here completed to his and your satisfaction than to leave it in its present state which might occasion a much longer delay for the impost law passed at the last session of congress being now in full force through all the states of the union imperfect importation of goods in imperfect duties are paid having lately been immensely great the flow of money into the treasury must be proportionable so that when they meet again which will be early in january next they will find themselves in possession of a very considerable sum and as their debt to you was one of the earliest they contracted i suppose it will of course be one of the first they will think of discharging and i have promised him to use my best interest and endeavors with them for that purpose he has accordingly thought fit to take my advice and i hope it will be approved by you and his good mother and that this short delay will not occasion any great inconvenience whereas if he should be absent when the first payments are made his affair might be postponed for another year we hope indeed that when he does visit you you will not think of detaining and fixing him in france for we are not willing to part with him his behavior having been such     during his residence among us as to obtain for him the goodwill respect and esteem of all who have had the pleasure of knowing him pray make my respects acceptable to good madame imperfect b franklin benjamin franklin   december      philadelphia david hartley mdlxxiv to david hartley philadelphia   december      my very dear friend— i received your favor of august last your kind condolences on the painful state of my health are very obliging i am thankful to god however that among the numerous ills human life is subject to one only of any importance is fallen to my lot and that so late as almost to insure that it can be but of short duration the convulsions in france are attended with some disagreeable circumstances but if by the struggle she obtains and secures for the nation its future liberty and a good constitution a few years enjoyment of those blessings will amply repair all the damages their acquisition may have occasioned god grant that not only the love of liberty but a thorough knowledge of the rights of man may pervade all the nations of the earth so that a philosopher may set his foot anywhere on its surface and say this is my country your wishes for a cordial and perpetual friendship between britain and her ancient colonies are manifested continually in every one of your letters to me     something of my disposition on the same subject may appear to you in casting your eye over the enclosed paper i do not by this opportunity send you any of our gazettes because the postage from liverpool would be more than they are worth i can now only add my best wishes of every kind of felicity for the three amiable hartleys to whom i have the honor of being an affectionate friend and most obedient humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia jane mecom mdlxxv to mrs jane mecom philadelphia    december      dear sister— you tell me you are desired by an acquaintance to ask my opinion whether the general circumstances mentioned in the history of baron trenck are founded in fact to which i can only answer that of the greatest part of those circumstances the scene being laid in germany i must consequently be very ignorant but of what he says as having passed in france between the ministers of that country himself and me i can speak positively that it is founded in falsehood and that the fact can only serve to confound as i never saw him in that country nor ever knew or heard of him anywhere till i met with the abovementioned history in print in the german language in which he ventured to relate it as a fact that i had with those ministers solicited him to enter into the american service a translation of that book into french has since been     printed but the translator has omitted that pretended fact probably from an apprehension that its being in that country known not to be true might hurt the credit and sale of the translation i thank you for the sermon on sacred music i have read it with pleasure i think it a very ingenious composition you will say this is natural enough if you read what i have formerly written on the same subject in one of my printed letters wherein you will find a perfect agreement of sentiment respecting the complex music of late in my opinion too much in vogue it being only pleasing to learned ears which can be delighted with the difficulty of execution instead of harmony and melody your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia mdlxxvi to ——— philadelphia    december      dear friend— i have received your kind letter of the  th inst together with your present of metheglin of which i have already drank almost a bottle i find it excellent please to accept my thankful acknowledgments the letter of yours enclosed is from the widow of a jew who happening to be one of a number of passengers that were about forty years ago in a stageboat going to new york and which by the unskilful management of the boatman overset the canoe from whence i was endeavoring to get on     board her near staten island has ever since worried me with demands of a gratia for having as he pretended been instrumental in saving my life though that was in no danger as we were near the shore and you know what an expert swimmer i am and he was no more of any service to me in stopping the boat to take me in than every other passenger to all whom i gave a liberal entertainment at the tavern when we arrived at new york to their general satisfaction at the time but this hayes never saw me afterwards at new york or brunswick or philadelphia that he did not dun me for money on the pretence of his being poor and having been so happy as to be instrumental in saving my life which was really in no danger in this way he got of me sometimes a double joannes sometimes a spanish doubloon and never less how much in the whole i do not know having kept no account of it but it must have been a very considerable sum and as he neither incurred any risk nor was at any trouble in my behalf i have long since thought him well paid for any little expense of humanity he might have felt on the occasion he seems however to have left me to his widow as part of her dowry benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia noah webster mdlxxvii to noah webster philadelphia    december      dear sir— i received some time since your dissertations on the english language the book was     not accompanied by any letter or message informing me to whom i am obliged for it but i suppose it is to yourself it is an excellent work and will be greatly useful in turning the thoughts of our countrymen to correct writing please to accept my thanks for the great honor you have done me in its dedication i ought to have made this acknowledgment sooner but much indisposition prevented me i cannot but applaud your zeal for preserving the purity of our language both in its expressions and pronunciation and in correcting the popular errors several of our states are continually falling into with respect to both give me leave to mention some of them though possibly they may have already occurred to you i wish however in some future publication of yours you would set a discountenancing mark upon them the first i remember is the word improved when i left new england in the year      this word had never been used among us as far as i know but in the sense of ameliorated or made better except once in a very old book of dr mathers entitled remarkable providences as that eminent man wrote a very obscure hand i remember that when i read that word in his book used instead of the word imployed i conjectured it was an error of the printer who had mistaken a too short l in the writing for an r and a y with too short a tail for a v whereby imployed was converted into improved but when i returned to boston in      i found this change had obtained favor and was then become common for i met with it often in perusing the newspapers where it frequently made an appearance     rather ridiculous such for instance as the advertisement of a countryhouse to be sold which had been many years improved as a tavern and in the character of a deceased country gentleman that he had been for more than thirty years improved as a justice of the peace this use of the word improved is peculiar to new england and not to be met with among any other speakers of english either on this or the other side of the water during my late absence in france i find that several other new words have been introduced into our parliamentary language for example i find a verb formed from the substantive notice i should not have noticed this were it not that the gentleman etc also another verb from the substantive advocate the gentleman who advocates or has advocated that motion etc another from the substantive progress the most awkward and abominable of the three the committee having progressed resolved to adjourn the word opposed though not a new word i find used in a new manner as the gentlemen who are opposed to this measure to which i have also myself always been opposed if you should happen to be of my opinion with respect to these innovations you will use your authority in reprobating them the latin language long the vehicle used in distributing knowledge among the different nations of europe is daily more and more neglected and one of the modern tongues viz the french seems in point of universality to have supplied its place it is spoken in all the courts of europe and most of the     literati those even who do not speak it have acquired knowledge enough of it to enable them easily to read the books that are written in it this gives a considerable advantage to that nation it enables its authors to inculcate and spread throughout other nations such sentiments and opinions on important points as are most conducive to its interests or which may contribute to its reputation by promoting the common interests of mankind it is perhaps owing to its being written in french that voltaires treatise on toleration has had so sudden and so great an effect on the bigotry of europe as almost entirely to disarm it the general use of the french language has likewise a very advantageous effect on the profits of the bookselling branch of commerce it being well known that the more copies can be sold that are struck off from one composition of types the profits increase in a much greater proportion than they do in making a great number of pieces in any other kind of manufacture and at present there is no capital town in europe without a french booksellers shop corresponding with paris our english bids fair to obtain the second place the great body of excellent printed sermons in our language and the freedom of our writings on political subjects have induced a number of divines of different sects and nations as well as gentlemen concerned in public affairs to study it so far at least as to read it and if we were to endeavor the facilitating its progress the study of our tongue might become much more general those who have employed some parts of their time in learning a new   0 language have frequently observed that while their acquaintance with it was imperfect difficulties small in themselves operated as great ones in obstructing their progress a book for example ill printed or a pronunciation in speaking not well articulated would render a sentence unintelligible which from a clear print or a distinct speaker would have been immediately comprehended if therefore we would have the benefit of seeing our language more generally known among mankind we should endeavor to remove all the difficulties however small that discourage the learning it but i am sorry to observe that of late years those difficulties instead of being diminished have been augmented in examining the english books that were printed between the restoration and the accession of george the second we may observe that all substantives were begun with a capital in which we imitated our mother tongue the german this was more particularly useful to those who were not well acquainted with the english there being such a prodigious number of our words that are both verbs and substantives and spelled in the same manner though often accented differently in the pronunciation this method has by the fancy of printers of late years been laid aside from an idea that suppressing the capitals shows the character to greater advantage those letters prominent above the line disturbing its even regular appearance the effect of this change is so considerable that a learned man of france who used to read our books though not perfectly     acquainted with our language in conversation with me on the subject of our authors attributed the greater obscurity he found in our modern books compared with those of the period above mentioned to change of style for the worse in our writers of which mistake i convinced him by marking for him each substantive with a capital in a paragraph which he then easily understood though before he could not comprehend it this shows the inconvenience of that pretended improvement from the same fondness for an even and uniform appearance of characters in the line the printers have of late banished also the italic types in which words of importance to be attended to in the sense of the sentence and words on which an emphasis should be put in reading used to be printed and lately another fancy has induced some printers to use the short round s instead of the long one which formerly served well to distinguish a word readily by its varied appearance certainly the omitting this prominent letter makes the line appear more even but renders it less immediately legible as the paring all mens noses might smooth and level their faces but would render their physiognomies less distinguishable add to all these improvements backwards another modern fancy that gray printing is more beautiful than black hence the english new books are printed in so dim a character as to be read with difficulty by old eyes unless in a very strong light and with good glasses whoever compares a volume of the gentlemans magazine printed between the years      and    0 with one of those printed in the last ten     years will be convinced of the much greater degree of perspicuity given by black ink than by gray lord chesterfield pleasantly remarked this difference to faulkener the printer of the dublin journal who was vainly making encomiums on his own paper as the most complete of any in the world but mr faulkener said my lord dont you think it might be still farther improved by using paper and ink not quite so near of a color for all these reasons i cannot but wish that our american printers would in their editions avoid these fancied improvements and thereby render their works more agreeable to foreigners in europe to the great advantage of our bookselling commerce further to be more sensible of the advantage of clear and distinct printing let us consider the assistance it affords in reading well aloud to an auditory in so doing the eye generally slides forward three or four words before the voice if the sight clearly distinguishes what the coming words are it gives time to order the modulation of the voice to express them properly but if they are obscurely printed or disguised by omitting the capitals and long ss or otherwise the reader is apt to modulate wrong and finding he has done so he is obliged to go back and begin the sentence again which lessens the pleasure of the hearers this leads me to mention an old error in our mode of printing we are sensible that when a question is met with in reading there is a proper variation to be used in the management of the voice we have therefore a point called an interrogation affixed to     the question in order to distinguish it but this is absurdly placed at its end so that the reader does not discover it till he finds he has wrongly modulated his voice and is therefore obliged to begin again the sentence to prevent this the spanish printers more sensibly place an interrogation at the beginning as well as at the end of a question we have another error of the same kind in printing plays where something often occurs that is marked as spoken aside but the word aside is placed at the end of the speech when it ought to precede it as a direction to the reader that he may govern his voice accordingly the practice of our ladies in meeting five or six together to form a little busy party where each is employed in some useful work while one reads to them is so commendable in itself that it deserves the attention of authors and printers to make it as pleasing as possible both to the reader and hearers after these general observations permit me to make one that i imagine may regard your interest it is that your spelling book is miserably printed here so as in many places to be scarcely legible and on wretched paper if this is not attended to and the new one lately advertised as coming out should be preferable in these respects it may hurt the future sale of yours i congratulate you on your marriage of which the newspapers inform me my best wishes attend you being with sincere esteem sir etc b franklin     john paul jones    december      amsterdam benjamin franklin mdlxxviii from john paul jones amsterdam    december      dear sir— the enclosed documents from my friend the count de ségur minister plenipotentiary of france at st petersburg will explain to you in some degree my reasons for leaving russia and the danger to which i was exposed by the dark intrigues and mean subterfuges of asiatic jealousy and malice your former friendship for me which i remember with particular satisfaction and have ever been ambitious to merit will i am sure be exerted in the kind use you will make of the three pieces i now send you for my justification in the eyes of my friends in america whose good opinion is dearer to me than any thing else i wrote to the empress from warsaw in the beginning of october with a copy of my journal which will show her majesty how much she has been deceived by the account she had of our maritime operations last campaign i can easily prove to the world that i have been treated unjustly but i intend to remain silent at least till i know the fate of my journal i shall remain in europe till after the opening of the next campaign and perhaps longer before i return to america from the troubles in brabant and the measures now pursuing by the king of prussia i presume that peace is yet a distant object and that the baltic will witness warmer work than it has yet done on the death of admiral greig i was last year called from the black sea by the     empress to command a squadron in the baltic this set the invention of all my enemies and rivals at work and the event has proved that the empress cannot always do as she pleases i am with sincere affection dear sir etc j paul jones p s—it is this day ten years since i left the texel in the alliance mdlxxix queries and remarks respecting alterations in the constitution of pennsylvania  i of the executive branch your executive should consist of a single person on this i would ask is he to have no council how is he to be informed of the state and circumstances of the different counties their wants their abilities their dispositions and the characters of the principle people respecting their integrity capacities and qualifications for offices does not the present construction of our executive provide well for these particulars and during the number of years it has existed have its errors or failures in answering the end of its appointment been more or greater than might have been expected from a single person     but an individual is more easily watched and controlled than any greater number on this i would ask who is to watch and control him and by what means is he to be controlled will not those means whatever they are and in whatever body vested be subject to the same inconveniences of expense delay obstruction of good intentions etc which are objected to the present executive ii the duration of the appointment this should be governed by the following principles the independence of the magistrate and the stability of his administration neither of which can be secured but by putting both beyond the reach of every annual gust of folly and of faction on this it may be asked ought it not also to be put beyond the reach of every triennial quinquennial or septennial gust of folly and faction and in short beyond the reach of folly and of faction at any period whatever does not this reasoning aim at establishing a monarchy at least for life like that of poland or to prevent the inconveniences such as that kingdom is subject to in a new election on every decease are the freemen of pennsylvania convinced from a view of the history of such governments that it will be for their advantage to submit themselves to a government of such construction iii on the legislative branch a plural legislature is as necessary to good government as a single executive it is not enough that     your legislature should be numerous it should also be divided numbers alone are not a sufficient barrier against the impulses of passion the combination of interest the intrigues of faction the haste of folly or the spirit of encroachment one division should watch over and control the other supply its wants correct its blunders and cross its designs should they be criminal or erroneous wisdom is the specific quality of the legislature grows out of the number of the body and is made up of the portions of sense and knowledge which each member brings to it on this it may be asked may not the wisdom brought to the legislature by each member be as effectual a barrier against the impulses of passion etc when the members are united in one body as when they are divided if one part of the legislature may control the operations of the other may not the impulses of passion the combinations of interest the intrigues of faction the haste of folly or the spirit of encroachment in one of those bodies obstruct the good proposed by the other and frustrate its advantages to the public have we not experienced in this state when a province under the government of the proprietors the mischiefs of a second branch existing in the proprietary family countenanced and aided by an aristocratic council how many delays and what great expenses were occasioned in carrying on the public business and what a train of mischiefs even to the preventing of the defence of the province during several years     when distressed by an indian war by the iniquitous demand that the proprietary property should be exempt from taxation the wisdom of a few members in one single legislative body may it not frequently stifle bad motions in their infancy and so prevent their being adopted whereas if those wise men in case of a double legislature should happen to be in that branch wherein the motion did not arise may it not after being adopted by the other occasion long disputes and contentions between the two bodies expensive to the public obstructing the public business and promoting factions among the people many tempers naturally adhering obstinately to measures they have once publicly adopted have we not seen in one of our neighboring states a bad measure adopted by one branch of the legislature for want of the assistance of some more intelligent members who had been packed into the other occasion many debates conducted with much asperity which could not be settled but by an expensive general appeal to the public and have we not seen in another neighboring state a similar difference between the two branches occasioning long debates and contentions whereby the state was prevented for many months enjoying the advantage of having senators in the congress of the united states and has our present legislature in one assembly committed any errors of importance which they have not remedied or may not easily remedy more easily probably than if divided into branches and if the wisdom brought by the members to the assembly is divided into two branches may it     not be too weak in each to support a good measure or obstruct a bad one the division of the legislature into two or three branches in england was it the product of wisdom or the effect of necessity arising from the preexisting prevalence of an odious feudal system which government notwithstanding this division is now become in fact an absolute monarchy since the    by bribing the representatives with the peoples money carries by his ministers all the measures that please him which is equivalent to governing without a parliament and renders the machine of government much more complex and expensive and from its being more complex more easily put out of order has not the famous political fable of the snake with two heads and one body some useful instruction contained in it she was going to a brook to drink and in her way was to pass through a hedge a twig of which opposed her direct course one head chose to go on the right side of the twig the other on the left so that time was spent in the contest and before the decision was completed the poor snake died with thirst hence it is that the two branches should be elected by persons differently qualified and in short that as far as possible they should be made to represent different interests under this reason i would establish a legislature of two houses the upper should represent the property the lower the population of the state the upper should be chosen by freemen possessing in land and houses one thousand pounds the lower by all such as had   0 resided four years in the country and paid taxes the first should be chosen for four the last for two years they should be in authority coequal several questions may arise upon this proposition  st what is the proportion of freemen possessing lands and houses of one thousand pounds value compared to that of freemen whose possessions are inferior are they as one to ten are they even as one to twenty i should doubt whether they are as one to fifty if this minority is to choose a body expressly to control that which is to be chosen by the great majority of the freemen what have this great majority done to forfeit so great a portion of their right in elections why is this power of control contrary to the spirit of all democracies to be vested in a minority instead of a majority then is it intended or is it not that the rich should have a vote in the choice of members for the lower house while those of inferior property are deprived of the right of voting for members of the upper house and why should the upper house chosen by a minority have equal power with the lower chosen by a majority is it supposed that wisdom is the necessary concomitant of riches and that one man worth a thousand pounds must have as much wisdom as twenty who have each only nine hundred and ninetynine and why is property to be represented at all suppose one of our indian nations should now agree to form a civil society each individual would bring into the stock of the society little more property than his gun and his blanket for at present he has no other we     know that when one of them has attempted to keep a few swine he has not been able to maintain a property in them his neighbors thinking they have a right to kill and eat them whenever they want provision it being one of their maxims that hunting is free to all the accumulation therefore of property in such a society and its security to individuals in every society must be an effect of the protection afforded to it by the joint strength of the society in the execution of its laws private property therefore is a creature of society and is subject to the calls of that society whenever its necessities shall require it even to its last farthing its contributions to the public exigencies are not to be considered as conferring a benefit on the public entitling the contributors to the distinctions of honor and power but as the return of an obligation previously received or the payment of a just debt the combinations of civil society are not like those of a set of merchants who club their property in different proportions for building and freighting a ship and may therefore have some right to vote in the disposition of the voyage in a greater or less degree according to their respective contributions but the important ends of civil society and the personal securities of life and liberty there remain the same in every member of the society and the poorest continues to have an equal claim to them with the most opulent whatever difference time chance or industry may occasion in their circumstances on these considerations i am sorry to see the signs this paper i have been considering affords of a disposition among some of our people to     commence an aristocracy by giving the rich a predominancy in government a choice peculiar to themselves in one half the legislature to be proudly called the upper house and the other branch chosen by the majority of the people degraded by the denomination of the lower and giving to this upper house a permanency of four years and but two to the lower i hope therefore that our representatives in the convention will not hastily go into these innovations but take the advice of the prophet stand in the old ways view the ancient paths consider them well and be not among those that are given to change benjamin franklin    january    0 philadelphia mdlxxx to ——— philadelphia    january    0 sir— i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me respecting the construction of the eleventh article of the treaty of commerce between france and the united states i was indeed one of the commissioners for making that treaty but the commissioners have no right to explain the treaty its explanation is to be sought for in its own words and in case it cannot be clearly found there then by an application to the contracting powers i certainly conceived that when the droit daubaine was relinquished in favor of the citizens of the united states the relinquishing clause was meant to extend to all the dominions of his most christian     majesty and i am of opinion that this would not be denied if an explanation were requested of the court of france and it ought to be done if any difficulties arise on this subject in the french islands which their courts do not determine in our favor but before congress is petitioned to make such a request i imagine it would be proper to have the case tried in some of the west india islands and the petition made in consequence of a determination against us i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin   march    0 philadelphia ezra stiles mdlxxxi to ezra stiles philadelphia   march    0 i received your kind letter of january   th  and am glad you have at length received the portrait     of governor yale from his family and deposited it in the college library he was a great and good man and had the merit of doing infinite service to your country by his munificence to that institution the honor you propose doing me by placing mine in the same room with his is much too great for my deserts but you always had a partiality for me and to that it must be ascribed i am however too much obliged to yale college the first learned society that took notice of me and adorned me with its honors to refuse a request that comes from it through so esteemed a friend but i do not think any one of the portraits you mention as in my possession worthy of the situation and company you propose to place it in you have an excellent artist lately arrived if he will undertake to make one for you     i shall cheerfully pay the expense but he must not delay setting about it or i may slip through his fingers for i am now in my eightyfifth year and very infirm i send with this a very learned work as it seems to me on the ancient samaritan coins lately printed in spain and at least curious for the beauty of the impression please to accept it for your college library i have subscribed for the encyclopædia now printing here with the intention of presenting it to the college i shall probably depart before the work is finished but shall leave directions for its continuance to the end with this you will receive some of the first numbers you desire to know something of my religion it is the first time i have been questioned upon it but i cannot take your curiosity amiss and shall endeavor in a few words to gratify it here is my creed i believe in one god the creator of the universe that he governs it by his providence that he ought to be worshipped that the most acceptable service we render to him is doing good to his other children that the soul of man is immortal and will be treated with justice in another life respecting its conduct in this these i take to be the fundamental points in all sound religion and i regard them as you do in whatever sect i meet with them as to jesus of nazareth my opinion of whom you particularly desire i think his system of morals and his religion as he left them to us the best the world ever saw or is like to see but i apprehend it has received various corrupting changes and i have with     most of the present dissenters in england some doubts as to his divinity though it is a question i do not dogmatize upon having never studied it and think it needless to busy myself with it now when i expect soon an opportunity of knowing the truth with less trouble i see no harm however in its being believed if that belief has the good consequence as probably it has of making his doctrines more respected and more observed especially as i do not perceive that the supreme takes it amiss by distinguishing the unbelievers in his government of the world with any peculiar marks of his displeasure i shall only add respecting myself that having experienced the goodness of that being in conducting me prosperously through a long life i have no doubt of its continuance in the next though without the smallest conceit of meriting such goodness  my sentiments on this head you will see in the copy of an old letter enclosed  which i wrote in answer to one     from an old religionist whom i had relieved in a paralytic case by electricity and who being afraid i should grow proud upon it sent me his serious though rather impertinent caution i send you also the copy of another letter  which will show something of my disposition relating to religion p s—had not your college some present of books from the king of france please to let me know if you had an expectation given you of more and the nature of that expectation i have a reason for the enquiry i confide that you will not expose me to criticisms and censures by publishing any part of this communication to you i have ever let others enjoy their religious sentiments without reflecting on them for those that appeared to me unsupportable or even absurd all sects here and we have a great variety have experienced my goodwill in assisting them with subscriptions for the building their new places of worship and as i have never opposed any of their doctrines i hope to go out of the world in peace with them all mdlxxxii on the slave trade  march       0 to the editor of the federal gazette sir— reading last night in your excellent paper the speech of mr jackson in congress against their     meddling with the affairs of slavery or attempting to mend the condition of the slaves it put me in mind of a similar one made about one hundred years since by sidi mehemet ibrahim a member of the divan of algiers which may be seen in martins account of his consulship anno      it was against granting the petition of the sect called erika or purists who prayed for the abolition of piracy and slavery as being unjust mr jackson does not quote it perhaps he has not seen it if therefore some of its reasonings are to be found in his eloquent speech it may only show that mens interests and intellects operate and are operated on with surprising similarity in all countries and climates whenever they are under similar     circumstances the africans speech as translated is as follows allah bismillah etc god is great and mahomet is his prophet have these erika considered the consequences of granting their petition if we cease our cruises against the christians how shall we be furnished with the commodities their countries produce and which are so necessary for us if we forbear to make slaves of their people who in this hot climate are to cultivate our lands who are to perform the common labors of our city and in our families must we not then be our own slaves and is there not more compassion and more favor due to us as mussulmen than to these christian dogs we have now above fifty thousand slaves in and near algiers this number if not kept up by fresh supplies will soon diminish and be gradually annihilated if we then cease taking and plundering the infidel ships and making slaves of the seamen and passengers our lands will become of no value for want of cultivation the rents of houses in the city will sink one half and the revenue of government arising from its share of prizes be totally destroyed and for what to gratify the whims of a whimsical sect who would have us not only forbear making more slaves but even manumit those we have but who is to indemnify their masters for the loss will the state do it is our treasury sufficient will the erika do it can they do it or would they to do what they think justice to the slaves   0 do a greater injustice to the owners and if we set our slaves free what is to be done with them few of them will return to their countries they know too well the greater hardships they must there be subject to they will not embrace our holy religion they will not adopt our manners our people will not pollute themselves by intermarrying with them must we maintain them as beggars in our streets or suffer our properties to be the prey of their pillage for men accustomed to slavery will not work for a livelihood when not compelled and what is there so pitiable in their present condition were they not slaves in their own countries are not spain portugal france and the italian states governed by despots who hold all their subjects in slavery without exception even england treats its sailors as slaves for they are whenever the government pleases seized and confined in ships of war condemned not only to work but to fight for small wages or a mere subsistence not better than our slaves are allowed by us is their condition then made worse by their falling into our hands no they have only exchanged one slavery for another and i may say a better for here they are brought into a land where the sun of islamism gives forth its light and shines in full splendor and they have an opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the true doctrine and thereby saving their immortal souls those who remain at home have not that happiness sending the slaves home then would be sending them out of light into darkness     i repeat the question what is to be done with them i have heard it suggested that they may be planted in the wilderness where there is plenty of land for them to subsist on and where they may flourish as a free state but they are i doubt too little disposed to labor without compulsion as well as too ignorant to establish a good government and the wild arabs would soon molest and destroy or again enslave them while serving us we take care to provide them with every thing and they are treated with humanity the laborers in their own country are as i am well informed worse fed lodged and clothed the condition of most of them is therefore already mended and requires no further improvement here their lives are in safety they are not liable to be impressed for soldiers and forced to cut one anothers christian throats as in the wars of their own countries if some of the religious mad bigots who now tease us with their silly petitions have in a fit of blind zeal freed their slaves it was not generosity it was not humanity that moved them to the action it was the conscious burthen of a load of sins and a hope from the supposed merits of so good a work to be excused from damnation how grossly are they mistaken to suppose slavery to be disallowed by the alcoran are not the two precepts to quote no more master treat your slaves with kindness slaves serve your masters with cheerfulness and fidelity clear proofs to the contrary nor can the plundering of infidels be in that sacred book forbidden since it is well known from it     that god has given the world and all that it contains to his faithful mussulmen who are to enjoy it of right as fast as they conquer it let us then hear no more of this detestable proposition the manumission of christian slaves the adoption of which would by depreciating our lands and houses and thereby depriving so many good citizens of their properties create universal discontent and provoke insurrections to the endangering of government and producing general confusion i have therefore no doubt but this wise council will prefer the comfort and happiness of a whole nation of true believers to the whim of a few erika and dismiss their petition the result was as martin tells us that the divan came to this resolution the doctrine that plundering and enslaving the christians is unjust is at best problematical but that it is the interest of this state to continue the practice is clear therefore let the petition be rejected and it was rejected accordingly and since like motives are apt to produce in the minds of men like opinions and resolutions may we not mr brown venture to predict from this account that the petitions to the parliament of england for abolishing the slave trade to say nothing of other legislatures and the debates upon them will have a similar conclusion i am sir your constant reader and humble servant historicus     benjamin franklin    march    0 philadelphia jane mecom

part of my strength thus i continue to live on while all the friends of my youth have left me and gone to join the majority i have however the pleasure of continued friendship and conversation with their children and grandchildren i do not repine at my malady though a severe one when i consider how well i am provided with every convenience to palliate it and to make me comfortable under it and how many more horrible evils the human body is subject to and what a long life of health i have been blessed with free from them all you have done well not to send me any more fish at present these

british government pretending that it is the western and not the eastern river of the bay of passamaquoddy which was designated by the name of st croix in the treaty of peace with that nation and requesting of me to communicate any facts which my memory or papers may enable me to recollect and which may indicate the true river which the commissioners on both sides had in their view to establish as the boundary between the two nations your letter found me under a severe fit of my malady which prevented my answering it sooner or attending indeed to any kind of business i now can assure you that i am perfectly clear in the remembrance that the map we used in tracing the boundary was brought to the treaty by the commissioners from england and that it was the same that was published by mitchell above twenty years before having a copy of that map by me in loose sheets i send you that sheet which contains the bay of passamaquoddy where you will see that part of the boundary traced i remember too that in that part of the boundary we relied much on the opinion of mr adams who had been concerned in some former disputes concerning those territories i think therefore that you may obtain still further light from him     that the map we used was mitchells map congress were acquainted at the time by a letter to their secretary for foreign affairs which i suppose may

he loved you very tenderly as he did all your family and i do not     doubt you will share my just sorrow i intended writing you the details of his death by m de chaumont but the duty of arranging his affairs and especially his papers prevented my answering your last as well as the one which your daughter was pleased to write me accompanying her work i have been touched with this mark of her condescension and friendship and i beg you to testify to her my gratitude until i have an opportunity of writing to her which will certainly be by the first occasion for france now as i am about writing her goodness will awaken me this letter will reach you by way of england i feel it my duty to profit by this occasion to inform you that my grandfather among other legacies has left all his papers and manuscripts to me with permission to turn them to what profit i can consequently i beg you my dear friend to show to no one that part of his life which he sent you some time since lest some one copy and publish it which would infinitely prejudice the publication which i propose to make as soon as possible of his entire life and of his other works as i have the original here of the part which you have it will not be necessary for you to send it to me but i beg you at all events to put it in an envelope well sealed addressed to me in order that by no accident it may get into other hands if however it should be necessary to assist the person who will pronounce his eulogy at the academy you may lend it for that purpose with the stipulation that no copy of it shall be made and with     such other precautions as you deem necessary the foreign representatives of our government have not yet been named it is possible i may be one which would put me in the way to assist in the publication of my grandfathers works but even if they think no more of me it is very probable that i shall conclude to go to europe inasmuch as i am persuaded i can derive more advantage from the publication in england or in france than in this country adieu for the present in two or three weeks i hope to be able to write to you directly as well as to my other friends male and female in france

interest and so continued at interest for ever which interest annually shall be laid out in silver medals and given as honorary rewards annually by the directors of the said free schools belonging to the said town in such manner as to the discretion of the selectmen of the said town shall seem meet out of the salary that may remain due to me as president of the state i do give the sum of two thousand pounds to my executors to be by them the survivors or survivor of them paid over to such person or persons as the legislature of this state by an act of assembly shall appoint to receive the same in trust to be employed for making the river schuylkill navigable and what money of mine shall at the time of my decease remain in the hands of my bankers     messrs ferdinand grand and son at paris or messrs smith wright and gray of london i will that after my debts are paid and deducted with the money legacies of this my will the same be divided into four equal parts two of which i give to my dear daughter sarah bache one to her son benjamin and one to my grandson william temple franklin during the number of years i was in business as a stationer printer and postmaster a great many small sums became due for books advertisements postage of letters and other matters which were not collected when in      i was sent by the assembly to england as their agent and by subsequent appointments continued there till      when on my return i was immediately engaged in the affairs of congress and sent to france in      where i remained nine years not returning till      and the said debts not being demanded in such a length of time are become in a manner obsolete yet are nevertheless justly due these as they are stated in my great folio ledger e i bequeath to the contributors of the pennsylvania hospital hoping that those debtors and the descendants of such as are deceased who now as i find make some difficulty of satisfying such antiquated demands as just debts may however be induced to pay or give them as charity to that excellent institution i am sensible that much must inevitably be lost but i hope something considerable may be recovered it is possible too that some of the parties charged may have existing old unsettled accounts against me in which case the managers     of the said hospital will allow and deduct the amount or pay the balance if they find it against me  my debts and legacies being all satisfied and paid the rest and residue of all my estate real and personal not herein expressly disposed of i do give and bequeath to my son and daughter richard and sarah bache i request my friends henry hill esquire john jay esquire francis hopkinson esquire and mr edward duffield of benfield in philadelphia county to be the executors of this my last will and testament and i hereby nominate and appoint them for that purpose i would have my body buried with as little expense or ceremony as may be i revoke all former wills by me made declaring this only to be my last seal in witness thereof i have hereunto set my hand and seal this seventeenth day of july in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eightyeight b franklin signed sealed published and declared by the abovenamed benjamin franklin for and as his last will and testament in the presence of us abraham shoemaker john jones george moore     codicil i benjamin franklin in the foregoing or annexed last will and testament named having further considered the same do think proper to make and publish the following codicil or addition thereto it having long been a fixed political opinion of mine that in a democratical state there ought to be no offices of profit for the reasons i had given in an article of my drawing in our constitution it was my intention when i accepted the office of president to devote the appointed salary to some public uses accordingly i had already before i made my will in july last given large sums of it to colleges schools building of churches etc and in that will i bequeathed two thousand pounds more to the state for the purpose of making the schuylkill navigable but understanding since that such a sum will do but little towards accomplishing such a work and that the project is not likely to be undertaken for many years to come and having entertained another idea that i hope may be more extensively useful i do hereby revoke and annul that bequest and direct that the certificates i have for what remains due to me of that salary be sold towards raising the sum of two thousand pounds sterling to be disposed of as i am now about to order it has been an opinion that he who receives an estate from his ancestors is under some kind of obligation to transmit the same to their posterity this     obligation does not lie on me who never inherited a shilling from any ancestor or relation i shall however if it is not diminished by some accident before my death leave a considerable estate among my descendants and relations the above observation is made merely as some apology to my family for making bequests that do not appear to have any immediate relation to their advantage i was born in boston new england and owe my first instructions in literature to the free grammarschools established there i have therefore already considered these schools in my will but i am also under obligations to the state of massachusetts for having unasked appointed me formerly their agent in england with a handsome salary which continued some years and although i accidentally lost in their service by transmitting governor hutchinsons letters much more than the amount of what they gave me i do not think that ought in the least to diminish my gratitude i have considered that among artisans good apprentices are most likely to make good citizens and having myself been bred to a manual art printing in my native town and afterwards assisted to set up my business in philadelphia by kind loans of money from two friends there which was the foundation of my fortune and of all the utility in life that may be ascribed to me i wish to be useful even after my death if possible in forming and advancing other young men that may be serviceable to their country in both those towns to this end i devote two thousand pounds sterling of which i give one thousand     thereof to the inhabitants of the town of boston in massachusetts and the other thousand to the inhabitants of the city of philadelphia in trust to and for the uses intents and purposes hereinafter mentioned and declared the said sum of one thousand pounds sterling if accepted by the inhabitants of the town of boston shall be managed under the direction of the selectmen united with the ministers of the oldest episcopalian congregational and presbyterian churches in that town who are to let out the sum upon interest at five per cent per annum to such young married artificers under the age of twentyfive years as have served an apprenticeship in the said town and faithfully fulfilled the duties required in their indentures so as to obtain a good moral character from at least two respectable citizens who are willing to become their sureties in a bond with the applicants for the repayment of the moneys so lent with interest according to the terms hereinafter prescribed all which bonds are to be taken for spanish milled dollars or the value thereof in current gold coin and the managers shall keep a bound book or books wherein shall be entered the names of those who shall apply for and receive the benefits of this institution and of their sureties together with the sums lent the dates and other necessary and proper records respecting the business and concerns of this institution and as these loans are intended to assist young married artificers in setting up their business they are to be proportioned by the discretion of the managers so as not to exceed sixty pounds     sterling to one person nor to be less than fifteen pounds and if the number of appliers so entitled should be so large as that the sum will not suffice to afford to each as much as might otherwise not be improper the proportion to each shall be diminished so as to afford to every one some assistance these aids may therefore be small at first but as the capital increases by the accumulated interest they will be more ample and in order to serve as many as possible in their turn as well as to make the repayment of the principal borrowed more easy each borrower shall be obliged to pay with the yearly interest one tenth part of the principal which sums of principal and interest so paid in shall be again let out to fresh borrowers and as it is presumed that there will always be found in boston virtuous and benevolent citizens willing to bestow a part of their time in doing good to the rising generation by superintending and managing this institution gratis it is hoped that no part of the money will at any time be dead or be diverted to other purposes but be continually augmenting by the interest in which case there may in time be more than the occasions in boston shall require and then some may be spared to the neighboring or other towns in the said state of massachusetts who may desire to have it such towns engaging to pay punctually the interest and the portions of the principal annually to the inhabitants of the town of boston if this plan is executed and succeeds as projected without interruption for one hundred years the sum will then be one hundred and thirtyone thousand     pounds of which i would have the managers of the donation to the town of boston then lay out at their discretion one hundred thousand pounds in public works which may be judged of most general utility to the inhabitants such as fortifications bridges aqueducts public buildings baths pavements or whatever may make living in the town more convenient to its people and render it more agreeable to strangers resorting thither for health or a temporary residence the remaining thirtyone thousand pounds i would have continued to be let out on interest in the manner above directed for another hundred years as i hope it will have been found that the institution has had a good effect on the conduct of youth and been of service to many worthy characters and useful citizens at the end of this second term if no unfortunate accident has prevented the operation the sum will be four millions and sixtyone thousand pounds sterling of which i leave one million sixtyone thousand pounds to the disposition of the inhabitants of the town of boston and three millions to the disposition of the government of the state not presuming to carry my views farther all the directions herein given respecting the disposition and management of the donation to the inhabitants of boston i would have observed respecting that to the inhabitants of philadelphia only as philadelphia is incorporated i request the corporation of that city to undertake the management agreeably to the said directions and i do hereby vest them with full and ample powers for that purpose and having considered that the covering a ground     plat with buildings and pavements which carry off most of the rain and prevent its soaking into the earth and renewing and purifying the springs whence the water of wells must gradually grow worse and in time be unfit for use as i find has happened in all old cities i recommend that at the end of the first hundred years if not done before the corporation of the city employ a part of the hundred thousand pounds in bringing by pipes the water of wissahickon creek into the town so as to supply the inhabitants which i apprehend may be done without great difficulty the level of the creek being much above that of the city and may be made higher by a dam i also recommend making the schuylkill completely navigable at the end of the second hundred years i would have the disposition of the four million and sixtyone thousand pounds divided between the inhabitants of the city of philadelphia and the government of pennsylvania in the same manner as herein directed with respect to that of the inhabitants of boston and the government of massachusetts it is my desire that this institution should take place and begin to operate within one year after my decease for which purpose due notice should be publicly given previous to the expiration of that year that those for whose benefit this establishment is intended may make their respective applications and i hereby direct my executors the survivors or survivor of them within six months after my decease to pay over the said sum of two thousand pounds sterling to such persons as shall be duly appointed     by the selectmen of boston and the corporation of philadelphia to receive and take charge of their respective sums of one thousand pounds each for the purposes aforesaid considering the accidents to which all human affairs and projects are subject in such a length of time i have perhaps too much flattered myself with a vain fancy that these dispositions if carried into execution will be continued without interruption and have the effects proposed i hope however that if the inhabitants of the two cities should not think fit to undertake the execution they will at least accept the offer of these donations as a mark of my goodwill a token of my gratitude and a testimony of my earnest desire to be useful to them after my departure i wish indeed that they may both undertake to endeavor the execution of the project because i think that though unforeseen difficulties may arise expedients will be found to remove them and the scheme be found practicable if one of them accepts the money with the conditions and the other refuses my will then is that both sums be given to the inhabitants of the city accepting the whole to be applied to the same purposes and under the same regulations directed for the separate parts and if both refuse the money of course remains in the mass of my estate and is to be disposed of therewith according to my will made the seventeenth day of july         0 i wish to be buried by the side of my wife if it may be and that a marble stone to be made by chambers six feet long four feet wide plain with only a small moulding round the upper edge and this inscription benjamin and deborah  franklin     — to be placed over us both my fine crabtree walkingstick with a gold head curiously wrought in the form of the cap of liberty i give to my friend and the friend of mankind general washington if it were a sceptre he has merited     it and would become it it was a present to me from that excellent woman madame de forbach the dowager duchess of deuxponts connected with some verses which should go with it i give my gold watch to my soninlaw richard bache and also the gold watch chain of the thirteen united states which i have not yet worn my timepiece that stands in my library i give to my grandson william temple franklin i give him also my chinese gong to my dear old friend mrs mary hewson i give one of my silver tankards marked     for her use during her life and after her decease i give it to her daughter eliza i give to her son william hewson who is my godson my new quarto bible oxford edition to be for his family bible and also the botanic description of the plants in the emperors garden at vienna in folio with colored cuts and to her son thomas hewson i give a set of spectators tatlers and guardians handsomely bound there is an error in my will where the bond of william temple franklin is mentioned as being four thousand pounds sterling whereas it is but for three thousand five hundred pounds i give to my executors to be divided equally among those that act the sum of sixty pounds sterling as some compensation for their trouble in the execution of my will and i request my friend mr duffield to accept moreover my french wayweiser a piece of clockwork in brass to be fixed to the wheel of any carriage and that my friend mr hill may also accept my silver creampot formerly given to me by the good doctor fothergill with the motto keep bright the chain my reflecting telescope made by short which was formerly mr cantons i give to my friend mr david rittenhouse for the use of his observatory my picture drawn by martin in      i give to the supreme executive council of pennsylvania if they shall be pleased to do me the honor of accepting it and placing it in their chamber since my will was made i have bought some more city lots near the centre part of the estate of joseph dean i would have them go with the other lots disposed     of in my will and i do give the same to my soninlaw richard bache to his heirs and assigns forever in addition to the annuity left to my sister in my will of fifty pounds sterling during her life i now add thereto ten pounds sterling more in order to make the sum sixty pounds i give twenty guineas to my good friend and physician dr john jones with regard to the separate bequests made to my daughter sarah in my will my intention is that the same shall be for her sole and separate use notwithstanding her coverture or whether she be covert or sole and i do give my executors so much right and power therein as may be necessary to render my intention effectual in that respect only this provision for my daughter is not made out of any disrespect i have for her husband and lastly it is my desire that this my present codicil be annexed to and considered as part of my last will and testament to all intents and purposes seal in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and seal this twentythird day of june anno domini one thousand seven hundred and eightynine b

business than that of a journeyman printer  i have already three printinghouses in three different colonies and purpose to set up a fourth if i can meet with a proper person to manage it having all materials ready for that purpose if the young man will venture over hither that i may see and be acquainted with him     we can treat about the affair and i make no doubt but he will think my proposals reasonable if we should not agree i promise him however a twelvemonths good work and to defray his passage back if he inclines to return to england i am sir your humble servant unknown b franklin benjamin franklin   july      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia   july      sir— i received your favor per mr hall who arrived here about two weeks since and from

advantageous to him i have already made him some proposals which he has under consideration and as we are like to agree on them we shall not i believe differ on the article of his passage money i am

force received a terrible blow fifty sail of the line destroyed would scarce be a greater loss to britain than that to us—and yet t was only a  0gunship sunk and about one hundred men drowned just as she was going out to sea on a   0 privateering voyage against the kings enemies she was overset by a flaw of wind being built too sharp and too highmasted a treaty is now holding at newtown in

lower rate than the english edition can be afforded at even if i paid but  s per volume i do what i can to lessen the credit of that piratical edition and talk much of the improvements made in this but that being to be had entire immediately and this not till after many months weighs a good deal with some and others object that it is to be apprehended the london booksellers will either curtail the folio edition greatly to save money or put the subscribers at last to the expense of a greater number of volumes than twenty seeing the volumes are much less than the irish edition the three first of the one containing but little more than the first of the other if they think fit to venture a parcel here hall will do his best to dispose of them and i will assist him what i can they may send a parcel also     to mr parker printer of new york a very honest punctual man i am glad all the bills i have sent you have been paid or accepted you may expect more in a short time and after the next parcel of books are paid for you will chiefly have to deal with mr hall into whose hands i have agreed to put the shop etc with all our best respects to you and yours heartily wishing you health and happiness i conclude your obliged humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia    november      sir— i received your favor

october      dear sir— i received your favor of april   th with the maps etc i am glad the polybius did not come and hope you will not have sent it when this reaches your hands it was intended for my son who was then in the army and seemed bent on a military life but as peace cuts off his prospect of advancement in that way he will apply himself to other business enclosed i send you his certificate from the governor of new york by which he is entitled to £     s  d sterling being his pay with a letter of attorney impowering you to receive it i know not what the deductions will be at the pay office but desire you will give my account credit for the net proceeds i am in daily expectation of a bill from virginia of £ 0 which i shall remit you towards the balance and mr hall will account with you for those things you have sent me that are put in his invoice   0 our accounts agree except that i have charged you £   s  d for the ainsworth sold james read the    being the proportion of charges on that book and the bill on geo rigge my account calls £    s   d yours £    s  d which is but a small variation and i know not but yours may be right i have lately sent a printinghouse to antigua by a very sober honest and diligent young man who has already as i am informed by divers hands gained the friendship of the principal people and is like to get into good business this will open another market for your books if you think fit to use it for i am persuaded that if you shall send him a parcel with any quantity of stationery he may write to you for he will make you good and punctual returns his name is thomas smith he is the only printer on that island had worked with me here and in my printinghouse in new york three or four years and always behaved extremely well mr thomas osborne bookseller of london is endeavoring to open a correspondence in the plantations for the sale of his books he has accordingly sent several parcels   to mr parker of new york   to mr read here and   to mr parks in virginia i have seen the invoices to parker and read and observe the books to be very high charged so that i believe they will not sell i recommended parker to you for books but he tells me he has wrote you several letters and in two of them sent a guinea to purchase some small things but never received any answer perhaps the guineas made the letters miscarry he is a very honest punctual man and will     be in the way of selling a great many books i think you might find your account in writing to him mr read having left off bookselling osborne has wrote to me and desired me to take those books into my hands proposing a correspondence etc but i have declined it in a letter per this ship my spouse will write to mrs strahan to whom my best respect by this time twelvemonth if nothing extraordinary happens to prevent it i hope to have the pleasure of seeing you both in london being with great esteem and affection dear sir your obliged friend and servant b franklin p s—you will find mr geo smith one of the witnesses to the power of attorney at the pennsylvania coffeehouse he goes over in this ship benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia    november      dear sir— i have just time to acquaint you that yours per cowie is this moment come to hand with mr reads account etc i shall use my best endeavors to get your money and am not without hopes of succeeding i wrote you on the   th past and sent a power with the first of the enclosed certificates which i hope will get safe to hand you may depend on having the balance of my account in a few months i am sir your obliged and humble servant b franklin     i have desired dr mitchell to pay you three guineas being the price of a fireplace sent him for the duke of argyle benjamin franklin   december      james read to j read   december      dear sir— t is some time since i received a considerable account against you from england an unwillingness to give you concern has hitherto prevented my mentioning it to you by comparing the moderation and long forbearance toward you of mr strahan to whom you owe so much with your treatment of an old friend in distress bred up with you under the same roof and who owes you so little you may perceive how much you have misunderstood yourself t is with regret i now acquaint you that even while you were talking to me in that lofty strain yesterday concerning mr grace i had in my pocket the power of attorney to recover of you £      s  d sterling a balance long due it will be your own fault if it comes to be known for i have mentioned it to nobody and i now ask you how you would in your own case like those petty pieces of practice you so highly contended for of summoning a day only before the court lest the cause should be made up and fees thereby prevented and of carrying on a suit privately against a man in another county than that in which he lives and may every day be found getting a judgment by default and taking him by surprise with an execution when he happens to come where you have sued     him etc etc i should be glad to have that account against my friend grace with all the little charges you have so cunningly accumulated on it that i may communicate it to him and doubt not but he will immediately order you payment it appears not unlikely to me that he may soon get through all his difficulties and as i know him goodnatured and benevolent to a high degree so i believe he will be above resenting the illtreatment he has received from some that are now so fond of insulting him and from whom he might have expected better things but i think you would do well not to treat others in the same manner for fortunes wheel is often turning and all are not alike forgiving i request as soon as it suits your convenience that you will take the proper measures with regard to mr strahans account and i am your humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia    april      sir— i suppose mr hall will acquaint you that i have settled with him for those things you sent me that were charged in his invoice enclosed are the following bills viz  £ s d richard grahams    0   james mcnabs    0 0 hammond  co        hammond  co     0 hammond  co   0 0  £            which with my sons wages and a remittance i ordered you from the west indies and suppose may be in your hands before this time will i imagine near balance our account in a former letter i promised to write you largely about your affairs with mr read and the measures taken to recover your money before i received your power of attorney and account there was a misunderstanding between us occasioned by his endeavoring to get a small office from me clerk to the assembly which i took the more amiss as we had always been good friends and the office could not have been of much service to him the salary being small but valuable to me as a means of securing the public business to our printinghouse so as we were not on speaking terms when your account came to hand and the influence i had over him as a friend was become little or nothing it was some time before i mentioned it to him but at length the ice was broke in the following manner i have a friend in the country that assisted me when i first set up whose affairs have lately been in some disorder occasioned chiefly by his too great good nature his creditors coming at the same time in a crowd upon him i had made up with several of them for him but mr read being employed in one small case a debt of £   only carried on by some contrivance in the law which i dont understand a private action against him by summoning him in this county when he lives in another and obtained a judgment against him without his or my knowing any thing of the matter and then came to me knowing i had a great     affection for mr grace and in a very insulting manner asked what shall i do with your friend grace i have got a judgment against him and must take out execution if the debt is not immediately satisfied etc upon enquiring into the matter and understanding how it had been carried on i grew a little warm blamed his practice as irregular and unfair and his conduct towards mr grace to whom his father and family had been much obliged as ungrateful and said that since he looked on me as mr graces friend he should have told me of the action before he commenced it that i might have prevented it and saved the charges arising on it and his not doing so could be only from a view of the small fees it produced him in carrying it through all the courts etc he justified his practice and said it was legal and frequent denied that his father or family were under any obligation to mr grace alleged that grace had used him ill in employing another lawyer in some of his own actions when at the same time he owed him near £  and added haughtily that he was determined to sue grace on his own account if not speedily paid and so saying left me very abruptly i thought this a good opportunity of introducing your affair imagining that a consciousness of his ill behavior to me and my friend would pique him to make immediate payment accordingly i wrote him a letter the next day of which i send you the rough draft enclosed together with his answer since which several other letters passed on the same subject of which i have no copies all i insisted on since he declared his     inability to pay at present was that he should give you his bond so that in case of his death you might come in for payment prior to common creditors and that he should allow you interest from the time the money became due in the common course of payments he agreed to give his bond but it has been delayed from time to time till this day when on my writing to him again to know what account i should send you i received from him the enclosed billet in which he refuses to allow interest for the time past as he cannot be compelled to pay interest on a book account i desired him then to fill up and execute a bond to you for the principal and he might settle the affair of the interest with you hereafter accordingly he has just now done it so that interest will arise for the time to come but as he threatens to pay very speedily and i am persuaded may easily do it by the help of his relations who are wealthy i hope you will not have much interest to receive he has a great many good qualities for which i love him but i believe he is as you say sometimes a little crazy if the debt were to me i could not sue him so i believe you will not desire me to do it for you but he shall not want pressing though i scarce ever dun for myself because i think his relations may and will help him if properly applied to and mr hall thinks with me that urging him frequently may make him more considerate and induce him to abridge some of his unnecessary expenses the bond is made payable in a month from the day and for your encouragement i may add that notwithstanding what he affects to say of the     badness of his circumstances i look on the debt to be far from desperate please to send me chambers dictionary the best edition and charge it in mr halls invoice my compliments to good mrs strahan my dame writes to her i am with great esteem and affection dear sir your most obliged friend and humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   july      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia   july      dear sir— i wrote to you very fully per arthur concerning your affair with mr read and shall have nothing to add on that subject till i hear further from you i acquainted you that he had given his bond for the balance due to you and that i do not look on the debt as desperate enclosed i send you several second bills having sent the first per arthur i hope to hear per next ship that you have received my sons pay since i understand there was a parliament in march last for a sum to defray all the charges of the canada expedition if it should prove otherwise i will send the balance from hence in the fall and make you satisfaction for the delay and disappointment the library company send to mr collinson by this ship for a parcel of books i have recommended you to him on the occasion and hope you will have the selling of them if you should and the company judge your charges reasonable i doubt not but you will keep their custom     i fear i shall not have the pleasure of seeing you this year perhaps the next i may please to send me a book lately advertised i think it is called a collection of sentences wise sayings etc by some officer about the parliament house his name i have forgot with all our best respects to you and yours i am dear sir your most obliged friend and servant b franklin what is the price of printing paper in london benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia    october      dear sir— i hope before this can reach you your parliament will have met and ordered payment of what has been so long due on account of the canada expedition in the settling our account i will make you a reasonable allowance for the disappointment occasioned by the delay of my sons bill j read has removed into a house of less rent which i was well pleased with i have had no talk with him lately about your affairs but still hope the best and it shall not be long before i take an opportunity of urging him to discharge some part of the bond i am now engaged in a new public affair as you will see by the enclosed which i hope with gods blessing will very soon be in good train i have not laid aside my intention of seeing england and believe shall execute it next year if nothing extraordinary     occurs in which your conversation is not one of the least pleasures i propose to myself i hope this will find you and good mrs strahan safe returned from your northern journey i am just setting out on one and have only time to add that i am with great esteem and sincere affection dear sir your most obliged humble servant b franklin p s—please to give my account credit for what you receive by the enclosed power of attorney and let me know the sum that i may pay the person here benjamin franklin   february    0 philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia   february    0    dear sir— i wrote you per capt budden who sailed the beginning of december and sent you a bill of exchange on jonathan gurnel  co for £ 0 and desired you to send one viners bacon and danvers abridgments of the law with woods and cokes institutes i have no copy of the letter and forget whether i added the complete attorney in six or eight volumes  vo the precedents in english please to send that also i likewise desired you to enter my sons name william franklin in one of the inns of court as a student of law which i am told costs between £  and £  and to let me know what time must expire before he can be called to the bar after such entry because he intends to go to london a year or two before to finish his studies   0 i hope that letter got to hand i see they have printed a new translation of tully on old age please to send me one of them mr hall continues well and goes on perfectly to my satisfaction my respects to mrs strahan and master billy i have not time to add but that i am with great esteem and affection dear sir your most obliged humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   june    0 philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia   june    0 dear sir— the person from whom you had the power of attorney to receive a legacy was born in holland and at first called aletta crell but not being christened when the family came to live among the english in america she was baptized by the name of mary this change of name probably might be unknown to the testator as it happened in carolina and so the legacy might be left her by her first name aletta she has wrote it on a piece of paper which i enclose and desires you would take the trouble of acquainting the gentleman with these particulars which she thinks may induce him to pay the money i am glad to understand by the papers that the parliament has provided for paying off the debts due on the canada expedition i suppose my sons pay is now in your hands i am willing to allow   per cent the rate of interest here for the delay or more if the disappointment has been a greater loss     to you i hope the £ 0 bill i lately sent you is come to hand and paid the description you give of the company and manner of living in scotland would almost tempt one to remove thither your sentiments of the general foible of mankind in the pursuit of wealth to no end are expressed in a manner that gave me great pleasure in reading they are extremely just at least they are perfectly agreeable to mine but london citizens they say are ambitious of what they call dying worth a great sum the very notion seems to me absurd and just the same as if a man should run in debt for  000 superfluities to the end that when he should be stripped of all and imprisoned by his creditors it might be said he broke worth a great sum i imagine that what we have above what we can use is not properly ours though we possess it and that the rich man who must die was no more worth what he leaves than the debtor who must pay i am glad to hear so good a character of my soninlaw please to acquaint him that his spouse grows finely and will probably have an agreeable person that with the best natural disposition in the world she discovers daily the seeds and tokens of industry economy and in short of every female virtue which her parents will endeavor to cultivate for him and if the success answer their fond wishes and expectations she will in the true sense of the word be worth a great deal of money and consequently a great fortune      i suppose my wife writes to mrs strahan our friend mr hall is well and manages perfectly to my satisfaction i cannot tell how to accept your repeated thanks for services you think i have done to him when i continually feel myself obliged to him and to you for sending him i sincerely wish all happiness to you and yours and am dear sir your most obliged humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    june      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia    june      dear sir— i received yours of march   th with the books per smith in good order and your account which agrees with mine except in a trifle the share of the charges on ainsworth carried to j reads account i am concerned at your lying so long out of your money and must think of some way of making you amends i have wrote to smith at antigua to quicken him in discharging his debt to you i purpose god willing to go over with my son as soon as it becomes necessary for him to go  when i hope to have the pleasure of finding you and yours well and happy in the parcel of books i had from you      i think the last parcel there were a number of law books when i quitted the shop to mr hall they were left in his hands for sale the person who had ordered them not taking them now we have lost or mislaid the invoice between us and     cannot settle for those books without your help i must therefore beg the favor of

received your favor by my son and return my thanks for your kind entertainment of him at your house i delivered yours to my friend bartram and enclose to you his answer he is much pleased with the prospect of a continued correspondence with you he is a man of no letters but a curious observer of nature i like very well the paragraph you propose to insert concerning mr jacksons papers except the last line to wit the improvement of it must be deferred till another year instead of which i would say it cannot now be inserted but shall be in our next my reasons are that i think in the first     place your essays ought to be more frequent than once a year next that it is a pity if mr jacksons papers would be advantageous to the public a whole years benefit of them should be lost thirdly he will be at a loss to know why since your essay was not quite finished and published his papers might not as well have been added now and indeed i think you had best add them unless you intend speedily another essay lastly i object to the word improvement which in the sense you use it is peculiar to new england and will not be understood elsewhere it will look as if you proposed to alter it for the better correct or amend it such being the common meaning of the word improve every colony has some peculiar expressions familiar to its own people but strange and unintelligible to others this is not to be wondered at since the same may be observed in the different counties of england i know you will excuse this freedom and that i need make no apology for it i am with great respect dear sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    march      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia    march      dear sir— i wrote to you in the winter via new york for a few books and sent a bill

dear sir your obliged humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   august      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia   august      dear sir— i wrote to you on the  0th of june

second is published please to send it bound dark sprinkled filleted and lettered     i wrote you a few days since recommending to your notice an old acquaintance who is bound home from maryland to obtain holy orders his name matthias harris any civilities you show him as he will be an entire stranger in london i shall gratefully acknowledge only i ought to acquaint you that he has always had a strong penchant to the buying of books and that some late misfortunes have rendered it more inconvenient to him to gratify that taste than it has been heretofore my wife son and daughter desire to be respectfully remembered to you mrs strahan and master billy i am dear sir your obliged humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   december      philadelphia john franklin to john franklin  philadelphia   december      dear brother— reflecting yesterday on your desire to have a flexible catheter a thought struck into my mind how one might probably be made and lest you should not readily conceive it by any description of mine i went immediately to the silversmiths and gave directions for making one sitting by till it was finished that it might be ready for this post but now it is done i have some apprehensions that it may be too large to be easy if so a silversmith can easily make it less by twisting or turning it on a smaller wire and putting a smaller pipe to the end if the pipe be really necessary this machine     may either be covered with small fine gut first cleaned and soaked a night in a solution of alum and salt and water then rubbed dry which will preserve it longer from putrefaction then wet again and drawn on and tied to the pipes at each end where little hollows are made for the thread to bind in and the surface greased or perhaps it may be used without the gut having only a little tallow rubbed over it to smooth it and fill the joints i think it is as flexible as would be expected in a thing of the kind and i imagine will readily comply with the terms of the passage yet has stiffness enough to be protruded if not the enclosed wire may be used to stiffen the hinder part of the pipe while the fore part is pushed forward and as it proceeds the wire may be gradually withdrawn the tube is of such a nature that when you have occasion to withdraw it its diameter will lessen whereby it will move more easily it is a kind of screw and may be both withdrawn and introduced by turning experience is necessary for the right using of all new tools or instruments and that will perhaps suggest some improvements to this instrument as well as better direct the manner of using it i have read whytt on limewater you desire my thoughts on what he says but what can i say he relates facts and experiments and they must be allowed good if not contradicted by other facts and experiments may not one guess by holding limewater some time in ones mouth whether it is likely to injure the bladder i know not what to advise either as to the injection   0 or the operation i can only pray god to direct you for the best and to grant success i am my dear brother yours most affectionately b franklin  i found whytts experiments are approved and recommended by dr mead dear brother—with regard to our fathers estate i can only so far inform you that the household stuff as sold at vendue amounted to a little more than  00 but the house and land was apprised at  000      benjamin franklin   may      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia   may      dear sir— i have your favor of january  0th and thank you for the

pressmaker to go out of his old road a little i would have the ribs made not with the face rounding outwards as usual but a little hollow or rounding inwards from end to end and the cramps made of hard cast brass fixed not across the ribs but longways so as to slide in the hollow face of the ribs the reason is that brass and iron work better together than iron and iron such a press never gravels the hollow face of the ribs keeps the oil better and the cramps bearing on a larger surface do not wear as in the common method of this i have had many years experience i need not desire you to agree with the workmen on the most reasonable terms you can and as this affair will give you trouble pray charge commission i shall not think myself a whit the less obliged     my compliments to mrs strahan master billy etc in which my wife and children join with dear sir your most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia    april      dear sir— by capt gibbon i received a copy of yours per the myrtilla but she is not yet arrived i am glad to hear the bills i sent you for £ 00 sterling are accepted and that the goods were to be shipped soon for connecticut bryant is arrived in new york who left london the middle of march i have not heard whether he has brought them i now enclose you a bill for £ 0 sterling drawn by mr stevens on alexander grant merchant london and what balance may remain unpaid i will send as soon as i can know it i am glad you have sent again the things that were shipped on the davis as to that loss give yourself no concern about it it is mine and but a trifle i do not know or regard what the custom of merchants may be in such cases but when i reflect how much trouble i have given you from time to time in my little affairs that you never charged me commissions and have frequently been in advance for me were the loss much greater be sure i should not suffer it to fall on you benjamin mecom writes me that he has remitted you £ 0 sterling which i am pleased to hear and am glad you have not sent him the great parcel of     books which you mention he has wrote for he is a young lad quite unacquainted with the world and i fear would be much embarrassed if he went suddenly into dealings too deep for his stock the people of those islands might buy his books but i know they are very dull pay and he would find it impracticable to collect the money when it ought to be sent you pray keep him within bounds let him have good salable sortments but small and do not suffer him to be more than £ 0 in your debt if so much it is best for him to proceed gradually and to deal more as his stock and experience increases i am thankful to you for prudently delaying to send what he indiscreetly wrote for till you had advised me of it our compliments to mrs strahan and your children i am with great esteem dear sir your most humble servant b franklin please to send me

chandler which i doubt not will be readily paid i know not well how my account stands with you and should be glad to see it but suppose this bill will leave a balance in your hands after paying for those founts so have taken the freedom to draw a small bill on you payable to nathl voogdt  co merchants london for £    s  d sterling which they are to remit to germany on a particular occasion my compliments to mrs strahan and to your promising son perhaps one day mine god send our children good and suitable matches for i begin to feel a parents cares in that respect and fondly wish to see

interesting facts in it at the end a little piece of mine endorsed in pencil in franklins handwriting observations on the late and present conduct of the french with regard to their encroachments upon the british colonies in north america together with remarks on the importance of those colonies to great britain by william clarke to which are added by another hand observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of colonies etc     benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia    november      dear sir— i have yours of october  d bolitha being just arrived the things not yet come on shore by the account sent i find i was then £    s  d sterling in your debt i hope you have since received the bills i sent you per joy  budden for £ 0   s  d sterling which will leave a balance in my favor i do not at all approve of b mecoms being so much in your debt and shall write to him about it the people of those islands expect a great deal of credit and when the books are out of his hands if he should die half would not be collected this i have learned by experience in the case of poor smith whom i first settled there i am glad therefore that you declined sending him the other things he wrote for pray write to him for the pay and make him keep touch that will oblige him to dun quick and get in his debts otherwise he may hurt himself and you in the end remember i give you this caution and that you venture on your own risk i shall be glad to be of any service to you in the affair you mention relating to the gentlemans magazine and our daughter who already trades a little in london is willing to undertake the distributing of them per post from this place hoping it may produce some profit to herself i will immediately cause advertisements to be printed in the papers here at new york new haven and boston recommending that magazine and proposing to supply all who will   0 subscribe for them at   s this currency a year the subscribers paying down the money for one year beforehand for otherwise there will be a considerable loss by bad debts as soon as i find out what the subscription will produce i shall know what number to send for most of those for new england must be sent to boston those for new york connecticut pennsylvania and maryland must be sent to new york or philadelphia as opportunities offer to one place or the other as to virginia i believe it will scarce be worth while to propose it there the gentlemen being generally furnished with them by their correspondents in london those who incline to continue must pay for the second year three months before the first expires and so on from time to time the postmaster in those places to take in the subscription money and distribute the magazines etc these are my first thoughts i shall write further that magazine has always been in my opinion by far the best i think it never wants matter both entertaining and instructive or i might now and then furnish you with some little pieces from this part of the world my wife and daughter join in sincerest good wishes of prosperity to you and all yours with dear sir your most obedient humble servant b franklin my respects to mr newberry of whom you give so amiable a character     benjamin franklin   july      new york william strahan to william strahan new york

and letters he writes me that he has lately sent you a bill for £ 00 sterling and being now employed only in collecting his debts he hopes soon to send you a bill for the balance of your account about £ 0 more as the £ 0 bill you received of me in november      was only lent to his account and he will now pay his whole balance without reckoning that £ 0 you will please to take it back to my account when he has settled     and paid off his whereby a balance will remain in my favor but in the meantime lest that should not be so soon done as he proposes that you may not be longer in advance for me i enclose a little bill on mr collinson for £    0s  ½d the balance due to you but desire you would not forget to take back the £ 0 into your hands for me when you settle finally with b mecom who writes me that he proposes going for england this present july you judge rightly that my many employments and journeys of late have prevented my carrying into execution the proposed scheme of circulating your magazine but i think now to write to the postmaster as soon as i get home and order the advertisements into the papers with the greatest respect and esteem i am dear sir your obliged

philadelphia one of our newspapers printed on the new letter you sent us and find that it is not a brevier body but larger and is really and truly no other than the burgeois no   of carlons specimen now lying before me which burgeois is marked by a pen with his own hand price  s so that the charging it as brevier at  s  d is an imposition of twentyfive per cent which is too much to bear and therefore i do insist on his     doing me justice and refunding the additional sixpences or he will forfeit the character he always bore with me that of an honest man i enclose you a piece of the newspaper for your satisfaction compare it with his specimen and you will find what i say precisely true the sum to be returned is £     s  d for which when received please give to my account credit lord loudon arrived last week i have had the honor of several conferences with him on our american affairs and am extremely pleased with him i think there cannot be a fitter person for the service he is engaged in i propose to return tomorrow to philadelphia where i hope things will soon be on a better footing as we expect a new governor of whom we hear a good character my best compliments to mrs strahan and your children i am dear friend yours affectionately b franklin p s—since my last i have a letter from b mecom who writes that he has sent you a £ 0 bill i send a whole newspaper instead of the piece mentioned above as there is some news in it benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan philadelphia    december      dear sir— this serves only to cover a bill of exchange drawn by b mecom on you upon a supposition that you have received bills he sent you from     antigua for about £  0 more than the balance of your account if those bills are not come to hand or not paid you need not be at the trouble of protesting this bill but let it lie in your hands till you hear farther from me if those bills are paid then please to carry this £ 00 to my account b mecom has settled honorably with me and bought my old printinghouse that he had at antigua he wants some new letter which he now writes for lest his bills above mentioned should fail i have given him a draft on my friend collinson for £ 0 sterling which he now sends to you he purposes to set up in boston my respects affectionately to you and yours particularly my son billy it gives

william strahan philadelphia   january      dear sir— i wrote you a line or two yesterday enclosing b mecoms second bill for £ 00 sterling drawn on you upon presumption that you had received some bills he had sent you to the amount of £  0 more than the balance of his account he has settled honorably with me and bought the old antigua office of me and is gone to boston to set up his business there among his friends and relations and has wrote to you to purchase him two new founts one of long primer and one of pica for which i have furnished him with a bill on mr collinson     for £ 0 lest you should not have received his money i now send b mecoms third bill if you are not in cash for him you need not be at the charge or trouble of protesting it but only acquaint me if you are carry it

already takes off part of her mothers family cares this must give you and mrs strahan pleasure so that account is partly balanced our assembly talk of sending me to england speedily then look out

bill for £ 00 sterling the  d and  d sent before     benjamin franklin william strahan to mr strahan oh my dear friend— i never was more surprised than on reading your note i grieve for you for mrs strahan for mr johnston for the little ones and your whole family the loss is indeed a great one she was every thing that one could wish in every relation i do not offer you the common topics of consolation i know by experience how little they avail that the natural affections must have their course and that the best remedy for grief is time mrs stevenson joins her tears with mine god comfort you all yours most affectionately b franklin wednesday morn benjamin franklin   june      william heberden to dr william heberden craven street   june      sir— i now return the smallest of your two tourmalins with hearty thanks for your kind present of the other which though i value highly for its rare and wonderful properties i shall ever esteem it more for the friendship i am honored with by the giver i hear that the negative electricity of one side of the tourmalin when heated is absolutely denied and what has been related of it ascribed to prejudice in favor of a system by some ingenious gentlemen abroad who profess to have made the experiments on the stone with care and exactness the experiments have succeeded differently with me yet i would not call the accuracy of those gentlemen in question possibly the tourmalins they have tried     were not properly cut so that the positive and negative powers were obliquely placed or in some manner whereby their effects were confused or the negative parts more easily supplied by the positive perhaps the lapidaries who have hitherto cut these stones had no regard to the situation of the two powers but chose to make the faces of the stone where they could obtain the greatest breadth or some other advantage in the form if any of these stones in their natural state can be procured here i think it would be right to endeavor finding before they are cut the two sides that contain the opposite powers and make the faces there possibly in that case the effects might be stronger and more distinct for though both these stones that i have examined have evidently the two properties yet without the full heat given by boiling water they are somewhat confused the virtue seems strongest towards one end of the face and in the middle or near the other end scarce discernible and the negative i think always weaker than the positive i have had the large one new cut so as to make both sides alike and find the change of form has made no change as i found them before it is now set in a ring in such a manner as to turn on an axis that i may conveniently in making experiments come at both sides of the stone the little rim of gold it is set in has made no alteration in its effects the warmth of my finger when i wear it is sufficient to give it some degree of electricity so that it is always ready to attract light bodies the following experiments have satisfied me that     m epinus account of the positive and negative states of the opposite sides of the heated tourmalin is well founded i heated the large stone in boiling water as soon as it was dry i brought it near a very small cork ball that was suspended by a silk thread the ball was attracted by one face of the stone which i call a and then repelled the ball in that state was also repelled by the positively charged wire of a phial and attracted by the other side of the stone b the stone being fresh heated and the side b brought near the ball it was first attracted and presently after repelled by that side in this second state it was repelled by the negatively charged wire of a phial therefore if the principles now generally received relating to positive and negative electricity are true the side a of the large stone when the stone is heated in water is in a positive state of electricity and the side b in a negative state the same experiments being made with the small stone with sealingwax the same effects are produced the flat side of the small stone gives the signs of positive electricity the high side gives the signs of negative electricity again   i suspended the small stone by a silk thread   i heated it as it hung in boiling water   i heated the large one in boiling water then i brought the large stone near to the suspended small one     which immediately turned its flat side to the side b of the large stone and would cling to it i turned the ring so as to present the side a of the large stone to the flat side of the small one the flat side was repelled and the small stone turning quick applied its high side to the side a of the large one this was precisely what ought to happen on the supposition that the flat side of the small stone when heated in water is positive and the high side negative the side a of the large stone positive and the side b negative the effect was apparently the same as would have been produced if one magnet had been suspended by a thread and the different poles of another brought alternately near it i find that the face a of the large stone being coated with leaf gold attached by the white of an egg which will bear dipping in hot water becomes quicker and stronger in its effect on the cork ball repelling it the instant it comes in contact which i suppose to be occasioned by the united force of different parts of the face collected and acting together through the metal i am etc b franklin benjamin franklin  0 august      mary stevenson to miss mary stevenson craven street  0 august      we are to set out this week for holland where we may possibly spend a month but purpose to be at home again before the coronation i could not go   0 without taking leave of you by a line at least when i am so many letters in your debt in yours of may   th which i have before me you speak of the ease with which salt water may be made fresh by distillation supposing it to be as i had said that in evaporation the air would take up water but not the salt that was mixed with it it is true that distilled sea water will not be salt but there are other disagreeable qualities that rise with the water in distillation which indeed several besides dr hales have endeavored by some means to prevent but as yet their methods have not been brought much into use i have a singular opinion on this subject which i will venture to communicate to you though i doubt not you will rank it among my whims it is certain that the skin has imbibing as well as discharging pores witness the effects of a blisteringplaster etc i have read that a man hired by a physician to stand by way of experiment in the open air naked during a moist night weighed near three pounds heavier in the morning i have often observed myself that however thirsty i may have been before going into the water to swim i am never long so in the water these imbibing pores however are very fine perhaps fine enough in filtering to separate salt from water for though i have soaked by swimming when a boy several hours in the day for several days successively in salt water i never found my blood and jucies salted by that means so as to make me thirsty or feel a salt taste in my mouth and it is remarkable that the flesh of sea fish though bred in salt water is not salt     hence i imagine that if people at sea distressed by thirst when their fresh water is unfortunately spent would make bathingtubs of their empty watercasks and filling them with sea water sit in them an hour or two each day they might be greatly relieved perhaps keeping their clothes constantly wet might have an almost equal effect and this without danger of catching cold men do not catch cold by wet clothes at sea damp but not wet linen may possibly give colds but no one catches cold by bathing and no clothes can be wetter than water itself why damp clothes should then occasion colds is a curious question the discussion of which i reserve for a future letter or some future conversation adieu my little philosopher present my respectful compliments to the good ladies your aunts and to miss pitt and believe me ever your affectionate friend etc b franklin benjamin franklin  0 march      london to rev m ——— london  0 march      revd sir— i am favored with yours of the   th instant enclosing a bank note of £ 0 which makes £ 0 now repaid by overal i acquainted you in mine by last saturdays post that i had reason to think the whole sum to be repaid would not be so great as i before computed it and perhaps not exceed £   or £ 0 it will be a pleasure to me to find it so that i may have no occasion to have recourse to the law which is so disagreeable a thing to me     that through the whole course of my life i have never entered an action against any man but i own i was not a little provoked with these people as i concluded they must certainly have known of the mortgage and indeed the letters they have since produced show that they did particularly the last you mentioned of december         and yet when i asked them if there was no mortgage or other incumbrance on the estate the man said none that he knew or had ever heard of and the woman added and to be sure if there had been any such thing in so long a time as we have received the rent we must have heard of it there was such an apparent simplicity in their manner and they answered with such readiness and confidence that i was perfectly satisfied and therefore the more surprised and chagrined when i afterwards found how easily i had been imposed on they likewise had instructed mr winterbottom to assure the purchaser as he did me that the house had lately undergone a thorough repair whereas spofford in his letter had informed them it will soon want a great deal of repair i think with you that they are weak and foolish people but there seems no small mixture of knavery with their folly i likewise imagined as you do that they were but little accustomed to money from some conversation between them when they were about to receive it the man said he had been bred to a trade but that he never liked to work at it well my dear says she you know you will now have no occasion ever to work any more they seemed to think it so great a sum that it could never be spent     i am very sensible sir that this must have been a disagreeable affair to you and i am the more obliged the very mutilated and generous manner in which you have executed it will ever demand my thankful acknowledgment which i beg you to accept and believe me with the sincerest esteem and respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    june probably      william strahan to william strahan saturday    june

formerly a merchant of figure and credit in north america being by various misfortunes reduced to poverty is here in great distress and would be made happy by any employment that would only enable him

over which are touched on in that letter are at an end he is a very honest man but too much dispirited to put himself forward cannot some smouting in the writing way be got for him or some little

to good mr strahan     benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia jared ingersoll to jared ingersoll  philadelphia    december      dear sir— i thank you for your kind congratulations it gives me pleasure to hear from an old friend it will give me much more pleasure to see him i hope therefore nothing will prevent the journey you propose for next summer and the favor you intend me of a visit i believe i must make a journey early in the spring to virginia but purpose being back again before the hot weather you will be kind enough to let me know beforehand what time you expect to be here that i may not be out of the way for that would mortify me exceedingly i should be glad to know what it is that distinguishes connecticut religion from common religion communicate if you please some of these particulars that you think will amuse me as a virtuoso when i travelled in flanders i thought of your excessively strict observation of sunday and that a man could hardly travel on that day among you upon his lawful occasions without hazard of punishment while where i was every one travelled if he pleased or diverted himself in any other way and in the afternoon both high and low went to the play or the opera where there was plenty of singing fiddling and dancing i looked around for gods judgments but saw no signs of them the cities were well built and full of inhabitants the markets filled with plenty the people well favored and well clothed the fields well tilled the cattle fat and strong the fences     houses and windows all in repair and no old tenor anywhere in the country which would almost make one suspect that the deity is not so angry at that offence as a new england justice i left our friend mr jackson well and i had the great happiness of finding my little family well when i came home and my friends as cordial and more numerous than ever may every prosperity attend you and yours i am dear friend yours affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    march      william strahan to william strahan    march         i have received your favors of october  0th and november  st by my son who is safely arrived with my new daughter i thank you for your friendly congratulations on his promotion i am just returned from a journey i made with him through his government and had the pleasure of seeing him everywhere received with the utmost respect and even affection of all ranks of people as to myself i mentioned to you in a former letter that i found my friends here more numerous and as hearty as ever it had been industriously reported that i had lived very extravagantly in england and wasted a considerable sum of the public money which i had received out of your treasury for the province but the assembly when they came to examine my accounts and allow me for my services found themselves £      0s d sterling in my debt     to the utter confusion of the propagators of that falsehood and the surprise of all they had made to believe it the house accordingly ordered that sum to be paid me and that the speaker should moreover present me with their thanks for my fidelity etc in transacting their affairs i congratulate you on the glorious peace your ministry have made the most advantageous to britain in my opinion of any your annals have recorded as to the places left or restored to france i conceive our strength will now soon increase to so great a degree in north america that in any future war we may with ease redeem them all and therefore i look upon them as so many hostages or pledges of good behavior from that perfidious nation your pamphlets and papers therefore that are wrote against the peace with some plausibility give me pleasure as i hope the french will read them and be persuaded they have made an excellent bargain    benjamin franklin   may      to ———   may      i congratulate you sincerely on the signing of the definitive treaty which if agreeable to the preliminaries gives us peace the most advantageous as well as glorious that was ever before attained by britain throughout this continent i find it universally approved and applauded and am glad to find the same sentiment prevailing in your parliament and the unbiased part of the nation grumblers there will     always be among you where power and places are worth striving for and those who cannot obtain them are angry with all that stand in their way such would have clamored against a ministry not their particular friends even if instead of canada and louisiana they had obtained a cession of the kingdom of heaven    benjamin franklin    june      new york william strahan to william strahan new york    june      dear friend— you will hear before this reaches you that the indians have renewed their hostilities they have not as usual made any previous complaint and various conjectures are therefore made of the cause some think it is merely to secure their hunting countries which they apprehend we mean to take from them by force and turn them into plantations though the apprehension is without ground others that too little notice of them has been taken since the reduction of canada no presents made them as before others that they are offended at the prohibition of selling them rum or powder but i do not find this prohibition has been general and as to powder that enough has been allowed them all for their hunting others that they acquired a relish for plunder in the late war and would again enjoy the sweets of it others that it is the effect of a large belt sent among them by the french commander in the illinois country before he heard of the peace to excite them to renew the war and assure them of     supplies and assistance others think all these causes may have operated together the nations chiefly concerned are said to be the ottawas and chippewas who live west of and north of the lakes and the delawares on the ohio but some other nations who have not yet appeared are suspected privily to encourage them it is however a war that i think cannot last long though for the present very mischievous to the poor settlers on the frontiers i expected when i left england to have learnt in your letters the true state of things from time to time among you but you are silent and i am in the dark i hear that faction and sedition are becoming universal among you which i can scarcely believe though i see in your public papers a licentiousness that amazes me i hear of ins and outs and ups and downs and know neither why nor wherefore think my dear friend how much satisfaction it is in your power to give me with a loss only of half an hour in a month that you would otherwise spend at cribbage i left our friend david and his family well i hope this will find you so i am here on my journey to new england whence i hope to return in about two months sally goes with me billy and his wife came over here last night from the jerseys to spend a few days with their friends at new york so that we are all together at present except my wife and all join in best wishes for you and good mrs strahan and your children i wrote to you by the last packet and can now only add that i am with sincerest esteem and affection dear sir your most obedient humble servant b franklin     benjamin franklin   august      boston william strahan to william strahan boston   august      dear friend— i have received here your favor of may  d and postscript of may  0th and thank you cordially for the sketch you give me of the present state of your political affairs if the stupid brutal opposition your good king and his measures have lately met with should as you fear become general surely you would not wish me to come and live among such people you would rather remove hither where we have no savages but those we expect to be such but i think your madmen will erelong come to their senses and when i come i shall find you generally wise and happy that i have not the propensity to sitting still that you apprehend let my present journey witness for me in which i have already travelled eleven hundred and forty miles on this continent since april and shall make six hundred and forty miles more before i see home no friend can wish me more in england than i do myself but before i go  every thing i am concerned in must be so settled here as to make another return to america unnecessary my love to every one of your dear family of whose welfare i always rejoice to hear being with the greatest esteem and affection dear sir yours sincerely b franklin   0 benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia william strahan to william strahan  philadelphia    december         i own that i sometimes suspect my love to england and my friends there seduces me a little and makes my own middling reasons for going over appear very good ones we shall see in a little time how things will turn out blessings on your heart for the feast of politics you gave me in your last i could by no other means have obtained so clear a view of the present state of your public affairs as by your letter most of your observations appear to me extremely judicious strikingly clear and true i only differ from you in some of the melancholy apprehensions you express concerning consequences and to comfort you at the same time flattering my own vanity let me remind you that i have sometimes been in the right in such cases when you happened to be in the wrong as i can prove upon you out of this very letter of yours call to mind your former fears for the king of prussia and remember my telling you that the mans abilities were more than equal to all the force of his enemies and that he would finally extricate himself and triumph this by the account you give me from major beckwith is fully verified you now fear for our virtuous young king that the factions forming will overpower him and render his reign uncomfortable on the contrary i am of opinion that his virtue and the consciousness of his sincere intentions to make his people happy will give him firmness and steadiness in his measures and in the support of the honest friends he     has chosen to serve him and when that firmness is fully perceived faction will dissolve and be dissipated like a morning fog before the rising sun leaving the rest of the day clear with a sky serene and cloudless such after a few of the first years will be the future course of his majestys reign which i predict will be happy and truly glorious your fears for the nation too appear to me as little founded a new war i cannot yet see reason to apprehend the peace i think will long continue and your nation be as happy as they deserve to be b franklin benjamin franklin    january      philadelphia governor bernard to governor bernard philadelphia    january      sir— having heard nothing from virginia concerning your son i have at length thought the best and surest way of bringing him safely here will be to send from hence a sober trusty person to conduct him up who will attend him on the road etc i have accordingly this day agreed with mr ennis a very discreet man to make the journey who sets out tomorrow morning i shall send with him my own horse for mr bernard and money to bear his expenses with a letter to mr johnson engaging to pay any account he may have against your son or any reasonable debts he may have contracted there i hope this will be agreeable to you and answer the end i am with sincerest respect your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant b franklin endorsed     benjamin franklin    january      philadelphia anthony todd to mr todd secretary of the general postoffice philadelphia    january      sir— in my last i wrote you that mr foxcroft my colleague was gone to virginia where and in maryland some offices are yet unsettled we are to meet again in april at annapolis and then shall send you a full account of our doings i will now only just mention that we hope in the spring to expedite the communication between boston and new york as we have already that between new york and philadelphia by making the mails travel by night as well as by day which has never heretofore been done in america it passes now between philadelphia and new york so quick that a letter can be sent from one place to another and an answer received the following day which before took a week and when our plan is executed between boston and new york letters may be sent and answers received in four days which before took a fortnight and between philadelphia and boston in six days which before required three weeks we think this expeditious communication will greatly increase the number of letters from philadelphia and boston by the packets to britain      benjamin franklin    august      philadelphia colonel bouquet to colonel bouquet philadelphia    august      dear sir— returning just now from the board of commissioners i found your agreeable favor of the  0th instant we had a meeting on tuesday when your letter to the governor was laid before us his honor not present and the board thin i think none but myself spoke then for the measure recommended so to prevent its being too hastily refused i moved to refer it to this day when we might have a fuller board the principal objection was that the act did not empower us to go farther today we got over that objection and all others and came to a resolution which will be communicated to you by the governor i suppose and the money sent by captain young we have fully as we understand it complied with your requisition and t is a pleasure to me to have done every thing you wished me to do in the affair before the receipt of your letter i recollect that i once in conversation promised you some papers i had by me containing hints for conducting an indian war i have since found them and on looking them over am of opinion you will meet with nothing new in them that is of any importance however to keep my promise i now send them enclosed the june packet is arrived from england as is also our friend mr allen but we have no news by them that is material france and england are both diligently repairing their marine but i suppose t is a matter of course and not with intention of any new repulse the ministerial party is said to be continually     gaining strength and the opposition diminishing abroad the poles are cutting one anothers throats a little about their election but t is their constitution and i suppose reckoned among their privileges to sacrifice a few thousands of the subjects every interregnum either to the manes of the deceased king or to the honor of his successor and if they are fond of this privilege i dont know that their neighbors have any right to disturb them in the enjoyment of it and yet the russians have entered their country with an army to preserve peace and secure the freedom of the election it comes into my mind that you can easily do me a kindness and i ought not by omitting to acquaint you with the occasion deprive you of the pleasure you take in serving your friends by this ship i hear that my enemies for god has blessed me with two or three to keep me in order are now representing me at home as an opposer and obstructor of his majestys service here if i know any thing of my own heart or can remember any thing of my own actions i think they might have as justly accused me of being a blackamoor you cannot but have heard of the zeal and industry with which i promoted the service in the time of general braddock and the douceurs i procured for the officers that served under him i spent a summer in that service without a shilling advantage to myself in the shape of profit commission or any other way whatsoever i projected a method of supplying general shirley with £ 0000 worth of provisions to be given at his request by this province and carried the same through     the house so as to render it effectual together with a gift of some hundreds of warm waistcoats stockings mittens etc for the troops in their first winter service at albany and at lord loudons request i so managed between the governor and assembly as to procure the passage of the £ 0000 act then greatly wanted and met with great difficulty on your arrival here you know the readiness with which i endeavored to serve the officers in the affair of their quarters and you have been a witness of my behavior as a commissioner in the execution of the present act and of my forwardness to carry at the board every measure you proposed to promote the service what i would request is that you would take occasion in some letter to me to express your sentiments of my conduct in these respects so far as has come to your knowledge or fallen under your observation my having such a letter to produce on occasion may possibly be of considerable service to me with the most perfect esteem i am dear sir etc b franklin mrs franklin and sally join me in prayers for your success and happy return i send you enclosed our last political pamphlet to amuse you on some rainy day benjamin franklin   september      william strahan to william strahan    september      i thought i had sent you one of my narratives you cannot conceive the number of bitter enemies     that little piece has raised me among the irish presbyterians i now need send you a pamphlet that i have written since in favor of our projected change of government and mr galloways speech with a preface of mine against the proprietary party with whom i am still at war and who will erelong either demolish me or i them if the former happens as possibly it may behold me in london for the rest of my days at present i am here as much the butt of party rage and malice expressed in pamphlets and prints and have as many pelted at my head in proportion as if i had the misfortune of being your prime minister    you can scarcely conceive how acceptable and satisfactory your letters always are on public affairs to me and my friends for my part i rely entirely on your accounts and sentiments—only making a small abatement when you forebode any misfortune but that is mere temper in me who always love to view the bright sides of things    news is just arrived of a peace concluded at presquisle with the delawares and shawanese by col bradstreet b franklin benjamin franklin   september      philadelphia anthony todd to anthony todd esq philadelphia   september      sir— we have just received some important news from presquisle on lake erie which it is my duty to take this first opportunity of communicating through you to his majestys postmastergeneral the public papers before this can come to hand     will have informed you that sir william johnson had held a treaty at niagara and concluded a peace with all the indian nations or tribes that were at war with us the delawares shawanese and other ohio indians excepted who had haughtily refused to send deputies to the congress we were much concerned to hear of their standing out as by their situation they were most capable of injuring this and the neighboring provinces and had actually committed all the late ravages on the frontiers of pennsylvania and virginia but these people being informed that col bouquet from this province with one thousand of our provincials besides regulars was on his march towards their country and that col bradstreet with a considerable force of regulars and new york and new jersey provincials was advancing along the back of their territories by lake erie they suddenly changed their resolution of continuing the war and sent ten of their principal men as deputies who met col bradstreet at presquisle and in the most submissive manner acknowledged their fault in commencing this war on the english without the least cause or provocation and humbly begged for mercy and forgiveness and that a peace might be granted them the colonel after severely reproving them granted them peace on the following terms   that all the prisoners now in their country should be immediately collected and delivered up to him at sandusky within twentyfive days none to remain among them under any pretence of marriage adoption or otherwise and the unwilling to be forced away       that they should cede to the english and renounce forever all claim to the posts or forts now or late in our possession in their country and that we should be at liberty to erect as many new forts or trading houses as we pleased wherever we thought them necessary for security of our trade and that round each fort now or hereafter to be built they should cede to us forever as much land as a cannon could throw a shot over to be cultivated by our people for the more convenient furnishing provisions to the garrison   that in case any one of the tribes should hereafter renew the war against the english the others should join us in reducing them and bringing them to reason and that particular murderers hereafter given up to preserve peace should be tried by the english law the jury to be half indians of the same nation with the criminal   that six of the deputies should remain with him as hostages till the prisoners were restored and these articles confirmed these terms were thankfully accepted and signed by the deputies with their marks as usual they declaring themselves fully authorized for that purpose by the shawanese delawares hurons of sandusky and the other tribes inhabiting the plains of scioto and all the countries between lake erie and the ohio the other four deputies with an english officer and an indian were immediately despatched to acquaint the nations with what had passed and inform them that the colonel would not discontinue his     march but proceed to sandusky where he expected their chiefs would meet him and ratify the treaty otherwise they should find two armies of warriors in their country and no future proposals of peace would be hearkened to but they should be cut off from the face of the earth if this peace holds it will be very happy for these colonies we only apprehend that the savages obtaining a peace so easily without having suffered the chastisement they deserved for their late perfidy and without being obliged to make any restitution or satisfaction for the goods they robbed our merchants of and the barbarities they committed except the cession of those small tracts round forts will more readily incline to renew the war on every little occasion be pleased to present my dutiful respects to the postmastergeneral and believe me with much esteem sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin  0 september      philadelphia colonel bouquet

complying with  00 my request your letter was quite full and sufficient and leaves me nothing to desire by way of addition except that if any letter of yours relating to the present expedition is like to be seen by the secretary of state you would take occasion just to mention me as one ready on that and every other occasion to promote the service of the crown the malice and industry of my adversaries have i find made these precautions a little necessary your sentiments of our constitution are solid and just i am not sure that the change now attempted will immediately take place nor am i very anxious about it but sooner or later it will be effected and till it is effected we shall have little internal quiet in the administration of our public affairs i have lately received a number of new pamphlets from england and france among which is a piece of voltaires on the subject of religious toleration i will give you a passage of it which being read here at a time when we are torn to pieces by faction religious and civil shows us that while we sit for our picture to that able painter t is no small advantage to us that he views us at a favorable distance mais que dironsnous dit il

london peter collinson to peter collinson london    july      dear friend— i have heard of an account you lately received from russia of some discovery of an ancient sepulchre in the frontiers of that country i wish i could see that account in the meantime i  0  send you a passage i have met with in herodotus that most ancient historian concerning the sepulchres of the scythian kings which may possibly throw some light on this discovery the boristhenes you know is a river that takes its rise in the north and empties itself into the euxine sea i am as ever yours affectionately b franklin the sepulchres of the scythian kings are in the country of the gerrhians where the borysthenes is first known to be navigable when their king dies they dig a great hole in the ground of a quadrangular form and having received the body covered with wax they open and cleanse the belly filling the space with bruised cypress incense seeds of parsley and aries and after they have sewed up the belly again they carry the body in a chariot to another province where those who receive it imitate the royal scythians in the following custom they cut off part of one ear shave their heads wound themselves on the arms forehead and nose and pierce the left hand with an arrow having done thus they accompany the chariot to another district and this manner is observed in every province till having carried the dead body of the king through all his dominions they bury him in the country of the gerrhians who inhabit the remotest parts of the kingdom here they lay him in the sepulchre upon a bed encompassed on all sides with spears which they cover with timber and spread a canopy over the  0  whole monument in the spaces that remain vacant they place one of the kings concubines strangled with a cupbearer a cook a groom a waiter a messenger certain horses and some of all things necessary to these they add cups of gold because silver and brass are not used amongst them this done they throw up the earth with great diligence and endeavor to raise the mount as high as possibly they can—herodotus book iv  benjamin franklin    october      anthony todd to anthony todd esq craven street    october      sir— discoursing with captain folger a very intelligent mariner of the island of nantucket in new england concerning the long passages made by some ships bound from england to new york i received from him the following information viz that the island in which he lives is inhabited chiefly by people concerned in the whale fishery in which they employed nearly   0 sail of vessels that the whales are found generally near the edges of the gulph stream a strong current so called which comes out of the gulph of florida passing northeasterly along the coast of america and then turning off most easterly running at the rate of    ½   and  ½ miles an hour that the whaling business leading these people to cruise along the edges of the stream  0  in quest of whales they are become better acquainted with the course breadth strength and extent of the same than those navigators can well be who only cross it in their voyages to and from america that they have opportunities of discovering the strength of it when their boats are out in the pursuit of this fish and happen to get into the stream while the ship is out of it or out of the stream while the ship is in it for then they are separated very fast and would soon lose sight of each other if care were not taken that in crossing the stream to and fro they frequently in the same meet and speak with ships bound from england to new york virginia etc who have passages of     and  0 weeks and are still far from land and not likely to be in with it for some time being engaged in that part of the stream that sets directly against them and it is supposed that their fear of cape sable shoals georges banks or nantucket shoals hath induced them to keep so far to the southward as unavoidably to engage them in the same gulph stream which occasions the length of their voyages since in a calm it carries them directly back and though they may have fair winds yet the current being  0 or  0 miles a day is so much subtracted from the way they make through the water at my request captain folger hath been so obliging as to mark for me on a chart the dimensions course and swiftness of the stream from its first coming out of the gulph where it is narrowest and strongest until it turns away to go to the southward of the western islands where it is broader and weaker and to give me withal some written directions whereby  0  ships bound from the banks of newfoundland to new york may avoid the said stream and yet be free of danger from the banks and shoals above mentioned as i apprehend that such chart and directions may be of use to our packets in shortening their voyages i send them to you that if their lordships should think fit so much of the chart as is contained within the red lines may be engraved and printed together with the remarks at the charge of the office or at least that manuscript copies may be made of the same for the use of packets the expense of the former would not so much exceed the latter and would besides be of general service with much esteem i am etc b franklin endorsed craven street oct   th      dr franklin to mr todd in mr todds to mr pownall of   feby      benjamin franklin  0 december    0 london cooper to the rev dr cooper london  0 december    0 dear sir— i duly received your several favors of july   th november  th and   th and am glad that my little communications afforded you any pleasure i join with you most cordially in wishes of a perfect happy union between great britain and the colonies this is only to be expected from principles of justice and equity on both sides which we must endeavor to cultivate i think there is now a disposition here to treat us more equitably and i hope it will increase and prevail  0  i esteem the appointment to the agency of your province unexpected and unsolicited by me as one of the greatest honors for which i must think myself indebted to your friendship i wish i may be able to do my country effectual service nothing could make me more happy i shall however use my most faithful endeavors i had before i heard of this appointment openly opposed the project of abridging our charter privileges which some of our adversaries were extremely busy in designing to do by an act of parliament a bill for the purpose being as i have heard actually drawn ready to be brought in i boldly and openly asserted that parliament had no such power and that an attempt of that kind would by alarming all america raise a new flame there and tend more to loosen the connections now subsisting than any step that had yet been taken i do not know that the freedom i used in declaring and publishing these sentiments had much effect i rather think the apprehension of an approaching war inclined government to milder measures and to hearken less to the mad projects of our adversaries so it is however that the scheme has been laid aside and will i think hardly be resumed though the expectation of war is much lessened it makes me happy to learn that my ideas on a certain subject appeared just to you and your friends i have now in hand a piece intended for the public at a convenient time  which i hope will satisfy many others even on this side the water that every lady of  0  genoa is not a queen of corsica just at this juncture here perhaps t is more prudent to be quiet to stir no new questions to let heats abate and when minds are cooler reason may be better heard i think i shall send my manuscript to america for the perusal and correction of my friends and for their advice on the expediency of its being published before i venture it into the world you i hope will give me leave to trouble you with it as it seems to me a question of great importance to us all you have given in a little compass so full and comprehensive a view of the circumstances on which is founded the security britain has for all reasonable advantages from us though things were put into the same state in which they were before the stamp act that i cannot refrain communicating an extract of your letter where i think it may be of use and i think i shall publish it there is no doubt of an intention here to make all our governors independent of the people for their support as fast as the american duties will bear the expense in this point i think all parties are against us and nothing appears to them more unreasonable than that we should wish to have our governors under such influence when the king himself as they say is always made independent of the parliament here in that respect by a fixed civillist revenue i have endeavored to show the injustice of taxing those colonies who have always supported their own government for the support of other governments in which they have no interest and the great difference between a prince—whose welfare and that of his family  0  is intimately connected with the prosperity of the nation—and a governor who comes from another country to make money and intends to return to the place whence he came where he will not hear the complaints and curses of those he has oppressed and plundered nor his children be less respected or fare the worse for the malfeasance of their father but it is so sweet a thing to have the giving of places of great and sure profit to friends and favorites and the prospect of doing it out of other revenues than those of this nation at which parliament is therefore less likely to take umbrage is so tempting that i think scarce any thing said or to be said here will avail much towards discouraging the project there is indeed one thing if that is in their power—the refraining absolutely from the use of all commodities subject to the duty the deficiency of the revenue to pay the salaries and those to be made good by the treasury here might possibly put some check to the career and if the assemblies should at the same time decline giving any more annual supports and leave all governors to their appointments out of the revenue giving bountifully to a good governor at the end of his administration and leaving bad ones to be rewarded by their masters perhaps by this means some of that influence with governors might be retained which induces them to treat the people with equity and moderation but if our people will by consuming such commodities purchase and pay for their fetters who that sees them so shackled will think they deserve either redress or pity methinks that in drinking tea a true american reflecting that   0 by every cup he contributed to the salaries pensions and rewards of the enemies and persecutors of his country would be half choked at the thought and find no quantity of sugar sufficient to make the nauseous draught go down i hope your health is restored and that your valuable life will be long continued for the benefit of your friends family and country with sincere and great esteem i am dear sir your affectionate and most obedient servant b franklin benjamin franklin    april      london humphrey marshall to humphrey marshall  london    april      sir— i duly received your favors of the  th of october and the   th of november it gave me pleasure to hear that though the merchants had departed from their agreement of nonimportation the spirit of industry and frugality was likely to continue among the people i am obliged to you for your concern on my account the letters you mention gave great offence here but that was not attended with the immediate ill consequences to my interest that seem to have been hoped for by those that sent copies of them hither if our country people would well consider that all they save in refusing to purchase foreign gewgaws and in making their own apparel being applied to the improvement of their plantations would render     those more profitable as yielding a greater produce i should hope they would persist resolutely in their present commendable industry and frugality and there is still a further consideration the colonies that produce provisions grow very fast but of the countries that take off those provisions some do not increase at all as the european nations and others as the west india colonies not in the same proportion so that though the demand at present may be sufficient it cannot long continue so every manufacturer encouraged in our country makes part of a market for provisions within ourselves and saves so much money to the country as must otherwise be exported to pay for the manufacturing he supplies here in england it is well known and understood that wherever a manufacture is established which employs a number of hands it raises the value of lands in the neighboring country all around it partly by the greater demand near at hand for the produce of the land and partly from the plenty of money drawn by the manufacturers to that part of the country it seems therefore the interest of all our farmers and owners of lands to encourage our young manufactures in preference to foreign ones imported among us from distant countries i am much obliged by your kind present of curious seeds they were welcome gifts to some of my friends i send you herewith some of the new barley lately introduced into this country and now highly spoken of i wish it may be found of use with us i was the more pleased to see in your letter the improvement of our paper having had a principal share     in establishing that manufacture among us many years ago by the encouragement i gave it if in any thing i can serve you here it will be a pleasure to your obliged friend and humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin  0 june      london thomas cushing to thomas cushing  private london  0 june      sir— i received your favor of the  0th of april a few days since with the newspapers etc and am much obliged by the information you as a private person so kindly give of the present state of affairs in your province such a confidential correspondence between us i most willingly embrace as i am persuaded it must be often useful in the prudent conduct of our public interests to interchange intelligence that cannot so properly or safely appear in public letters since nothing written to or from an assembly can be kept from the knowledge of adversaries who may take advantage of it to the prejudice of our affairs and of the persons concerned in the management of them the continuing our general court at cambridge     has always appeared to me a measure extremely impolitic in government here as it can tend only to irritate the members offend the people in general and create an illhumor that can never be for his majestys service or the benefit of this nation for supposing the province to be ever so great an offender this is not a punishment sufficient to reform by its severity it is rather more fitted to affront and provoke you will therefore hardly understand it if you do not well know the character of the present american secretary proud supercilious extremely conceited of his political knowledge and abilities moderate as they are fond of every one that can stoop to flatter him and inimical to all that dare tell him disagreeable truths this mans mandates have been treated with disrespect in america his letters have been criticised his measures censured and despised which has produced in him a kind of settled malice against the colonies particularly ours that would break out into greater violence if cooler heads did not set some bounds to it i have indeed good reason to believe that his conduct is far from being approved by the kings other servants and that he himself is so generally disliked by them that it is not probable he will continue much longer in his present station the general wish here being to recover saving only the dignity of government the goodwill of the colonies which there is little reason to expect while they are under his wild administration their permitting so long his eccentricities if i may use such an expression is owing i imagine rather to the difficulty of knowing how to dispose     of or what to do with a man of his wrongheaded bustling industry who it is apprehended may be more mischievous out of administration than in it than to any kind of personal regard for him all views or expectations of drawing any considerable revenue to this country from the colonies are i believe generally given over and it seems probable that nothing of that kind will ever again be attempted but as foreign courts appear to have taken great pleasure in the prospect of our disunion it seems now to be thought necessary for supporting the national weight and the influence of our court abroad that there should be an appearance as if all was pacified in america and as i said before i think the general wish is that it may be really so but then there is an apprehension lest a too sudden yielding to all our claims should be deemed the effect of weakness render the british court contemptible in the eyes of foreigners make us more presumptuous and promote more extravagant demands such as could never be granted and thence still greater danger of a fatal rupture i am thus particular that you may judge whether it will not be prudent in us to indulge the mother country in this concern for her own honor so far as may be consistent with the protection of our essential rights especially as that honor may in some cases be of importance to the general welfare and in this view whether it will not be better gradually to wear off the assumed authority of parliament over america which we have in too many instances given countenance to with our indiscreet acknowledgment of it     in public acts than by a general open denial and resistance to it bring on prematurely a contest to which if we are not found equal that authority will by the event be more strongly established and if we should prove superior yet by the division the general strength of the british nation must be greatly diminished i do not venture to advise in this case because i see in this seemingly prudent course some danger of a diminishing attention to our rights instead of a persevering endeavor to recover and establish them but i rely a good deal on the growing knowledge of them among the americans and the daily increasing strength and importance of that country to this which must give such weight in time to our just claims as no selfish spirit in this part of the empire will be able to resist in the meantime while we are declining the usurped authority of parliament i wish to see a steady dutiful attachment to the king and his family maintained among us and that however we may be induced for peacesake or from a sense of our present inability to submit at present in some instances to the exercise of that unjust authority we shall continue from time to time to assert our rights in occasional solemn resolves and other public acts never yielding them up and avoiding even the slightest expressions that seem confirmatory of the claim that has been set up against them my opinion has long been that parliament had originally no right to bind us by any kind of law whatever without our consent we have indeed in a manner consented to some of them at least tacitly but for the future methinks we should be cautious     how we add to those instances and never adopt or acknowledge an act of parliament but by a formal law of our own as your general assembly i think did in the case of the act of parliament relating to the oaths mentioned in the first paragraph of your votes though as it stands there it seems as if the act of parliament had required those oaths to be taken by your members and was acknowledged as of force for that purpose i do not at present see the least likelihood of preventing the grant of salaries or pensions from hence to the kings officers in america by any application in be half of the people there it is looked on as a strange thing here to object to the kings paying his own servants sent among us to do his business and they say we would seem to have much more reason of complaint if it were required of us to pay them and the more we urge the impropriety of their not depending on us for their support the more suspicion it breeds that we are desirous of influencing them to betray the interests of their master or of this nation indeed if the money is raised from us against our wills the injustice becomes more evident than where it arises from hence i do not think however that the effect of these salaries is likely to be so considerable either in favor of government here or in our prejudice as may be generally apprehended the love of money is not a thing of certain measure so as that it may be easily filled and satisfied avarice is infinite and where there is not good economy no salary however large will prevent necessity he that has a fixed and what others may think a competent     income is often as much to be biased by the expectation of more as if he had already none at all if the colonies should resolve on giving handsome presents to good governors at or after their departure or to their children after their decease i imagine it might produce even better effects than our present annual grants but the course probably will soon be that the chief governor to whom the salary is given will have leave to reside in england a lieutenant or deputy will be left to do the business and live on the perquisites which not being thought quite sufficient his receiving presents yearly will be winked at through the interest of his principal and thus things will get into the old train only this inconvenience remaining that while by our folly in consuming the dutyarticles the fixed salary is raised on ourselves without our consent we must pay double for the same service however though it may be a hopeless task while the duties continue sufficient to pay the salaries i shall on all proper occasions make representations against this new mode and if by the duties falling short the treasury should be called on to pay those salaries it is possible they may come to be seen in another light than at present and dropped as unnecessary i was glad to see that attention in the general court to the improvement of the militia a war may happen in which britain like rome of old may find so much to do for her own defence as to be unable to spare troops or ships for the protection of her colonies a minister may arise so little our friend as to neglect that protection or to permit invasions of our     country in order to make us cry out for help and thereby furnish stronger pretence for maintaining a standing army among us if we once lose our military spirit and supinely depend on an army of mercenaries for our defence we shall become contemptible despised both by friends and enemies as neither our friendship nor our enmity will be deemed of any importance as our country is not wealthy so as to afford much ready plunder the temptation to a foreign invasion of us is the less and i am persuaded that the name of a numerous welldisciplined militia would alone be almost sufficient to prevent any thoughts of attempting it and what a glory would it be for us to send on any trying occasion ready and effectual aid to our mother country i have lately been among the clothing towns in yorkshire and by conversing with the manufacturers there am more and more convinced of the natural impossibility there is that considering our increase in america england should be able much longer to supply us with clothing necessity therefore as well as prudence will soon induce us to seek resources in our own industry which becoming general among the people encouraged by resolutions of your court such as i have the pleasure of seeing in your late votes will do wonders family manufactures will alone amount to a vast saving in the year and a steady determination and custom of buying only of your own artificers wherever they can supply you will soon make them more expert in working so as to despatch more business while constant employment enables them to afford their work still cheaper     the lowness of provisions with us compared with their daily rising price here added to the freight risk and commissions on the manufactures of this country must give great advantage to our workmen and enable them in time to retain a great deal of money in the country though still trade enough should remain between us and britain to render our friendship of the greatest importance to this nation i was a subscriber to a set of plates published here entitled the senators remembrancer a work encouraged by many members of both houses having a spare copy i beg your acceptance of it as a small mark of my respect and send it by captain jarvis should it afford to your already wellfurnished mind no useful hints in the management of public affairs it may however be of service to some young friend—at least as copies of fair and elegant writing the letters i have received from my friends in boston have lately come to hand badly sealed with no distinct impression appearing as if they had been opened and in a very bungling way closed again i suspect this may be done by some prying persons that use the coffeehouse here i therefore mention it that you may if you think fit send yours under cover to some merchant of character who would forward them to me more safely with great and sincere respect i have the honor of being sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin   0 this note is on a slip of paper attached to the preceding letter whatever the prerogative may be with regard to appointing the place of meeting for parliaments and assemblies it should be used only for the good of the people where it is made an instrument of arbitrary power to enforce ministerial measures to the prejudice of the peoples rights such use of it has justly been condemned it was one article of impeachment against a former evil minister  that to work his ends or the kings he has caused the parliament to sit in villibus et remotis partibus regni where few people propter defectum hospitii et victualium could attend and by shifting that assembly from place to place to enforce the authors words illos paucos qui remanebunt de communitate regni concedere regi quamvis pessima benjamin franklin    january      london thomas cushing to thomas cushing  london    january      sir— i am now returned again to london from a journey of some months in ireland and scotland though my constitution and too great confinement to business during the winter seem to require the air     and exercise of a long journey once a year which i have now practised for more than twenty years past yet i should not have been out so long this time but that i was well assured the parliament would not meet till towards the end of january before which meeting few of the principal people would be in town and no business of importance likely to be agitated relating to america i have now before me your esteemed favors of july  th september   th and october  d in the first you mention that the general assembly was still held out of its ancient and only convenient seat the township of boston and by the latest papers from thence i see that it was prorogued again to meet in cambridge which i little wonder at when i recollect a question asked me by lord hillsborough in ireland viz whether i had heard from new england lately since the general court was returned to boston from this i concluded orders had been transmitted by his lordship for that removal perhaps such may have been sent to be used discretionally i think i have before mentioned to you one of the articles of impeachment brought against an evil administration here in former times that the parliament had been caused to sit in villibus et remotis partibus regni where few people propter defectum hospitii et victualium could attend thereby to force illos paucos qui remanebunt de communitate regni concedere regi     quamvis pessima lord clarendon too was impeached for endeavoring to introduce arbitrary government into the colonies lord h seems by the late instructions to have been treading in the paths that lead to the same unhappy situation if the parliament here should ever again feel for america as there is something curious in our interview in ireland i must give you an account of it i met with him accidentally at the lord lieutenants who happened to invite us to dine with a large company on the same day he was surprisingly civil and urged my fellowtraveller and me to call at his house in our intended journey northwards where we might be sure of better accommodations than the inns could afford us he pressed us so politely that it was not easy to refuse without apparent rudeness as we must pass through his town of hillsborough and by his door and as it might afford an opportunity of saying something on american affairs i concluded to comply with his invitation his lordship went home some time before we left dublin we called upon him and were detained at his house four days during which time he entertained us with great civility and a particular attention to me that appeared the more extraordinary as i knew that just before i left london he had expressed himself concerning me in very angry terms calling me a republican a factious mischievous fellow and the like in our conversations he first showed himself a good irishman blaming england for its narrowness towards that country in restraining its commerce discouraging its woollen manufacture     etc and when i applied his observations to america he said he had always been of opinion that the people in every part of the kings dominions had a natural right to make the best use they could of the productions of their country and that america ought not to be restrained in manufacturing anything she could manufacture to advantage that he supposed she at present found generally more profit in agriculture but whenever she found that less profitable or a particular manufacture more so he had no objection to her pursuing it and he censured lord chatham for asserting in his speech that the parliament had a right or ought to restrain manufactures in the colonies adding that as he knew the english were apt to be jealous on that head he avoided every thing that might inflame that jealousy and therefore though the commons had requested the crown to order the governors to send over annually accounts of such manufactures as were undertaken in the colonies yet as they had not ordered such accounts to be annually laid before them he should never produce them till they were called for then he gave me to understand that the bounty on silk raised in america was a child of his which he hoped would prove of great advantage to that country and he wished to know in what manner a bounty on raising wine there might be contrived so as to operate effectually for that purpose desiring me to turn it in my thoughts as he should be glad of my opinion and advice then he informed me that newfoundland was grown too populous to be left any longer without a regular government but there     were great difficulties in the forming such a kind of government as would be suitable to the particular circumstances of that country which he wished me likewise to consider and that i would favor him with my sentiments he seemed attentive to every thing that might make my stay in his house agreeable to me and put his eldest son lord kilivaring into his phæton with me to drive me a round of forty miles that i might see the country the seats manufactures etc covering me with his own cloak lest i should take cold and in short seemed in every thing extremely solicitous to impress me and the colonies through me with a good opinion of him all which i could not much wonder at knowing that he likes neither them nor me and i thought it inexplicable but on the supposition that he apprehended an approaching storm and was desirous of lessening beforehand the number of enemies he had so imprudently created but if he takes no step towards withdrawing the troops repealing the duties restoring the castle or recalling the offensive instructions i shall think all the plausible behavior i have described and the discourse related concerning manufactures etc as meant only by patting and stroking the horse to make him more patient while the reins are drawn tighter and the spurs set deeper into his sides before i leave ireland i must mention that being desirous of seeing the principal patriots there i stayed till the opening of their parliament i found them disposed to be friends of america in which disposition i endeavored to confirm them with the expectation that our growing     weight might in time be thrown into their scale and by joining our interest with theirs might be obtained for them as well as for us a more equitable treatment from this nation  there are many brave spirits among them the gentry are a very sensible polite and friendly people their parliament makes a most respectable figure with a number of very good speakers in both parties and able men of business and i ought not to omit acquainting you that it being a standing rule to admit members of the english parliament to sit though they do not vote in the house among the members while others are only admitted into the gallery my fellowtraveller being an english member was accordingly admitted as such but i supposed i must have gone to the gallery when the speaker having been spoken to by some of the members stood up and acquainted the house that there was in town an american gentleman of character a member or delegate of some of the parliaments of that country who was desirous of being present at the debates of this house that there was a standing rule of the house for admitting members of the english parliament that he did suppose the house would consider the american assemblies as english parliaments but this being the first instance he had chosen not to give any order without receiving their directions on the question the whole house gave a loud unanimous aye when two members came to me without the bar where i was standing     led me in and placed me very honorably this i am the more particular in to you as i esteemed it a mark of respect for our country and a piece of politeness in which i hope our parliament will not fall behind theirs whenever an occasion shall offer ireland is itself a poor country and dublin a magnificent city but the appearances of general extreme poverty among the lower people are amazing they live in wretched hovels of mud and straw are clothed in rags and subsist chiefly on potatoes our new england farmers of the poorest sort in regard to the enjoyment of all the comforts of life are princes when compared to them such is the effect of the discouragements of industry the nonresidence not only of pensioners but of many original landlords who lease their lands in gross to undertakers that rack the tenants and fleece them skin and all to make estates to themselves while the first rents as well as most of the pensions are spent out of the country an english gentleman there said to me that by what he had heard of the good grazing in north america and by what he saw of the plenty of flaxseed imported in ireland from thence he could not understand why we did not rival ireland in the beef and butter trade to the west indies and share with it in its linen trade but he was satisfied when i told him that i supposed the reason might be our people eat beef and butter every day and wear shirts themselves in short the chief exports of ireland seem to be pinched off the backs and out of the bellies of the miserable inhabitants but schemes are now under consideration     among the humane gentry to provide some means of mending if possible their present wretched condition      i am much obliged by the very particular account you have favored me with of the general sentiments of people in our province on the present state of affairs between the two countries they are for the most part the same with my own i think the revenue acts should be repealed as not constitutionally founded that the commission of the customs should be dissolved that the troops foreigners to us as much as hanoverians would be in england since they are not introduced with the consent of our legislature ought to be withdrawn and the castle restored to its rightful owners the government of the province that built it and that the general court should be returned to its ancient seat and     the governors salary put upon its ancient footing but it is also my opinion that while the present american minister continues there is very little likelihood that any change will be made in any of those particulars that of returning the court perhaps excepted and yet i am also of opinion that no farther duties are intended and that although the american minister might wish to increase that fund for corruption the other ministers are not disposed to humor him in it and would not consent to it i may be deceived in this opinion but i have grounds for it however i think we should be as much on our guard and use the same defensive measures and endeavors as if we saw new duties intended in the ensuing session and nothing can more effectually discourage new duties than the diminution of the revenue produced by duties a resolute steady refusal to consume the dutiable commodities in compliance with your respected recommendation i introduced mr story to a secretary of the treasury who forwarded his memorial and he tells me he has obtained his request relating to the affair of mr wheelwrights debt he now seems to wish for some appointment in consideration of his sufferings from the mob but i doubt whether it may be worth his while to attend here the solicitation and expectation of such reward those attendances being often drawn out to an inconceivable length and the expense of course enormous with the greatest esteem i have the honor to be sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin   0 benjamin franklin   july      london to ——— london   july      dear cousin— in looking over your letters i find in that of november   th mention of a prize of £ 0 which you have drawn it never came into my hands and i cannot find that smith wright and gray know any thing of it if i knew the number of the ticket i could inquire farther i am much obliged by your care in halls affair and glad you have recovered so much of that debt and are likely to get the rest i hope it will be of service to my dear sister the goods for her were sent per captain hatch in a trunk consigned to you i wish you success in your new plan of business and shall certainly embrace every opportunity i may have of promoting it upon your recommendation i went to see the black poetess and offered her any services i could do her before i left the house i understood her master was there and had sent her to me but did not come into the room himself and i thought was not pleased with the visit i should perhaps have inquired first for him but i had heard nothing of him and i have heard nothing since of her my love to cousin grace and your children i am your affectionate uncle b franklin benjamin franklin   february      london william franklin to governor william franklin london   february      dear son— this line is just to acquaint you that i am well and that my office of deputypostmaster     is taken from me as there is no prospect of your being ever promoted to a better government and that you hold has never defrayed its expenses i wish you were well settled in your farm t is an honester and a more honorable because a more independent employment you will hear from others the treatment i have received i leave you to your own reflection and determinations upon it and remain ever your affectionate father b franklin benjamin franklin    february      william franklin to governor william franklin    february      some tell me that it is determined to displace you likewise but i do not know it as certain i only give you the hint as an inducement to you to delay awhile your removal to amboy which in that case would be an expense and trouble to no purpose perhaps they may expect that your resentment of their treatment of me may induce you to resign and save them the shame of depriving you when they ought to promote but this i would not advise you to do let them take your place if they want it though in truth i think it is scarce worth your keeping since it has not afforded you sufficient to prevent your running every year behindhand with me but one may make something of an injury nothing of a resignation b franklin     benjamin franklin    march      london john ingenhousz to john ingenhousz london    march      dear friend— i am very sensible of your kindness in the concern you express on account of the late attack on my character before the privy council and in the papers be assured my good friend that i have done nothing unjustifiable nothing but what is consistent with the man of honor and with my duty to my king and country and this will soon be apparent to the public as it is now to all here who know me i do not find that i have lost a single friend on the occasion all have visited me repeatedly with affectionate assurances of their unaltered respect and affection and many of distinction with whom i had before but slight acquaintance you know that in england there is every day in almost every paper some abuse on public persons of all parties the king himself does not always escape and the populace who are used to it love to have a good character cut up now and then for their entertainment on this occasion it suited the purpose of the ministry to have me abused as it often suits the purposes of their opposers to abuse them and having myself been long engaged in public business this treatment is not new to me i am almost as much used to it as they are themselves and perhaps can bear it better i have indeed lost a little place that was in their power but i can do very well without it it will not be long before i publish my vindication which some circumstances keep back at present sir john pringle continues well his speech in giving the last medal on the subject of the discoveries     relating to the air did him great honor dr priestley goes on rapidly with new and curious experiments on that subject he is about printing a new  vo book full of them mr walsh has just made a curious discovery in electricity you know we find that in refined air it would pass more freely and leap through greater spaces than in denser air and thence it was concluded that in a perfect vacuum it would pass any distance without the least obstruction but having made a perfect vacuum by means of boiled mercury in a long torricellian bent tube its ends immersed in cups full of mercury he finds that the vacuum will not conduct at all but resists the passage of the electric fluid absolutely as much as if it was glass itself this may lead to new principles and new views in the atmospheric part of philosophy i am ever my dear friend b franklin benjamin franklin   august      west wycombe william franklin to william franklin west wycombe   august      dear son— i have been here with lord le despencer about a week for a little country air and exercise i wrote to you per captain falconer and have nothing to add but to let you know that i continue very well and hearty methinks t is time to think of a profession for temple who is now upwards of fourteen that the remainder of his education may have some relation to it i have thought he may make an expert lawyer as he has a good memory quick parts and ready     elocution he would certainly make an excellent painter having a vast fondness for drawing which he pursues with unwearied industry and has made great proficiency but i do not find that he thinks of it as a business the only hint of inclination he has given is that of being a surgeon but it was slightly mentioned it is indeed my wish that he might learn some art by which he could at any time procure a subsistence and after that if any thing better could be done for him well and good but posts and places are precarious dependencies i would have him a free man upon the whole in my opinion we should turn him to the law as a profession reputable in itself and as the knowledge he may gain in that study will qualify him for other employments and be serviceable to him if he were to be only a mere gentleman  if i return this year it will probably be in the september packet but i begin to have some doubts with love to betsey i am ever your affectionate father b franklin benjamin franklin   september london william franklin to william franklin  london   september dear son— i received yours of july  d from new york with the bill of exchange for forty     pounds on cobham bond  ryland which is carried to the credit of your account i have spoken in mr antills favor but there seems to have been a previous disposition of those places at the time of making up the mail for the august packet i was down at lord le despencers and wrote the above letter to you from thence franked by his lordship a week after the packet had sailed my letter was returned to me having been by a blunder at the office sent to burlington in yorkshire i have now opened it to add this and send it resealed to have the benefit of the same frank i am glad you have met with my friend barrow i wish you to cultivate his acquaintance and mrs barrows who is a good and amiable woman i am much obliged to mr panton for his information relating to mr parkers affairs cousin jonathan williams an expert and accurate accomptant is now with me and engaged in posting and settling my accounts which will be done before the next packet when i shall send what concerned parkers in the meantime i think it cannot be amiss for you or mr bache to accept any security mrs parker is willing to give you mention some lands i think i gave a power to mr bache you say my presence is wished for at the congress but no person besides in america has given     me the least intimation of such a desire and it is thought by the great friends of the colonies here that i ought to stay till the result of the congress arrives when my presence here may they suppose be of use in my opinion all depends on the americans themselves if they make and keep firm resolutions not to consume british manufactures till their grievances are redressed and their rights acknowledged this ministry must fall and the aggrieving laws be repealed this is the opinion of all wise men here i hear nothing of the proposal you have made for a congress of governors etc i do not so much as you do wonder that the massachusetts have not offered payment for the tea   because of the uncertainty of the act which gives them no surety that the port shall be opened on their making that payment   no specific sum is demanded   no one knows what will satisfy the customhouse officers nor who the others are that must be satisfied nor what will satisfy them and   after all they are in the kings power how much of the port shall be opened as to doing justice before they ask it that should have been thought of by the legislature here before they demanded it of the bostonians they have extorted many thousand pounds from america unconstitutionally under color of acts of parliament and with an armed force of this money they ought to make restitution they might first have taken out payment for the tea etc and returned the rest but you who are a thorough courtier see everything with government eyes     i am sorry for the loss of sir w johnson especially at this time of danger from an indian war i see by the papers you were with him at the time mr parker of amboy has written to mr wilmot that the kings approbation of the boundary act is not arrived i sent duplicates of it last winter to messrs kinsey  hewlings one by the packet the other by a philadelphia ship as you know they have received them pray request them to acquaint mr parker a fresh memorial has lately been presented on the ohio affair the event still uncertain but mr walpole continues confident that sooner or later it must succeed a spanish war is now seriously apprehended here and the stocks of course are falling the august packet is hourly expected when i hope to hear of your safe returned health with love to betsey i am ever your affectionate father b franklin benjamin franklin   may      william franklin to governor william franklin   may      i dont understand it as any favor to me or to you the being continued in an office by which with all your prudence you cannot avoid running behindhand if you live suitably to your station while you are in it i know you will execute it with fidelity to your master but i think independence more honorable than any service and that in the state of     american affairs which from the present arbitrary measures is likely soon to take place you will find yourself in no comfortable situation and perhaps wish you had soon disengaged yourself b franklin benjamin franklin    december      passy jonathan williams to jonathan williams passy    december      dear nephew— you need be under no concern as to your orders being only from mr deane as you have always acted up rightly and ably for the public service you would be justified if you had no orders at all but as he generally consulted with me and had my approbation in the orders he gave and i know they were for the best and aimed at the public good i hereby certify you that i approve and join in these you have received from him and desire you to proceed in the execution of the same b franklin memorandum of

assembled the memorial of the honorable benjamin franklin and samuel wharton humbly sheweth that on the  th day of november      his     britannic majesty at a congress held with the six nations of indians at fort stanwick purchased from the said indians a very extensive tract of country situate near the province of new york and upon the river ohio in north america the limits and boundaries of which tract are mentioned and described in the deed of sale and conveyance from the said indians to his said majesty that the consideration paid by his said majestys agent to the said indians on their executing the said conveyance amounted to £ 0  0  s  d sterling exclusive of other considerations referred to in the said conveyance that in june      a petition was presented to his said majesty by your memorialists in behalf of themselves and several persons residing in the united states and great britain proposing to purchase   00000 acres part of the said tract at such price and subject to such quitrents as should be thought reasonable and the petitioners humbly proposed that a grant of the lands under the great seal of great britain should be made to them and their heirs and assigns and that such grant should particularly specify the several and respective boundaries and limits within which the lands thereby granted should be located or set out that the said petition having been referred by his said majesty in council to the earl of hillsborough and the other lords commissioners for trade and plantations your memorialists and several of their associates attended their lordships in the month of december      on the subject of the said petition     when the earl of hillsborough was pleased to recommend to the petitioners to endeavor to contract with the lords commissioners of the british treasury for such part of the said lands purchased from the said six nations lying on the river ohio as would be sufficient in extent to form a separate government and your memorialists and their associates acceding to this suggestion and recommendation his lordship immediately went from the board of trade to the said board of treasury desiring the petitioners to wait till his return when his lordship was pleased to inform the petitioners that he had applied in their behalf to the duke of grafton lord north and the other lords of the said treasury board which was then sitting who had signified their desire to receive the proposal of the petitioners for purchasing such tract of land as was recommended to them to contract for as aforesaid that accordingly on the  th day of january    0 a memorial was presented to the said lords commissioners of the treasury proposing to purchase the tract of land hereinafter described and to pay the sum of £ 0  0  s  d sterling money of great britain for the same and a quitrent of two shillings for every hundred acres of cultivable land within the said tract the said quitrent to commence after the expiration of twenty years the boundaries of which tract of land were described in a paper annexed to the said memorial and are as follows beginning on the south side of the river ohio opposite to the mouth of scioto thence southerly through the pass in the quasioto mountains to the     south side of the said mountains thence along the side of the said mountains northeasterly to the fork of the great kenhawa made by the junction of green briar and new river thence along the said green briar river on the easterly side of the same into the head or termination of the northeasterly branch thereof thence easterly to the alleghany mountains thence along the said alleghany mountains to lord fairfaxs line thence along the same to the spring head of the north branch of the river potosomack thence along the western boundary line of the province of maryland to the southern boundary line of the province of pennsylvania thence along the said boundary line of the province of pennsylvania to the end thereof thence along the western boundary line of the said province of pennsylvania until the same shall strike the river ohio thence down the said river ohio to the place of beginning that the said lords commissioners of the treasury took into consideration the said memorial and paper containing a description of the lands applied for and agreed to accept the price offered to be paid for the purchase of the said lands in case the other departments of his said majestys government who were the proper judges of the policy of the grant applied for should approve such grant but with respect to the quitrents proposed to be reserved and the periods at which they should commence their said lordships postponed any decision thereon till they received information from the earl of hillsborough and the board of trade what quitrents were reserved on grants in his said majestys colonies which     lie nearest to the lands in question and from what periods after the grants such quitrents commenced respectively that on the   th day of january    0 the earl of hillsborough transmitted to the said board of treasury an account of the quitrents reserved in such grants of lands in north america as were nearest to the lands applied for that your memorialists and their associates being informed that arthur lee esq who had prayed his said majesty on the   th day of march      to give and grant to him and his associates   0000 acres of the said land had presented a petition to the lords commissioners for trade and plantations as had also colonel george mercer in behalf of the ohio company who claimed  00000 acres within the limits of the tract prayed for and that the said petitions had been transmitted to the said lords commissioners of the treasury for the purpose of staying the grant of the lands to your memorialists and their associates they therefore on the fourth day of april    0 represented to the said lords of the treasury that as their lordships had agreed to the sum offered to be paid for the said purchase and nothing was wanting to complete the same but fixing the time for the commencement of the quitrents they hoped the conclusion of their treaty would not be delayed at the request of the said petitioners that on the  th of april    0 the lord commissioners of the treasury having been attended by your memorialists and several of their associates their     lordships acquainted them that as the matter contained in the said petition of colonel mercer related singly to the question how far the grant to your memorialists and their associates could be made consistently with justice it could not properly come under the consideration of that board who had nothing before them but the settlement of the purchase money and quitrents to be paid and with respect to these points their lordships agreed to accept the proposition of the memorialists as to the purchase money and quitrents to be paid for the said grant that on the eighth day of may    0 your memorialists and their associates presented a petition to his said majesty in council praying that a grant of the said lands should be made to them reserving therein to all persons their just and legal rights to any parts or parcels of said lands which might be comprehended within the tract prayed for by the memorialists that your memorialists and their associates having agreed with the said colonel george mercer on behalf of the ohio company he withdrew his application to his said majesty for a separate grant of lands within the tract prayed for by the memorialists and relinquished all claim thereto that on the twentyfifth day of may    0 the lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs referred to the lord commissioners for trade and plantations the memorialists said petition of the  th of may    0 that in july    0 when the aforesaid petition was under the consideration of the lords commissioners     for trade and plantations the earl of hillsborough was pleased to send for and acquaint your memorialists and several of their associates that the said commissioners were of the opinion that the government of virginia should be furnished with copies of all papers relating to your memorialists and associates contract with the lords commissioners of the treasury and that until such time as an answer was received to a letter which the earl of hillsborough was directed by his britannic majesty to write to the governor of the colony inclosing the said papers all further proceedings with your memorialists and their associates touching the premises must be suspended but his lordship was pleased to assure your memorialists and several of their associates that he should by the said kings express command forbid the governor of virginia to grant any warrants for or suffer any surveys to be made on any lands within the boundaries of the contract of your memorialists or beyond the limits prescribed by the royal proclamation of      that on the   th of february      the honorable mr walpole one of your memorialists associates understanding that an answer was received from the president and council of virginia to the foregoing letter of the earl of hillsborough made application to his lordship for a copy of the same and on the day following his lordship by letter informed mr walpole that he had directed copies to be made and sent him of such parts of the letter he had received from virginia as related to your memorialists application for lands in america now before     the board of trade and that accordingly your memorialists and their associates were furnished with copies of such parts of mr president nelsons letter dated williamsburgh october       0 as related to their contract aforesaid by which it appeared that all the proceedings concerning the said contract with the lords commissioners of the treasury transmitted as above by order of the board of trade and the earl of hillsboroughs letter of the  0th of july    0 forbidding by the said kings order the granting of any more lands westward of the alleghany mountains had been received read in council and maturely considered that it also appeared that the said president and council had represented to the earl of hillsborough that his late majesty george ii had been pleased to order  00000 acres of land to be granted to the ohio company and that governor dinwiddie had by proclamation promised  00000 acres on or near the ohio to such persons as would voluntarily enter the kings service for the defence of the frontiers etc as upon reference being had to the said letter will more particularly appear but at the same time the said president and council observed that in all other grants he did not find any steps had been taken towards surveying and seating them of course he added they are or will become lapsed and also that we do not presume to say to whom our gracious sovereign should grant his vacant lands all that we can consistently with our duty hope for is that all prior rights whether equitable or legal may be preserved and protected     that upon the earl of hillsborough receiving the foregoing letter his lordship wrote to mr president nelson january        acknowledged the receipt of his despatches nos     and   and observed to him that as the first related to a matter under the consideration of the lords of trade his majesty had ordered copies thereof and of its enclosures to be sent to that board and that his lordship had no doubt but in the consideration of them attention would be given to the equitable claims of those bona fide letters whose possessions were derived from the grants made to the ohio company in      or such as were passed in consequence of instructions from his late majesty or lieutenantgovernor dinwiddies proclamation at the commencement of last war that after much attendance and solicitation at the board of trade the earl of hillsborough and other lords commissioners of that board did on the fifteenth day of april      make a report to the said lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs as to the propriety of the grant prayed for by your memorialists and their associates both in point of policy and justice and among other reasons assigned by their lordships against the policy of the said grant they were pleased to observe that the tract prayed for was out of all advantageous intercourse with great britain    and with regard to the justice of the said grant their lordships were pleased to report that they presumed this consideration could have reference only to the case of such persons who had already possession of lands in that part of the country under legal titles derived   0 from grants made by the governor and council of virginia that on the first day of july      the said lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs took the said report of the said lords commissioners for trade and plantations into consideration and having heard what your memorialists and their associates had to offer thereupon did humbly report to his said majesty that it appeared to them upon full and mature consideration of the evidence which the petitioners had produced in support of their said petition the most material part of which had not been produced at the board of trade  st that the lands in question had been for some time past and were then in an actual state of settling numbers of families to a very considerable amount removing thither from his said majestys other colonies  d that the lands in question did not lie beyond all advantageous intercourse with the kingdom of great britain that the lords of the said council for plantation affairs did at the same time report to his said majesty that it was their opinion that in case his said majesty should be graciously pleased to make a grant of any part of the lands in question that the petitioners were best entitled to such mark of his majestys royal favor in regard they were the first who had made proposals for the purchase from government of lands in his majestys plantations in america and had agreed to take the whole expense of the civil government on themselves and their     lordships at the same time that they recommended it to his said majesty to comply with the prayer of the petitioners submitted it as their opinion that orders should be sent to the superintendent of indian affairs to apprise the tribes of the six nations and their confederates of such intended settlement and that the said lords commissioners for trade and plantations should be directed to prepare a proper clause or clauses to be inserted in the grant saving and reserving to the respective occupiers all prior claims to lands within the limits of the said grant whether derived from equitable or legal titles and further strictly prohibiting the petitioners and their associates and their and each and every of their heirs and assigns from settling occupying or improving any part of the lands lying between the line which had been settled by the treaty as well with the tribes of the six nations and their confederates as with the cherokee indians as the boundary line between his said majestys territories and the hunting grounds of the indians and the line proposed by the petitioners beginning on the south side of the river ohio opposite to the mouth of scioto and running thence southerly through the pass of the quasioto mountains to the south side of the said mountains but that all that part of the said lands comprehended between the said two lines should remain wholly unsettled and unoccupied by the petitioners and their associates and each and every of their heirs and assigns until such time as his said majestys allowance and permission for the settling and occupying the same     should be first obtained and lastly the said lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs did report to his said majesty that it was their opinion that to the end the several persons actually settled or that might thereafter settle might be more properly and quietly governed the said settlement and district should be erected into a separate government in such form and manner as to his said majestys wisdom should seem meet and other such restrictions and regulations as his said majestys lord commissioners for trade and plantations should advise that on the fourteenth day of august      his said majesty taking the said report of the said lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs into consideration was pleased with the advice of his privy council to approve thereof and to order that the lord commissioners for trade and plantations should consider and report to his majesty in council if any and what terms of settlement and cultivation and what restrictions and reservations to the british crown were necessary to be inserted in the said grant exclusive of the money agreed to be paid by the petitioners in consideration of the said tract of land and the reservation of a quitrent of two shillings for every hundred acres of cultivable land within the said tract after the expiration of twenty years and that they should likewise prepare a proper clause or clauses to be inserted therein for saving and reserving to the respective occupiers all prior claims to lands within the limits of the said intended grant whether derived under equitable or     legal titles and also strictly prohibiting the petitioners and their associates and each and every of their heirs and assigns from settling occupying or improving any part of the lands which lie between the line which had been settled by treaty as well with the tribes of the six nations and their confederates as with the cherokee indians as the boundary line between his said majestys territories and the hunting grounds of the indians and the line proposed to be drawn by the petitioners as above described but that all that part of the said lands comprehended between the said two lines should remain wholly unsettled and unoccupied by the petitioners and their associates and each and every of their heirs and assigns till such time as the petitioners their heirs and assigns should have obtained his said majestys permission and allowance for settling and occupying the same and his said majesty was pleased further to order that the said lords commissioners for trades and plantations should prepare and lay before his majesty in council a plan for establishing a separate government upon the said tract in such form and manner and under such restrictions and regulations as they should judge proper and expedient together with an estimate of the expense and the ways and means by which the same should be defrayed by the petitioners that on the fourteenth day of august his said majesty in council was pleased by a further order in council to approve the report of the said lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs and accordingly to give the necessary directions to the     lords commissioners for trade and plantations for carrying the same into execution and his said majesty was thereby pleased to order that the right honorable the earl of dartmouth one of his said majestys principal secretaries of state should receive his majestys pleasure for directing his majestys superintendent for indian affairs to apprise the chiefs of the six nations and their confederates of his majestys intention to form a settlement upon the lands purchased of them by his majesty in      that in consequence of the said order of council the earl of dartmouth sent instructions to his majestys superintendent for indian affairs and in obedience thereto the deputy agent for indian affairs on the  d of april      assembled the chiefs of the western nations and informed them in his majestys name of his majestys resolution to form a settlement upon part of the lands purchased of the six nations in      and on the sixth day of the same month the chiefs in council returned an answer and therein among other things observed that as their brethren the white people had for some years past been settling in great numbers through that country they could not help being alarmed as they appeared to do it without the authority of their wise people or any good intentions towards them that for the peace of the country it was as necessary for prudent people to govern them as it was for them to take care of their foolish young men and they desired that his majesty might be assured that they wished nothing more than to cultivate the strictest friendship with their brethren the english in that     country and that it would give them the highest satisfaction to take the person whom his majesty should appoint to govern there by the hand and to afford him all the assistance on their parts that they were able to give in renewing and strengthening the chain of friendship and promoting the peace and tranquillity of that part of the country that on the sixth day of may      the earl of dartmouth and the other lords commissioners for trade and plantations were pleased to report to his said majesty that his majesty having been pleased by his order in council of the   th of august      to approve of a report from the right honorable the lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs containing several propositions respecting the application made as aforesaid for a grant of lands upon the river ohio in north america and for erecting the said lands into a separate government and to direct them to report their opinion touching the conditions of the said grant and the plan upon which such separate government ought to be established they did therefore in obedience to his said majestys command take the said order of reference into consideration and represented to his said majesty thereupon that as the measures which his said majesty had been pleased to adopt in regard to his possessions upon the ohio had they humbly conceived been principally founded upon a consideration of the necessity there was for introducing some regular and uniform system of government into a country which though at present a part of the colony of virginia was yet from its remote situation incapable of     participating of the advantages arising from the civil constitution of that colony they did therefore make the consideration of the plan of government the first object of their attention and as they presumed that it was not intended that the limits of the new government to be formed should be confined to the tract proposed to be granted in propriety but that it should comprehend all such parts of that country as by the agreement of the indians were reserved for the settlement of his majestys subjects and which from their nature and remote situation could not participate of the advantages of the civil constitution of any other colony they therefore craved leave humbly to propose  st that the lands comprehended within the boundaries described in the said report should be separated from the colony of virginia and be erected by letterspatent under the great seal of great britain into a distinct colony under the name of vandalia and that the form and constitution of government for the said colony should be such as is in and by the said report mentioned and expressed and particularly that the annual salaries and allowances to the several officers of government within the said new colony should be as follows viz to the governor £ 000 to the chiefjustice  00 to the assistant judges  00 to the attorneygeneral   0 to the clerk of the assembly  0 to the secretary  00 to the two ministers  00  £  00     and that in order to secure the payment of the said establishment together with such further annual sum not exceeding £ 00 as should be necessary for contingent expenses five of the persons to whom the lands prayed for being a part of the lands included within the said new government should give security in the sum of ten thousand pounds sterling for the payment by the proprietors of the sums above mentioned either into the receipt of his said majestys exchequer or into the hands of such person as his said majesty should please to appoint to receive the same the said payments to be made half yearly and the first payment to be made at the expiration of six months from the date of the governors commission and to continue to be paid half yearly as aforesaid until provision should have been made by some act of general assembly to be approved of by his said majesty for the support of the said establishment that pursuant to his said majestys order in council of the fourteenth day of august      so much and such part of the land included within the limits of the new colony as are hereinafter mentioned be granted to your memorialists and their associates—that is to say all the lands included within the following lines viz beginning at the south side of the river ohio opposite to the mouth of scioto then southerly through the pass of the quasioto mountains to the south side of the said mountains then along the side of the said mountains northeasterly to the fork of the great kenhawa made by the junction of green briar river and new river thence along the said green briar river on the easterly side     of the same unto the head or termination of the northeasterly branch thereof thence easterly to the alleghany mountains thence along the said alleghany mountains to lord fairfaxs line thence along the same to the spring head of the north branch of the river potomack thence along the western boundary line of the province of maryland to the southern boundary line of the province of pennsylvania thence along the said boundary line of the province of pennsylvania to the end thereof thence along the western boundary line of the said province of pennsylvania until the same shall strike the river ohio thence down the said river ohio to the place of beginning that the said grant should be made upon the following conditions and reservations—that is to say that the grantees should upon the day of the date of the grant pay into the receipt of his majestys exchequer the sum of ten thousand four hundred and sixty pounds seven shillings and threepence pursuant to the agreement made with his said majestys treasury on the  th of april    0 that the said grantees should yearly and every year for ever pay to his said majesty his heirs and successors or to such person or persons as his said majesty should appoint to receive the same the sum of two shillings sterling for every hundred acres which they should lease let demise plant or settle whether the said lands be settled and planted by the said grantees themselves or by their heirs or assigns or undertenants the said payment not to commence until the expiration of twenty years after     such leasing letting demising planting or settling respectively that for the better ascertaining and securing the payment of the said quitrent all agreements for possession leases grants conveyances demises plantings settlements or proper memorials thereof should be within six months from the date thereof transmitted to the auditor of the plantations in great britain and that all such agreements for possession leases grants conveyances demises plantings settlements or memorials thereof should not be admitted as evidence in any court of law unless the same were registered and recorded as above that in each of the parishes into which the several counties within the province should be divided there should be a tract of three hundred acres reserved for the purpose of a glebe for the support of a minister of the church of england and that such glebe land should be granted by the proprietors or their heirs or assigns as soon as a proper church should be built and twelve vestrymen elected out of such of the parishioners as should subscribe to and profess the doctrine of the church of england and that the said grants be made free from any quitrents or other rents or services whatsoever that the said grantees should within the space of one year from the date of the grant erect and build or cause to be erected and built at their own proper cost and charges within such part of the province granted to them as his said majesty should direct and appoint a house proper for the residence of his said majestys governor and also a church   0 that all prior claims to lands within the limits of the said grant whether derived under equitable or legal titles should be saved and reserved to the respective occupiers and possessors with exception however to all occupancy of what nature or kind soever taken or made subsequent to the agreement for the purchase of the said grant made with the lords of the treasury on the fourth day of january    0 and provided also that the grant of two hundred thousand acres to be made to the officers of the regiment raised and paid by the colony of virginia in      in consequence of the engagement made to them should be located in one continuous tract that there should be a reservation to his said majesty his heirs and successors of all mines of gold silver precious stones and of a right of erecting on any part of the said lands such forts and fortifications as might hereafter be judged necessary for the security and defence of the posssesions of the crown of england in america and lastly their lordships humbly craved leave to represent to his said majesty that they had omitted any restriction upon the proprietors from settling to the west of the line agreed upon with the cherokees at lochabor in october    0 that restriction having as they conceived become altogether unnecessary as the indians had for the sake of a natural boundary consented that the district reserved to his said majesty for settlement should be bounded on the southwest by the river louisa or catawba river which is very far west of the utmost     extent of the tract proposed to be granted in propriety that on the nineteenth day of may      his said majesty was pleased by an order in council of that day to refer the said report of the earl of dartmouth and the other lords commissioners for trade and plantations to the lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs that on the third day of july      their lordships by an order in council bearing date that day were pleased to observe that his said majesty having been pleased by his order in council of the   th of may last to refer unto that committee a report made by the lords commissioners for trade and plantations in pursuance of his said majestys order in council of the   th of august      proposing amongst other things the several conditions and reservations to be inserted in the grant of certain lands on the ohio in north america prayed for by your memorialists and their associates the lords of the committee that day took the same into consideration and were thereby pleased to order that his said majestys attorney and solicitorgeneral should prepare and lay before that committee a draught of a proper instrument to be passed under the great seal of great britain containing a grant to thomas walpole esq and others his associates of the lands prayed for by their memorial inserting in said draught the conditions and reservations proposed in the said report of the lords commissioners for trade and plantations a copy whereof was thereunto annexed     that on the sixteenth day of july      his said majestys attorney and solicitorgeneral made a report to the lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs on the said order of council of july        and after due consideration of the said report their lordships were pleased on the twentyeighth day of october      to make the following mandatory order thereupon viz at the council chamber whitehall the   th day of october      by the right honorable the lords of the committee of council for plantation affairs whereas there was this day laid before their lordships a report from his majestys attorney and solicitorgeneral upon taking into consideration an order of this committee bearing date the  d of july last whereby they are directed to prepare a draught of a proper instrument to be passed under the great seal of great britain containing a grant to the honorable thomas walpole and others his associates of certain lands on the river ohio in north america inserting in the said draught the conditions and reservations proposed in a report of the lords commissioners for trade and plantations bearing date the  th day of may      a copy whereof was annexed to the said order in which report of his majestys said attorney and solicitorgeneral it is humbly submitted that the granting the said lands in joint tenancy will probably render it impossible to make any undergrants with complete titles that the description of the thing to be granted is much     more loose and uncertain than hath been usual in royal grants or than hath been practised so far as they know in any but the grants which were made for the erection of colonies to the first adventurers in america while it was wholly unknown and further that the quitrents will not be so well secured to his majesty if they are not reserved from the lands undergranted instead of being made payable by the grantees the lords of the committee this day took the said report into consideration and are hereby pleased to order that his majestys attorney and solicitorgeneral do prepare and lay before this committee the draught of a proper instrument to be passed under the great seal of great britain containing a grant to the honorable thomas walpole samuel wharton benjamin franklin and john sarjent esquires and their heirs and assigns of the lands prayed for by their memorial they being the persons who in behalf of themselves and their associates contracted for the said lands with the lords commissioners of his majestys treasury inserting in the said draught the conditions and reservations proposed in the said report of the lords commissioners for trade and plantations dated the  th of may      excepting that part of the said report which proposes that the grantees do pay the quitrents to his majesty his heirs and successors and in respect thereof the lords of the committee are hereby pleased to order that the said quitrents be reserved from the lands which shall be leased sold demised planted or settled whether the said lands be planted and settled by the said grantees themselves     or by their heirs or assigns or undertenants the said payment of the quitrents not to commence until the expiration of twenty years after such leasing demising planting or settling respectively and for the better ascertaining the bounds of the said tract of land to be granted as aforesaid their lordships are hereby pleased to transmit the map of the tract of land prayed for by the memorialists and to order that his majestys attorney and solicitorgeneral do insert the bounds in the same manner as they are described and ascertained in the said report of the lords commissioners for trade and plantations dated the  th of may      that your memorialists and their associates understanding in the autumn of      that the earl of dunmore the then governor of virginia had presumed to pass grants for some lands comprehended within the bounds of their contract aforesaid represented the same to the earl of dartmouth at that time secretary of state for the american department and his lordship was pleased to convey his britannic majestys command to the said governor in the following words lord dartmouth   october      whitehall benjamin franklin whitehall   october      my lord— as your lordship says that you were entirely ignorant of the claims of walpole and his associates otherwise than by common report i think fit to enclose your lordship a copy of lord hillsboroughs letter to lord bottetourt of the  0th july    0 the receipt of which was acknowledged by mr president nelson a few days after lord     bottetourts death and appears by his answer to it to have been laid before the council that board therefore could not be ignorant of what has passed here upon mr walpoles application nor of the kings express command contained in lord hillsboroughs letter that no land whatever should be granted beyond the limits of the royal proclamation of      until the kings further pleasure was signified and i have only to observe that it must have been a very extraordinary neglect in them not to have informed your lordship of that letter and those orders i am etc signed dartmouth that in the spring of      the draught of a royal grant for the lands aforesaid being prepared pursuant to the said order of council and having undergone the examination and correction of lord camden and others of your memorialists associates in england the lord president of his majestys privy council requested that the honorable mr walpole and his associates would wait for the grant aforesaid and the plan of government of vandalia until hostilities which had then commenced between great britain and the united colonies should cease that your memorialists and their associates did incur a great loss of time particularly samuel wharton in the absence of more than eight years from his family connections and affairs and expended the sum of nine thousand five hundred and fiftyseven pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence sterling money of     great britain in conducting this business through the various offices and departments of the british government and in making presents to the indians on the river ohio in order to maintain peace and tranquillity there and by these means together with the before recited contract between them and the said british government your memorialists and their associates did acquire an equitable title to the lands in question notwithstanding the instrument for actually conveying the same was not completed on account of the difference which arose between the united colonies and great britain and as your honors have now succeeded to the sovereignty of the territory in question your memorialists confide that you will think it just and reasonable to consider the said lands as subject to such contracts and dispositions as were made concerning them while they confessedly belonged to the british crown and that your memorialists and their associates who have ever been ready to fulfil their parts of the said contract may not suffer so great an injury by a change of sovereignty as to be deprived of their equitable rights to the said lands your memorialists therefore humbly pray that the said lands may be granted to them and to their heirs and assigns in trust nevertheless for and concerning the respective purports and shares belonging to their several associates upon the terms and conditions of the said contract and order of council or upon such other terms as may be convenient to the interests of the united states and not injurious to your memorialists and their associates     and your memorialists as in duty bound shall ever pray etc saml wharton b franklin benjamin franklin   march    0 passy paul jones to captain paul jones passy   march    0 dear sir— i received the

mentioned to you m de sartine desires also a place for a passenger that goes on some business from him i make no doubt of your willingness to oblige that minister i could wish also that you would find room for mr brown of south carolina who is about returning there i do not know that i have authority to give the order you desire to lieutenant rhodes but if you and he agree in the transportation proposed i have no objection to it captain landais has demanded of me an order to you to deliver him his trunks and things that were left on board the alliance i find him so exceedingly captious and critical and so apt to misconstrue as an intended injustice every expression in our language he does not immediately understand that i am tired of writing any thing for him or about him and am determined to have nothing further to do with him i make no doubt however that you will deliver his things to any     person he may empower to receive them and therefore think such an order unnecessary i have not yet received an answer to the memorial i sent to the court of denmark reclaiming the prizes sent into norway and delivered up unjustly by that court to the british consul i have not heard that they have yet left bergen i hope we may yet recover them or their value there is a mr lockyer who has served twentytwo years in the british navy as a master and having met with some injustice would go to america in hopes of finding service there he wishes to go with you and if you can give him any employment on board it will be very agreeable to him dr bancroft being by this time with you will take all steps possible to promote your refitting and forward the payment of the prize money i do not comprehend what the weight of metal has to do with the division unless where ships are fitted out by different owners i hope your indisposition will soon be over and your health reestablished being with sincere esteem dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin

for the use of the congress for doing which this order shall be your warrant signed b franklin minister p etc etc benjamin franklin    june    0 passy paul jones to commodore paul jones passy    june    0 dear sir— saturday morning last i received a letter signed by about     of the sailors of the alliance declaring that they would not raise the anchor nor depart from lorient till they had six months wages paid them and the utmost farthing of their prize money including the ships sent into norway and until their legal captain p landais is restored to them or to that effect for i have not the letter before me this mutiny has undoubtedly been excited by that captain probably by making them believe that satisfaction has been received for those norway prizes delivered up to the english which god knows is not true the court of denmark not having yet resolved to give us a shilling on that account that he is concerned in this meeting he has been foolish enough to furnish us with proofs the sailors letter being not only enclosed under a cover     directed to me in his handwriting but he has also in the same writing interlined the words their legal captain p landais which happened to contain his signature i went immediately to versailles to demand the assistance of government and on showing the letter by which his signature quite plainly appeared an order was immediately granted and sent away the same evening for apprehending and imprisoning him and orders were promised to be given at the same time to the commissary of the port to afford you all kind assistance to facilitate your departure m de chaumont being with me and assisting warmly in obtaining these orders we thought it best at the same time to give directions that those sailors who have signed this letter should not be favored with receiving any part of the money ordered to be advanced in part of what it is supposed the serapis and countess may be sold for unless to such as express their sorrow for having been so misled and willingness to do their duty and that they may be known their letter was sent down to m de monplaiser but care should be taken that it be returned as it contains the proofs above mentioned against landais who will probably be tried for his life being considered by the ministers as an emigrant without the kings permission and therefore still a frenchman and when found in france still subject to its laws when that advance was ordered it was supposed the vessels might have been got away without waiting for the sale and that the people who had a right to share them receiving this in part to relieve their present necessities might have     appointed some agent to receive and remit the rest to them in america but the delays have been so great that the time of sale now approaches and perhaps the produce may be known before you can be ready to depart with the ariel and if ready money is paid the division may be made at once if any unforeseen difficulties should arise to prevent this i see no other way but to separate those who cannot trust to their country to do them justice and put them on shore and let them wait for their shares at their own expense for t is unreasonable to keep the ship here at so monstrous an expense to the public for their private advantage or humors as to wages i have no authority or means of paying wages here and i believe that all maritime states pay their ships at home for it cannot be supposed that payofficers are to be kept in every port of the world to which ships may happen to go besides it cannot be known here what their families or attorneys have received for them i see you are likely to have a great deal of trouble it requires prudence i wish you well through it you have shown your abilities in fighting you have now an opportunity of showing the other necessary part in the character of a great chief—your abilities in governing adieu yours sincerely b franklin benjamin franklin    june    0 passy paul jones to commodore paul jones passy   oclock pm    june    0 dear sir— i have this minute received yours of the   d the letter you mention having sent me by     the last post enclosing the necessary papers to explain circumstances is not come to hand so that i am much in the dark about your present situation i only learn by other means that the alliance is gone out of the port and that you are not likely to recover and have relinquished the command of her so that affair is over and the business is now to get the goods out as well as we can i am perfectly bewildered with the different schemes that have been proposed to me for this purpose by mr williams mr ross yourself and m de chaumont mr williams was for purchasing ships i told him i had not the money but he still urges it you and mr ross proposed borrowing the ariel i joined in the application for that ship we obtained her she was to carry all that the alliance could not take now you find her insufficient an additional ship has already been asked and could not be obtained i think therefore it will be best that you take as much in the ariel as you can and depart with it for the rest i must apply to the government to contrive some means of transporting it in their own ships this is my present opinion and when i have once got rid of this business no consideration shall tempt me to meddle again with such matters as i never understand them with great esteem i have the honor to be sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin     benjamin franklin    august    0 passy john paul jones to the honorable commodore john p jones esq at present commanding the ship ariel in service of the united states passy    august    0 sir— you are hereby directed to proceed as soon as possible with the ship under your command to the port you can best make in north america and deliver the arms powder and other stores to such officers of congress as are appointed to take care of such matters for which this shall be your order i am sir your most obedient humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    november    0 passy john paul jones to commodore john paul jones passy    november    0 dear sir— i received the honor of yours of the   th instant i was dissatisfied with mr moylans proceedings in going on with so great and unexpected an expense for the ariel and never giving me the least notice of it till he drew upon me for the amount near one hundred thousand livres drawing too before sending the account and when the account on my demanding it was sent it came only when the last bills were presented and their acceptance demanded which i must either refuse or take the account as it stood without examination or a possibility of examination the vouchers not accompanying it and if i accepted the bills it would be to little purpose afterwards to dispute the articles i might object to however on its being made to appear to me by mr gourlade that you had ordered the     things i objected to and supposing that if i refused paying for them he would sue and embarrass you i some time since accepted all his bills but though i suppose you thought it for the good of the service as you say you did to order that great quantity of medicines for the   gun ship yet after i had written to you of my difficulties it still seems to me that you ought not to have done it without informing me and obtaining my consent and i have only to be thankful that you did not order all her other stores—sails rigging anchors powder etc i think you must be sensible on reflection that with regard to me it was wrong and that it ought not to be expected of me to be always ready and able to pay the demands that every officer in the service may think fit to saddle me with this affair however is now done with and i shall say and think no more about it i understand from mr moylan that the arms must be left for cleaning you can take on board some of the other goods from his stores in their room your bread too he tells me is damaged i have not time to write to him by this post but leave it to him and you to supply that loss in the frugalest manner possible and i am with sincerest wishes for your health honor and happiness dear sir your assured friend and most obedient humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   december    0 passy paul jones to commodore paul jones passy   december    0 dear sir— i wrote to

first advice to you and your friends not to attempt the voyage till a peace which by the good disposition that has lately appeared in your parliament i hope is not far off you would in my opinion

desirous of promoting their happiness richard price   november      newington green benjamin franklin from richard price newington green   november      dear friend— i heard a few days ago with particular pleasure of your safe arrival at philadelphia and of the joy with which you were received there we had been alarmed here by accounts in the public papers of your being taken by an algerine pirate and carried into slavery i was so foolish as to believe this account when i first read it but a little inquiry and consideration soon convinced me that the distress it gave me was groundless may you still live to be happy in the respect and gratitude of your country and to bless it by your counsel it was a mortification to me that i could not make one of the friends who had the pleasure of being with you at southampton i return you many thanks for the kind lines you sent me from thence they gave me great pleasure i received some time ago from mr vaughan a diploma constituting me a member of the philosophical     society at philadelphia will you be so good as to convey to the president and other members of the society in whatever manner you may think proper my very grateful acknowledgments i cannot but be impressed by the honors they have done me and i hope they will accept my wishes of their increasing credit and prosperity to which were it in my power i should be glad to contribute i am sorry for the hostile aspect of affairs between this country and yours the general cry during the war was that the colonies were too important to be given up and that our essential interests depended on keeping them it seems now to be discovered among us that they are of no use to us and the issue may be that we shall lose the trade and friendship of an increasing world and throw it into the scale of france our restraints however will do no good to the united states should their effect be to oblige them to strengthen their federal government to check their rage for trade and to render them more independent by causing them to find all they want within themselves should you happen to see mr vaughan or any of his family deliver my kind compliments to them with every respectful sentiment the most affectionate regard i am ever yours richard price   0      0    alluding probably to fitchs steamboat   bigelows life of franklin appendix no     bigelows life of

inform you that the apprehensions suggested in my last are realized the delegates whom the states appointed to conduct the business of the union in congress till the meeting of the new government have not assembled in sufficient number to form a house consequently there was no opportunity of laying your letter before them and getting it inserted on their minutes i now wish to be informed what is to be done with it whether you would desire it to remain among the other papers of the late congress or have it returned to you i shall wait your orders in the meanwhile accept a fresh assurance of the sincere esteem and regard with which i am etc new york march        there is no evidence that any farther efforts were made by dr franklin to obtain justice from congress on the  st of april      a sufficient number of members had assembled to organize the congress under the new constitution but there is no record in the journals which shows that the above letter to the president of the old congress was ever laid before that body or that the subject was in any manner brought into consideration dr franklins accounts therefore remained unsettled till his death notwithstanding his repeated solicitations to have them examined adjusted and closed no allowance was ever granted for the equitable demands for extra services to which he thought himself entitled nor were the grounds of them even made a subject of inquiry nor was any vote of thanks or approbation ever passed for his long steady and most successful labors in the cause of his country for this he was probably indebted to the lees of virginia—arthur chiefly—and to the proprietary party in pennsylvania whose animosity is not yet entirely extinct—editor   madame helvetius   the bishop of st asaph died in london on the  th of december        these reflections are here presented in a translation from the french as published in castéras edition of the authors writings castéra says that a copy was found among franklins papers and inserted in the journal deconomie publique du  0 ventôse an v but not being able to procure that journal he translated it from the german version contained in the minerva edited by archenholz after passing through two languages the style and other characteristics of the original must of course be essentially changed and probably not for the better   book i chap   this was written in the year      the money price of wages has since that time risen very much in the united states at present      in boston the rate of wages in the same trades is about as follows viz common labor per diem sixtyeight and ¾ cents equal to five shillings and sixpence of the new york currency in shillings and pence shipcarpenters   equal to sixteen shillings new york housewrights     equal to fourteen shillings new york bricklayers     equal to twenty shillings new york tailors   0 equal to twelve shillings new york this is the rate of wages for journeymen in each of the above trades the rate in the principal towns in the northern and middle states generally does not vary materially from that in boston the laborer is supposed to support himself at the above rate of wages and fortunately the pint of rum is not now so generally a part of his requisite supplies as it was at the time when adam smith wrote his work—w phillips   about thirtythree inches   the suggestion in this essay that the capacity of a nation for cheap production is not dependent solely upon the lowness of wages is very just indeed quite obvious and yet it is not usually so satisfactorily presented in works on political economy as it is above those works are apt to lead the reader into a misapprehension on this subject by assigning to the money rate of wages too predominant an influence on the money price of products that it is not decisive in this respect is demonstrated in the example put in the text namely that of england where wages are higher than in any other european country and yet england maintains a successful competition in the foreign markets with other nations and not only with those where labor is cheaper but also with those where interest is lower for instance holland these are disadvantages under which england and still more the united states labor in competition with the dutch in her foreign markets and also the home markets provided all goods both foreign and domestic are admitted into the home market upon the same footing without discrimination how are these disadvantages to be compensated it may be by some or all of the following advantages viz   by low rents and cheap materials   by plenty and cheapness of fuel   by facility of inland transportation   by a good geographical position for marine transportation   by a good mercantile marine   by commercial advantages secured by treaties and conventions with foreign nations   by superior intelligence and skill of operatives   by improvements in machinery and more perfect implements   by more intense industry rendering a days labor more effective independently of any superiority of skill or implements  0 by superior sagacity activity and enterprise on the part of the undertakers and conductors of the national industry    by the greater enterprise skill and activity of the merchants in comparing the condition of different nations as competitors in commerce these causes ought all to be kept in view no less than the money rate of wages and the rate of interest and so presented that a just weight may be assigned to each in regard to the influence of the growth of the united states upon the rate of wages in europe franklins argument supposes that the increase of employment for european laborers will be greater in proportion to the increase of the laborers themselves than if the country were stationary the proposition is probably true but not so obviously so that it can be taken for granted the essay would have been clearer and more satisfactory had this question been treated—w phillips   marked ideas for the prints   relating to the claims of the socalled american loyalists see supra p      this performance was published in      and entitled a speech intended to have been spoken on the bill for altering the charters of the colony of massachusetts bay   mr carroll was at this time a senator in congress from maryland the first congress under the new constitution had recently convened in new york in march      dr franklin and mr carroll had been joint commissioners appointed by the continental congress with instructions to form a union between the canadas and the united colonies   that the rector be a man of good understanding good morals diligent and patient learned in the languages and sciences and a correct pure speaker and writer of the english tongue to have such tutors under him as shall be necessary the english language might be taught by grammar in which some of our best writers as tillotson addison pope algernon sidney catos letters etc should be classics the styles principally to be cultivated being the clear and the concise reading should also be taught and pronouncing properly distinctly and emphatically not with an even tone which underdoes nor a theatrical which overdoes nature mr locke speaking of grammar p     says that to those the greatest part of whose business in this world is to be done with their tongue and with their pens it is convenient if not necessary that they should speak properly and correctly whereby they may let their thoughts into other mens minds the more easily and with the greater impression upon this account it is that any sort of speaking so as will make him be understood is not thought enough for a gentleman he ought to study grammar among the other helps of speaking well but it must be the grammar of his own tongue of the language he uses that he may understand his own country speech nicely and speak it properly without shocking the ears of those it is addressed to with solecisms and offensive irregularities and to this purpose grammar is necessary but it is the grammar only of their own proper tongues and to those who would take pains in cultivating their language and perfecting their styles whether all gentlemen should not do this i leave to be considered since the want of propriety and grammatical exactness is thought very misbecoming one of that rank and usually draws on one guilty of such faults the imputation of having had a lower breeding and worse company than suit with his quality if this be so as i suppose it is it will be matter of wonder why young gentlemen are forced to learn the grammars of foreign and dead languages and are never once told of the grammar of their own tongues they do not so much as know there is any such thing much less is it made their business to be instructed in it nor is their own language ever proposed to them as worthy their care and cultivating though they have daily use of it and are not seldom in the future course of their lives judged of by their handsome or awkward way of expressing themselves in it whereas the languages whose grammars they have been so much employed in are such as probably they shall scarce ever speak or write or if upon occasion this should happen they should be excused for the mistakes and faults they make in it would not a chinese who took notice of this way of breeding be apt to imagine that all our young gentlemen were designed to be teachers and professors of the dead languages of foreign countries and not to be men of business in their own the same author adds p     that if grammar ought to be taught at any time it must be to one that can speak the language already how else can he be taught the grammar of it this at least is evident from the practice of the wise and learned nations among the ancients they made it a part of education to cultivate their own not foreign tongues the greeks counted all other nations barbarous and had a contempt for their languages and though the greek learning grew in credit among the romans towards the end of their commonwealth yet it was the roman tongue that was made the study of their youth their own language they were to make use of and therefore it was their own language they were instructed and exercised in and p     there can scarce be a greater defect says he in a gentleman than not to express himself well either in writing or speaking but yet i think i may ask the reader whether he doth not know a great many who live upon their estates and so with the name should have the qualities of gentlemen who cannot so much as tell a story as they should much less speak clearly and persuasively in any business this i think not to be so much their fault as the fault of their education thus far locke monsieur rollin reckons the neglect of teaching their own tongue a great fault in the french universities he spends great part of his first volume of belleslettres on that subject and lays down some excellent rules or methods of teaching french to frenchmen grammatically and making them masters therein which are very applicable to our language but too long to be inserted here he practised them on the youth under his care with great success mr hutchinson dial p     says to perfect them in the knowledge of their mother tongue they should learn it in the grammatical way that they not only speak it purely but be able both to correct their own idiom and afterwards enrich the language on the same foundation dr turnbull in his observations on a liberal education says p     the greeks perhaps made more early advances in the most useful sciences than any youth have done since chiefly on this account that they studied no other language but their own this no doubt saved them very much time but they applied themselves carefully to the study of their own language and were early able to speak and write it in the greatest perfection the roman youth though they learned the greek did not neglect their own tongue but studied it more carefully than we now do the greek and latin without giving ourselves any trouble about our own tongue monsieur simon in an elegant discourse of his among the memoirs of the academy of belleslettres at paris speaking of the stress the romans laid on purity of language and graceful pronunciation adds may i here make a reflection on the education we commonly give our children it is very remote from the precepts i have mentioned hath the child arrived to six or seven years of age he mixes with a herd of illbred boys at school where under the pretext of teaching him latin no regard is had to his mother tongue and what happens what we see every day a young gentleman of eighteen who has had this education cannot read for to articulate the words and join them together i do not call reading unless one can pronounce well observe all the proper stops vary the voice express the sentiment and read with a delicate intelligence nor can he speak a jot better a proof of this is that he cannot write ten lines without committing gross faults and because he did not learn his own language well in his early years he will never know it well i except a few who being afterwards engaged by their profession or their natural taste cultivate their minds by study and yet even they if they attempt to write will find by the labor composition costs them what a loss it is not to have learned their language in the proper season education among the romans was upon a quite different footing masters of rhetoric taught them early the principles the difficulties the beauties the subtleties the depths the riches of their own language when they went from those schools they were perfect masters of it they were never at a loss for proper expressions and i am much deceived if it was not owing to this that they produced such excellent works with so marvellous facility pliny in his letter to a lady on choosing a tutor for her son speaks of it as the most material thing in his education that he should have a good latin master of rhetoric and recommends julius genitor for his eloquent open and plain faculty of speaking he does not advise her to a greek master of greek rhetoric though the greeks were famous for that science but to a latin master because latin was the boys mother tongue in the above quotation from monsieur simon we see what was the office and duty of the master of rhetoric to form their style they should be put on writing letters to each other making abstracts of what they read or writing the same things in their own words telling or writing stories lately read in their own expressions all to be revised and corrected by the tutor who should give his reasons explain the force and import of words etc this mr locke recommends educ p     and says the writing of letters has so much to do in all the occurrences of human life that no gentleman can avoid showing himself in this kind of writing occasions will daily force him to make this use of his pen which besides the consequence that in his affairs the well or ill managing of it often draws after it always lays him open to a severer examination of his breeding sense and abilities than oral discourses whose transient faults dying for the most part with the sound that gives them life and so not subject to a strict review more easily escape observation and censure he adds had the methods of education been directed to their right end one would have thought this so necessary a part could not have been neglected whilst themes and verses in latin of no use at all were so constantly everywhere pressed to the racking of childrens invention beyond their strength and hindering their cheerful progress by unnatural difficulties but custom has so ordained it and who dares disobey and would it not be very unreasonable to require of a learned countryschoolmaster who has all the tropes and figures in farnabys rhetoric at his fingers ends to teach his scholar to express himself handsomely in english when it appears to be so little his business or thought that the boys mother despised t is like as illiterate for not having read a system of logic or rhetoric outdoes him in it to speak and write correctly gives a grace and gains a favorable attention to what one has to say and since t is english that an englishman will have constant use of that is the language he should chiefly cultivate and wherein most care should be taken to polish and perfect his style to speak or write better latin than english may make a man talked of but he will find it more to his purpose to express himself well in his own tongue that he uses every moment than to have the vain commendations of others for a very insignificant quality this i find universally neglected nor no care taken anywhere to improve young men in their own language that they may thoroughly understand and be masters of it if any one among us have a facility or purity more than ordinary in his mother tongue it is owing to chance or his genius or any thing rather than to his education or any care of his teacher to mind what english his pupil speaks or writes is below the dignity of one bred up among greek and latin though he have but little of them himself these are the learned languages fit only for learned men to meddle with and teach english is the language of the illiterate vulgar though the great men among the romans were daily exercising themselves in their own language and we find yet upon the record the names of orators who taught some of their emperors latin though it were their mother tongue t is plain the greeks were yet more nice in theirs all other speech was barbarous to them but their own and no foreign language appears to have been studied or valued amongst that learned and acute people though it be past doubt that they borrowed their learning and philosophy from abroad to the same purpose writes a person of eminent learning in a letter to dr turnbull nothing certainly says he can be of more service to mankind than a right method of educating the youth and i should be glad to hear ——— to give an example of the great advantage it would be to the rising age and to our nation when our public schools were first established the knowledge of latin was thought learning and he that had a tolerable skill in two or three languages thought his mind was not enlightened by any real knowledge was a profound scholar but it is not so at present and people confess that men may have obtained a perfection in these and yet continue deeply ignorant the greek education was of another kind which he describes in several particulars and adds they studied to write their own tongue more accurately than we do latin and greek but where is english taught at present who thinks it of use to study correctly that language which he is to use every day in his life be his station ever so high or ever so insignificant it is in this the nobility and gentry defend their country and serve their prince in parliament in this the lawyers plead the divines instruct and all ranks of people write their letters and transact their affairs and yet who thinks it worth his learning to write this even accurately not to say politely every one is suffered to form his style by chance to imitate the first wretched model which falls in his way before he knows what is faulty or can relish the beauties of a just simplicity few think their children qualified for a trade till they have been whipt at a latin school for five or six years to learn a little of that which they are obliged to forget when in those years right education would have improved their minds and taught them to acquire habits of writing their own language easily under right direction and this would have been useful to them as long as they lived—introd pp    to form their pronunciation they may be put on making declamations repeating speeches delivering orations etc the tutor assisting at the rehearsals teaching advising correcting their accent etc by pronunciation is here meant the proper modulation of the voice to suit the subject with due emphasis action etc in delivering a discourse in public designed to persuade the manner perhaps contributes more to success than either the matter or method yet the two latter seem to engross the attention of most preachers and other public speakers and the former to

force to justify the plundering and enslaving of europeans it affords at the same time a demonstration of the futility of the arguments in defence of the slavetrade and of the strength of mind and ingenuity of the author at his advanced period of life it furnishes too a no less convincing proof of his power of imitating the style of other times and nations than his celebrated parable against

of the unabated strength of franklins memory was written during the illness which was destined to prove his last and only nine days before his death he died on the   th of april    0 aged eightyfour years and three months during the greatest part of his life dr franklin had enjoyed almost uninterrupted good health in the year      indeed he had an attack of pleurisy which ended in a suppuration of the left lobe of the lungs but from this as well as from another attack of the same kind he recovered completely as he advanced in years however he became subject to fits of the gout to which in      a nephritic colic was superadded from this time he was also affected with the stone as well as the gout and for the last twelve months of his life these complaints confined him almost entirely to his bed notwithstanding his distressed situation his grandson tells us neither his mental faculties nor his natural cheerfulness ever forsook him his memory was tenacious to the very last and he seemed to be an exception to the general rule—that at a certain period of life the organs which are subservient to this faculty become callous a remarkable instance of which is that he learned to speak french with considerable facility after he had attained the age of seventy in the beginning of april    0 he was attacked with a fever and pain in his breast which terminated his existence the following account of his last illness was written by his friend and physician dr jones the stone with which he had been afflicted for several years had for the last twelve months confined him chiefly to his bed and during the extremely painful paroxysms he was obliged to take large doses of laudanum to mitigate his tortures—still in the intervals of pain he not only amused himself with reading and conversing cheerfully with his family and a few friends who visited him but was often employed in doing business of a public as well as private nature with various persons who waited on him for that purpose and in every instance displayed not only that readiness and disposition of doing good which was the distinguishing characteristic of his life but the fullest and clearest possession of his uncommon mental abilities and not unfrequently indulged himself in those jeux desprit and entertaining anecdotes which were the delight of all who heard him about sixteen days before his death he was seized with a feverish indisposition without any particular symptoms attending it till the third or fourth day when he complained of a pain in the left breast which increased till it became extremely acute attended with a cough and laborious breathing during this state when the severity of his pains drew forth a groan of complaint he would observe—that he was afraid he did not bear them as he ought—acknowledged his grateful sense of the many blessings he had received from that supreme being who had raised him from small and low beginnings to such high rank and consideration among men—and made no doubt but his present afflictions were kindly intended to wean him from a world in which he was no longer fit to act the part assigned him in this frame of body and mind he continued till five days before his death when his pain and difficulty of breathing entirely left him and his family were flattering themselves with the hopes of his recovery when an imposthumation which had formed itself in his lungs suddenly burst and discharged a great quantity of matter which he continued to throw up while he had sufficient strength to do it but as that failed the organs of respiration became gradually oppressed—a calm lethargic state succeeded—and on the   th of april    0 about eleven oclock at night he quietly expired closing a long and useful life of eightyfour years and three months in a letter from dr rush to dr price dated at philadelphia a week after franklins death the writer says the papers will inform you of the death of our late friend dr franklin the evening of his life was marked by the same activity of his moral and intellectual powers which distinguished its meridian his conversation with his family upon the subject of his dissolution was free and cheerful a few days before he died he rose from his bed and begged that it might be made up for him so that he might die in a decent manner his daughter told him that she hoped he would recover and live many years longer he calmly replied i hope not upon being advised to change his position in bed that he might breathe easy he said a dying man can do nothing easy all orders and bodies of people have vied with each other in paying tributes of respect to his memory mrs hewson writing to one of dr franklins oldest friends in england thus spoke of her own and the nations loss we have lost that valued that venerable kind friend whose knowledge enlightened our minds and whose philanthropy warmed our hearts but we have the consolation to think that if a life well spent in acts of universal benevolence to mankind a grateful acknowedgment of divine favor a patient submission under severe chastisement and an humble trust in almighty mercy can insure the happiness of a future state our present loss is his gain i was the faithful witness of the closing scene which he sustained with that calm fortitude which characterized him through life no repining no peevish expression ever escaped him during a confinement of two years in which i believe if every moment of ease could be added together would not amount to two whole months when the pain was not too violent to be amused he employed himself with his books his pen or in conversation with his friends and upon every occasion displayed the clearness of his intellect and the cheerfulness of his temper even when the intervals from pain were so short that his words were frequently interrupted i have known him to hold a discourse in a sublime strain of piety i say this to you because i know it will give you pleasure i never shall forget one day that i passed with our friend last summer i found him in bed in great agony but when that agony abated a little i asked if i should read to him he said yes and the first book i met with was johnsons lives of the poets i read the life of watts who was a favorite author with dr franklin and instead of lulling him to sleep it roused him to a display of the powers of his memory and his reason he repeated several of watts lyric poems and descanted upon their sublimity in a strain worthy of them and of their pious author it is natural for us to wish that an attention to some ceremonies had accompanied that religion of the heart which i am convinced dr franklin always possessed but let us who feel the benefit of them continue to practise them without thinking lightly of that piety which could support pain without a murmur and meet death without terror   this letter was written in french for the original see bigelows life of franklin vol iii p     more than a month elapsed before william temple franklin announced the decease of his grandfather to their old friend le veillard it is difficult even at this late day to read with composure the excuses which he then assigned in the letter above for omitting all details of the last illness of his illustrious relative this young man appears nowhere to so little advantage as in his utter inability to comprehend the nature and magnitude of his inheritance the mortal remains of dr franklin were interred in the cemetery of christ church in philadelphia beside those of his wife on the   st day of april    0 a plain marble slab covers the two graves pursuant to the directions of his will with no other inscription than their names and the year of his decease no funeral in america had ever before been so numerously attended and no customary testimonial of respect for the most illustrious dead was lacking on this occasion dr smith provost of the college of philadelphia and david rittenhouse one of its members were selected by the philosophical society to prepare a suitable tribute to its founder and president stiles interpreted the sentiments of the collegiate institutions of the city in a latin eulogy on motion of mr madison it was unanimously resolved by congress then sitting in new york that the members should wear the customary badge of mourning for one month as a mark of due veneration to the memory of a citizen whose native genius was not more an ornament to human nature than his various exertions of it have been precious to science to freedom and to his country a more unusual if not more flattering homage was paid to the memory of the deceased by the national assembly of france on the morning after the news reached paris june   th mirabeau rose and addressed the assembly as follows franklin is dead the genius which gave freedom to america and scattered torrents of light upon europe is returned to the bosom of the divinity the sage whom two worlds claim the man disputed by the history of the sciences and the history of empires holds most undoubtedly an elevated rank among the human species political cabinets have but too long notified the death of those who were never great but in their funeral orations the etiquette of courts has but too long sanctioned hypocritical grief nations ought only to mourn for their benefactors the representatives of free men ought never to recommend any other than the heroes of humanity to their homage the congress hath ordered a general mourning for one month throughout the fourteen confederated states on account of the death of franklin and america hath thus acquitted her tribute of admiration in behalf of one of the fathers of her constitution would it not be worthy of you fellowlegislators to unite yourselves in this religious act to participate in this homage rendered in the face of the universe to the rights of man and to the philosopher who has so eminently propagated the conquest of them throughout the world antiquity would have elevated altars to that mortal who for the advantage of the human race embracing both heaven and earth in his vast and extensive mind knew how to subdue thunder and tyranny enlightened and free europe at least owes its remembrance and its regret to one of the greatest men who has ever served the cause of philosophy and of liberty i propose that a decree do now pass enacting that the national assembly shall wear mourning during three days for benjamin franklin la rochefoucauld and lafayette rose immediately to second the motion of the orator which was adopted by acclamation it was further resolved that the discourse of mirabeau should be printed and that the president of the assembly the abbé sieyès should address a letter of condolence to the congress of the united states the name of benjamin franklin said president sieyès in fulfilling the instructions of the assembly will be immortal in the records of freedom and philosophy but it is more particularly dear to a country where conducted by the most sublime mission this venerable man knew how very soon to acquire an infinite number of friends and admirers as well by the simplicity and sweetness of his manners as by the purity of his principles the extent of his knowledge and the charms of his mind to this letter in compliance with the instructions of congress president washington sent a reply in which he said that so peculiar and so signal an expression of the esteem of so respectable a body for a citizen of the united states whose eminent and patriotic services are indelibly engraved on the minds of his countrymen cannot fail to be appreciated by them as it ought to be two days after the decree of the national assembly m de la rochefoucauld read to the society of      a paper on the life and character of franklin the commune of paris also ordered a celebration in his honor and invited the abbé fauchet to deliver a eulogy of the deceased of which they sent twentysix copies to congress condorcet pronounced an elaborate eulogy also before the académie des sciences on the   th november the printers of paris testified their sense of the loss their calling had sustained by assembling in a large hall in presence of a column surmounted by a bust of franklin with a civic crown upon his head and surrounded by printers cases types press etc and while one of their number delivered a eulogy they printed it on the spot and delivered copies of it to the vast concourse attracted by the occasion the city of passy then a suburb but now one of the most attractive parts of the city of paris testified its respect for franklins memory by giving his name to one of its principal streets within less than a year after his decease the impulse no doubt of his old friend le veillard who was then mayor of that place the motives for this step are officially set forth in the following extract from the official register which was kindly furnished the editor by the custodian des archives de la

this municipality of the long sojourn of that eminent man in this parish as the register from which the foregoing is an extract was destroyed with the hôtel de ville in      and as there is probably

never saw his son william after they separated at southampton in      nor does it appear that they ever held any correspondence with each other subsequent to that event the exgovernor continued to reside in london and attained the ripe age of eightytwo years after the war he married a second time but there is no evidence that he left any issue by these nuptials—editor   the dwellinghouse in which franklin died was torn down in      and the carriageway which led to it is now called franklin court—editor   in pursuance of the instructions and implications of this clause mrs bache sold the outer circle of diamonds and upon the proceeds she and her husband made the tour of europe the miniature was as late as      in the custody of w j duane esq of philadelphia—editor   mrs mecom survived

proved a singularly auspicious investment with the addition of a little to the fund from the city treasury of boston its medals have rewarded the diligence and exemplary conduct of over four thousand boys who have been found to merit them and have no doubt stimulated to extra exertion perhaps hundreds of thousands who were less fortunate the amount of this fund has more than doubled since franklins death—editor   this bequest did not realize the hopes and wishes of its author after trying seven years to get something from it the managers of the hospital decided formally that as many of the bequeathed debts were small numbers of them due from persons unknown and all of them from thirty to sixty years old which precludes every hope of recovering as much as will answer the demands exhibited against the decedent the legacy be not accepted and the ledger be returned to the doctors heirs—editor   these bequests have failed to realize the hopes of the testator the conditions upon which the money was to be loaned were all practically fatal to its success the number of persons who are married under twentyfive years of age in need of so small a sum as two hundred dollars who would be able and willing to produce two responsible sureties for a loan has probably diminished every year in boston since franklins death there were but two hundred and fiftyfive loans from this fund from may      to the end of the year      in sums varying from seventy dollars to two hundred and sixtysix up to the year   00 and of about two hundred dollars since that time from july      to

bonds now out the fate of the bequest in philadelphia so far as it has differed from this has been for the worse it was more reckessly lent and the unloaned balances less prudently invested the

to mr james read who appears to have been a dealer in books and stationery in that city mr hall entered into franklins employ at once and soon became his partner when franklin went abroad as agent of the colonies hall succeeded to the business mr read in a letter to william strahan dated philadelphia feb         says mr hall is perfectly well and gains ground daily in the esteem of all that know him i have no doubt that mr hall will succeed well in all he undertakes he is obliging discreet industrious and honest and where those qualities meet things seldom go amiss nothing in my power shall be wanting to serve him in another letter from mr read dated july        he says i wish you did but know that mr hall is with me in perfect health i have assured him and he shall find me sincere that i will be his friend in every case where i can assist him and will omit no pains by which i can make this distance from his old acquaintance easy to him and shall introduce him into such a new acquaintance as shall make his leisure hours pass on pleasantly i believe he is well satisfied with his present situation and i hope will succeed well in any scheme which mr franklin and he may enter into on this head i refer you to himself as he is now writing    in my last i hinted that i would have you decline dealing with mr franklin for books upon his writing for them but i would rather have you do it than not upon second thoughts for i believe a close correspondence between you and him may be of service both to mr hall and yourself   the spouse here alluded to sarah franklin afterwards

to whom i am also indebted for the following instructive note f n otis benjamin franklin january  0      my dear mr bigelow— the letter of benjamin franklin written in      in regard to the manufacture of a flexible catheter seems to convey the impression that the instrument he so graphically describes was one of his own invention i think however that it simply indicates his familiarity with the instrument previously in use abroad the first mention of a flexible catheter which i can find is by roncalus who at first used a catheter made of a band of silver twisted in a spiral and covered with a fine skin this he improved in    0 by winding the spiral with entwisted silk then dipped it in rosin and afterward gave it a coat of nuremberg plaster bernard a jeweller according to french authority in   00 or thereabouts sewed finely woven silk upon a staff or mandril and stiffened it with elastic gum this is practically the method which is in use in the manufacture of catheters and other flexible urethral instruments at the present day very truly yours f n otis   this note in the margin is in a different handwriting from the body of the letter and was doubtless made by john to whom it was addressed   benjamin the son of his sister mrs mecom   from the papers in the new haven colony historical society collection   this is but one of several intimations that franklin had serious thoughts of quitting america and establishing himself in england how different might have been the history of both countries had this intention ripened   endorsed plans gen extract of a letter from benjamin franklin esq deputy postmastergeneral of north america to the secretary of the postoffice dated january         respecting the communication carried on between new york and other colonies by post read march        r      i do not find this passage precisely in any of voltaires writings it certainly is not in the most accepted edition of his traité sur la tolérance franklin probably quoted at secondhand what voltaire actually wrote which is the foundation for franklins quotation probably will be found in his commentaire sur le livre des délits et des peines œuvres de voltaire par beuchot vol    p     and runs as follows le parlement de toulouse a un usage bien singulier on admet aillieurs des demipreuves qui au fond ne sont que des doutes car on sait quil ny a point de demivérités mais à toulouse on admet des quarts et des huitièmes de preuves on y peut regarder par example un ouïdire comme un quart un autre ouïdire plus vague comme un huitième de sorte que

give the letter here complete—editor   when read by the light of current events in great britain and the united states in the year of our lord      this paragraph furnishes a startling illustration of franklins sagacity and foresight   it is interesting to compare franklins impressions of ireland in      with those of arthur young another acute observer four years later and note the inconsiderable change for the better during the intervening century in his tour in ireland          young writes so much knowledge of the state of a country is gained by hearing the debates of a parliament that i often frequented the gallery of the house of commons since mr flood has been silenced with the vicetreasurership of ireland mr daly mr grattan sir william osborn and the prime sergeant burgh are reckoned high among the irish orators i heard many very eloquent speeches but i cannot say they struck me like the exertion of the abilities of irishmen in the english house of commons owing perhaps to the reflection both on the speaker and auditor that the attorneygeneral of england with a dash of his pen can reverse alter or entirely do away the matured result of all the eloquence and all the abilities of this whole assembly before i conclude with dublin i shall only remark that walking in the streets there from the narrowness and populousness of the principal thoroughfares as well as from the dirt and wretchedness of the canaille is a most uneasy and disgusting exercise         a landlord in ireland can scarcely invent an order which a servant laborer or cottar dares to refuse to execute nothing satisfies him but an unlimited submission disrespect or any thing tending towards sauciness he may punish with his cane or his horsewhip with the most perfect security a poor man would have his bones broke if he offered to lift his hands in his own defence knockingdown is spoken of in the country in a manner that makes an englishman stare landlords of consequence have assured me that many of their cottars would think themselves honored by having their wives and daughters sent for to the bed of their master a mark of slavery that proves the oppression under which such people must live nay i have heard anecdotes of the lives of people being made free with without any apprehension of the justice of a jury but let it not be imagined that this is common formerly it happened every day but law gains ground it must strike the most careless traveller to see whole strings of cars whipped into a ditch by a gentlemans footman to make way for his carriage if they are overturned or broken in pieces no matter it is taken in patience were they to complain they would perhaps be horsewhipped the execution of the laws lies very much in the hands of justices of the peace many of whom are drawn from the most illiberal class in the kingdom if a poor man lodges a complaint against a gentleman or any animal that chooses to call itself a gentleman and the justice issues out a summons for his appearance it is a fixed affront and he will infallibly be called out where manners are in conspiracy against law to whom are the oppressed people to have recourse it is a fact that a poor man having a contest with a gentleman must — but i am talking nonsense they know their situation too well to think of it they can have no defence but by means of protection from one gentleman against another who probably protects his vassal as he would the sheep he intends to eat the colors of this picture are not charged to assert that all these cases are common would be an exaggeration but to say that an unfeeling landlord would do all this with impunity is to keep strictly to truth and what is liberty but a farce and a jest if its blessings are received as the favor of kindness and humanity instead of being the inheritance of right         a better treatment of the poor in ireland is a very material point of the welfare of the whole british empire events may happen which may convince us fatally of this truth if not oppression must have broken all the spirit and resentment of men by what policy the government of england can for so many years have permitted such an absurd
