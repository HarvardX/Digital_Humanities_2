henry and emma a new poetical interlude altered from priors nut brown maid with additions and a new air and chorus the music by dr arne as performed on wednesday april         at the theater royal in covent garden for the benefit of mrs hartley  london sold by t davies in russel street covent garden and all the booksellers in town and country      price sixpence  advertisement it needs the most humble apology from the compiler of this little interlude for the liberties he has taken with a poem so universally and justly admired the different prunings which he judged necessary for his purpose were as sensibly lamented by the hand that performed them as they can possibly be by the most zealous advocate for the ingenious prior these however with various other alterations far from being the result of selfconsequence arose from absolute necessity in order to give the whole an appearance somewhat conformable to the laws of our drama it was therefore found expedient likewise to introduce the two new though trifling characters of venus and eugenius and to conclude the whole with an air and chorus which are here tacked to the piece with every conviction in the breast of the author for his presumption  a transposition of some lines an occasional addition of others some variation of the personal pronouns etc were judged proper to accommodate the performers and prepare the piece for stage representation  under these circumstances it is hoped that this temporary sacrifice of prior will be heartily overlooked by the public since it was made but to assist in some measure the modest merit of mrs hartley and to gratify no other desire in the compiler  april    th      persons of the drama henry mr smith eugenius mr hull emma mrs hartley venus miss brown chorus etc etc henry and emma a new poetical interlude etc scene a moon light view of an extensive forest eugenius entering alone  night silent reigns the world in sleep is laid save henry tortured for his nut brown maid he wretched slave to loves corroding fears greets solemn midnight with his manly tears and clad in false attire with borrowed name now meets the lovely object of his flame from prattling infancy i trained his mind to honors call and virtues most refined now soft repose his troubled breast forsakes of every pang my sympathy partakes though full of years i watch his sorrowing way and strive to guide him by calm reasons ray led by the moons pale lamp through yonder grade the anxious lovers seek this beachen shade their converse trying to fair emmas heart a fiction planned by loves and henrys art with wishes raised with jealousies oppressed alternate tyrants of the human breast by one great trial he resolves to prove the faith of woman and the force of love if scanning emmas virtues he shall find that beauteous frame enclose a steady mind he will fix his hope of future joy secure and live a slave to hymens happy power but if the fair one as he fears is frail light fly her merits and her faults prevail his mind he vows to free from amorous care resume his arms and shine again in war but soft  their mournful accents speak them nigh in spite of fond affection i must fly may no cursed demon over their mind prevail but every thought be weighed in virtues scale exit enter henry and emma henry sincere o tell me have thou felt a pain emma beyond what woman knows to feign has thy uncertain bosom ever strove with the first tumults of a real love if so with pity view my wretched state at least deplore and then forget my fate to some more happy knight reserve thy charms by fortune favored and successful arms for lo these hands in murder are imbrued these trembling feet by justice are pursued and i this night must fly from thee and love condemned in lonely woods a banished man to rove  emma what is true passion if unblest it dies and where is emmas joy if henry flies if love alas be pain the pain i bear no thought can figure and no tongue declare oh cease then coldly to suspect my love and let my deed at least my faith approve alas no youth shall my endearments share nor day nor night shall interrupt my care nor to hard banishment shall henry run while careless emma sleeps on beds of down view me resolved wherever thou leadst to go friend to thy pain and partner of thy woe blessed when my dangers and my toils have shown that i of all mankind could love but thee alone  henry let prudence yet obstruct thy venurous way and take good heed what men will think and say that full of youthful blood and fond of man you to the woodland with an exile ran reflect that lessened fame is never regained and virgin honor once is always stained timely advised the coming evil shun better not do the deed than weep it done no penance can absolve our guilty fame nor tears that wash out sin can wash out shame  emma let emmas hapless case be falsely told by the rash young or the illnatured old let every tongue its various censure choose absolve with coldness or with spite accuse fair truth at last her radiant beams will raise and malice vanquished heighten virtues praise let then thy favor but indulge my flight o let my presence make thy travels light  henry but can thou wield the sword and bend the bow with active force repel the sturdy foe when the loud tumult speaks the battle nigh and winged deaths in whistling arrows fly will thou though wounded yet undaunted stay perform thy part and share the dangerous day  emma near thee mistrust not constant i will abide and share each danger fearless by thy side though my inferior strength may not allow that i should bear or draw the warrior bow with ready hand i will the shaft supply and joy to see thy victor arrows fly touched in the battle by the hostile reed should thou but heaven avert it should thou bleed to stop the wounds my finest lawn i would tear wash them with tears and wipe them with my hair  henry but can thou tender maid can thou sustain afflictive want or hungers pressing pain when with hard toil we seek our evening food berries and acorns from the neighboring wood and find amongst the cliffs no other house but the thin covert of some gathered boughs will thou not then reluctant send thine eye around the dreary waste and weeping try though then alas that trial be too late to find thy fathers hospitable gate that gate whence long excluded thou must mourn that gate for ever barred to thy return  emma did i but purpose to embark with thee on the smooth surface of a summers sea while gentle zephyrs play in prosperous gales and fortunes favor fills the swelling sails but would forsake the ship and make the shore when the winds whistle and the tempests roar no henry no one sacred oath has tied our loves one destiny our life shall guide  henry but ere thou go unhappyst of thy kind thy sex and habit thou must leave behind no longer shall thy comely tresses break in flowing ringlets on thy snowy neck but with a bolder stride and looser air mingled with men a man thou must appear vagrants and outlaws shall offend thy view for such must be my friends a hideous crew with such must emma hunt the tedious day assist their violence divide their prey with such she must return at setting light though not partaker witness of their night now emma now the last reflection make what thou would follow what thou must forsake  emma o grief of heart that our unhappy fates force thee to suffer what thy honor hates mix thee amongst the bad or make thee run too near the paths which virtue bids thee shun yet with her henry still let emma go with him abhor the vice but share the woe and sure my little heart can never err amidst the worst if henry still be there  henry o wildest thought of an abandoned mind name habit parents woman left behind even honor dubious thou preferrst to go wild to the woods with me said emma so or did i dream what emma never said o guilty error and oh wretched maid whose roving fancy would resolve the same with him who next should tempt her easy fame  emma are there not poisons racks and flames and swords that emma thus must die by henrys words yet what could swords or poison racks or flame but mangle and disjoint this brittle frame more fatal henrys words they murder emmas fame did ever my tongue speak my unguarded heart the least inclined to play the wantons part did ever my eye one inward thought reveal which angels might not hear and virgins tell and have thou henry in my conduct known one fault but that which i must ever own that i of all mankind have loved but thee alone  henry vainly thou talk of loving me alone each man is man and all the sex is one nor in loves ritual can we ever find vows made to last or promises to bind be wise and false shun trouble seek delight change thou the first nor wait thy lovers flight why should thou weep let nature judge our case i saw thee young and fair pursued the chase of youth and beauty i another saw fairer and younger yielding to the law of our allruling mother i pursued more youth more beauty blessed vicissitude this younger fairer pleads her rightful charms with present power compels me to her arms and years may roll ever in her turn the maid shall weep the ardor of my love decayed  emma are we in life through one great error led is each man perjured and each nymph betrayed of the superior sex art thou the worst am i of mine the most completely cursed yet let me go with thee and going prove from what i will endure how much i love this potent beauty this triumphant fair this happy object of our different care her let me follow her let me attend a servant she may scorn the name of friend yet when increasing grief brings slow disease and ebbing life on terms severe as these will have its little lamp no longer fed when henrys mistress shows him emma dead rescue my poor remains from vile neglect with virgin honors let my hearse be decked oh let my henry then at least persuade this happy nymph that emma may be laid where thou dear author of my death where she with frequent eye my sepulcher may see see the sad fate which she may one day prove who hopes from henrys vows eternal love  henry hear solmn jove and conscious venus hear and thou bright maid believe me whilst i swear no time no change no future flame shall move the wellplacd basis of my lasting love o powerful virtue o victorious fair at least excuse a trial too severe no banished man condemned in woods to rove entreats thy pardon and implores thy love in me behold the potent edgars heir beloved in peace and terrible in war crown of my love and honor of my youth henry thy henry with eternal truth as thou may wish shall all his life employ and sound his glory in his emmas joy music and song shall wake the marriageday and while the priests accuse the brides delay myrtles and roses shall obstruct her way hence then for ever from my emmas breast that heaven of softness and that seat of rest ye doubts and fears and all that know to move tormenting grief and all that trouble love  emma o day the fairest sure that ever rose period and end of anxious emmas woes sire of her joy and source of her delight now winged with pleasure take thy happy flight yet tell thy votry potent queen of love henry my henry will he never rove will he be ever kind and just and good and is there yet no mistress in the wood none none there is the thought was rash and vain a false idea and a fancied pain
