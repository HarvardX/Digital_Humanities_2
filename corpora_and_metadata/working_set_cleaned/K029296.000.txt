enter darnley and sir george gauntlet sir george and so darnley you prefer this solitary life to all the joys of london  to be sure you have a nice snug villa and a charming wife here  but its dull  the scene tires  it wants variety harry   darnley no sir george  since i retired to this peaceful spot i have not had a wish beyond it i have been so happy in that humble cottage that when i am doomed to leave it the world will be a waste and life not have a charm   sir george how you are altered darnley when we were brother officers you were the greatest rake in the regiment but from the time we were quartered at worcester where you first beheld miss dormer    darnley i saw the folly of my former life i owned the power of her superior charms and leaving a busy and tumultuous world retired with her to this sequestered scene  it is now three years since i married   sir george and from that time to this have you lived in this outoftheway place   darnley yes and till you yesterday honored me with a visit i have not seen a friend within my doors  but is not it a happy life sir george our affections have room to shoot  care and distrust are banished from our cottage and with such a woman as mrs darnley to converse with what is the world to me i can defy and scorn its malice   sir george she is an angelic creature indeed darnley and at worcester i had myself nearly fallen a victim to her charms but about your future life  do you mean to live for ever in these woods and meadows   darnley no  would to heaven i could  i fear i must forego my present calm and mix in active life again when i married i sold my commission you remember to purchase this small farm  mrs darnleys portion was but a trifle and an increasing family has so enlarged my expenses that unless i return to the army    sir george ah  you want to be raking again   darnley no  i want to secure an independence for my family  i want to see my children affluent and to attain this i have once more applied to my uncle sir paul perpetual who was so offended at my selling out that he has ever since abandoned me   sir george what  does the old beau still persevere in his resentment   darnley his anger has increased for he writes me word he intends marrying lady sarah savage on purpose to have heirs more worthy his estate  oh my friend  it is hard that fortune should bestow such treasures and then compel me to desert them   sir george so it is but now i think on it this lady sarah savage and her brother are my intimate friends and as you are their neighbors i will introduce you and mrs darnley to their notice  when are they expected from town   darnley to day   sir george then well pay them a visit lady sarah savage shall interfere with your uncle and if that fails her brother can easily ensure your promotion in the army  but see here is mrs darnley   darnley look at her sir george  do you can you blame me  who would not act as i have done   sir george i would by heavens  i would live

we have never lived a day apart and if they lure you into fashionable scenes you will be corrupted harry  you will despise the humble roof you once revered and i perhaps shall be forgotten and neglected   darnley never  i cannot bear the supposition and while we have hearts to endure and hands to labor there is sufficient for our cottage  i will not go  my friend who sees my motive i am sure will not condemn me   sir george no  always obey the ladies but darnley i see our horses  you recollect we were to ride to see your children so madam i have the superlative honor    enter clara

tincture has entirely removed the gout from the extremities and she now hunts shoots eats and drinks more freely than ever  now is not it a shame maam between them they plunder both the patient and

of life and all its pleasures   sir george ay what indeed  in town  and savagehouse is the same thing you see for they always bring london into the country with them  but lady sarah darnley  i saw you

let a man escape  who mark you for their prey  lure you into their talons and if you dont yield will so claw you    darnley what make me love her whether i will or not   sir george certainly but consider the advantages of her friendship first she can get you promotion in the army secondly by gaining an ascendancy over her you may prevent her marrying your uncle and thirdly you can provide for your family without injuring your honor  there  there is an opportunity   darnley that is true and if i thought  harkye as we are alone and youre my best of friends  i have got a letter from her the

grief is that he never had a son he wants my consent to marry my sister   darnley and do you mean to consent sir   savage certainly  i say aside to sir george  i want his fortune to repair my own and

cough they laugh  why what do you laugh at   savage nothing  nothing  only we wondered how such a chicken as you could struggle against a pair of such mortal disorders  but seriously  what takes you to bath   sir paul such an event i have traced a son a boy above twenty years of age that is my first reason  my second is  to see my grandfather   savage your grandfather   sir paul harkye  he shall

that have done all this for sixty years  and yet to be called old p  they said i never was a father  but i shall soon prove the great and glorious fact   savage ay how will you prove it   sir paul how why you have all heard of my little nelly  poor girl she was jealous and she left me to marry a tradesman  a clerk at a lottery office and three months after we parted she was delivered of a boy  a fine boy as like me as one cupid is to another  a year after her marriage she died and i can hear nothing of her husband but let him say what he will i will swear the boy was mine i will swear it because i am convinced i am father to more children than one sir george   sir george very likely but where did you learn all this   sir paul from nellys sister a month ago i accidentally met her at tunbridge she had neither seen nor heard of the husband since her sisters death but she remembered the child went by his mothers name its mine  i am sure its mine and they laugh again i tell you what  you would better be careful for when you and other young sprigs of fashion smile at me jeer me and call me the infirm old p  gad you little think you dogs you are laughing at your own father perhaps

and when i rose to move my elbows another whipped the chair from under me a second put hot coals into my pocket so when i felt for my hankerchief i burnt my fingers a third tried to cut off my tail but that assassin i pursued when unluckily in running after him they had tied a string across the stairs and i pitched headforemost into a barrel of water they had placed for the purpose   clara indeed its quite terrible gaurdy   sir paul then they showed me a license brought me a fat parson and said if i would instantly be married they would let me go to find my son  if not i should be locked in and have plenty of it  now here is hospitality  but they have overshot the mark and if i get out of their doors i will not only break off the match but promise to befriend darnley    clara

whole town will be there  nay i shall attend  i would make you take more but as you will have to pay card money bye and bye it would be asking you to ones house absolutely to make a bargain of you clara gives the two guineas there  you may go   clara a bargain indeed and a bad one too for if i was mean enough to make money by my guests would i lay it out on foreigners who loll in carriages no  not while so many of our gallant soldiers and sailors have only wooden limbs to stand on half aside i am gone maam curtseying and now may darnley get out of the scrape  sir paul get out of the house

aside dont be uneasy my dear  these fashionable intrigues are very harmless i will assure you and if you had had my free and liberal education  but poor thing i suppose you were sent to school for instruction   mr darnley to school as certainly maam    lady sarah there it is then for what could you learn only to sing well enough to spoil conversation  to play on the harpsichord so as to give papa mama and the whole family an afternoons nap  to dance so aukwardly as to be always out of tune and place and to speak just french enough to make you forget english this is a boarding school education  but i my dear    mrs darnley hear me madam when i first saw you i was the happiest of women  i had a husband who loved and honored me  who doated on his children and knew no pleasure but in his family and now how severe is the reverse you have robbed me of that treasure seduced it from my heart and i return to a melancholy home without a friend for my own distresses or a father for my children   lady sarah and how can i help it  didnt i mean to do you both a service by introducing you to the great world   mrs darnley great world  there again madam  when i entered this house i expected from the exalted rank of its owner to have been surrounded with kindness elegance and hospitality  but i find that high birth does not create high breeding nor am i because humbly born less likely to set a polished example than yourself  oh darnley why will you not come forth and save your once loved wife from agonies too great to bear   enter mr savage savage so savage  here is a pretty story buzzed about  they say that darnley the country squire is locked up in your dressing room if this is true you jezabel    lady sarah scandalous brute  but i dont wonder at it you have had such a

we are ruined  yes ruined madam to mrs darnley you and your infamous husband will make your own plots and mar mine  so i will unkennel him   mrs darnley hold sir  indeed he is not to blame  he was

inventing me but here i am and if you have more property to distribute  if either of you has another two hundred pounds i will dispose of it so nearly that tears of joy shall trickle down your cheeks   flush after looking some time at sir paul sir paul   sir paul mr flush  we were joint guardians just now and    flush and now we are joint fathers it seems    sir paul this must be the tradesman  a word in private if you please sir they enter the marquee   gingham lay your heads together settle it as you please for while clara smiles on me i care not whether i am son to a haberdasher or heir to

mine the father knows his own child at last  i never suspected flush was clerk to a lottery office and consequently little thought he was the tradesman who married my nelly  gad i always took him for

speaking his mind but instead of checking him encourage him many a man only wants to be told of his errors to correct them and that is my case    gingham your case sir   sir paul yes my boy  since you talked of selfgratification bringing tears of pleasure into my eyes i resolved to try the experiment  i determined to retrench my expenses to sell my hounds dispose of my stud and see if i could not
